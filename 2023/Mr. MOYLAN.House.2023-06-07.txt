 Mr. Speaker, as Guam continues to recover from the wrath  of Super Typhoon Mawar, I want to take this time to thank the many  selfless heroes who worked and continue to work endless hours to ensure  that our community reaches normalcy, or at least some degree of it:   The crews from the Guam Power Authority and the Guam Waterworks  Authority continue to work till the wee hours of the morning to ensure  that power and water are restored in homes and businesses, as these  represent the first step toward normalcy;   The men and women from the Department of Public Works, along with the  Guam National Guard and even the Hawaii National Guard, who have and  continue to remove debris throughout the island;   Our hardworking men and women in healthcare, many of whom worked  bravely throughout the storm and who had to pull various roles,  inclusive of ensuring that the floors didn't get flooded in the rooms  of their patients, as the storm extended its stay in Guam;   Our brave men and women in public safety, who, just as many of our  healthcare workers, braved and worked throughout the storm and today  continue to ensure that the many dark streets and neighborhoods are  well patrolled from the ``sakis'';   Our Federal partners from FEMA, SBA, HHS, Army Corps of Engineers,  and the list goes on and on, many who got to the island prior to Mawar,  and those who came in after, who are fulfilling many roles, inclusive  of ensuring that the basic necessities, such as water, MREs,  generators, cots, tents, and so much more get to the community and, of  course, assisting the island residents in applying for the many Federal  benefit programs available;   The mayors and the vice mayors of our 19 municipalities and their  staffs, who I thank for their diligence, hard work, patience, and, most  especially, their heart in not only caring for their constituents but  also fighting for them;   Our brothers and sisters from the Commonwealth of the Northern  Marianas, including Governor Arnold Palacios, Lieutenant Governor David  Apatang, and Congressman Kilili Sablan, for opening your hearts and  helping the people of Guam. We are, indeed, One Mariana Islands Strong;    To our educators and the staff at Guam Agriculture, Port Authority of  Guam, Guam Airport Authority, Guam Customs and Quarantine Agency, Guam  Fire Department, the EMTs, and so many others in the public sector who  continue to strive to help with Guam's recovery; and   Our military partners, including Rear Admiral Benjamin Nicholson, and  our business partners, including various organizations, who were and  are all critical toward the path for recovery.   On behalf of a thankful nation and island community, and from the  sacred Halls of this House of Representatives, I thank the many who  worked prior, during, and after the storm to ensure that our people  were safe, prepared, and on the path toward recovery. Many left behind  their families, homes, and, in some cases, personal recovery to help  our community overcome this latest challenge. Their selfless efforts  and resiliency will never be forgotten.   God bless them. God bless Guam. God bless these United States of  America.                            ____________________
