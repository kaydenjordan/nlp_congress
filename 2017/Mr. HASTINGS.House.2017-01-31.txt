 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume,  and I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Washington, for yielding  me the customary 30 minutes for debate.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to debate the rule for consideration of a  joint resolution disapproving of a Department of the Interior  regulation known as the stream protection rule.   Through this action, my Republican colleagues are now attempting to  repeal a thoughtful and thoroughly vetted regulation that reflects  current science, technology, and mining practices in order to better  protect people and the environment from the negative impacts of  mountaintop removal mining. This regulation took 7 years to develop and  updates a 30-year-old coal mining regulation.   This regulation is not, as we have seen coming out of the  administration of late, some fly-by-night executive order, but rather a  serious attempt by serious people to make us a healthier and more  environmentally conscious nation.   However, what we see here today is business as usual for the  Republican majority--turning a blind eye to science in order to help  wealthy polluters at the expense of the public's health and the  environment. Just because my friends' unending attempts to normalize  such misguided governance have become almost numbing in their effect  does not make such attempts any less appalling to those of us who  believe in the scientific method and a clean and safe environment.   Indeed, the paucity of care that we see here today in ridding the  books of a regulation that hardworking and good people took 7 years to  write with, mind you, input from all stakeholders, is starting to look  like a variation of a theme when we consider the paucity of care the  Republicans in the White House have exhibited over the past 10 days.   As everyone knows, last Friday, President Trump issued an executive  order banning Muslims from certain countries from entering the United  States and callously shutting down the refugee program. What ensued,  and I predict will continue to ensue as we speak here today, was  nothing short of chaos. Scores and scores of people were detained for  hours, including green card holders, children, the elderly, and even  Iraqi translators who had helped the United States during the  insurgency.   Equally as horrifying as this Muslim ban that is the antithesis of  everything we value as Americans is the ineptitude in which such a  sweeping policy was implemented. Relevant agencies were not even  consulted. In fact, Homeland Security Secretary Kelly, found out about  the executive order on the phone while on a Coast Guard plane heading  back to Washington. Secretary Mattis was also left off the list of  those consulted. Had he been on it, he would have almost certainly  expressed the sentiment he expressed during the campaign, mainly that  the Muslim ban would cause great damage and send shock waves through  the international community.   Like Ms. Eshoo, who spoke earlier, I am a veteran of the Intelligence  Committee as well. We serve there together. I can assure you our  experience leads us to know--and anyone that is on the Intelligence  Committee knows now--that what we are about to experience is a handout  to our enemies and will cause additional shock waves in the  international community.   The result of this amateur hour rollout was a Customs and Border  Patrol agency that wasn't sure how to even execute the order. From  management on down, no one knew what was going on while scores of  people were riddled with fear that their realization of a free and fair  life here in the United States was lost forever. People with visas and  green cards were held for hours. Will someone please tell me what it  means to issue a visa to persons if they cannot utilize the visa?   People were denied access to a lawyer even after a Federal Court  order stayed the executive action.   Here is a small sampling of the immediate impact of this Muslim ban:  A 5-year-old boy, a U.S. citizen, was detained for several hours. 5  years old--a truer threat to our national security we have never faced.  An 88-year-old man and his 83-year-old wife, both wheelchair bound and  both possessing green cards, were detained for hours. He is legally  blind, and she recently suffered a stroke--detained for hours.   A Ph.D. student at Stony Brook University, who has lived in the  United States for 12 years, was detained for more than 24 hours. The  mother of an Active Duty United States servicemember was detained for  more than 30 hours.   Tell me, what danger do these people pose? What security objective is  achieved by detaining them?   I argue none.   I have to agree with Senator Rob Portman when he said what was so  plainly obvious to see: ``This was an extreme vetting program that  wasn't properly vetted.''   As thousands arrived at airports across the country to protest the  President's executive order and hundreds of lawyers showed up to  volunteer their time to write habeas petitions for those so clearly  wrongfully detained, President Trump, living in a world all his own,  tweeted the following: ``All is going well with very few problems.''   All is not going well, Mr. President, and there are many problems.   Then he defended the hastily implemented order saying that: ``If the  ban were announced with a one week notice, the `bad' would rush into  our country during that week. A lot of bad `dudes' out there!''   This is a stunningly ignorant and offensive statement that reveals to  the entire world a person with no grasp of even what the refugee  program is or how the visa process works.   Immediately preceding this tweet, the President advised everyone to:  ``Study the world!''   I encourage him to take his own advice.   Beyond the human toll this foolish and callous policy has inflicted  on scores of innocent people, the executive order actually undermines  our efforts to defeat terrorism--jeopardizing the very safety the order  purports to provide. The chairman of the Senate Armed Services  Committee, headed by John McCain, along with Senator Lindsey Graham,  underscored this irony, and I quote their joint statement: ``We fear  this executive order  [[Page H763]]  will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism,''  noting further that President Trump's executive order ``may do more to  help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.''    So I find it interesting now that the majority of my Republican  colleagues in the House, even the ones that voiced opposition to a  Muslim ban during the campaign when then-President-elect Trump first  proposed it, including our Speaker of the House, are now deafeningly  silent.   Instead, Republicans are using their time today not to respond to  this chaos-inducing executive order that so clearly violates core  American values, but rather to repeal a rule that was actually properly  vetted--vetted for 7 years, using the best science and technology  available, and following input from the public and leaders in the  industry. I caution my friends, the events of today and how you respond  to them will be written in the history books tomorrow.   A question emerges from the fog that is the Trump administration's  full frontal attack on our Constitution: What is more important,  appeasing a man who is just as likely to tweet insults at you as he is  to rush out ill-conceived and horrid executive orders, or protecting  our Constitution and the ideals of this great Nation?   The ideals and dedication to the rule of law that have inspired the  poor, the tired, and the huddled masses to seek a better and freer life  here in the United States. It didn't begin with Muslims. It began with  the Founders of this country, and it was followed by countless others,  from Irish, Italians, Polish, Hungarians, Vietnamese, and Chinese, all  over this world coming to this country to seek the kind of life that  many of our ancestors sought over the course of time and some of our  ancestors had no choice but to undertake.   The time to act in the name of short-term political expediency is  over. It is time to stand up and do what is right. It is time to  protect our Constitution. It is time to defend the idea that we can  indeed form a more perfect Union. But we cannot do that with the kind  of division that is being sold by this administration, and we cannot do  that by spending what appears to be the month of February disapproving  executive orders that the previous President issued. It seems to me  somehow or another in that fog is going to be the kind of confusion and  chaos that we just witnessed this weekend.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, both of my colleagues on the other side referred to the  rule they seek to disapprove as a midnight rule. Well, I don't know how  you take 7 years of midnights that it took to develop this rule and  call it a midnight rule--7 years.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), my very good friend and ranking member of the  Committee on Energy and Commerce.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, President Trump's xenophobic executive order banning  Syrian refugees and suspending emigration from certain countries is  driven by fear. It demonstrates a callous indifference to human  suffering; it ignores the Constitution; and it will not only tarnish  our image abroad, but harm our national security. If we defeat the  previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule to bring up my  good friend Representative Lofgren's bill to overturn and defund this  dangerous executive order.   Let me be abundantly clear for people watching this debate. The  question we are about to decide is: Should we even have a vote on  undoing Trump's order? A ``no'' vote on the previous question will give  us the opportunity to overturn this order. A ``yes'' vote means that  the House will do nothing to stop Trump's executive action.   The American people watching this debate should take notice to see  how their Representatives vote on this important motion, and they  should hold their elected officials accountable. Did your Member of  Congress turn a blind eye to Trump's unconstitutional policy by voting  ``yes,'' or did your Representative reject this attack on our core  American values and vote ``no?''   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Florida?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren), my good friend, to discuss  this proposal.    Mr. Speaker, would the Chair be so kind as to tell me  how much time remains on both sides?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida has 9\1/2\  minutes remaining. The gentleman from Washington has 11\1/2\ minutes  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, at this time I am very pleased to yield to  the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished  minority leader, for the purpose of a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren) for a unanimous consent  request.    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren) for a unanimous consent  request.    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 5 seconds to  the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 seconds to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Maxine Waters) for debate.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I am referring to H.R.  724, which would rescind President Trump's refugee ban so that green  card holders like Bessar Yousif, a refugee from Iraq on his way home  after getting engaged in Kurdistan, won't get detained in LAX.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman's time has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 seconds to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 seconds to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 seconds to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Cardenas).    Now we are back to unanimous consent. Mr. Speaker, I  yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Brownley) for a unanimous  consent request.    Yes, she did.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair understands that the gentleman  from Washington has not yielded for that purpose. Therefore, the  unanimous consent request cannot be entertained.                            Parliamentary Inquiry     Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary  inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary  inquiry.    Am I not permitted to yield a limited amount of time to  Members for debate?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman said he was yielding to the  gentlewoman from California for the purpose of a unanimous consent  request.    In that instance I did. My question and my  parliamentary inquiry continuing, Mr. Speaker, is am I permitted to  yield a limited amount of time to each Member for the purpose of  debate?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman may yield to Members for  debate.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 seconds to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Nadler).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 seconds to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Napolitano).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 seconds to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Velazquez).

Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 seconds to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 seconds to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Carbajal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 seconds to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished minority whip and my good  friend.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 seconds to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Schneider).    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 5 seconds to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Schneider).    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida has 8\1/4\  minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 10 seconds to  the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Serrano).    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 10 seconds to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Espaillat).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 seconds to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 seconds to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee).  [[Page H767]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 seconds to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Matsui).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 seconds to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Beyer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 seconds to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Beyer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 seconds to the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 seconds to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Barragan).    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 10 seconds to  the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Demings), my home girl, for a  unanimous consent request.

Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North  Carolina (Ms. Adams) for a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the Northern  Mariana Islands (Mr. Sablan) for a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Judy Chu) for a unanimous consent request.   Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to  bring up H.R. 724, which would rescind President Trump's refugee ban on  families like the Syrian refugee family of six who were scheduled to  arrive in Cleveland on Tuesday, January 31, but are now blocked  indefinitely.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Clarke) for a unanimous consent request.   Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring  up H.R. 724, which would rescind Donald Trump's refugee ban and help  unify the family of Farah Usa, a refugee who risked her life for United  States forces in Iraq and whose father, mother, and sister are now  barred from entering the United States of America.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York  (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney) for a unanimous consent request.   Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent to bring up H.R. 724, which would rescind the President's  refugee ban that impacts green card holders like the woman located in  Iran with her 3-year-old U.S. citizen daughter.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 seconds to the distinguished  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).   Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 724 would repeal Trump's overreaching  executive order that purports to make America safer. It is time to  restore American values. What are the Republicans afraid of? If you  support his action, bring up the bill and vote against it. If you don't  support his action, we are giving you an opportunity to restore the  lawful rights of Congress representing the American people.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 10 seconds to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, because our Nation has always welcomed  refugees and the poor and those who are in need, I don't know why we  don't bring up H.R. 724, which would rescind President Trump's refugee  ban on students like the Iranian-born anthropology student who left the  U.S. to carry out research and is now likely to be unable to return to  defend his thesis. If you do not believe in the ban, bring it up so we  can vote against this ban.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.

Mr. Speaker, I ask my Republican friends to bring up  H.R. 724, which would rescind President Trump's appalling and  discriminatory refugee ban on women like Samira Asgari, a scientist  from Iran who was set to begin a project to study tuberculosis at  Harvard Medical School, and was stopped from boarding her flight to the  United States. Let us have a vote, let us have a little democracy, in  the people's House.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New  Hampshire (Ms. Shea-Porter) for a unanimous consent request.   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up  H.R. 724, which would rescind President Trump's refugee ban on  individuals like the Syrian skin cancer researcher living in Germany  whose visa to visit colleagues in Philadelphia has now been revoked.  Let us vote.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle) for a unanimous consent request.   Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, you probably won't  be surprised to learn that I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  724, which would rescind President Trump's appalling refugee ban on  individuals like the young scientist in Iran who was awarded a  fellowship to study cardiovascular medicine at Harvard, but whose visa  has now been indefinitely suspended.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.

Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas) for a unanimous consent request.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro) for a unanimous consent request.   Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  724, which would rescind President Trump's refugee ban on women like  Shadi Heidarifar, a philosophy student at the University of Tehran who  was accepted to New York University, but is now unsure if she will be  able to attend.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.                                time  1345                            Parliamentary Inquiry     Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary  inquiry.    Mr. Speaker, with the Members who have come here and  asked for unanimous consent and with its being denied by virtue of the  gentleman from Washington's not agreeing to the unanimous consent and  with the notion in mind that the period for debate is what is to be  recognized, my  [[Page H769]]  question is: Do the people who did come here and seek unanimous  consent--although it was not accepted--have the opportunity to insert a  statement in the Record that signifies their intentions with reference  to the matter at hand?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members may insert remarks under general  leave.    Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on both sides?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida has 5 minutes and  55 seconds remaining. The gentleman from Washington has 11\1/2\ minutes  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I inform the gentleman from Washington  that I have no further requests for time and I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I inform the gentleman from Washington  that I have no further requests for time and I am prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The majority leader just got through saying all of the things they  are getting ready to do to drain the swamp. My feeling about what is  happening--and I am speaking for myself--is they may very well drain  the swamp, but if you take out the alligators and you put in crocodiles  and you put in snakes, you have just made the swamp that much more  dangerous to the American people.   Mr. Speaker, the cavalier nature by which my friends across the aisle  approach the awesome responsibility of governing is as disturbing as it  is disappointing. They all own this now. They are in charge. Although I  may understand the emotive desire to turn things on their head, they  all would be wise to come to the realization sooner rather than later  that their actions affect real people. All they have to do is just see  what transpired this past weekend.    The children, the elderly, the students who are waiting in airports  across our country who are wishing to flee their oppressors or who are  simply returning to their lives here at home are real people. They  heard them being identified in the denied unanimous consent requests of  my colleagues who came forward here. The children, the elderly, and all  of the other folks who have to live in environments that are less clean  and that are more likely to make them sick because of their flippant  approach here today are real people. To be taken seriously, they must  act seriously. Within that context, I would have to surmise that they  all would be judged and found wanting.   To truly convey the devastating consequences of what has happened  these past few days, I could quote from one of the Founding Fathers  about the ideal of freedom from religious persecution; or I could  recite for them the inscription on the Statue of Liberty, which has  guided and inspired generations of immigrants and refugees as they have  come here to seek better lives for themselves and their families; or I  could quote from Luke 10:25 wherein Jesus tells the parable of the Good  Samaritan. I will not.   Instead, I will leave them with the words of Dr. Amir Heydari, a  bariatric surgeon and United States citizen who has lived in the United  States for nearly 40 years and who was detained for questioning this  past weekend:   ``I wanted to live somewhere that celebrated freedom--freedom of  speech, freedom of religion, all of these kinds of things. That's what  everyone in the world thinks about the USA, and unfortunately, when  these types of actions are taken, the image is not the same anymore.''   I urge my colleagues to oppose this rule and the underlying measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this question will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.
