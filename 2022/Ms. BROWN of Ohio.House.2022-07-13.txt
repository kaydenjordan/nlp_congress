 Madam Speaker, while the decision to overturn Roe  v. Wade has impacted millions of Americans, we must also acknowledge  its economic and racial implications.   We live in a country plagued by generations of healthcare inequities  and racial disparities. Black, Latino, indigenous, and other  communities of color already face healthcare barriers and will only  continue to suffer in the aftermath of a post-Roe America.   State trigger bills that restrict or ban more than half of a country  from reproductive healthcare access have already stripped millions of  their fundamental right to decide their reproductive care. But our  fight continues.   I implore my colleagues in Congress to unite to pass legislation to  protect every American's constitutional right to travel freely and  voluntarily throughout the United States, including for reproductive  healthcare.                            ____________________
