 Mr. Speaker, last week, U.S. District Judge Kathryn  Mizelle voided President Biden and the CDC's overbearing and  unnecessary mask mandate for airplanes and public transportation.   After the announcement, I saw many videos online of many flyers and  flight attendants joyously ripping off their masks to celebrate. I had  urged, along  [[Page H4463]]  with many other colleagues in a couple of different letters to the  President, to allow the mask mandate to expire a few months ago. So  finally, I was relieved and pleased to hear of this announcement by the  judge.   Our celebration was short-lived, however, as the Biden administration  soon announced they would sue to try to repeal the judge's ruling and  force back in place mask mandates for people traveling.   Science has repeatedly found that the masks are not nearly as  effective at preventing the spread of COVID as they previously had  thought. It really boils down to that government likes controlling  people with this. They like scaring them. They like putting them in a  box and saying, If you don't do this, you might die.   People, if they are forced into having mask mandates on public  transportation once again, there is going to be a lot of anger coming  out that no midterms or nothing else will save if they force this onto  us.                            ____________________
