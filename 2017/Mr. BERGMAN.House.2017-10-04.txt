 Mr. Chairman, it has been an honor to work with the  chairman of the Budget Committee as a new Member of Congress because it  is such a learning curve to understand the challenges that we have in  our country in so many ways, but especially on the fiscal side of  things.   I would like to spend my time talking to my grandchildren right now.  I am talking to your grandchildren as well.   In the last 48 hours, I have had an opportunity--it was more of a  responsibility--to chat with my grandchildren about the horrific events  that occurred in Las Vegas. When you are 8 or 16, you assimilate those  things in different ways. I talk to them a lot about responsibility for  behavior, responsibility for money, and responsibility for their own  lifestyles.   I talked to them today to say that we are not going to put you into  the debt hole caused by the spending that has occurred over the last  decades in this country. We are not going to pass that along to you,  because the hole is only getting deeper and more extensive, and we are  passing it along to those next generations. Not only is it not right,  it is morally wrong and absolutely irresponsible.   We have to ask ourselves the questions: If not now, then when do we  begin to bend the spending curve? If we don't do it, then who will?   We know that mandatory spending within our grandchildren's lifetime  will eclipse almost, if not, 100 percent of the Federal budget. That  means no money for research, for medical, for education, and for all of  those discretionary dollars that are so wisely spent.   We have to begin to bend the spending curve now, and that means cuts  in mandatory spending, while responsibly using the other dollars, the  discretionary dollars, to advance good programs.                                time  1530    That takes discipline, that takes effort, that takes making tough  decisions that are unpopular but necessary for the future of our  country.   Our Budget Committee wrestled long and hard to present what you are  going to vote on, and I am proud of the fact that with the discourse  and debate that we had over tough issues, in the end, the American  people are taking a next first step forward towards fiscal  responsibility that reflects the reality that we owe to our  grandchildren, just like our parents and grandparents felt that they  needed to do for us during the Great Depression and a couple of World  Wars to make sure that we have a physically viable country. This budget  is a next first step.
