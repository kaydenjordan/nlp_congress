 Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the German- American Caucus, I rise today to recognize October as German-American  Heritage Month and to commemorate 30 years of German unity.   Last year, I introduced H. Res. 446, a bipartisan resolution to  recognize the importance of the alliance between the United States and  Germany and to highlight our shared commitment to democracy.   The resolution reaffirms our support of the Wunderbar Together  initiative, which, in 2019, worked with 500 partners to host more than  2,800 events to celebrate German-American culture, art, science, and  more.   On October 3, 1990, East and West Germany reunited, just short of 1  year after the fall of the Berlin Wall, when thousands rushed to  Brandenburg Gate to celebrate.   This year, the German Ambassador to the United States, Emily Haber,  is hosting a virtual event to celebrate East and West Germany becoming  one, walking attendees through the milestones that led to this historic  moment. Anyone can tune in by visiting the Embassy's Facebook page  tomorrow at 1 p.m.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to say danke, or thank you, to our German  friends, and prost, or cheers, as we celebrate this milestone together.                            ____________________
