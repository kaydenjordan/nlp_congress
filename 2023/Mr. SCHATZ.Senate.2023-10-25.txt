 Mr. President, just to point out, this amendment only  applies to surface transportation, Amtrak and passenger rail in  particular. I think it is counterproductive. I understand the point  that the Senator from Ohio is making. But the problem right now--look,  I don't think President Biden or the head of Amtrak or Secretary  Buttigieg or anyone else is, at all, planning to implement any kind of  mask mandate in the foreseeable future.   But he said something that I agree with, which is that COVID is going  to be with us for the foreseeable future and there will be new  variants. And if it looks the same, it looks same. But if  [[Page S5164]]  it is, say, 10 times as virulent, 100 times as deadly and airborne,  then I do think public health officials should be able to consult with  Agencies to try to figure out what measures ought to work.   And for those reasons, I oppose this amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1210
