 Mr. Speaker, we came together this morning to read the  United States Constitution and its 27 amendments. I offer a 28th  amendment, an amendment to overturn the Supreme Court's disastrous  decision in Citizens United:   Section 1. To advance democratic self-government and political  equality, and to protect the integrity of government and the electoral  process, Congress and the States may regulate and set reasonable limits  on the raising and spending of money by candidates and others to  influence elections.   Section 2. Congress and the States shall have power to implement and  enforce this article by appropriate legislation, and may distinguish  between natural persons and corporations or other artificial entities  created by law, including by prohibiting such entities from spending  money to influence our elections.   Section 3. Nothing in this article shall be construed to grant  Congress or the States the power to abridge freedom of the press.   Mr. Speaker, Citizens United let unlimited money flood into our  elections and compromise our democracy. I ask all of my colleagues in  this 115th Congress to join our effort to overturn it.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, in April of last year, 394 Members of this  House sent a letter to the President urging him to oppose and veto if  necessary any one-sided United Nations resolutions. Unfortunately, the  resolution that passed the Security Council resolution without our veto  was exactly that. It was one-sided.   The resolution contained no fewer than five provisions on Israeli  settlement activity. It calls the Jewish neighborhoods of Jerusalem  illegal, and it characterizes Jews praying at the Western Wall as being  in flagrant violation of international law.   But even if you choose to accept every provision on settlement  activity, the resolution included only one very general statement about  violence. The U.N., which is historically biased against Israel, could  not even condemn Palestinian terrorism against Israel as an obstacle to  peace. It is, and the U.N. must acknowledge it. That is not balanced.  It is one-sided.   Today's resolution clearly supports the goal of two states: a Jewish  democratic State of Israel living next to a demilitarized Palestinian  state as it stands against one-sided U.N. resolutions to take us  further than this goal. Please support this resolution.   Mr. ROYCE of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the  balance of my time.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we are all friends of Israel, but that friendship  requires more than demonizing the United Nations and the Obama  administration. In fact, it requires the facing of hard truths, the  destructive effect of incitement and violence on the Palestinian side,  which the U.N. resolution explicitly acknowledges, and the threat to  peace and to any conceivable two-state solution by relentless  settlement expansion on the Israeli side, pushed by the right wing,  unchallenged by H. Res. 11.   The majority, seeking to push this resolution through, has displayed  little interest in what it would take actually to achieve peace,  choosing instead to distort the history, to impugn the motives of those  attempting to achieve peace. It is not worthy of this body. I urge its  rejection.   I yield back the balance of my time.
