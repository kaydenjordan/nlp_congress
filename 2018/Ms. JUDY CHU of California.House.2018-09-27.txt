 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the American Innovation Act.   But before I talk about the underlying bill, I want to make clear  that this bill is part of the Republicans' larger tax scam 2.0. Instead  of increasing opportunity or addressing the income inequality for  Americans, the Republicans are doubling down on their failed policies  that benefit the wealthiest Americans and are ultimately paid for by  the middle class.   As a result of the Republicans' tax law, health insurance companies  in  [[Page H9115]]  State after State are announcing higher premiums for next year, while  health coverage for those living with preexisting conditions is on the  chopping block. To make matters worse, the Medicare trustees cut 3  years off the life of the Medicare trust fund because of the Republican  tax bill.   But instead of backing away from their mistake, the Republicans are  doubling down. Their second round of tax cuts for the wealthy will  further compromise the future of Medicare and Social Security,  depriving seniors the benefits they have earned.   Not to mention, Republicans are cutting taxes for the rich for the  second time in less than a year. By simply making permanent the cut to  the top individual tax rate, Republicans are providing a huge tax cut  for just a fraction of the top 5 percent of taxpayers.   At the same time, the Republicans have doubled down on their attack  on the middle class by making permanent the limits to the State and  local tax deduction. In fact, in my home district in California, 37  percent of tax filers claimed the SALT deduction in 2016, and the  average SALT deduction was $18,517 according to IRS data. This is  nearly double the cap that Republicans have put in place, and that  means that middle class families in my district are footing the bill  for the wealthy's permanent tax cuts.   In addition, Republicans are also permanently limiting the mortgage  interest deduction and casualty loss deduction.   Furthermore, the so-called party of fiscal conservatism will be  passing over $3 trillion in tax breaks in less than a year. Because of  the Republican tax law and President Trump's irresponsible policies,  the U.S. Treasury is now borrowing money at a rate of $5.4 billion per  day.   This package, like the one before it, is being rushed through with no  hearings and no input from stakeholders. A rushed and lopsided process  resulted in tax bill 1.0, and, in fact, Democrats have identified over  100 problems with the Republicans' tax law.   Republicans are doubling down on their flawed policies with this  exercise, with bills guaranteed to be dead on arrival in the Senate.  Tax scam 2.0 is another reckless tax cut for the wealthy that leaves  behind average, hardworking families.    Now I would like to discuss H.R. 6756, the American Innovation Act.   This bill has never received consideration in a public committee  hearing. Last year, the Republicans' rushed process created the end  result of a disastrous tax law that is riddled with problems. Yet  rather than learn from their mistake, the Republicans are, once again,  moving forward with legislation without the appropriate oversight.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly believe in American innovation and  entrepreneurship. As the only member of both the House Small Business  Committee and the Ways and Means Committee, I know just how critical  small businesses are to the growth of our economy. They create two out  of every three new jobs and allow people to be their own bosses.   I know that my Democratic colleagues and I would have  enthusiastically and actively participated in the construction of  bipartisan legislation to help small businesses deduct more of their  startup costs. This is something I care deeply about because access to  capital is one of the biggest challenges facing our entrepreneurs  today. However, Democrats were shut out of the process once again as  the bill was rushed to the floor.   With only a few days left for Congress to be in session, the  Republicans have yet to address rising healthcare costs and how to pay  for innovation and value in our healthcare system.                                time  1415    They have done nothing to stop the haphazard and reckless trade  policy coming out of the White House.   And this week, the Republicans are driving these so-called tax reform  2.0 bills down a road to nowhere. If they were serious about helping  small businesses and innovative startups, they surely would have not  treated these provisions like an afterthought to their 2017 tax bill.   Therefore, I oppose H.R. 6756 and encourage my colleagues to do the  same. We should work together to ensure that small businesses and  innovative startups have the tools to not just survive, but actually  thrive in the economy. We can do better in a fiscally responsible  manner that does not recklessly add to the deficit.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, first, I would like to clarify something. I appreciate  the comment from Chairman Buchanan regarding Mr. Thompson's amendment,  but that does not change the fact that, during tax bill 2.0 and its  markup, every Republican present voted against permanent natural  disaster relief on H.R. 6760.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats are strong believers in the power of American  innovation and entrepreneurship. Democrats support small businesses,  which are the backbone of our economy and create two out of every three  new jobs. My Democratic colleagues and I would have loved to  participate in the drafting of bipartisan legislation to help small  businesses and innovative startups succeed, but that is not the process  that the majority adopted.   This bill, just like tax scam 1.0, has never received the scrutiny it  deserves in a public committee hearing. A rushed and lopsided process  resulted in the disastrous tax law. Yet, rather than learn from their  mistakes, Republicans are once again rushing through legislation  without the appropriate oversight.   This process should tell you how serious the majority is about  helping small businesses, which is not very. If the Republicans were  serious about helping small businesses last year, they surely would not  have enacted their so-called small business tax benefit to disguise a  massive tax cut for millionaires.   If Republicans were serious about helping small businesses and  innovative startups today, they surely would not have treated these  provisions like an afterthought, guaranteed to be dead on arrival in  the Senate.   Mr. Speaker, I believe we should work together to ensure that small  businesses, ranging from mom-and-pop shops to cutting-edge startups,  have the tools they need to thrive in this economy. But we should do it  the right way, with hearings and input from stakeholders, and in a  fiscally responsible manner, not by saddling future Americans with more  debt.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong  opposition to H.R. 6757, the Family Savings Act. It is outrageous that,  after our markup, a provision was snuck into the bill, behind closed  doors, through a manager's amendment that seeks to further an extreme  anti-choice agenda and has no place in this tax bill.   Chairman Brady's manager's amendment, offered behind closed doors in  the Rules Committee, has added language that would allow parents to  open 529 college savings accounts for unborn children. The term  ``unborn children'' is defined as a child ``in utero'' at any stage of  development carried in the womb. This provision is completely  unnecessary because, under current law, parents are already able to  open 529 savings plans for future children in their own name, and then  change the name of the beneficiary after the birth of their child.   The implications of this insertion, however, is serious. In the  landmark Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade, the Court declared that  ``the word person, as used in the 14th Amendment, does not include the  unborn.''   So let me say, there is no ambiguity here. This is a thinly-veiled  attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court's decision by inserting the  words ``unborn child'' in, of all places, the Tax Code, so that  codifies in law a legal concept of the unborn child, therefore,  establishing the fetus is protected separately from the mother.                                time  1515    This is the same language that anti-choice advocates tried to insert  into the GOP tax scam bill 1.0, but where the language was ultimately  stripped out.   At that time, a spokesperson for the anti-choice March for Life group  stated that H.R. 1, the GOP tax scam bill, ``. . . we hope that this is  the first step in expanding the child tax credit to include unborn  children as well.''   This language is, therefore, obviously, an attempt to lay the legal  groundwork to undermine a woman's constitutional right to an abortion,  plain and simple. Based on this language alone, women's groups NARAL  and Planned Parenthood are opposing this bill.   This is nothing more than a political gimmick conducted in secret in  order to score political points for Republicans trying to placate their  extreme base.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to reject this bill and  vote ``no''.
