 Mr. President, it is that time of year where I am privileged  to recognize exceptional young men and women from the great State of  Utah who have answered the call to serve by applying to the U.S. Air  Force Academy, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, the U.S. Military  Academy, and the U.S. Naval Academy. It is one of my greatest honors to  recognize these fine Utahns in the U.S. Senate.   Under title 10 of the U.S. Code, each year, Members of Congress are  authorized to nominate a number of young men and women from their  district or State to attend the country's service academies. Each of  these students is of sound mind and body. This will serve them well in  Colorado Springs, Kings Point, West Point, and Annapolis, but to  succeed, they will need more than this.   The journey on which these young men and women will soon embark  requires more than mental and physical aptitude. It also demands strong  moral character: leadership, courage, honesty, prudence, and self- discipline. It calls for a commitment to service and a love of country.  Ultimately, it provides a chance for some of Utah's finest to stand up  for our country.   Today, I would like to congratulate each of these impressive  students, all of whom embody, in their own unique way, the standards of  excellence upon which America's service academies are built.
