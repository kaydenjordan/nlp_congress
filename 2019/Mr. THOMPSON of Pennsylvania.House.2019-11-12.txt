 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  and honor our Nation's veterans, the men and women who have made the  decision to commit their lives to service and to defend our great  Nation, among America's most courageous.   This past July, I had the honor and privilege of traveling to Fort  Drum, New York, to attend the final reenlistment and promotion of my  son, Logan, to sergeant first class of the United States Army. My wife,  Penny, and I could not be more proud.   There are more than 20 million veterans living in the United States  today, and, as elected officials, we have the opportunity and  responsibility to equip them to succeed while they are defending our  Nation and to ease their burdens when they return to civilian life.   Our men and women in uniform have committed their lives to protecting  this great Nation, and we are forever indebted to them for their  service and their sacrifice.                            ____________________
