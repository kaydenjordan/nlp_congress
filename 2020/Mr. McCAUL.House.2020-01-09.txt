 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in opposition to H. Con. Res. 83.   When President Obama took down Osama Bin Laden, the Republican  Members joined with Democrats, as Americans, to praise the President.  Unfortunately, today, Democrats are incapable of giving this President  credit where credit is due, which only emboldens Iran.   I am surprised to be faced with this partisan resolution today. We  should be standing together, as the chairman mentioned, as a Nation.  Instead, this resolution plays politics with national security.   Yesterday, the President laid out a measured response to Iran's  ballistic missile attacks. Let me be clear. The President is not  seeking war with Iran. The President has shown, if anything,  [[Page H94]]  great restraint regarding Iran, including after Iran's downing of a  U.S. drone, a U.S. military asset.   But in their blind contempt for the President, my colleagues are  ignoring the assessments of career intelligence and military  professionals.                                time  1445    Our colleagues on the other side are downplaying the murderous evil  of Soleimani, the mastermind of terror in the Middle East for over two  decades.   Soleimani was designated as a terrorist by the Obama administration.  He was responsible for the deaths of more than 600 Americans and  wounded thousands more.   Soleimani was involved in the Iranian plot to assassinate the Saudi  Ambassador to the United States on American soil in Georgetown, right  in this city. Soleimani oversaw Iran's support for Assad in Syria,  including convincing Russia to fight for Assad, killing hundreds of  thousands. This year, Soleimani played a key role in the crackdown on  protestors in Iraq that killed hundreds of Iraqis.   It should be clear to any reasonable person that Soleimani posed a  long-term threat to the United States and to innocent civilians in the  Middle East and across the globe. We don't need to get into classified  details to see Soleimani's clear threat.   According to the Department of Defense, in the last 2 months,  Soleimani and his proxies launched 12 attacks against U.S. forces and  facilities in Iraq. On December 27, Soleimani's Iranian proxies killed  an American and injured four U.S. servicemembers near Kirkuk. On  December 31, Soleimani's Iranian proxies launched an assault on the  United States Embassy in Baghdad.   But Soleimani was not done. Secretary Pompeo said that Soleimani was  ``actively plotting'' to take ``big action'' that would ``put dozens if  not hundreds of American lives at risk,'' which DOD said targeted  American diplomats and servicemembers in Iraq and throughout the  region.   The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Milley, said that the  administration would have been ``culpably negligent,'' given the  evidence and intelligence they had, had they not acted.   The President possessed the legal authority for this strike and  complied with his obligation to report it to Congress within 48 hours  under the War Powers Resolution. The President has inherent Article II  authority as Commander in Chief to defend United States personnel from  attacks that Soleimani was carrying out and plotting against Americans.  It is an act of self-defense.   This is not just a partisan analysis. Jeh Johnson, President Obama's  general counsel at the Department of Defense and former Secretary of  Homeland Security, approved the airstrikes during the Obama  administration. He stated that Soleimani ``was a lawful military  objective, and the President, under his constitutional authority as  Commander in Chief, had ample domestic legal authority to take him out  without an additional congressional authorization.'' That was President  Obama's Secretary of Homeland Security.   As a second authority, the National Security Adviser cited the 2002  AUMF that authorized the use of force ``to defend the national security  of the United States against the continuing threat posed by Iraq.''  That authorization has been used previously to address terrorist  threats to U.S. personnel inside Iraq, including by President Obama to  go after ISIS terrorist forces in Iraq.   The dangerously partisan reactions to last week's strike in defense  of Americans are even more apparent when compared to Democratic  reactions to Obama's thousands of unauthorized airstrikes in defense of  Libyans inside Libya in 2011.   Back in June 2011, then-Leader Pelosi was asked about the Obama  administration's months of airstrikes inside Libya, dropping hundreds  of millions of dollars in U.S. munitions without congressional  authorization. Leader Pelosi was asked: ``Madam Leader, you are saying  that the President did not need authorization initially and still does  not need any authorization from Congress on Libya?'' Her answer was,  ``Yes.''   She said: ``I believe the limited nature of this engagement allows  the President to go forward. . . . I am satisfied that the President  has the authority he needs to go ahead.''   That logic should apply far more in the strike against Soleimani to  protect Americans.   I am pleased the administration did not hesitate to take bold action,  given the high threat level. Soleimani showed us through the embassy  attack and the attacks on U.S. forces that he was serious about hurting  Americans.   Our intelligence community saw his next plan coming together, and our  military, under direction from our Commander in Chief, acted. They saw  the storm coming, and they stopped it.   I thank the President and the men and women of our intelligence  community and the military for upholding their responsibility to  protect American lives. Instead of supporting the President,  unfortunately, my Democratic colleagues are dividing Americans at a  critical time, weakening our leverage overseas and emboldening our  enemy, the largest state sponsor of terror in the world.   I ask my colleagues to oppose this resolution, which seeks to tie the  President's hands as he continues to defend Americans in the Middle  East.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for the leader, and I  do not disagree with him that the President needs to come to Congress  to authorize war with Iran, but that is not what we are looking at here  today.   We do not currently have troops engaged in hostility in Iran subject  to withdrawal under the War Powers Resolution. However, if the  administration were to strike Iran directly, in my opinion, they would  need to submit a war powers notification, and they would need to  proceed with an authorized use of military force.

Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Baird).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I am strongly in favor of exercising our Article I  authorities for matters as grave as war and peace, but the fact is, we  are not at war with Iran. The President is not trying to start a war  with Iran.   I met with the President earlier today. He told me that if this  resolution passes, it will take all of his power to negotiate with Iran  off the table. That is the worst thing that we could do.    Yesterday, he called for making a deal that allows for Iran to thrive  and prosper. The President is making the choice to move toward  deescalation.   The premise of this resolution is flawed because we are not engaged  in hostilities with Iran. The President is not trying to start  hostilities with Iran. Despite this public proclamation by our  President, my colleagues are trying to claim that the President still  wants to go to war.   I deeply regret that my colleagues are not serious enough about  exercising our Article I authorities to pursue regular order on such a  serious question. We have had no hearings in the House Foreign Affairs  Committee since these events transpired. There was no Foreign Affairs  Committee markup of this legislation.   I received the text of this legislation only 2 hours before the Rules  Committee meeting last night on a War Powers Resolution. Debating  issues of war and peace is perhaps our most important responsibility as  Members of Congress, and, yet, this legislation dropped last night  without committee consideration as required by the War Powers  Resolution.                                time  1730    If my colleagues were as serious about Article I as they say they  are, then this would be a joint resolution with the force of law.  Instead, it is a House concurrent resolution that will never go to the  President's desk. Let me translate what that means to the American  people listening today.   Today, we are voting on a press release, a press statement. This is a  political statement for a leftwing domestic audience. But they are not  the only ones watching, Mr. Speaker.   Iran is watching, and its proxies are watching. What they see is a  divided America that does not fully support the ability of our  Commander in Chief to respond to imminent threats to Americans.   Churchill warned against appeasement when the dark clouds of fascism  and the Third Reich swept in, in my father's war. Weakness invites  aggression, he said. President Reagan said: ``Peace through strength.''  I believe in these ideals and these axioms.   Last May, it was reported that Soleimani met with Iraqi militias in  Baghdad and told them to ``prepare for proxy war.''   Without last week's strike, Soleimani would still be waging that  proxy war, a war that he was escalating. An American was killed less  than 2 weeks ago, and four American soldiers were injured. Our Embassy  in Baghdad was attacked under Soleimani's orders.   What more do we need? What more evidence do we need?   Let's talk about the facts. He is a designated terrorist under the  Obama administration. Importantly, the President told me today that  Soleimani was planning to blow up our Embassy. I need no further proof,  evidence, or intelligence than that from the President of the United  States.   What if the President had not acted? Let's assume that. By the way,  some on the other side of the aisle were criticizing him for not  responding after our Embassy was attacked.   What if he did not act. What if Soleimani had made it back to Tehran  to meet with the Ayatollah to give the green light to carry out the  plot to attack our soldiers and diplomats in Iraq? What if the  Americans were killed? What if they killed our soldiers and diplomats?  What if they successfully stormed our American Embassy and held our  marines and diplomats hostage, like they did in 1979 when this whole  reign of terror started with Jimmy Carter in the White House?   How would the critics of the President respond then if we had done  nothing? How would the American people respond? How would the Gold Star  Mothers respond?   No, this President did the right thing to take out this threat that  killed so many Americans. I have been to too many funerals, as many of  us in this Chamber have, and many of those soldiers were killed at the  bloody hands of Soleimani. As many Americans whose families still  grieve today, we grieve for them.   Since 1979, Iran has presided over a reign of terror in the region.  For over two decades, Soleimani has been the mastermind of terror, and  the world is safer today without him.   Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by saying that now is not the time to  divide this Nation and play into the propaganda of Iran. Now is not the  time to tie our Commander in Chief's hands. Now is the time to support  our men and women in uniform.  [[Page H113]]    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this resolution, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
