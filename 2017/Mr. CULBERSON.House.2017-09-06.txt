 Mr. Speaker, to everyone in Texas and Louisiana who  has suffered the loss of a loved one or the loss of everything they own  in this catastrophic flood, we are here today to tell you that help is  on the way and to say thank you.   Help is on the way because today, in the Congress, there are no  Republicans, there are no Democrats. We are all Americans here today,  unified in our determination to move swiftly to help all those poor  people who have suffered so much as a result of this catastrophic  storm.   It is an unparalleled disaster in our Nation's history. My district  suffered. We all suffered, all of us in southeast Texas, southwest  Louisiana.   My brother and his wife lost everything. Their home is still  underwater. My in-laws lost everything. Their home was destroyed,  everything they owned and loved, but they are just personal  possessions.   No one lost their lives. I can't imagine if you lost a loved one in  this catastrophe.   But help is on the way. We are all unified here today. We are all  working together to make sure that we get this immediate infusion of  cash into the Disaster Relief Fund to help these people who have  suffered so much and been displaced so abruptly and so  catastrophically.   I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for bringing this to the floor so  quickly, thank our leadership for working together to get this done. I  want to thank President Trump and his wife for personally donating $1  million to the relief fund for the victims of Hurricane Harvey. I want  to thank, also, all of the first responders who sacrificed so much to  save so many lives. I want to thank especially the people of America  who stepped up to help the people of Houston.   I spent all of last week out in neighborhoods in boats and on trucks  and in waders helping pull people and their property and their pets out  of their homes.   Last Saturday, I ran into a group of guys, four guys, with a bass  boat that drove all the way from Florida. They saw the catastrophe on  television and said, ``We can either sit here and watch this or we can  go help our fellow Americans,'' and they jumped in their truck and they  drove that bass boat all the way to Texas to help us.   A guy from Michigan showed up in our neighborhoods just to help.   I want to thank my friend and my colleague, Congressman Garret Graves  of Louisiana, who called me on the second day of the disaster and said:  The Cajun Navy is on the way.   I said: What? I didn't know there was such a thing as the Cajun Navy.   Garret said: 110 trucks are on the way to Texas towing 100 boats  loaded with thousands of meals of jambalaya and red beans and rice and  diapers and water and radios and everything that you need to recover  from a storm.   They just did it, our neighbors.   I have never been prouder to be an American, never been prouder to be  a Texan or a Houstonian, to see people step up and help each other out  of the goodness of their hearts, because we are Americans and we are  the greatest nation in the history of civilization, and it is because  we are all self-reliant. It is because we all look after each other as  a community. We all love each other. We love our family, our God. We  respect the law.   This great Nation that was founded on the rule of law is a bond that  connects all of us, and we saw it in this disaster, and we thank you  all from the bottom of our heart. Help is on the way.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Today, we are all Americans, arm in arm.    Mr. Chairman, first of all, I want to thank everyone  here in the House for their kind words and their prayers and their  support this morning for the Hurricane Harvey relief bill. I want to  thank you in particular, Chairman Frelinghuysen, for your hard work,  along with the Speaker, to get that legislation passed through the  House in record time to get relief to the people of Texas and Lousiana,  and know that we are praying for the people of Puerto Rico and Florida  who are facing this terrible hurricane right now.   Today, I am pleased to present the fiscal year 2018 Commerce,  Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill.   I want to particularly thank my ranking member, Jose Serrano, who has  been a good partner to work with and for his support when it comes to  science, and NASA has deeply appreciated it. His input has improved the  bill significantly.   I am also very grateful to Chairman Frelinghuysen and Ranking Member  Lowey for their help in writing this bill, and the superb staff work on  both sides of the aisle in putting it together.                                time  1700    This Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies bill provides  $54 billion in discretionary funding this year, which is $2.6 billion  below fiscal year 2017.   We have done our best to be good stewards of our constituents' hard- earned and very precious tax dollars. We fund critical programs in this  bill while cutting or freezing lower priority programs.   One of the main priorities of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and  Related Agencies bill is to fund both Federal and local law enforcement  agencies. Our bill provides the FBI with $8.8 billion, which is a $92  million increase over the budget request.   The FBI has done a superb job in protecting this Nation against  espionage, cybercrime, terrorism, and hate crimes. The threats against  our security are real and evolving. We have done our best in this bill  to make sure that the FBI has the resources it needs to continue to  protect this great Nation.   The Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies bill also  provides increases across all other Federal law enforcement agencies,  Mr. Chairman, to enhance their capabilities, to combat illegal  immigration, violent crime, and go after human and opioid traffickers.  Unfortunately, Houston, Texas, is a center of human trafficking. And  our legislation makes sure that all Federal agencies have the resources  they need to combat these modern human slavers.   We have provided funding for 65 new immigration judge teams to reduce  the 500,000 immigration case backlog; we have got a $22 million  increase in here, Mr. Chairman, for U.S. attorneys, an $88 million  increase for U.S. marshals, a $98 million increase for the DEA, and a  $35 million increase for ATF.   We have also provided strong funding for priority State and local law  enforcement programs that protect women and children and help support  our local police officers. I am especially grateful, and I want to say  a special thank you, to all of the first responders who saved so many  lives in Houston and across southeast Texas and southwest Louisiana.  Our first responders have been absolutely magnificent in helping  protect the people of Texas, and I know they will be there for the  people of Puerto Rico and Florida.   Our legislation includes $527 million to fight human trafficking and  protect women against violence. We have provided $72.5 million to help  protect missing and exploited children. We have provided $500 million  for the Byrne JAG program to help local law enforcement agencies and  $220 million to help  [[Page H6839]]  reimburse State and local agencies for housing criminal aliens.    Mr. Chair, the bill also provides $19.9 billion for  NASA, which is a $218 million increase, and the bill advances space  exploration and ensures America will remain the world leader in space  exploration and technology.   The bill makes sure that the human spaceflight program is fully  funded and that we will have Americans launched back into space on  American-built rockets as soon as humanly possible.   The bill does not adopt the proposed cut to the National Science  Foundation, and we have continued to fund basic scientific research.   We have included numerous oversight provisions, Mr. Chairman, to  protect hard-earned taxpayer dollars, and we have also continued  provisions included in previous year bills to protect our Second  Amendment rights.   Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for the time and urge all Members to  support the CJS bill.
