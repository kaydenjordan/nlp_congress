 Objection.    Mr. President, to help libraries respond to and recover  from the COVID-19 pandemic and continue providing communities with  needed services, resources, technology, and broadband access, I am  introducing the Library Stabilization Fund Act along with Senators  Brown, Booker, Blumenthal, Udall, Cardin, Warren, Whitehouse, Heinrich,  Van Hollen, Menendez, Wyden, Hirano, and Markey. Our bill would provide  the $2 billion the American Library Association has estimated is  necessary for a library stabilization fund under the Institute of  Museum and Library Services (IMLS).   COVID-19 has wreaked havoc on every aspect of our daily lives.  Libraries, which anchor our local communities, are no exception. Local  budget shortfalls have left libraries to grapple with severe cuts,  furloughs of staff, and reduced operations just when communities need  their services the most. In addition to providing additional resources  to enable schools to reopen safely, close the homework gap, and  strengthen the social safety net, we need to invest in libraries to  help our communities recover.   Libraries are a critical piece of our education, economic  development, and social infrastructure. Although many libraries remain  closed or have limited hours, libraries are meeting urgent community  needs by increasing technology access (including boosting WIFI and  lending hotspots, tablets, and computers), offering digital content,  providing books and materials for delivery or pick-up, and hosting  online story times, classes, and discussion groups. In this way,  libraries are providing enrichment to our young people, ensuring  students can connect to remote and summer learning, enabling those with  jobs to telework, helping job seekers find employment and receive  training, and offering a lifeline to vulnerable adults and seniors who  need health information, a portal to government services, and ways to  avoid social isolation.   To strengthen the ability of libraries to serve communities affected  by COVID-19, our bill would provide funding to states on a formula  basis, with a minimum allotment of $10 million; to tribes; and on a  competitive basis. The funding could be used to support general  operations, including paying staff and ensuring the safe handling of  library materials; to offer greater access to technology, including  expanding digital networks and enabling the purchase and lending of  hotspots, laptops, and digital resources; to strengthen services and  resources, including those relating to literacy, distance learning,  adult education, workforce and economic development, and health  information; and to link patrons to government, community, and cultural  resources.   This legislation will help ensure libraries can continue to find new  ways to bridge the digital divide and safely provide information,  programming, and services that people of all ages need to stay engaged  and informed. This smart investment in our libraries will keep people  and communities connected and contribute to our economic recovery.   I thank the supporters of the bill, including the American Library  Association; Association for Rural & Small Libraries; Association of  Research Libraries; Chief Officers of State Library Agencies; Common  Sense Media: International Dyslexia Association; National Association  of Elementary School Principals; National Association of Secondary  School Principals; National Coalition for Literacy; National Digital  Inclusion Alliance; National Humanities Alliance; National League of  Cities; Reach Out and Read; Reading Is Fundamental; and Urban Libraries  Council. Companion legislation is being introduced on a bipartisan  basis in the other body by Congressman Andy Levin.   I urge our colleagues to join us in pressing for the inclusion of the  Library Stabilization Fund Act in the next COVID-19 response package.                                  ______                                         By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Merkley):   S. 4189. A bill to provide for drought preparedness and improved  water supply reliability; to the Committee on Energy and Natural  Resources.
