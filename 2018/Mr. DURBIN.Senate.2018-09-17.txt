 Madam President, our Nation is in the midst of the worst  drug epidemic in its history. There is no town too small, no suburb too  wealthy to be spared. Every day, more than 115 Americans die from an  opioid overdose. In the past 3 years, there has been a 53-percent spike  in drug overdose deaths in Illinois, with more than 2,400 lives lost in  2016. I am glad we are finally doing something to address this crisis.   To truly prevent addiction and stop the next drug epidemic, we need  to look at the factors driving this crisis.   I am pleased that several of my bills to help prevent opioid  addiction have been included in the bill before us. Whether it is  witnessing violence, experiencing a parent's opioid addiction, or  facing abuse in the home, traumatic experiences can harm a child's  brain.   Thanks to the Adverse Childhood Experiences, ACEs, study and  advancements in brain science, we know that, left unaddressed, these  events can have an impact on future health problems, mental illness,  drug use, and the cycle of violence. But with the right care and  support, we can help heal children who experience trauma and prevent  serious, negative consequences.   I want to thank Chairman Alexander and Ranking Member Murray for  including legislation I introduced with Senators Heitkamp, Capito, and  Murkowski. Our language will help train more teachers, doctors, social  services, first responders, and the justice system to recognize signs  of trauma in children and provide help to those in need.   Our provisions will improve coordination between Federal agencies,  ensure more Federal funding is used to promote these skills and  awareness, and expand the workforce capable to providing care.   In 2016, Big Pharma produced 14 billion opioid doses--enough for  every adult in America to have a 3-week supply of opioids. Each year,  the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, sets the amount of opioids  allowed to be produced in the United States. Between 1993 and 2015, DEA  allowed production of oxycodone to increase 39-fold and hydrocodone to  increase 12-fold. The sheer volume of opioids manufactured each year  increases risk of abuse--four of five new heroin users started with  painkillers.   One problem is that, when setting annual quotas, DEA is unable to  look at how a drug is abused or leads to overdose deaths. Why should  DEA be handcuffed from considering the real-world misuse of oxycodone  pills when it sets the production levels? This package includes my  bipartisan bill to strengthen DEA's ability to adjust quotas to reflect  the risk of opioid misuse, while improving flexibility to avoid any  shortages.   I want to thank Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Feinstein, and DEA  for working so closely with me and Senator Kennedy. It is a good thing  that we are now talking about drug addiction as a treatable disease,  not a moral failing that should be punished. Sadly, it has taken us too  long to get here.   The opioid epidemic also underscores the importance of having quality  health insurance--coverage that includes mental health and substance  abuse treatment. But once again, President Trump wants to allow  insurance companies to discriminate against people with a preexisting  condition--such as an opioid addiction--and promote ``junk'' insurance  plans that don't cover substance abuse treatment. I will fight tooth  and nail against efforts to repeal, gut, or sabotage this quality care  so that we do not return to the dark days of coverage denials and sky- high premiums.   The legislation before us addresses several important factors, and I  am happy to support it today, but it neglects many more actions we need  to take.   This opioid package fails to include my bipartisan bill with Senators  Brown and Portman, which would lift an outdated barrier to addiction  treatment that restricts Medicaid from paying for care in facilities  larger than 16 beds.   We have worked in a thoughtful, open process to improve this  legislation and address any policy concerns, and I look forward to  including our revised bill in conference with the House.   We must also hold the pharmaceutical industry accountable for its  role in creating the epidemic through their deceptive conduct. Drug  companies have profited from flooding the market with painkillers,  often with misleading information, and should have to pay for the  addiction treatment that their products have caused. Additionally,  executives from Perdue Pharma, Janssen, Abbott, Endo, Insys, and other  manufacturers must testify before the Senate to explain their role in  this epidemic.   Today's bipartisan opioid legislation is an important step forward,  but we need to do more, and quickly, to meet this destructive crisis  head-on.    Mr. President, American jobs have changed dramatically in  the last century, but the reasons Americans work have not changed.   Work is about more than a paycheck. A job is--or ought to be--a  source of dignity. Men and women who work hard may not be able to live  on Easy Street, but they ought to be able to walk down Main Street with  their heads held high, knowing that they can provide for the basic  needs of their families, and they ought to be able to retire with  dignity and security.   Keith Kelleher understands this. He understands that treating  workers--all workers--fairly is not an outdated idea; it is a  requirement for a sound economy and solid future. He has devoted more  than four decades of his life to improving the lives of some of the  lowest paid workers in our economy, including nursing home workers and  home health aides.   As founding president of SEIU Healthcare in Illinois, Indiana,  Missouri, and Kansas, Keith Kelleher has helped secure the right to  form and join a union for more than 91,000 traditionally low-paid  healthcare workers and to negotiate for better wages and working  conditions.   Not only that, like Walter Reuther and other great labor leaders of  the last century, Keith Kelleher has championed broader causes of  social justice. In 2014, Keith Kelleher and the members of SEIU  Healthcare helped lead the fight in Illinois for marriage equality, a  year before the U.S. Supreme Court made marriage equality the law of  the land.   This week, Keith Kelleher is stepping down officially from the union  he helped found. He is retiring after more than 30 years at the helm of  SEIU Healthcare, and I want to thank him for his contributions to  economic and social justice in Illinois and in our Nation.   Keith Kelleher moved to Chicago in the early 1980s from Detroit. He  was working with a group called the United Labor Unions, an  organization that trained people on how to organize and work together  to advance their common good.   He lived as simply as the people he came to help. He focused on the  home care industry because it had some of the lowest paid workers in  the state. Private-sector workers hired by the State to provide  services for seniors and people with disabilities earned an hourly rate  of $3.35, with no benefits. They were a forgotten group, one largely  ignored by traditional labor unions.   In 1983, Keith Kelleher gathered seven home health aides in the  basement of the United Methodist Temple in downtown Chicago, and they  voted to organize a union. That moment was the beginning of Union Local  880. Twenty-five years later, Local 880 had grown from 7 members to  68,000 members. All great things come from small beginnings.   Keith Kelleher built Local 880 from the ground up by going door-to- door in some of Chicago's poorest, most neglected neighborhoods. He  helped convince thousands of workers to pay membership fees even before  Local 880 could engage in collective bargaining. They won that right in  1984, when the National Labor Relations Board officially recognized  Local 880.   He convinced people that they mattered and that they could change  their own lives though collective action.   He found innovative ways to raise funds for the fledgling union,  canvassing for donations, selling chicken dinners on payday, and  holding tag sales. Keith and his wife even figured out how to turn  their wedding into a union fundraiser.   In 1985, the independent Local 880 merged with SEIU, the Service  Employees International Union.   In 2007 and 2008, Local 880 merged with two other SEIU local unions  in Indiana, Local 20 and Local 4. In 2009, SEIU Healthcare Illinois/ Indiana merged with the SEIU Healthcare local unions in Missouri and  Kansas. Keith Kelleher was elected founding president of the new  combined union.   For nearly 40 years, Keith Kelleher has helped forge new partnerships  and fought new battles. He is as determined as they come. One battle  took nearly 20 years to win, but SEIU Local 880 never gave up, and in  2005, Illinois' Governor finally signed an executive order recognizing  unionized home care workers who work as contractors for State agencies  as public employees. That victory gave 50,000 workers the legal right  to bargain collectively for better wages and working conditions. They  have since won a 35 percent wage increase over 4 years and other  improvements in benefits.   Under Keith Kelleher's leadership, Local 880 has become a significant  political force. You cannot miss SEIU Health members at public events.  They are often known as ``the purple people'' because of the color of  the t-shirts they wear.   Keith Kelleher has fought for justice for union members and for those  who don't have the benefit of union membership.   In addition to marriage equality, he has fought for a higher minimum  wage across the country.   Like Tom Joad in ``The Grapes of Wrath,'' wherever there are people  in need of justice, Keith Kelleher seems to be there.   As he steps down officially this week from the union he helped  create, I want to thank Keith personally and wish him, his wife  Madeline, and his two daughters Ryan and Aileen well. He has made a  real difference in the lives of tens of thousands of workers, and his  life's work will continue to lift workers up for generations to come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, earlier this year, I had the opportunity  to visit Venezuela, a once proud Latin American democracy that is now  in a state of collapse. The country was planning a Presidential  election a few weeks after my visit in late May.   My message to President Maduro and members of his government during  this visit was clear and simple. They should run a clean election in  which opposition candidates are released from detention and allowed to  participate. Local and international observers should be allowed to  observe the entire electoral process. The election should be  administered in a fair and open manner by credible nonpartisan election  commissioners.  [[Page S6182]]    These were the same messages told to Venezuela by its neighbors in  Latin America.   I suggested that meeting these obvious international norms and  restoring the power of the country's duly elected National Assembly  would help ease Venezuela's isolation and the suffering of its people.   Tragically, obstinately, President Maduro and his circle of corrupt  colleagues chose to double down. They held a sham election.   Its legitimacy was rejected by the international community and the  consequences have been predictable: continued mass exodus of desperate  Venezuelans to neighboring countries, inflation nearing 1 million  percent, deepening international isolation, and of course, an  increasingly ruthless crackdown on political opponents to further  solidify the regime's illegitimate hold on power.   This regime already had a shameful history of jailing political  opponents. Their victims include Judge Maria Afiuni, who had the  courage to rule against the government on a case before her, Leopoldo  Lopez, the former mayor of Caracas who was a highly popular national  candidate and therefore remains under house arrest and unable to  compete in elections, and so many others including a number of dual  American-Venezuelan citizens.   And now, it has jailed young elected National Assembly Member Juan  Requesens on highly questionable charges.   His crime? Criticizing President Maduro and the staggering human  suffering and the demise of democracy under his dictatorial rule.   Haunting videos of Requesens in detention have surfaced which  strongly suggest torture and inhumane treatment.   Several months ago, I had the great pleasure of sitting down with  several of Juan's colleagues when I was in Caracas. These are the next  generation of young leaders, brave men and women who won at the ballot  box in many areas previously won by Hugo Chavez and Maduro.   They won because they made an effort to understand voters' economic  concerns and how former ruling parties had too often become corrupt or  ignored the poor. They were the hope for the future, but to this Maduro  regime, they were a threat.   So voter and candidate registrations were manipulated to make it  harder for opposition parties and candidates to compete. Elected  National Assembly Members were harassed and threatened. In some cases,  their passports were confiscated.   I will never forget when they told me that, if I returned a year  later, that half of them might be gone, jailed or chased into exile.  Sadly, they were right.   My colleagues Senators Menendez, Nelson, Rubio, Cornyn, and I will  introduce legislation in the days ahead that will further targeted  sanctions against those Venezuelan officials responsible for this  scandalous regime and those responsible for Juan's detention. It will  also provide additional aid to help with the humanitarian crises in and  along Venezuela's borders.   I wish we had not reached this desperate moment. I wish the Maduro  regime would play by basic democratic rules and let the Venezuelan  people freely decide their leaders. I wish the Maduro regime had the  courage to compete in a free and fair election.   But it didn't.   So until it does and until Leopoldo, Juan, and the many other  Venezuelan political prisoners are freed, the National Assembly's  powers restored, and a legitimate democratic process is reestablished,  I will continue to support pressure on this corrupt regime and  sanctioning those responsible for the Venezulea's misery.                            ____________________
