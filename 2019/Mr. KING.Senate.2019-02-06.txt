 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the town of  Auburn, ME, which is celebrating its 150th anniversary this year.  Auburn might be a small city, but it features something for everyone,  from recreation activities and parks and trails to cultural  opportunities, a variety of restaurants, shopping, and public and  private school options. Located along the banks of the Androscoggin  River, Auburn is home to over 23,000 residents and is the county seat  of Androscoggin County.   Auburn was first incorporated on February 22, 1869, and was created  by annexing parts of the surrounding towns of Poland, Minot, and  Danville, previously called Pejepscot. Auburn was the first city in  Maine to adopt a council-manager form of government and grew into one  of Maine's largest municipalities. In the early to mid-1800s, a new  bridge across the Androscoggin River to Lewiston and the arrival of the  Atlantic and St. Lawrence Railroad helped spur development in Auburn.  Like many Maine towns, Auburn developed into a mill town, and many of  those mills were powered by the falls on the Androscoggin and Little  Androscoggin  [[Page S918]]  Rivers. Auburn was also the home to a number of other manufacturing  plants, including shoes, cotton and woolen textiles, carriages, bricks,  and furniture. The population of the city grew quickly through the end  of the 1800s, mostly due to the influx of French-Canadian immigrants  coming to the city to work at the shoe factories.   By the late 19th century, shoe manufacturing became the dominant  industry in Auburn. In fact, the city seal depicts a spindle with  different types of shoes at each outside point. In 1917, one factory in  Auburn was producing 75 percent of the world's supply of white canvas  shoes. Like many manufacturing towns, Auburn has had to reinvent itself  in recent years, and they have shown their resiliency and grit. Today,  Auburn is as vibrant as ever.   The city of Auburn has contributed to the energy, vitality, and  commerce of the State of Maine and is poised to make the next 150 years  some of the best years in its long and cherished history. I hope that  the citizens of Auburn take the opportunity during this yearlong  birthday celebration to reconnect to their roots, share their life  stories, and remind current and future generations about the rich past  and the bright future ahead of us all. Happy 150th birthday, Auburn,  and congratulations to all the citizens of this great Maine  community.                            ____________________
