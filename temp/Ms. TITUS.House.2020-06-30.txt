 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   The Moving Forward Act is transformative legislation that will help  revive and strengthen our economy for years to come.   In Las Vegas we welcome nearly 43 million visitors from all over the  world every year, and it is vital that we make smart investments in our  infrastructure to help travelers get there easily and then move them  around safely and efficiently once they arrive.   As a member of the committee, I am proud of the provisions I secured  in this bill to:   Prioritize the completion of I-11 between Las Vegas and Phoenix;   Promote projects related to the movement of travelers to  destinations, not just the movement of freight;   And to ensure that there is dedicated funding in every State for  child passenger safety programs for underserved populations.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, which also takes  significant action to address global climate change by investing in  renewable energy, resilient housing and schools, green transit, and  more efficient road infrastructure.   I thank the chairman for his leadership.
