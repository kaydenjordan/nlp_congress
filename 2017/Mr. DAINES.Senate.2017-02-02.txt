 Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct  honor of recognizing Ms. Ally Martin of Wheatland County, a tough ranch  hand with a very bright future. This young lady has flat out excelled  in her community. The superintendent of Harlowton Public Schools said  of Ally, ``I have known Ally for her whole life and she has yet to  disappoint me.''   Ally is the oldest of four siblings on a working sheep and cattle  ranch not too far from the Musselshell River in central Montana. Anyone  who knows the amount dedication and perseverance it takes to keep this  type of family business running knows that Ally's achievements in  sports, school, and 4-H are remarkable. Ally gets her grit from her  family. Her parents would drive 25 miles to take Ally to her part-time  job washing dishes and waiting tables at the Crazy Mountain Inn in  Martinsdale.   From 2013-2015, Ally was recognized as the Wheatland County 4-H  ``Grand Champion'' for her sheep project. Ally meticulously cross-bred  Suffolk sheep into her family's Targhee flock, making noticeable gains  to weaning weight. Some of her 4-H peers even started using her lambs  in 4-H as well. Ally has been able to shoulder the demands of the ranch  while ranking first in her class academically, earning all-State  athletic honors in basketball and track, and participating in student  government. Ally commits to whatever she sets her mind to, from  ranching to school to sports.   Ally broke new ground as the first person from Harlowton High School  appointed to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. The number of  cadets at West Point will be nearly double the population of Wheatland  County. Ally won't flinch at this. She is not one to seek out comfort,  make excuses, or look for shortcuts. She will do what she has always  done--wake up when almost everyone else is still sleeping, focus on the  tasks at hand, and simply get the job done. Her exemplary hardwork and  leadership will serve our Nation well in the military. Good luck, and  Godspeed, Ally; the people of Montana support you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in recent years we have seen the inability  of the Federal Government to quickly adapt to changing technology and  emerging threats. In June of 2015 the Office of Personnel Management,  OPM, was infiltrated with a major cyber breach, affecting more than 22  million current and former Federal employees, including myself. In  January of 2016, another nearly half a million Americans had their  social security numbers stolen when the Internal Revenue Service was  hacked.   I spent 28 years in the private sector, 12 years with a global cloud  computing company. We faced cyber threats daily, and our customers  expected security of their data. We delivered, not once was our data  compromised. Until I came to the Federal Government and received the  letters from OPM, my data had been secured too.   I know firsthand that industry has the talent and incentive to keep  their information systems secure. The Federal Government should  continue to innovate and utilize industries' expertise and learn from  their best practices.   That is why I am introducing the Support for Rapid Innovation Act.  This  [[Page S658]]  legislation will extend the authorization for the Secretary of Homeland  Security to carry out innovative research and development projects that  will enhance our Nation's cyber security. It will focus efforts on  developing more secure information systems, technologies for detecting  and containing attacks in real-time, and develop cyber forensics to  identify perpetrators. This will be done by leveraging private sectors'  innovation and ingenuity.   I want to thank Senator Warner for being an original cosponsor of  this bill and Representative Ratcliffe of Texas for leading  introduction of companion legislation in the House of Representatives.  I ask my Senate colleagues to join us in support of this important  legislation.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                   S. 278         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
