 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   I rise in support of the INVEST in America Act, which focuses on  rebuilding our Nation's highways, transit systems, railroads, and water  systems.   These investments will spur economic development, tackle the climate  crisis, and put people to work in good-paying union jobs.   I am proud that the Act includes some issues that I fought for that  will benefit the State of Nevada, provisions to support projects of  regional impact, like the completion of I-11 between Las Vegas and  Phoenix; an expansion of the RRIF program to help with the development  of high-speed passenger rail; projects to reduce congestion and improve  air quality in our environmental justice communities; and resources for  child passenger safety programs in our underserved communities.   Finally, I am glad to see Congress reassert its authority to direct  funding to priority projects in a very transparent manner.   Critical infrastructure projects in southern Nevada will see $20  million in funding to support congestion relief, transit, and safety  enhancements on roadways that cross and crisscross the district.   The INVEST Act sends a clear and strong message about our priorities,  and I congratulate our chairman for his hard work on this issue.
