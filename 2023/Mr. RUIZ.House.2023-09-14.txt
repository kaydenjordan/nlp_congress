 Mr. Speaker, I rise today deeply frustrated that so many  Members on the other side of the aisle seem determined to shut down the  government and create a national crisis of massive proportions.   Let's be clear. We are not asking Republicans to break new ground. We  are only asking them to live up to the bipartisan budget agreement that  a majority on both sides of the aisle already voted for and passed the  House. We are only asking them to support the essential programs  critical to veterans, seniors, childcare programs, working families,  farmers, and retirees; the people I care about and came to serve  because, again, let's be clear, if they force a government shutdown,  these are the people who will suffer most.   Veterans won't receive their full benefits, retirees will lose their  economic security and medical care, and our businesses will face  massive economic turmoil. For what? A political stunt created by  extremists who care more about riling up their base than helping their  constituents.   Every one of us here swore an oath to serve our constituents. It is  time to live up to that oath.                            ____________________
