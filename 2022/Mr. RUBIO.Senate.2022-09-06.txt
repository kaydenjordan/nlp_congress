 Mr. President, I recognize Grady Judd as he  celebrates 50 years of service with the Pasco County Sheriff's Office.  Grady has served as sheriff since 2004, where he is a constant and  protective presence in the community.   Sheriff Grady joined the Polk County Sheriff's Office in 1972 as a  dispatch officer and rose through the department's ranks. At the age of  19, he was the youngest deputy sworn in and eventually served as a  sergeant, colonel, and chief of staff for his predecessor before  becoming sheriff.   Devoted to helping others throughout the county, at 16, he managed to  convince the Polk County Ambulance Service to hire him despite being 2  years away from the required age of 18. Grady has always sought to help  others throughout his community, dedicating his time and talents to  making a difference in their lives.   After becoming sheriff, Grady reworked how the department interacts  with the local media. The sherriff's office seeks to provide the public  with up-to-date information regarding investigations as quickly as  possible, and often, Grady will issue warnings aimed at suspects that  have since become well-known throughout Florida.   Grady was born in Lakeland, FL, graduating from Lakeland High School  before attending Polk Community College and Rollins College, where he  earned his bachelor of arts and master's degrees in criminal justice.  He is an adjunct professor at the University of South Florida and  Florida Southern College, offering students first-hand knowledge of law  enforcement.   Grady's work and commitment has made a real difference in the lives  of the people of Polk County. I am grateful for his decades of service  and extend my best wishes to his wife, Marisa, his two adult children,  and his 13 grandchildren on this momentous milestone.                            ____________________
