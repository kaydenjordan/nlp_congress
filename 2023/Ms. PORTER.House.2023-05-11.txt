 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor my constituent and proud  Californian, Dorothy Levin. Dorothy is celebrating her 100th birthday,  and I am thrilled to join her friends and family in commemorating this  remarkable milestone.   Dorothy was born in Cleveland, Ohio, on May 12, 1923, and moved to  southern California with her family in 1952.   In 1958, while raising her three young children, Dorothy decided to  attend law school. She graduated and passed the California Bar exam but  was unable to find a job in a male-dominated field, so she opened her  own firm, where she practiced until her retirement in 1994.   Dorothy's unwavering dedication, tenacity, and courage have helped  pave the way for generations of women in the legal profession.   I wish Dorothy a happy 100th birthday. I am so thankful for her  trailblazing work, and I am proud to honor her today.                            ____________________
