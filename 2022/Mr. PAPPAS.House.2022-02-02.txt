 Madam Speaker, as an original cosponsor of the Homeland  Procurement Reform Act, I am grateful that this legislation has been  included in the America COMPETES Act. I will offer an amendment later  today that strengthens provisions that support domestic manufacturing  and American small businesses.   It is of the utmost importance for our economic and national security  interests that we make more things in America. That should be a  priority when it comes to purchases made by the Department of Homeland  Security for protective equipment for frontline personnel. Purchasing  more of these items from qualified American small businesses would be a  win for workers and companies that manufacture their products here in  the United States.   Small businesses receive less than 26 percent of Federal Government  contracts. My amendment will help close that procurement gap and at the  same time create good-paying jobs, support domestic manufacturing, and  strengthen our supply chains.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and the America  COMPETES Act.                            ____________________
