 Madam President, the United States is in the midst of the  deadliest drug epidemic in our Nation's history, caused by the most  lethal drugs ever created.   More than 108,000 Americans died last year from drugs--more than  108,000--which is almost double the number of Americans killed in the  entire Vietnam war. That is the worst slaughter of American citizens by  drug dealers and traffickers on record.   The biggest killers, by far, were lab-made opioids, most notably  fentanyl, which are cheap to produce and easy to mix with other street  drugs. These lethal cocktails have devastated countless families and  communities across our Nation. Too many parents have come home to a  dead child who has mistakenly taken a prescription pill or a so-called  party drug that might have been laced with fentanyl. Indeed, almost no  one dies of a fentanyl overdose thinking he took fentanyl. It is laced  into other drugs.   That is why, repeatedly, over the past 2 years, I and many of my  colleagues have offered a measure to keep it illegal to traffic new  variants of fentanyl, but, each time, a Democrat has blocked that  measure. Later today, they will do so again.   Perhaps we can at least agree on one thing: We should have no  tolerance for people who willingly trick addicted drug users or other  innocent persons into taking deadly fentanyl by telling them it is  really something else. This happens every day with heartbreaking  consequences across the country.   For example, just 2 weeks ago, a drug trafficker was sentenced to  life in prison for his role in distributing fentanyl to unsuspecting  users in Minnesota. Eleven people died. They thought they were buying  illicit Adderall. When he heard about the deaths, the dealer asked his  Chinese suppliers for a discount on his next shipment.   That same week, another drug dealer was arrested just minutes from  the Capitol Building, where we stand--in Silver Spring, MD--for killing  a child with a fentanyl pill, which he said was Percocet. He was hiding  the fentanyl-laced, fake Percocet pills inside small bags of marijuana.   Last week, a few minutes in the other direction, a trafficker was  tried in Northern Virginia for distributing cocaine laced with fentanyl  at a party. Six partygoers overdosed. One died.   These cases happen every day. Drug addicts are especially lulled into  a false sense of safety by fake prescription pills, believing them to  be medicine for which they have some past experience. That is why fake  prescription drugs are on the rise. Federal law enforcement encountered  as many fake prescription pills in 2021 as in the previous 2 years  combined.   If Democrats refuse to help Republicans keep all fentanyl variants  off the streets, hopefully, we can at least agree on keeping deceptive  fentanyl traffickers behind bars. My bill would establish that any drug  trafficker who knowingly misrepresents fentanyl as though it is  something else would be subject to 20 years in prison. If the criminal  has a prior felony criminal record or if its misrepresentation kills  someone, then the criminal would be subject to life in prison or would  even be eligible for the death penalty. There can simply be no leniency  for people who trick unsuspecting users into taking deadly fentanyl.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to  the immediate consideration of S. 4984, which is at the desk. I further  ask that the bill be considered read a third time and passed and that  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, what we heard is a lot of the same  excuses that the Democrats have made for years about being soft on  crime and their claims about mass incarceration or systemic racism or  what have you.   I would point out that almost no one--almost no one--is in Federal  prison for mere drug possession. It is a myth that there are low-level,  nonviolent offenders in prison because they are addicted to drugs.   Where we are is at a 21-year low in the number of Federal inmates we  have. Do you know where we are not at? A 21-year low in drug deaths-- the highest on record every single year, year after year. Almost twice  as many have died as in the Vietnam war. Almost 24 times as many have  died as in the entire Iraq war. Almost 35 times as many have died as on  9/11. Yet the Democrats repeatedly refuse to crack down on deceptive  fentanyl dealers.   As I have mentioned, I have also offered bills in the past that would  permanently add fentanyl to the Controlled Substances Act scheduling.  The Democrats refuse to do so. They will do it temporarily from time to  time, but they want a trade. They want to get a trade for something.  They want to either reduce sentences or let prisoners out. This is  whether they are Democratic Senators or Democratic Governors in places  like Illinois, in their eliminating the bail system, or whether they  are Democratic mayors or Democratic prosecuting attorneys in places  like Chicago. As a result, we have a crimewave and a drug epidemic all  across America.   Let me just reiterate. The bill I just offered, which the Senator  from Illinois blocked, would simply say that you cannot sell another  drug and not acknowledge that fentanyl is in it; that you cannot  misrepresent what you are selling.   It is not just opioids. It is not just heroin. It is even marijuana.  It is pills that are passed off as mere prescription drugs, like in  some of the examples I gave--Adderall, OxyContin, Percocet--that people  all across the America are dying from.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 621    Madam President, let's take another angle on this problem. Almost all  of these drugs come from Mexico. Almost all of the drugs in America  today come from Mexico. Almost all come from a handful of vicious,  depraved cartels in Mexico--cartels that have taken on the powers of a  quasi-state, cartels that the Mexican Government either cannot or will  not crack down on. So let's look at it from that perspective. It is  past time that we bring the full weight of the U.S. Government to bear  on these cartels and to destroy them for what they are unleashing on  our streets.   Imagine if ISIS or al-Qaida set up shop across our border and was  responsible for more than a hundred thousand American deaths every  single year. What would we do? What would you do?   I know what we wouldn't do. We wouldn't hesitate to act, and that is  exactly what we should do with these Mexican cartels.   Unfortunately, President Biden has done the opposite. Since the day  he took office, he has flung open our borders, created a border crisis,  and made it easier than ever to smuggle massive amounts of illegal  drugs into the United States.   Already this year, the Border Patrol has found over 12,000 pounds of  fentanyl being smuggled over our borders--12,000 pounds. You may not be  able to put that in perspective. Let me put it in perspective for you:  It is enough to kill every man, woman, and child in America many, many  times over.   That doesn't even include any fentanyl brought in by the hundreds of  thousands of illegal aliens whom the DHS calls got-aways.   President Biden could declare fentanyl-peddling cartels to be  terrorist organizations, but he has refused to do so. So the bill that  I am about to bring up would give him additional tools, short of  labeling these cartels ``terrorists.''   My bill would create a new designation called a significant  transnational criminal organization, and it would enable the Federal  Government to impose many of the same sanctions and use many of the  same tools against cartels that it already does against terrorist  organizations like al-Qaida and ISIS. Those would include barring  cartel members and their immediate families from entering the United  States, freezing assets belonging to the cartels to hit their wallets  and to keep them from profiting off of death and destruction, and  enabling civil and criminal penalties for anyone who provides material  assistance or resources to the cartels.   The Democrats are going to block a bill later today that would keep  new fentanyl variants illegal. They just blocked another bill that  would target drug traffickers who trick people into taking the fentanyl  that kills them. I hope at least Democratic Senators would be willing  to say that we should give the Biden administration more tools to use  against the Mexican cartels, some of the worst and most depraved  criminals on Earth.   Therefore, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  my bill, S. 621, the Significant Transnational Criminal Organization  Designation Act, and that the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration; further, that the bill be considered read a third time  and passed, and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table.    Madam President, I think we know who is soft on crime. It  sounds like I hit a nerve. I didn't stand up here saying I am not soft  on crime five or six times in a row. It is the Senator from Illinois  who said that, just like Senate Democrats have been saying it for the  last several months, just like their candidates all across America are  saying it.   Let's look at the first bill he mentioned, the American Rescue Plan.  You know what that is, right, the American Rescue Plan? That is their  $2 trillion wasteful spending bill from last spring that is responsible  for 13 percent inflation.   Do you know what is also included in it? A measure that would get  stimulus checks to prisoners. That is right--depraved, violent felons;  murderers and rapists and drug traffickers all across America. People  like the Boston marathon bomber got stimulus checks last year because  the Democrats believe that criminals are really, at heart, victims as  well, victims of an oppressive society and system.   If I am not mistaken, when I offered my amendment to prevent  prisoners from getting stimulus checks, I think it was the Senator from  Illinois who stood up and blocked it. I know that he voted against it.  I know that he wanted prisoners to get stimulus checks. That is what he  is talking about.   What about his objection to this bill, that it is going to target  mothers and kids, the poor mothers and children of drug kingpins, a  very common feature of American sanctions efforts--in fact, sanctions  efforts that we are doing exactly against Russian oligarchs and regime  figures, which I support, by the way. I support. No, the wives and the  children of Russian oligarchs and Mexican cartel kingpins should not  benefit from their ill-gotten gains.   But I care more about the lives of American citizens--the hundred  thousand-plus American citizens whom we lose every single year--than  anyone else in the world.   The Biden administration's policy, though, is that we will use this  tool against Russians, but we are not going to use it against Mexican  cartel members. I think that goes to show you where their priorities  are.   Again, just to recap, we tried to pass legislation that would have  imposed heightened penalties on drug traffickers who misrepresent their  drugs and say they don't contain fentanyl. The Senator from Illinois  blocked it on behalf of the Democrats.   Just now, we tried to give the Biden administration more tools to  target the cartels that are smuggling these drugs into our country,  that are killing a hundred thousand of our fellow citizens. Again, on  behalf of Senate Democrats, the Senator from Illinois blocked it.   I say, again, over 108,000 Americans were killed by drugs last year.  Yet the Democrats continue to refuse to crack down on drug traffickers  and cartel kingpins.   Some of my other colleagues are going to offer similar bills today,  just like I am going to offer, yet again, my permanent fentanyl  scheduling bill that would stop the annual Kabuki dance here of the  Democrats demanding some pro-criminal law just so we can permanently  add fentanyl to the Controlled Substance Act schedule.   Think about that. At a time when 108,000 Americans are dying every  single year--that is not an aggregate number, every single year--the  Democrats refuse to act if they don't get something in return on behalf  of criminals, if they can't reduce drug sentences for hardened  criminals, if they can't let more felons out of prison. It shows a  depraved indifference to the lives of our people.   I yield the floor.
