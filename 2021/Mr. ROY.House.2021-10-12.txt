 Mr. Speaker, I just want to thank the distinguished majority  leader for sharing with us he has voted 49 times to raise the debt  ceiling, because when he came into this body, the debt was about $1  trillion. Today it is $28.5 trillion.   So thank you--I guess--on behalf of the people of America who are  staring at $28.5 trillion of debt.   Here is the thing: My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are  asking us to support a half-a-trillion-dollar increase in the debt-- half a trillion dollars. And the American people can't even keep up  with what those numbers even mean. But they do know that those dollars  are being used to fund government tyranny over their lives.   That is what those dollars are being used for--for a border that is  not secure; for cartels that are ripping into Texas; for critical race  theory being taught to our children; to not fund police; to have the  FBI going after parents and school boards; vax mandates; shutting down  businesses; forcing people to comply or they lose their job; energy  poverty, preventing people from actually getting the energy to heat  their homes, drive their cars, and go to work. That is what my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle want us to borrow half a  trillion dollars to keep funding.   So please forgive me if I vote ``no'' to rack up more debt for my  kids and grandkids, to fund the tyranny over the minds and the hearts  of the American people that my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle wish to continue to fund. And no, I haven't voted for a debt  ceiling increase before. And I certainly haven't 49 times to raise the  debt from $1 trillion to $28.5 trillion, as has the majority leader.
