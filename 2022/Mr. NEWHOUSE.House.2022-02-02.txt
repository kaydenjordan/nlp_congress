 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of two  outstanding cultural leaders in Washington State.   First, I want to thank Mr. Mike LaPlant. For years Mike has been a  fierce champion of agriculture in Washington, serving as the president  of the Washington State Farm Bureau since 2011. Washington State is  home to one of the most robust and vibrant agricultural industries in  the country. With over 300 different crops and virtually every type of  livestock raised in our State, the hardworking men and women who make  the industry run face challenges as diverse as they are.   That is why it is so important that they have solid, experienced, and  servant-minded people working to raise their voices. Not only has Mike  been a strong advocate for the industry in Washington State and beyond,  but he has been a valuable partner in my work on behalf of the farmers,  ranchers, and growers in my district. He has my thanks for his years of  leadership and my best wishes for the next chapter in his life.   I also recently had the opportunity to meet with Mike's successor as  Farm Bureau president, Rosella Mosby. Rosella, like Mike, will be an  effective voice for Washington State agriculture. I look forward to a  continued partnership with the bureau under her leadership.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of all central Washingtonians, I say  congratulations to Rosella and thank you to Mike.                  Honoring the Career of Chief Ken Hohenberg     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the career of one of  my constituents, longtime chief of the Kennewick Police Department, Ken  Hohenberg, and to congratulate him on concluding 40 years of service to  his badge and to his community.   Chief Hohenberg is the city of Kennewick's longest serving employee,  having joined the force in 1978. Back then, Kennewick had just over  20,000 residents. Although the town has changed a lot over the years  and now has over 80,000 people, Chief Hohenberg's commitment to  protecting his community has never wavered. Through good times and bad,  economic downturns, and social unrest, Chief Hohenberg has spent the  last four decades putting himself in harm's way for the good of his  friends and neighbors. We owe a debt of gratitude to all men and women  who don a badge and a uniform. Chief Hohenberg stands out as a shining  example of what it means to serve and protect.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the people of central Washington, I extend  my sincere gratitude and best wishes to Chief Hohenberg. Thank you for  your service, Chief.                Honoring Congressional Award Winner Cara Elzie     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate one of my  constituents, Cara Elzie of Yakima, on earning the Congressional Award  silver medal. Cara served her community, spending over 420 hours with  the 4-H group called Youth Advocates for Health which engages with  young people to teach the importance of healthy living. Cara's efforts  helped reach over 1,500 young people in Yakima County through various  events. She committed herself to personal development, spending more  than 300 hours learning about journalism through her work as a  journalist and photographer for the Yakima Herald-Republic's Unleashed  program.   Cara also improved her musical talents by practicing the guitar and  piano for over 750 hours. She dedicated herself to personal fitness by  working on her goals for more than 450 hours, with an emphasis on yoga.  Finally, Cara completed five expeditions, traveling to new places as  far away and diverse as Boston, Scotland, London, Spain, and Italy. In  each location she learned about history and immersed herself in  different cultures.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Cara for all her hard work. I congratulate her  on this remarkable achievement and wish her the very best of luck in  her future endeavors. She truly represents the best of our region and  is a source of hope for the future.                 Honoring Congressional App Challenge Winners     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the  accomplishments of three of my young constituents: Andrew Modine, Torin  Rauch, and Tyler Iverson of the West Valley Innovation Center.   These three students won the 2021 Central Washington Congressional  App Challenge with their app, Beating Heart Health, which aims to  promote teen health and wellness by offering tools to practice and  improve mindfulness and healthy sleep habits.   On Monday, I got to see the West Valley Skills Center where Andrew,  Torin, and Tyler developed their winning app. I am very pleased to see  the work going on. Cultivating robust STEM education opportunities for  our students is critical to ensuring the United States remains a  competitive leader in the global economy. The app challenge is one way  we can foster a passion for STEM among our young people and help them  become the innovators and industry leaders of tomorrow.    Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Andrew, Torin, and Tyler on their  achievement and offer my thanks to West Valley educators for all of  their hard work.                            ____________________
