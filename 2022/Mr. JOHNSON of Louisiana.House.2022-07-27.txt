 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  and express my admiration for my friend, Mr. Gerry May. He is the man  behind the ``Hometown Patriot'' series on our locally owned ABC-TV  affiliate in Shreveport, Louisiana, KTBS.   ``Hometown Patriot'' is a program that chronicles the stories of  Louisiana's veteran community. To date, they have aired over 500  veteran stories, and many more are yet to come. These stories are  critical because they preserve our historical record, and it is a  tribute to all who have served this country so patriotically and so  favorably.   ``Hometown Patriot'' will ensure that future generations of  Louisianians will be able to better understand the service of these  heroes, and it will keep their stories alive for many years to come.   Mr. May himself has a long history of excellence in broadcast  journalism, from covering Louisiana politics to the aftermath of  Hurricane Katrina, to the Saints during their triumphant Super Bowl  win. This history of impactful journalism has even landed Mr. May in  the occasional Hollywood movie bit role.   I thank Gerry for running ``Hometown Patriot'' and making sure our  veteran community has an advocate in our local media. We can never  thank them enough.   Keep up the great work.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, for the remainder of this  Special Order we will have a number of Republican Members from around  the country who will come up and address the big issues of the day, the  continued crises, not the least of which is our economic crisis here on  the eve of the latest GDP numbers that we all anticipate will confirm  that we have a recession, even though the administration apparently  can't even define what ``recession'' is. Instead of trying to fix the  problems, they are trying to work on the definition of words.   Madam Speaker, I yield first to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Keller).    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend; that was  so well said. As we told Secretary Mayorkas in a Judiciary Committee  hearing just a few months ago, clearly what he is doing is intentional,  and I believe that he needs to dust off his resume because we are going  to have the majority soon, and there will be a reckoning for that.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany).    Madam Speaker, the news is so staggering,  and it is an incalculable amount of loss that Americans are  experiencing. I love what the gentleman said: It is not overdoses now,  it is poisoning. That is exactly right. It is the leading cause of  death of Americans aged 18 to 49.   Overdoses, these poisonings, are killing more people than cancer, car  wrecks, and COVID, all of it. What are we going to do about it?    I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin.    Absolutely. I cannot wait for us to get  control of the gavel again.   Madam Speaker, I yield next to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Rose).    Madam Speaker, that was so well said. The  gentleman is right; every single State is a border State, and I know  the good people of Tennessee are just as concerned as my friends in  Louisiana and also in the State of Georgia.   Madam Speaker, I yield next to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Allen).    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  his comments, and he is right. The energy crisis is a direct result of  policy choices. It could be reversed if Democrats would simply  acknowledge their error, but I am afraid they won't.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Grothman).    Madam Speaker, I have never seen my friend  so animated.   It is time for that because it is an existential crisis to the  country. Truly, when we asked the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  what the greatest threat to America is, they don't say China first.  They say the national debt. It is just out of control.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions).    Great words, my friend. I am so thankful  that you summarized again how ideas have consequences.   Madam Speaker, that is our concern. These are policy choices that  have led to all this pain for families and individuals in all of our  communities, and it just seems like madness to us. But our message is  hopeful because we are going to turn the corner. We are going to lead  this country in a new direction, and we are excited to relay that to  people.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Meuser).    Madam Speaker, this is a great reminder  that this is real pain for real people. This is not a game here. What  we do affects the lives of all of our constituents, all Americans, and  we have a responsibility to fix it.    Thank you for highlighting that.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the State of California  (Mr. LaMalfa), a good friend of mine.                                time  1915     Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for his  faithful efforts and being such a clarion call and a voice of reason.   One of the things that is necessary to maintain a constitutional  Republic as the Founders warned us is that you have to have an informed  and engaged electorate. I think people are paying attention now. I  think they are feeling the pain, and it is drawing awareness to our  situation. I think they are going to evaluate.   I am hopeful and optimistic, so we can turn some of this around. I  thank my friend for his efforts.   Madam Speaker, you heard a recurring theme here tonight, whether we  focus tonight on the economic crisis, the border crisis, the energy  crisis--all the many crises--the common theme is this: If you review  the facts objectively, Madam Speaker, then the evidence shows that all  of these are intentional. They are intentional. These are the  foreseeable and obvious results of the Democrats' policy choices of the  [[Page H7245]]  Biden administration and the Democrats that run both Houses of  Congress.   House Republicans, on the other hand--as all my colleagues tonight  have pointed out--are optimistic. We are so looking forward to the  upcoming August district work period so that we can take our vision for  a new direction for this country directly to the American people.   I believe that message is going to be well-received. I think people  are desperate for the answers, and we have solutions to all the great  challenges facing this country.   Madam Speaker, I thank all my colleagues, once again, for being  faithful and being here tonight for this Special Order.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
