 Mr. President, by now, we all know the pain ObamaCare  continues to inflict on our families, our communities, and our country.  Skyrocketing prices, disappearing choices, failing markets--that is the  legacy of ObamaCare. It has hurt so many already. Without reforms, it  will hurt even more Americans as it continues a year-long march toward  total collapse.   Across the aisle, there are two basic schools of thought on what to  do about this. One is essentially nothing. Two is to quadruple down on  ObamaCare with a massive expansion of a failed idea--a fully  government-run system that would strip even more Americans of their  healthcare plans and take away even more of their health decisions.   Neither of these options is acceptable.   If ObamaCare's failure has shown us anything, it is that we need new  ideas and a better approach. That is what the Senate pursued this  summer. That is what Senators Graham and Cassidy are pursuing now. I  would like to thank them for all of their dedicated work.   I would also like to thank the committees that worked so hard on this  legislation as well, including the Budget Committee under Chairman  Enzi, the HELP Committee under Chairman Alexander, and the Finance  Committee under Chairman Hatch, which just held a hearing on the bill  this afternoon.   I would like to thank each of these committees, their chairs, their  members, and their staffs for their hard work to provide the American  people with a better way than ObamaCare and its years of failure.                            ____________________     Mr. President, for more than 80 years, the NLRB has  been responsible for the impartial resolution of labor disputes and for  ensuring stable labor relations.   Under the Board majority appointed by the Obama administration,  however, the NLRB moved from fair administrator of the law to partisan  activist--one that put leftwing ideology, deep-pocketed union bosses,  and other special interest friends ahead of middle-class workers.   It pursued an ambush election rule that would weaken workers' rights.  It implemented a joint employer mandate that would disadvantage small  businesses. The list goes on, and the Obama administration pulled out  every stop to get its way on the Board as well--everything from  illegally appointing its Members to refusing to allow a Republican  vacancy to be filled for nearly 2 years.   A new majority on the NLRB can begin to undo this severe damage and  restore the Board's neutrality.   Confirming the nominee before us today, William Emanuel, is sure to  mark a turning point in the NLRB's direction. His experience in labor  law is deep, his credentials are impressive, and his confirmation will  finally allow the NLRB to return to its important work with a full  slate of Senate-confirmed Board Members--for the first time since 2015.   The National Labor Relations Board is supposed to be a neutral umpire  in labor disputes. It is time it get back to that important original  mission. Confirming Mr. Emanuel today will allow it to do just that.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 165,  S. 1519.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  September 26; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that following  leader remarks, the Senate resume consideration of the motion to  proceed to S. 1519; finally, that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m.  until 2:15 p.m. to allow for the weekly conference meetings.
