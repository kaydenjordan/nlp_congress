 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman mentioned, this bill amends the  Migratory Bird Treaty Act to establish special duck hunting days for  youth and veterans. While I generally support expanding hunting  opportunities for youth and veterans, it is important that we do it in  a way that does not detract from management decisions based on sound  science that produces the best outcomes for wildlife populations.   This year marked the 100th anniversary of the Migratory Bird Treaty  Act, a law which codified our Nation's commitment to honor  international treaties that protect migratory bird populations. It is  important to remember that prior to its passage, birds like the snowy  egret and wood duck were plummeting towards extinction due to market  hunting and unregulated commercial trade in bird feathers.   Thanks to the protections afforded by the MBTA, these birds and many  others have recovered from the brink of extinction, while maintaining  opportunities for hunters to participate in waterfowl hunting through  science-based management and population assessments.   Congress has an obligation to ensure that the Secretary of the  Interior retains the authority to determine when hunting of migratory  game birds can take place in the United States. While the flyway  councils play a critical role in developing regulations, establishing  the framework for migratory bird management is a Federal responsibility  that should be done in consultation with flyway councils.   I do want to thank Chairman Bishop for working with our staff to make  modest changes to the bill to address some of our concerns. We hope to  continue working with our colleagues in the Senate to make further  refinements and ensure that this bill does not move us forward in a way  that departs from sound, science-based management.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I agree with my colleague. This is a good bill. We are  pleased that it facilitates the implementation of the Multiple Species  Habitat Conservation plan for the Lower Virgin River. It authorizes  funds for fuels reduction and restoration projects in pinyon-juniper- dominated landscapes, makes technical corrections to the boundaries of  several wilderness areas and validates a patent associated with a  previously authorized land exchange.   A previous version of this bill is cosponsored by the entire Nevada  delegation, and I recognize that its passage is important to the people  of eastern Nevada. I do want to thank the majority and the sponsor for  working with the BLM to address many of their concerns throughout the  bill's history. Resolving those concerns and working with the BLM  turned this bill into a proposal we can support.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this is a bill that is strongly bipartisan. It reaffirms  congressional intent to continue to authorize sustainable, working  dairies and ranches within a portion of the Point Reyes National  Seashore. This is consistent with the seashore's historic, cultural,  scenic, and natural values.   It also honors repeated Federal promises that the ranches and dairies  in the Point Reyes National Seashore would be offered long-term permits  so that they can have the certainty and the clarity they need to obtain  financing, make family succession plans, and other decisions necessary  to continue operations.   For over 150 years, agriculture has been a vital part of the fabric  of West Marin, part of my district in northern California. This  includes the historic ranches and dairies in the Point Reyes National  Seashore and also some northern portions of the Golden Gate National  Recreation Area. These ranches and dairies contribute to the unique  history, character, and cultural heritage of these magnificent national  park units.   The statutory history of Point Reyes reflects Congress' intent to  continue ranching in the pastoral areas of the seashore to ensure that  future generations could experience these working landscapes. We are  reaffirming that intent with this bill.   I think the agricultural heritage of West Marin is worth protecting.  The National Park Service agrees. Across Presidential administrations  and since the creation of the seashore and the GGNRA, the Park Service  has consistently supported continuation of the ranching heritage in  these areas. Today, Congress is reaffirming longstanding policy and  decades of diligent efforts by the Park Service.   We are also making good on a commitment Interior Secretary Salazar  made in November of 2012 to provide long-term assurances for these  ranchers and dairies. He specifically directed the Park Service to  proceed with extending 20-year permits consistent with applicable laws  and planning processes.                                time  2100    Toward that same end, this bill directs the issuance of 20-year  leases and permits after completion by the Park Service of a robust  general management plan update process, including public engagement and  environmental review under the National Environmental Policy Act, which  must include compliance with the Endangered Species Act and any other  environmental reviews.   Through this planning and environmental review process, the Park  Service will receive public comment, evaluate possible measures that  could improve the environmental sustainability of the ranches and  dairies, and ensure the good stewardship of the seashore's national  resources.   The general management plan and the NEPA process will inform how the  Park Service exercises its broad discretionary authority to set terms  and conditions in the leases and the permits, and can develop critical  strategies, actions, and policies on a wide range of issues involving  land and natural resource management within the seashore.   As any visitor to Point Reyes knows, one of the unique features of  the seashore is the successful return of the majestic tule elk. This  legislation envisions a healthy coexistence of thriving elk herds and  the historic ranches and dairies within the seashore through effective  management.   It provides direction to the Park Service to manage for effective  separation between tule elk and livestock in areas where growing elk  herds have  [[Page H8858]]  presented conflicts with working ranches and dairies, such as taking up  permanent residence on dairies' critical organic pastureland,  interfering with ranch operations, or damaging infrastructure, hardly  the outcomes envisioned by the Park Service's 1998 elk management plan.   While providing this general policy guidance, the bill leaves broad  discretion to the Park Service to determine how best to manage the elk.  It leaves in place all existing tools, while adding a new opportunity  to explore relocation and cultural ceremonial activities with  interested Native American Tribes.   I am grateful for the broad public support that this bill has  received, ranging from the Marin Conservation League to the Marin  County Farm Bureau and the Marin County Board of Supervisors.   I also want to address, briefly, some misconceptions that a few of  the bill's critics have raised.   First, nothing in this bill elevates ranching above other uses of the  seashore. It specifically does not amend the purpose section of the  enabling act, which means that operations of the ranches and dairies  will remain consistent with the policies and legal requirements that  govern the Interior Department's stewardship of the land.   It is important to remember that less than one-third of the seashore  is in agricultural use today. Nearly twice that amount is designated as  wilderness. Nothing in this bill expands agriculture. It is limited to  the areas where there is currently ranching or dairy operations.   I also want to address and emphasize the fact that nothing in this  bill suggests elimination of elk from the seashore. I am not aware of a  single stakeholder who has suggested eliminating elk. If they had, I  would reject it. There is no reason elk and ranching cannot coexist on  the seashore if there is effective management and separation in areas  of conflict. This bill leaves broad discretion to the Park Service to  determine the strategies and actions that make the most sense to  achieve that goal.   For those worried that this bill may somehow reopen the 2012 decision  by Interior Secretary Ken Salazar to not renew for Drakes Bay Oyster  Company and to designate and manage Drakes Estero as marine wilderness,  let me be emphatically clear. There is nothing in the letter or the  intent of this bill that possibly could be read to do that. The bill  has nothing to do with the oyster issue. It focuses on making sure the  unresolved part of Secretary Salazar's 2012 decision, the part  providing long-term assurances for the historic ranches and dairies, is  actually carried out.   In this regard, I was mindful in drafting the bill of Secretary  Salazar's specific direction in his memo of November 29, 2012, that the  Park Service work with the ranches and dairies to ``reaffirm my  intention that, consistent with applicable laws and planning processes,  recognition of the role of ranching be maintained and to pursue  extending permits to 20-year terms. . . .''   Secretary Salazar also directed that ``the values of  multigenerational ranching and farming at Point Reyes should be fully  considered in future planning efforts. These working ranches are a  vibrant and compatible part of Point Reyes National Seashore and both  now and in the future represent an important contribution to Point  Reyes' superlative natural and cultural resources.'' I couldn't agree  more.   Finally, we have been careful in this bill not to micromanage or tie  the hands of the Park Service. As we made clear in amendments at markup  and in the committee report, the Service retains the ability to  exercise commonsense discretion in the supervision of the seashore's  agriculture property and in administering its various permits and  leases.   For example, the Park Service is not financially responsible for  operating ranches and dairies. It is not required to bring back  property into agriculture if it has been retired or converted to other  purposes. It doesn't have to allow ranching on agricultural property  where there is no willing lessee.   Nothing in this bill diminishes any of the Secretary's existing  discretionary authority regarding how to manage agricultural property,  including setting and enforcing permit terms and conditions and  allowing shorter lease or permit terms if a rancher does not want a 20- year lease or permit. All of this is common sense.   In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6687 is a narrowly tailored bill to  help ensure that sustainable ranches and dairies continue as part of  the fabric of our spectacular Point Reyes National Seashore for  generations to come. The bill does this without compromising any  environmental standards. It is consistent with both longstanding  congressional intent, with Secretary Salazar's 2012 policy directive,  and with the current National Park Service planning process.    I am proud that this bill has been a refreshing bipartisan effort  here in Congress, and I do want to thank my colleagues on the Natural  Resources Committee for their support and assistance, especially  Chairman Rob Bishop and his staff, as well as Ranking Member Raul  Grijalva and his staff, who have worked diligently to perfect this  legislation and to move it forward.   I also want to thank my staff, especially my district director, Jenny  Callaway, as well as Logan Ferree and Christine Sur from my legislative  team, for their hard work to make this bill possible.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I agree with the gentleman's description of this very  good bill.   These two sites draw nearly 200,000 visitors to the Dutchess County  region. They are significant contributors to the local economy. It is  only fitting that we should work to improve the integration between  these two sites and enhance their management and increase their  accessibility to the public.   I know Representative Faso has worked hard on this bill and that it  is a priority for his office. I want to commend him for working across  the aisle, including with Senator Gillibrand's support, and I  congratulate him on this success today.   Before wrapping up, I do want to mention that the money to carry out  the expansion proposed in this bill will likely come from the Land and  Water Conservation Fund, a popular program that expires at the end of  this week. That is right. After more than 50 years of bipartisan  support, LWCF is once again on the brink of expiring. This is despite  the fact that a bill to make the program permanent has earned the  support of 235 Members of the House. The bill was voted out of the  committee by voice, and all this body must do is bring it up on the  floor for a vote.   I am always happy to support legislation that protects our public  lands and cultural legacies, like this bill by Mr. Faso. I urge  immediate action, however, on the other step we need to take, and that  is bringing forward the bill to address the pending expiration of the  LWCF.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is correct; this decision created a lot of confusion  and frustration. Staff needs at national parks fluctuate throughout the  year. They are highly seasonally dependent, and many career personnel  work at different parks through the year, a lifestyle that is supported  by the ability to return to a position every year without having to  recompete for it. Without that certainty, they lose job security, and  it becomes extremely difficult to ensure adequate experienced staff  throughout the National Park system.   I agree with my colleague. I want to thank Representatives Knight and  Panetta for coming up with this bipartisan solution.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support its adoption, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating), my colleague and champion  of the Cape Cod National Seashore.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
