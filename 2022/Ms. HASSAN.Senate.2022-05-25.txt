 Mr. President, I rise today to thank and pay  tribute to the service of Derry Police Chief Edward Garone.   For more than 50 years, Chief Garone has served with dedication and  has worked to keep the people of Derry and people throughout the  Granite State safe.   Throughout it all, Chief Garone has worked tirelessly to ensure  public safety--the most fundamental task of any government--creating  the stability necessary for our people, families, and economy, to  thrive.   After bravely serving our country in the Marines, Chief Garone began  his  [[Page S2705]]  career as a police officer in 1964 and eventually became captain. In  1972, he and his family moved to Derry, where he took on the role as  police chief, a position that he has remained in for more than four  decades, becoming one of the longest serving full-time police chiefs in  the United States.   Chief Garone quickly became a valued member of the Derry community,  even being named Derry's Citizen of the Year in 1984. And in addition  to his work in uniform, he worked to improve Derry in a variety of  ways, including as Rotarian and by volunteering with the Boys and Girls  Club of Greater Derry.   Above all, the chief has said that he has appreciated his many years  in Derry because he enjoys helping people. And people across New  Hampshire are indeed grateful for his commitment to service.   Chief Garone represents the very best of New Hampshire's law  enforcement; he has lived his life in service to our country, and I  have appreciated our work together. I join the people of Derry in  thanking him, as well as his family, for all that they have done on  behalf of the Granite State.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am honored to recognize Mike  Manning of Penacook as May's Granite Stater of the Month. After a  chance stop-by at the Open Door Community Kitchen, Mike Manning stepped  up to volunteer and now even comanages the kitchen, which provides free  meals to help individuals in need in the community.   When Mike saw a ``Free Meals'' sign outside the United Church of  Penacook in 2015 and decided to venture in, he had no idea how much  that decision would impact his life. Mike connected with the chair of  Open Door Community Kitchen and learned about their mission of serving  meals to communities in and around Penacook. Later that year, Mike  became the kitchen's cochair, organizing volunteer shifts, food orders,  and donations.   In his first years as cochair, Mike made sure that Open Door  Community Kitchen provided three free sit-down meals a week, with extra  food for people to bring home and last them the following days.  Mealtimes provided a sense of camaraderie and togetherness among  volunteers and attendees alike.   Yet when the COVID-19 pandemic began, Open Door Community Kitchen was  hard hit. Many of the volunteers were older and started to stay home at  the onset of the pandemic because of the risk to their health. With  limited capacity, the kitchen had to reduce its three free meals per  week to two. In addition, the dining hall space had to close, and Open  Door transitioned to making to-go meals.   Nevertheless, Mike put every effort into making sure that Open Door  Community Kitchen was able to keep running during the entire pandemic,  never missing a week. Even with a skeleton staff and rising food  prices, Mike has worked around the clock to continue serving meals. And  now, he is working to restart Open Door's in-person meals, which  provide an important sense of community.   Mike's efforts to serve his neighbors during a time of need and under  unprecedented challenges are commendable. As Mike himself says, if  everyone could just help each other, the world would be a much better  place. His actions exemplify the best of the Granite State spirit of  working together to support each other, no matter the obstacles, and we  are lucky to have him in our midst.                            ____________________
