 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, I rise today to recount the life of a  colleague who recently passed away, Senator Kay Hagan from the State of  North Carolina. I wish I didn't have to stand here to talk about her in  the past tense. So many people who have served in the Senate with Kay  Hagan, so many staff people across the Senate--and, in the context of  both Members and staff, I would say both parties--recall serving with  her fondly and also were very saddened by her passing.   It is very difficult to encapsulate someone's personality or their  life in a few short remarks, but you could not have met Kay Hagan even  for a short period of time or worked with her even for a short period  of time without being captivated by her spirit, her energy, and her  optimism, not only about her life but about work. You could also be  captivated by her ability to connect with people and to demonstrate the  kind of uncommon decency that we don't see enough of in politics and  even public service. We are going to miss that energy, that optimism,  and that decency. We are also going to miss her commitment to public  service, even when she was not an elected public official.   My remarks today will not in any way encapsulate her whole life or  her life of service, but I will try to provide some reflections.   One thing you knew about Kay Hagan when she got to the Senate was  that she was very clear about the people she represented in the State  from which she came. If you were in a short conversation with her or a  long conversation--even a 30-second conversation--you were likely to  hear the two words, ``North Carolina,'' if not once in a short  conversation, several times.   She was so proud of her State and so proud of the opportunities she  had to represent the people of North Carolina. She, of course,  understood her work and was faithful to the basic obligation to  represent the Nation as well. She was fiercely loyal to and always  concerned about the people of North Carolina.   She was a fierce advocate for working people in North Carolina and  around the country. She also happened to serve at a time when the  Senate was considering and then, ultimately, took a vote on the Patient  Protection and Affordable Care Act. At that time, it was a long debate  and a lot of contention, obviously, and there still is on healthcare.  But Kay Hagan was very clear about where she stood.   We happened to serve as members of the Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions Committee, known by the acronym HELP--one of the two  committees in the Senate that considered healthcare. Both the HELP  Committee and the Finance Committee had fierce debate about and then,  ultimately, votes on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.   Here is what Senator Kay Hagan said when the HELP Committee approved  similar or, I should say, related legislation, which at that time was  called the Affordable Health Choices Act. That was the original  healthcare bill that went through that committee, the HELP Committee.  It ultimately changed when it was considered by the Finance Committee  and then by the whole Senate, and the changes were made in negotiation  and deliberation with the House.   But here is what she said. I guess this would have been sometime in  2009. She talked about this one particular healthcare bill as it stood  at that moment. She said:         Our bill also ensures that a pre-existing condition will       not prevent you from getting coverage. This compromise       package focuses on prevention and wellness, which will keep       our nation healthier and save taxpayers' money in the long       run. I will continue working with my colleagues to get reform       legislation to the President that stabilizes costs, expands       coverage and improves the quality of care for all Americans.    That is what Senator Kay Hagan said at the time. Of course, we are  still wrestling with a lot of those issues. She was predicting, in a  sense, some of our future debates.   Kay Hagan wanted to get things done for the people she represented  and really for the American people. One of the areas where she  demonstrated that commitment to leadership and that commitment to  getting things done was in the area of children's issues. In that same  committee, the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, she  was the chair of the Subcommittee on Children and Families. Later, I  was able to follow in her footsteps.   That was so emblematic of Kay Hagan's service not to be concerned  just about what is right in front of us--the issue of the day or the  issue of the moment, as important as those issues are--but always  thinking about what comes next, always focusing on the future, thinking  about the future, and not just in a compassionate way, as it relates to  children, but in a very strategic way. Kay Hagan knew that investing in  our children was essential for building the economy of the future and  having the kind of country we say we want to have.   So Kay Hagan was ahead of her time in that regard, focusing on  America's future, which meant focusing on America's children--whether  it was financial literacy and the curriculum for middle and high school  students or whether it was from her earliest days in the Senate--to  improve the lives of children in any way that she could.   When I think about Kay Hagan, I think of not just a Senator, not just  a colleague and a friend, but a public servant, someone who cared very  deeply about service. I have often quoted the inscription on a building  in which I worked in the State capital of Pennsylvania--Harrisburg. It  is called the Finance Building, and I served in that building for 10  years and worked in that building for 10 years. The inscription on that  building about public service is very simple. It says: ``All public  service is a trust given in faith and accepted in honor.'' That is what  it says in that inscription. It is a great summation of what public  service must be about and what an election must be about, that public  service is a trust that is given to one person, given to a group of  people, and that trust must be honored by the service that you render.    Here is another way of saying it by a predecessor of Kay Hagan, in a  sense, because she was a Member of the Senate and, at the time, a real  pioneer for women in the Senate. Margaret Chase Smith once said:         Public service must be more than doing a job efficiently       and honestly. It must be a complete dedication to the people       and to the nation.    That is what Senator Margaret Chase Smith once said, and I think Kay  Hagan's service was totally consistent with that sentiment, that public  service is more than just doing a job honestly and efficiently, as  Senator Smith said at the time. It must be a complete dedication to the  people in the Nation. Kay Hagan demonstrated that in her life and in  her work.   I have joined so many Members of the Senate in expressing condolence  and also commendation for the good work that she did. I express  condolence, of course, to her family. I speak on behalf of my wife  Terese and many people here in the Senate who served with Kay to offer  condolence to Kay's husband Chip and to her three children--Jeanette,  Tilden, and Carrie--and Kay's five grandchildren. We are thinking of  them today and all these days since her passing, and we pray that she  will rest in peace. I express again how much we will miss Kay Hagan not  only in the Senate but also because of the person she was. God bless  you, Kay.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
