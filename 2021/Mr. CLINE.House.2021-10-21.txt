 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 50th  anniversary of Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia.   Originally founded by Dr. Jerry Falwell, Sr. as Lynchburg Baptist  College in 1971, its first classes were held that September for its 154  students.   Over the years, the college has grown and transformed in many ways,  but has always remained a Christian academic community practicing the  traditions of evangelical institutions of higher education.   The school was renamed Liberty Baptist College in 1975 and became  Liberty University in 1985.   Now, Liberty University is one of the largest private nonprofit  universities in the Nation and the largest university in Virginia,  boasting more than 95,000 total undergraduate and postgraduate  students, both in person and online.  [[Page H5733]]    As of 2021, Liberty has more than 250,000 alumni making an impact in  their respective fields and in their communities.   I congratulate Liberty University and president Jerry Prevo on this  milestone and wish the institution another 50 years of success in  fulfilling its mission to develop Christ-centered men and women and  instill in them the values, knowledge, and skills needed to impact the  world.                            ____________________
