 Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   This is a very important bill that I am asking the Members of  Congress to vote ``no'' on because we don't want to empower the  megabanks and huge conglomerates to be able to skirt adverse  supervisory decisions about regulators.   The bill would give all financial institutions, regardless of their  size, an additional method to appeal, thereby significantly delaying  adverse determinations by creating a new independent review office to  conduct de novo reviews without concern for the institution's safety  and soundness or the protection of consumers.   This bill goes far beyond relief for community banks and credit  unions by enabling megabanks and nonbanks, like payday lenders and  Equifax, to pursue limitless challenges to the agency's actions in  court.   If you take a look at the examples that we have prepared for you,  take a look at Wells Fargo. Wells Fargo has been at the center of  attention in this country for the fraudulent accounts that it  established using their customers' accounts and information to create  more accounts without informing their customers; and then they had the  illegal student loan servicing practices that we have all been so  concerned about; and even after the fraudulent accounts were exposed  and a fine was made because of the harm that they had caused to their  customers, we then found that they had inappropriate force-placed  insurance, which means that people who were already paying for their  insurance were forced to pay again because the bank basically forced  them to have additional insurance.   And then there is J.P. Morgan with illegal credit card practices and  discriminatory lending, sale of bad credit card debt, and illegal robo- signing.   And Citi with deficient mortgage servicing and foreclosure processing  practices; inappropriate fees, marketing, billing, administration of  add-on products; and foreclosure abuses.   Bank of America, also mortgage abuses, deficient mortgage servicing  and foreclosure processing practices, credit monitoring abuses,  deceptive marketing for add-on products, violations of the  Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.   Now, we find that these banks have determined--they act in ways that  we know that fighting is just the cost of doing business. It is a slap  on the wrist. And they are going to continue to be able to get away  with this. And if they are saying that the bank examiners who come in  and find these adverse conditions somehow will be ignored and they can  literally get around them, then we are going to add to the problems of  our consumers in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I am certainly asking for a ``no'' vote on this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I always have these lively debates with my chairman, and  he never fails to point out that I voted for the bailout. And, of  course, oftentimes when he comes with one of these deregulation bills,  he talks about bipartisan and how he had Democrats. Well, I want you to  know the bailout was a bipartisan thing. It was appointed by both  Democrats and Republicans at a time when we were in great difficulty in  this country.   It was the Bush bailout, and it was Mr. Paulson, appointed by Mr.  Bush, who was the Secretary who led it and gave us the advice and had  us participate in saving our economy based on the information that he  had uncovered about the risk that was now proposed for our country.   So I am not for bailing out big banks at all. We had an emergency  situation in this country where, again, it was the Bush bailout that we  had to deal with the fact that we were in great danger. But let me just  also say this: we have something now that we put into Dodd-Frank reform  called the Orderly Liquidation Authority scenario that we are able to  look at banks, and, because of the stress testing that they have gone  through, if there is a need for an orderly resolution because there are  problems with the bank, we cannot only recommend breaking off parts of  the bank, but reordering parts of the bank and doing what is necessary  to ensure that the bank does not get into a situation where it fails  and triggers the failures of others in our economy.    So it is the Orderly Liquidation Authority that I am referring to,  and I do not support bailing out big banks. This is one thing that I  join with my chairman on. We both agree that we should not be bailing  out these big banks. And, of course, that is what Dodd-Frank is helping  us to avoid.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the offer from my good friend to join him,  but I don't think I will be doing that today.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record organizations that have sent us  information in opposition to this bill. It includes the National  Consumer Law Center, AFSCME, the Center for American Progress, and  Americans for Financial Reform.                                   National Consumer Law Center,                                      Washington, DC, March 8, 2017.      Re Oppose S. Amdt. 2140 (Moran), HR 4545, The Financial           Institutions Examination Fairness Act; creates roadblocks           to bank supervision for safety and soundness, consumer           protection.       Senator,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        On behalf of our low income clients, I urge you to oppose       Senate Amendment 2140 to S. 2155, which incorporates HR 4545       (Tipton), The Financial Institutions Examination Fairness       Act. The bill would create unprecedented barriers to       effective prudential and consumer protection supervision of       banks, allowing banks to resist corrective actions to address       law violations or safety and soundness risks, bogging down       agencies with frivolous appeals.        HR 4545 would grant regulated banks the right to appeal any       supervisory determination made by any prudential banking       agency or by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)       to a new ``Office of Independent Examination Review''       established in the Federal Financial Institutions       Examinations Council (FFIEC). Upon appeal by a supervised       bank, this new office would be required to undertake a       repetitive de novo review of the agency's supervisory       decision. No deference to the initial examination findings or       the agency's judgment would be required in this review.        This new process is duplicative to appeals processes and       ombudsmen already present. The CFPB, FDIC, OCC, Federal       Reserve, and National Credit Union Administration each       already have an agency ombudsman and an intra-agency formal       review and appeals process. In addition, banks may bring a       court challenge to any formal regulatory enforcement action.        HR 4545 would enormously increase the ability of banks to       resist supervisory decisions. This effect would be most       pronounced at the largest banks, who could appeal dozens or       hundreds of material findings from every examination,       creating enormous roadblocks to supervision. The bank       supervision process has been the first line of regulatory       defense against threats to bank safety and soundness for a       century or more. HR 4545 creates unprecedented roadblocks to       the effectiveness of bank supervisory determinations and       could be devastating to effective regulatory oversight in       areas ranging from basic  [[Page H1631]]       prudential oversight to key consumer protections that make       our financial markets fairer.        I urge you to oppose HR 4545 and any amendment that       incorporates the bill.            Yours very truly,                                                Lauren K. Saunders,      Associate Director.                                   ____                                                           AFSCME,                                     Washington, DC, March 13, 2018.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 1.6 million members       of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal       Employees (AFSCME), I urge you to oppose the Financial       Institutions Examination Fairness and Reform Act (H.R. 4545),       which would undermine the federal government's enforcement of       bank regulations and related systemic risk protections by       granting every bank--of any size--a new right to appeal and       postpone existing banking regulators' adverse supervisory       determinations. Now is not the time to undermine these       protections.        AFSCME strongly opposes H.R. 4545 because it would       undermine bank regulators' existing authority and related       systemic safeguards that protect our economy from risky       practices of banks. This would impose added costs and risks       on working families and consumers. Specifically, H.R. 4545       would grant regulated banks the right to appeal a prudential       banking agency's material supervisory determination. H.R.       4545 installs the new appeals process in a not yet created       Office of Independent Examination Review (OIER) located       within the Federal Financial Institutions Examinations       Council (FFIEC) and would require OIER to initiate a de novo       review of the appealed supervisory decision with zero       deference to the regulators' prior pre-appeal review,       findings, or determinations. By creating a de novo appeals       process, H.R. 4545 further incentivizes banks to challenge       every supervisory decision and allows banks to more easily       circumvent and delay penalties. Furthermore, H.R. 4545 also       would grant these appeal rights to any nonbank under       supervisory authority of the Consumer Financial Protection       Bureau (CFPB) and require OIER de novo review.        Unlike the current process with existing prudential       regulators, OIER would not be responsible for our banking       system's safety and soundness, and thus OIER's decision-      making would be narrower in purpose and thereby increase risk       to America's economy. We do not need H.R. 4545's appeals       process because a formal review and appeals process along       with ombudsmen already exist at affected banking agencies,       such as CFPB, FDIC, the Federal Reserve, National Credit       Union Administration, and OCC. Furthermore, banks already can       bring a court challenge to any formal regulatory enforcement       action.        H.R. 4545's scope is huge and not merely limited to small,       community depository banks. At committee mark-up, an       amendment to narrow H.R. 4545's scope to community financial       institutions below $10 billion in assets was rejected       clarifying the intent that H.R. 4545 would benefit enormous       banks, including Wells Fargo. The tax bill enacted just       months ago in December 2017 grants many of these same large       banks tens of billions of dollars in new tax breaks.       Moreover, many are already earning record profits.        We are nearing the 10th anniversary of the 2008 financial       crisis, which triggered U.S. and global recessions, America's       multiyear underwater mortgage crises, and bankruptcies for       many companies that nearly sank the U.S. economy. The       subsequent Dodd-Frank financial reform protections added       essential safeguards that stabilized our economy. We should       not weaken these protections. Rather than rolling back Dodd-      Frank protections, we should improve protections for working       families from the abuses of large banks like Wells Fargo, and       take steps to penalize large data companies like Equifax for       breaches of its consumer data.        AFSCME opposes this harmful risky bill because it increases       the likelihood that banks, both large and small, will       continue harming working families and consumers and trigger       new systemic economic problems. AFSCME urges you to vote       against H.R. 4545.            Sincerely,                                                        Scott Frey,      Director of Federal Government Affairs.                                   ____                                     Center for American Progress,                                     Washington, DC, March 12, 2018.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: The Center for       American Progress (``CAP'') is writing today to express       opposition to the following bills impacting the regulation of       financial institutions: H.R. 4293, the Stress Test       Improvement Act of 2017; H.R. 4545, the Financial       Institutions Examination Fairness and Reform Act; H.R. 4566,       the Alleviating Stress Test Burdens to Help Investors Act;       H.R. 1116, the TAILOR Act of 2017; and H.R. 4061, the       Financial Stability Oversight Council Improvement Act of       2017. These bills may be considered on the floor of the House       of Representatives in the near-term, so we welcome the chance       to share our concerns regarding this series of bills with you       and your  Mr. Speaker, let me just read one of  the paragraphs from the Center for American Progress that I think is so  profound.   ``The Financial Institutions Examination Fairness and Reform Act,  would give financial institutions the authority to appeal any material  examination decision rendered by the Federal banking regulators or  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, CFPB, to the Office of  Independent Examination Review--a new office created by the bill.  Financial regulators already have internal appeals processes in place  through their respective ombudsman offices and financial institutions  can pursue legal remedy for flawed examination decisions through the  judicial system.   ``This new office and review process is simply an additional hurdle  for regulators to contend with when supervising financial institutions  and an additional point at which institutions can slow down or avoid  punishments. H.R. 4545 would undermine the examinations process at a  time when supervisory authority and penalties for financial sector  malfeasance should be strengthened.''   In addition to that, there is another paragraph in the letter from  Americans for Financial Reform that I think is extremely important in  explaining why this bill should be opposed.   It says: ``By layering an entirely new appeals process on top of  existing processes, this bill would greatly increase the ability of  banks to resist supervisory oversight and ignore or delay changes  called for by supervisors. The impact would be most pronounced at the  largest banks, which can receive dozens or hundreds of material  findings from every examination. The ability to appeal every one of  those material supervisory findings, or just to threaten to appeal  them, would create an enormous new barrier to effective supervision of  big banks.''   In essence, Mr. Speaker, what we are saying is, we have our bank  examiners who are going in and looking for ways to strengthen the banks  and hoping that they will not find these adverse conditions, but, if  they do, they have a responsibility to the consumers to try and get  them corrected or to try and get changes made.                                time  1400    This bill says, despite adverse conditions that are discovered, we  don't want to have to comply; we don't want to have to change; we don't  want to have to correct. We want to fight you. We want to use our vast  resources to say your examiners didn't know what they were doing.   They are not so much concerned about the consumers; rather, they are  more concerned about just being a part of the bureaucracy.   It doesn't make good sense what they are saying about the examiners  and why they are not important.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how  much time I have left.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4545 is yet another harmful bill that would help  out Wall Street and predatory lenders. It has become a theme for the  majority to claim that their legislation is meant to provide relief for  small community banks, when, in fact, the legislation plainly benefits  the Nation's largest banks, including abusive megabanks like Wells  Fargo and even payday lenders. This bill is yet another example.   The bill would allow any bank as well as any nonbank supervised by  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to appeal negative supervisory  determinations made by regulators in the examination process.   H.R. 4545 makes it more likely that bad actors, including predatory  megabanks like Wells Fargo, would avoid or delay accountability when  they break Federal law. It takes our system of financial regulation in  exactly the wrong direction.   Megabanks like Wells Fargo already treat the fines they are required  to pay for violations of the law as simply the cost of doing business.  They don't need more escape routes to avoid accountability for their  wrongdoing.   I have made it clear many times that abusive megabanks with egregious  patterns of harming consumers should face steep penalties from  regulators. Last year I introduced H.R. 3937, the Megabank  Accountability and Consequences Act, which would require the Federal  prudential banking regulators to fully utilize existing authorities,  such as the ability to shut down a megabank and ban culpable executives  and directors from working in the banking industry.   To get tough on megabanks that repeatedly engage in practices that  harm consumers, Congress should be focused on measures that strengthen  consumer protections, provide tailored, responsible relief for  community banks, and ensure that abusive megabanks are held  accountable. This bill, which would help megabanks and predatory  lenders get off the hook when they break the law, should be rejected.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at  the desk made in order under the rule.    Mr. Speaker, my amendment is fairly  straightforward. It would limit the applicability of the exam reforms  under H.R. 4545 to only depository institutions with assets less than  $10 billion.   I have only heard about community banks and credit unions with  respect to concerns regarding their exam process and the ability to  enhance the opportunity to appeal exam findings. As Ms. Maloney made  clear, when the committee marked up this bill, the sole purpose of the  bill was to help community banks and credit unions, so my amendment  seeks to narrow the scope of the bill's relief to these small firms.   Congress used a similar $10 billion asset threshold in Dodd-Frank to  exempt small banks and credit unions from the Consumer Bureau's  supervision, so applying a similar threshold for the purpose of  appealing bank supervisory findings makes sense.   Today, 98 percent of all banks and 99.8 percent of all credit unions  have less than $10 billion in assets. While I am in favor of sensible  relief for smaller financial institutions, I believe that the 2007-2009  financial crisis showed the dangers of weak oversight of these big  banks, including a $30 billion bank like IndyMac. The bank's costly  failure was the fourth largest in the history of the United States and  contributed to the most damaging financial crisis in generations.   As the largest firms pose the greatest risk to the country's economy  and the safety and soundness of our financial system, it is only  prudent to apply a stringent supervisory approach for the largest  institutions. In fact, the GAO issued a report last year criticizing  the  [[Page H1634]]  Federal Reserve's large bank supervision program, underscoring there is  more work that must be done.   I have been pushing bank regulators to deploy the full suite of their  enforcement tools against megabanks like Wells Fargo that repeatedly  and carelessly break the law and harm millions of consumers. That is  why I introduced, again, H.R. 3937, the Megabank Accountability and  Consequences Act.   So, no, I do not think it is appropriate to let megabanks like Wells  Fargo hijack what should be regulatory relief for community banks so  that they can challenge their exams. Nonbanks regulated by the Consumer  Bureau, like Equifax or payday lenders, do not need this kind of  regulatory relief either.   My amendment narrows the scope of the bill on what should garner  broad bipartisan support: sensible relief for the community banks and  credit unions that need it.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge my colleagues who truly want to help  community banks and credit unions rather than Wall Street megabanks to  support my amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4263, the so-called Regulation A+ Improvement Act,  is a solution in search of a problem that threatens to undermine  protections for mom-and-pop investors and the integrity of our capital  markets. The bill would arbitrarily and prematurely increase the  maximum amount of securities that private companies can sell each year  to the public from $50 million to $75 million under the Securities and  Exchange Commission's Regulation A+ exemption from registration.   Mr. Speaker, such a change makes no sense. First, the SEC only  recently implemented Regulation A+ pursuant to the Jumpstart Our  Business Startups, the JOBS Act. Effective June 19, 2015, that rule now  allows private companies to raise either $20 million under Tier 1 or  $50 million under Tier 2 from the public with less investor protections  and oversight than a public securities offering registered with the  SEC.   What little data we have since it became effective suggests that  there is no need to raise that $50 million limit. As of December 31,  2017, only 39 percent of the 172 companies using Tier 2 of Regulation  A+ sought the maximum amount of $50 million; and only three issuers, or  5 percent, of the 61 issuers that have reported proceeds in Tier 2  offerings actually raised the maximum amount.   Second, in the JOBS Act, Congress specifically directed the SEC to  review the Regulation A+ limit every 2 years and report its reasons for  not raising it to Congress. On April 5, 2016, the SEC sent Congress its  report, stating: ``Given the short period of time that the final rules  have been in effect and in light of the limited number of Regulation A+  offerings qualified and completed to date, the Commission does not  believe that the information currently reported by companies on the  amount of capital raised pursuant to Regulation A+ is sufficient to  determine whether it would be appropriate to propose an increase in the  Tier 2 $50 million offering limit.''   If my Republican colleagues think that the SEC should be doing more,  they only have to wait a few more weeks for the SEC's next review and  report on the Regulation A+ offering limit. There is no reason why  Congress shouldn't acknowledge the SEC's existing efforts to study the  empirical evidence instead of making arbitrary decisions devoid of any  real analysis.   Finally, and most importantly, the bill may harm retail investors and  our markets. What my Republican colleagues fail to acknowledge is that  the purpose of Regulation A+ is to provide small private businesses  with access to financing from mom-and-pop investors, many of whom are  in their community, so that they can grow and eventually enter the  public markets as full SEC reporting companies traded on a national  securities exchange.   As public companies, they are subject to the full set of investor  protections under the securities laws, but also gain access to much  deeper sources of capital. Indeed, under the current system, eight  Regulation A+ issuers have already listed their shares on an exchange,  becoming true public companies. This positive development suggests that  Regulation A+ is working as Congress intended, and expanding it could  discourage companies from becoming truly public.   However, it is also clear that additional study of the existing  Regulation A+ exemption is warranted. A series of recent press articles  highlight the high risk of loss that investors face in investing in  companies that have used Regulation A+ even when those companies later  list their securities for trading on an exchange.   According to a February 2018 article in The Wall Street Journal,  seven out of the eight companies that listed their securities for  trading on an exchange in 2017 following a Regulation A+ offering are  trading an average of 42 percent below their offering prices. By  comparison, companies that engaged in a traditional initial public  offering, or an IPO, in 2017 are trading an average of 22 percent above  their offering prices. Moreover, those Regulation A+ companies were  trading lower, even as the S&P 500, which tracks 500 large publicly  traded companies, has risen 18 percent since the start of 2017.   Congress should better understand why Regulation A+ companies that  have gone public fared so poorly compared to the rest of the market  before  [[Page H1636]]  we go ahead and expand Regulation A+ through legislation like H.R.  4263.   Now, Mr. Speaker, I joined with my friends on the opposite side of  the aisle, and Mr. McHenry in particular, and supported the JOBS Act,  and of course I had some questions about the risk that would be  involved with our mom-and-pop investors. I wasn't sure, but I decided  to support the JOBS Act and Mr. McHenry even with my concerns because I  certainly wanted the opportunity for these small businesses to have  access to capital that perhaps they would not be able to get otherwise.                                time  1430    Along with that bill, we talked about the review that would be done  to determine whether or not we should be increasing, particularly, Tier  2, that would expand the ability for the small businesses to have  access to more than $50 million. So I don't know why we just don't  stick with what we did.   I think that, despite whatever we are learning about the A+  regulation, we need to understand thoroughly what the advantages are,  what the disadvantages are, and what the risks are to investors, et  cetera.   So I am going to ask my colleagues to oppose this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have extensive information here about what is  happening with Regulation A+. At first, I decided that some of this  information I wouldn't share because I am so anxious for these small  businesses to be able to access capital, but I think that, you know,  some of my earlier concerns, perhaps, may have been justified.   H.R. 4263, the so-called Regulation A+ Improvement Act, is opposed by  consumer and investor advocates. I would like to take a moment to read  some of their statements in opposition to this bill.   Consumer Federation of America:   ``This bill would increase the offering limit, despite the fact that  the SEC already has unlimited authority to raise the cap as it deems  appropriate. Moreover, the SEC is required to review the offering limit  every 2 years, with its next analysis expected to be released next  month. . . . A vote for this bill, before the SEC has had a chance to  complete its analysis, is a vote against evidence-based policymaking.   ``If Congress were to take the time to consider the research that the  SEC has conducted on the Regulation A markets since the Regulation A+  rules were adopted, it would find that there currently is no need to  raise the limit . . . data suggest that issuers generally are not  clamoring for more capital than is currently allowed to them under the  rules. . . .   ``The market's tepid reaction to Regulation A offerings is surely  also related to the largely abysmal performance of Regulation A  offerings to date. . . . A recent Barron's article provided an in-depth  review of the Regulation A market, describing the `woeful performance'  of the few dozen companies that are currently exchange-listed and the  difficulty trading or getting a price quote for the vast majority of  companies that aren't exchange listed. The Barron's article further  described how `most Reg. A+ businesses haven't gotten beyond the  startup phase known as the pipedream.' Some examples that the article  cites include businesses seeking capital for cannabis paraphernalia,  flying cars, studying UFOs, telepathy, and light-speed travel. We  wonder why the backers of this legislation would spend so much time and  effort seeking to artificially prop up businesses of this sort.   ``And while Regulation A's supporters have touted Regulation A's job  creating potential, the Barron's article states that the only people  Regulation A clearly has created jobs for are Regulation A underwriters  and promoters on Wall Street, many of whom have `checkered stock market  histories.'''   Are these really the sort of jobs Congress is intending to promote?   ``In conclusion, because this bill arbitrarily increases the offering  limit without evidence that doing so is either necessary or beneficial,  and in the face of evidence that Regulation A offerings to date largely  have been market failures, we urge you to vote `no.'''   Let me just continue to quote. Americans for Financial Reform: ``This  is an unwarranted increase in the threshold. Most fundamentally,  Congress should not be undermining public securities markets by  expanding the ability of larger companies to make offerings while being  exempt from core disclosure and investor protection requirements.  Private offerings were designed to permit early stage capital raising  from sophisticated investors by small companies, but the current cap of  $50 million per year in private capital raising already permits fairly  large companies to take advantage of this route. Additionally, the  Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, already has regulatory  authority to increase the current threshold, which they examine on a  biannual basis. . . .   ``Seven of the eight companies with Regulation A+ offerings in 2017  are down 42 percent from their offer prices, as compared to  conventional offerings made during the same period, which are up 22  percent from offer prices. This is to be expected, given that  Regulation A+ permits companies to avoid requirements such as  disclosures that were designed to protect investors. If it expanded  such exemptions, Congress would facilitate increased harm to investors.   ``Members should also take notice that with the blockchain and  cryptocurrency fever, SEC filing and disclosure exemptions like  Regulation A+ are becoming a popular avenue for initial coin offerings,  ICOs. . . .   ``In the middle of this SEC crackdown on fraudulent ICOs, H.R. 4263  would potentially expose a larger number of investors--including  nonaccredited, unsophisticated investors--to shady companies, Ponzi  schemes, and exit scams.   ``The widespread use of private offerings reduces transparency and  investor protections in capital markets. Raising capital under  Regulation A+ should be used as an on-ramp to a true public offering  and not as an end in itself for larger issuers. Increasing the annual  threshold for exempted Regulation A+ offerings goes in the opposite  direction.''   Public Citizen had this to say:   ``Evidence shows little demand for this measure. A study by the SEC  of Regulation A+ offerings found that the average issuer sought only  $18 million. Moreover, these firms pose risk for investors, as the  issuers had only an average of $50,000 in cash; no property, plants,  and equipment; no revenues; and no net income. Increasing access to  capital with no additional investor protections exacerbates the  problem.''   And so, yes, I do oppose the bill. Let me just say this. I would like  small businesses to do well. I would like our small businesses to have  access to the capital that they need to support, you know, good ideas  that have been given the kind of research that is necessary to  determine the potential for some of these businesses.   You just heard this information from the Barron report. This is  serious. What we have seen, despite the fact what we want to happen, is  that it is not happening. The fact that we would like very much--and we  have done everything that we could do with the JOBS Act to give support  to our small businesses because we want them to thrive. We believe that  they are job intensive, if they can get up and get going. It is not  happening.   What we are doing is we are exposing these little mom-and-pop  investors to situations where they are going to lose what small amounts  of money they are investing. So let's just be cool, let's be calm, and  let's give the SEC the opportunity to do its analysis. There is no  reason to push this now.  [[Page H1639]]    I would ask my Members on the opposite side of the aisle to rethink  and to join with me, oppose the bill so that we can give the SEC the  opportunity, again, to do the kind of analysis it needs to do, and  let's think about what else can we do to help small businesses, rather  than continue down the road of failure, because this is exactly what is  being exposed.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4263 is just another reckless partisan bill that  could harm mom-and-pop investors and weaken the integrity of the U.S.  capital markets. It continues the efforts to repeal or weaken important  regulatory protections under the guise of supporting jobs.   Not only have my Republican colleagues failed to come up with any  real data or analysis to support this claim, but they also completely  substitute their own judgment for that of the SEC, the agency with the  expertise over these issues.   As I have already said, we only have to wait a few more weeks to see  if the SEC decides to expand the Regulation A+ exemption and to  understand its rationale for the decision. But I suppose a few weeks is  a few weeks too long for my friends on the opposite side of the aisle  who are currently pushing for as many of these kinds of bills as  possible to be included in the Senate's Dodd-Frank rollback.   Those bad bills would cause further harm to investors by allowing  newly public companies to avoid audits of their controls over financial  reporting for a decade; by hampering investors' ability to get  independent, reliable information ahead of a shareholder meeting; and  by making it easier for fraudsters to swindle unsophisticated investors  into buying stock in a fake or failing company.   It should come as no surprise that these same harmful provisions show  up in the CHOICE Act, which is 10 times worse than the Senate's  deregulatory bill.   Mr. Speaker, both Democrats and Republicans want to help small  businesses grow and create jobs, but as Members of Congress, we also  have the responsibility to protect investors, particularly retail  investors, who are looking to save for retirement, to buy a house, or  to support our children's education.   As I have repeatedly said, any regulation must strike the right  balance between capital formation in our securities markets and  investor protection. This bill fails to do that, and that is why it is  opposed by consumer and investor advocates like Americans for Financial  Reform, Consumer Federation of America, and Public Citizen.   Mr. Speaker, I would urge all Members to join me in standing up for  investors and vote ``no'' on H.R. 4263, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
