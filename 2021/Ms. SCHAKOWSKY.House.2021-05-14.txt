 Mr. Speaker, pregnant women should never have to  choose between maintaining a healthy pregnancy and their paycheck.   This critical bill will ensure that pregnant women get accommodations  when they need them without facing discrimination and/or retaliation at  work. It will especially help low-paid women--largely women of color  and immigrants--working in jobs that require prolonged standing, long  hours, irregular schedules, and heavy lifting or physical activity.   Many people can work just fine without accommodations through their  pregnancy. However, some in physically demanding jobs need a temporary  adjustment of their job duties and perhaps some rules during pregnancy  so that they can continue to work and support their families.   The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is long overdue, and we think that  it is common sense.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Religious  Action Center of Reform Judaism.                                             Religious Action Center                                               of Reform Judaism,                                       Washington, DC, May 11, 2021.        Dear Member of Congress: I write on behalf of the Union for       Reform Judaism, whose 850 congregations across North America       encompass approximately 1.8 million Reform Jews, and the       Central Conference of American Rabbis, whose membership       includes more than 2,000 Reform rabbis, to express our       support for the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (H.R. 1065).        Over 40 years since the passage of the Pregnancy       Discrimination Act in 1978, pregnant workers still face       unjust barriers in the workplace. No worker should have to       choose between their pregnancy and their family's financial       security, yet due to the lack of explicit protections for       pregnant workers needing onsite accommodations for medical or       safety reasons, countless workers confront the agonizing       choice between risking their health and facing forced leave,       lost benefits, or possible termination.        As the inequitable impact of the pandemic has highlighted,       People of Color are more likely to hold demanding, inflexible       jobs where they face tradeoffs between their work and their       health. Illegal pregnancy discrimination and denial of       workplace accommodations, which disproportionately affect       pregnant People of Color, contribute to the Black maternal       health crisis and other forms of racial inequity.        The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (PWFA) would mitigate       these disparities by requiring employers to provide       reasonable, temporary accommodations to pregnant workers so       that they can remain in the workforce throughout their       pregnancies. By requiring temporary adjustments similar to       the accommodations employers already must provide through the       Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), pregnant workers would       no longer be forced to choose between their pregnancies and       their paychecks.        According to the ancient rabbis, workers should not be put       in the position where they have ``to starve or afflict       themselves in order to feed their children'' (Tosefta Bava       Metzia 8:2). We are similarly taught that the fair treatment       of all workers is a matter of tzedek, or justice. These moral       imperatives guide our support for the bipartisan Pregnant       Workers Fairness Act, and we strongly urge Congress to pass       this bill to ameliorate the impact of discrimination against       pregnant people in the workplace.            Sincerely,                                              Barbara Weinstein,                                       Director of the Commission on                                   Social Action of Reform Judaism.
