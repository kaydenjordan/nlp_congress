 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize February as Career and Technical Education Month. Each year,  this month highlights the benefits of a skills-based education and the  valuable contributions that CTE students make to the American workforce  and the American economy.   More specifically, February 2 through February 8 is SkillsUSA Week.  SkillsUSA is a leader in the CTE movement. This annual celebration  represents nearly 370,000 SkillsUSA members across the country who are  developing the personal, workplace, and technical skills necessary to  earn and keep good-paying and rewarding jobs.   A one-size-fits-all approach to education is not an effective way to  prepare students for the workforce. We are doing students a great  disservice when we only promote what is considered a traditional  college experience.   When we look at the potential of our Nation's learners and contrast  that with the 7 million unfilled jobs nationwide, clearly, there is a  disconnect. This is often referred to as the skills gap, and CTE can  help us bridge this divide.   Now, I have the privilege of serving as the co-chair of the  bipartisan House Career and Technical Education Caucus alongside my  colleague and good friend, Congressman  Jim Langevin.   Over the years, we have met with many educators, counselors,  administrators, and students to better understand the resources  necessary to support learners of all ages.   I am proud of the legislation that we have put forward to ensure  students have the tools they need to pursue a rewarding education, and,  eventually, a rewarding career.   With this kind of support, we can help empower students and better  prepare them for a 21st century workforce. Most recently, that includes  H.R. 5092, the Counseling for Career Choice Act, a bill that would  invest in career counseling for high school students as well as  professional development opportunities for the counselors who support  them.   Career and technical education is not a plan B. It is a valuable  educational option that is empowering learners of all ages to take  control of their personal and professional futures.   To me, the ideal educational system is one that allows students to  get in with as few barriers to entry as possible, get the education  that they need, and get out. By providing students with a clear picture  of what the workforce entails--or, more specifically, by investing in  career and technical education--we can help make that a reality.   Madam Speaker, I am asking my colleagues to join me in celebrating  Career and Technical Education Month by supporting the Counseling for  Career Choice Act and other commonsense, bipartisan bills that help  provide quality CTE opportunities to our Nation's students.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize and thank one of the most productive, job-producing  constituents in my district, Punxsutawney Phil.   Over the weekend, Punxsutawney Phil delivered us some good news: He  predicted an early spring for the second year in a row.   But that is not the only good news. Groundhog Day draws tens of  thousands of tourists to Jefferson County each year, which boosts  revenue at local restaurants, hotels, and other small businesses.   Last week, activists claimed that Punxsutawney Phil should be  replaced by an animatronic groundhog powered by artificial  intelligence.   Well, I believe in creating jobs, not eliminating them. And  Punxsutawney Phil is no exception. I will always stand up for the  hardworking men, women, and rodents in the 15th District of  Pennsylvania.   In all seriousness, Groundhog Day brings together people of all  different backgrounds, and this fun family celebration reminds us of  the importance of tradition. It is not only an economic stimulus in the  district, but it is also a great source of pride.                            ____________________
