 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  service of Harvey Drahos, a beloved World War II veteran who lives in  the South Puget Sound of Washington State.   A member of America's Greatest Generation, he joined the military in  1943 and rose to the rank of technician fifth grade.   Like many of our World War II heroes, Mr. Drahos was wounded on the  front lines, and as the Battle of Okinawa went on, he made a promise:  If I survive, I vow to help people.   Like many of his generation, he made serving our great Nation and its  citizens a cornerstone of his life's work.   Post-military service, he served on multiple service organization  boards and dedicated 53 years of active community service and  leadership to Washington State.   One piece of Mr. Drahos' story that stood out to me is that while on  the battlefield in Japan, he recovered a cherished photo album. After  decades of searching for the family it belonged to, he was able to get  it back to the Nakamoto family in Okinawa. This selfless act helped a  family reunite with their past loved ones, transcending the boundaries  of war with a kind act of humanity.   Madam Speaker, Harvey Drahos exemplifies courage, selfless service,  and love for others. He recently celebrated his 100th birthday and is  the last living member of his World War II military unit. I am honored  and proud to recognize him for his service in combat and his love and  compassion for our Nation.                     Congratulating Alfie Alvarado-Ramos     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Lourdes  ``Alfie'' Alvarado-Ramos, who will retire at the end of this month as  director of the Washington State Department of Veterans Affairs.   I congratulate Alfie on an exemplary and distinguished career serving  the American people and my fellow Washingtonians for more than five  decades.   Alfie enlisted in the Army in 1971, rising to the rank of troop  command sergeant major at Madigan Army Medical Center, part of Joint  Base Lewis-McChord in my district.   After retiring from the military in 1993, Alfie joined the Washington  State Department of Veterans Affairs and has served as its director for  the last decade. Under her leadership, the department was recognized as  the leading State veterans affairs department in the entire Nation,  offering the largest portfolio of services.   Madam Speaker, throughout her career, Alfie has broken barriers and  empowered the next generation of soldiers to lead at the highest levels  of military and public service. More importantly, she has been  instrumental in making sure that our veterans are never forgotten.   I thank Director Alvarado-Ramos for her selfless service to our  veterans, the State of Washington, and our Nation. She is a true  patriot indeed.                            ____________________
