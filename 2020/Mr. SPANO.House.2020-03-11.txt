 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Women's History  Month, a time to highlight the many often-overlooked female  contributions to our national history.   Great women have undoubtedly helped make America great. From the  classroom to the boardroom, from Capitol Hill to outer space, their  impact is undeniable.   Now, across our land, women-owned businesses are thriving in our  booming economy above all others. Over the past 5 years, these  businesses have grown by 21 percent, compared to 9 percent across all  other sectors.   An example of this entrepreneurial spirit is seen in Lakeland,  Florida's own Angie Ruff. Mrs. Ruff opened a dry food manufacturing  business in 2018. Through her dedication and passion for creating good  local jobs, her warehouse has since tripled in size, and her head count  quadrupled. The future for her and other entrepreneurs like her looks  bright.   It is because of individuals like Angie Ruff, who are making history,  that I am proud to represent Florida's 15th District on the House Small  Business Committee, and it is because of dedicated women like her that  we can proudly say: America is back and open for business.                            ____________________
