 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 2611) to modify the boundary of the Little Rock Central  High School National Historic Site, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2611         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Little Rock Central High       School National Historic Site Boundary Modification Act''.       SEC. 2. LITTLE ROCK CENTRAL HIGH SCHOOL NATIONAL HISTORIC                     SITE BOUNDARY MODIFICATION.         Section 2 of Public Law 105-356 (112 Stat. 3268) is       amended--        (1) by redesignating subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e) as       subsections (c), (d), (e), and (f), respectively;        (2) by inserting after subsection (a) the following:        ``(b) Boundary Modification.--The boundary of the historic       site is modified to include the 7 residences on South Park       Street in Little Rock, Arkansas, consisting of 1.47 acres, as       generally depicted on the map entitled `Central High School       National Historic Site Proposed Boundary', numbered 037/      80,001, and dated August, 2004.''; and        (3) in subsection (d) (as redesignated by paragraph (1))--        (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``(1) The Secretary'' and       inserting the following:        ``(1) In general.--The Secretary'';        (B) in paragraph (2), by striking ``(2) The Secretary'' and       inserting the following:        ``(3) Coordination.--The Secretary''; and        (C) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following:        ``(2) Cooperative agreements for the preservation and       interpretation of certain properties.--        ``(A) In general.--The Secretary may enter into cooperative       agreements with the owners of the 7 residences referred to in       subsection (b) pursuant to which the Secretary may use       appropriated funds to mark, interpret, improve, restore, and       provide technical assistance with respect to the preservation       and interpretation of the properties.        ``(B) Inclusions.--An agreement entered into under       subparagraph (A) shall include a provision specifying that no       changes or alterations shall be made to the exterior of the       properties subject to the agreement, except by the mutual       agreement of the parties to the agreement.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise  [[Page H7252]]  and extend their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), the sponsor of this excellent piece of  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), also a member of our committee and who  has helped shepherd this bill through our committee and here on the  floor.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill, to me, is an extremely important bill. Sixty  years ago, during this month, nine extraordinary students attended  Little Rock, Arkansas' Central High School. They were kids picked for  their academic ability and their maturity level because they were going  to go through a year that no one had seen before and, hopefully, will  ever see again.   Mr. Speaker, perhaps because I taught high school for almost 30  years, I understand the environment that took place here, and I have a  great deal of empathy for these nine kids who went there. They could  have easily been my students.   This becomes a significant concept that on September 4, 60 years ago,  the Governor of Arkansas ordered the National Guard to bar these nine  kids from entrance into Central High School in Little Rock; then, after  some pressure, he withdrew the protection so the kids were subject to  the mobs and the violence that took place there at that time.   On September 25, 60 years ago, Dwight Eisenhower had the courage and  leadership--one of the reasons I respect him so much as a President--to  order the Army 101st Airborne Division to go down to Little Rock to  Central High School and to escort these nine kids through that first  year and lead them to a school year like no other has ever been.   This situation was, in my estimation, a pivotal moment in our  Nation's civil rights history as well as our education history. We have  often talked about how buildings and monuments are used to interpret  history. That is exactly what Mr. Hill is attempting to do here with a  significant site in America's history, to make sure that it is  preserved--and not just the high school itself, but the seven  residences that are across the street on South Park Street. Those  residences there are part of the historical landmark which was made and  designated in the Reagan administration. They are part of the  designation on the National Register of Historic Places.    Finally, in 1998, the high school and some surrounding areas were  established as a National Historic Site. Those buildings still have  significant historical integrity. They add to the definition and the  story of history which must--which must--be remembered at all times.   This bill expands the boundaries of this National Historic Site to  include those residences so the National Park Service can, in  cooperative agreements with the residents who still live there, make  sure that that area will always be preserved as a place to interpret,  improve, and provide the technical assistance to make sure this story  of American history is not forgotten. It is part of the milieu.   As the gentlewoman from Hawaii said, when you see pictures of these  kids giving press conferences, you see these homes in the background.  It is part and parcel to this story. The residents who live across the  street are connected to the landmark events in September of 1957 and  provide the backdrop for this particular element.   I am appreciative of Mr. Hill of Arkansas for leading forth with this  particular bill, realizing the significance, and I am happy that today,  on the very month this was happening 60 years ago, we actually are  talking about this particular event and desiring to secure these areas  so that the history of this country will be remembered to its fullest  extent.   One of our staffers in the committee who helped in the drafting of  this bill had the opportunity of having lunch with one of those Little  Rock Nine. His essay won, and his reward was to have a chance to  actually meet one of these heroic young women who went to Little Rock's  Central High School 60-plus years ago.   This is significant, and I cannot think of this story without in some  way feeling choked up inside because I know what it must have been like  for those kids to go there, and I know what it must have been like to  be part of that milieu. This was historic. They were true heroes. They  were truly brave kids who took this event on and did it with such  aplomb. They need to be remembered.   That is why I am happy that this bill is coming forward, so that we  can expand the horizon and we can expand the area of this historic site  so that we can make sure that this will be a protected area, so that  the history will not be forgotten and so what these kids did in that  very historic year of 1957 and 1958 in Little Rock will not be  forgotten, and so the significance and the conviction those kids had  and the experience they had to go through can be remembered and that we  can never again go back there. We could never again replicate that  area, and we will move forward in the area of civil rights as well as  education.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to be here to support this bill. I am going  to ask my colleagues to support this bill because it says so much about  us, about our commitments, about our priorities, and about what we want  to do, and it says so much about what is good in this country. This is  the primary example of what we are attempting to do.   Once again, Mr. Speaker, we appreciate all those who have spoken on  behalf of this particular bill, those who have worked on this bill, and  those who have sponsored this bill. This bill is something I think is  really significant. It says something that is very positive about this  country and helps us to remember that which is positive about this  country.   Mr. Speaker, I am urging all my colleagues to support this, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
