 Madam Speaker, you can hear the babies crying. When  I went to the south Texas processing center, places where they were  holding children, you could see the cages. You could hear and feel the  warmth of Roger that was 9 months old who I held in my hands and who I  did not want to let go. I could feel that because Roger's relatives had  been taken from him, and he was crying.   The babies are coming every day. There are 2,000 children who have  been snatched from their families. It is child abuse.   Mr. President, you can come to the Republican Conference and make  jokes and raise your fist, but you can sign right now on behalf of the  American people that you will let these babies go to their families.   Pope Francis said: ``A person's dignity does not depend on them being  a citizen, a migrant, or a refugee. Saving the life of someone fleeing  war and poverty is an act of humanity.''   This is a sin. Please, for Carlos and Alajerry, please let our  children go to their families.    Mr. Speaker, America is listening to the pain of so  many of the Members, my colleagues, as we have experienced the  devastation of watching families torn apart from their babies, their  toddlers, their young children.   I spent my Sunday and Monday, Father's Day, looking at those who just  simply wanted an opportunity, holding baby Roger in my hands, whose  mother had died and whose sister was ripped away from him and  prosecuted criminally for entering the United States. Or baby Leah, who  was 1 year old and was obviously fussy and had been in such a way that  she was experiencing trauma.   And yet, we now have this executive order that looks as if the  President has done something that he could not have done a few hours  ago, which is picking up the telephone and telling the people at the  border to cease and desist.   Those are good people who work there. They are only following orders.  But this is a tragic executive order--it has no heart to it--because  what it does is, yes, it keeps the families together in a  criminal posture and houses them in the same conditions, now on  military bases, rather than allowing them to proceed through court  proceedings. In my southern district of Texas we have 50,000 cases in  backlog because, as I go to the Budget Committee, this administration  refuses to give us more judges.    Well, they are trying to open one of these places in my congressional  district. And I want to congratulate Houston, because Houston is  standing for humanity; it is standing, as the Pope has said, because  everyone deserves dignity.   This executive order is not worth the paper it is written on because  it could have been a phone call, not a demand that it is all of  Congress' fault.   But I am standing for the children, and we are going to save them.                            ____________________
