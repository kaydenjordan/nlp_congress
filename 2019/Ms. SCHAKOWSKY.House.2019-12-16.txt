 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4779) to extend the Undertaking Spam, Spyware, And Fraud  Enforcement With Enforcers beyond Borders Act of 2006, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4779         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF THE U.S. SAFE WEB ACT OF 2006.         Section 13 of the U.S. SAFE WEB Act of 2006 (Public Law       109-455; 15 U.S.C. 44 note) is amended by striking       ``September 30, 2020'' and inserting ``September 30, 2027''.       SEC. 2. REPORT.         Not later than 3 years after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Federal Trade Commission shall transmit to the       Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of       Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and       Transportation of the Senate a report describing its use of       and experience with the authority granted by the U.S. SAFE       WEB Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-455) and the amendments made       by such Act. The report shall include--        (1) the number of cross-border complaints received and       acted upon by the Commission;        (2) identification of the foreign agencies with which the       Commission has cooperated and the results of such       cooperation, including any foreign agency enforcement action       or lack thereof;        (3) a description of Commission litigation brought in       foreign courts and the results of such litigation; and        (4) any recommendations for legislation that may advance       the mission of the Commission in carrying out the U.S. SAFE       WEB Act of 2006 and the amendments made by such Act.       SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on H.R. 4779.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4779, a bill to extend  the U.S. SAFE WEB Act of 2006. This legislation, which I have  cosponsored, was introduced by the ranking member of the Consumer  Protection and Commerce Subcommittee, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, and  Representatives Robin Kelly and Larry Bucshon. It advanced out of the  Energy and Commerce Committee without objection.                                time  1615    With our increased global and connected marketplace, American  consumers and businesses are facing a growing number of complex threats  from foreign wrongdoers. The United States SAFE WEB Act protects us  from bad actors engaged in unfair or deceptive acts or practices by  giving the Federal Trade Commission the authority and tools it needs to  pursue enforcement actions against them.   It has already been used to great effect to protect consumers in a  wide range of cases, including scams that prey on older adults and  connected toys that prey on our children's privacy. Reauthorizing the  U.S. SAFE WEB Act is supported by all five commissioners at the Federal  Trade Commission. This legislation would extend the U.S. SAFE WEB Act  for another 7 years.   Mr. Speaker, I call on all my colleagues to support this measure, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, but I do want to  say that this is an example of bipartisan legislation that I am so  proud of that has come out of the Consumer Protection and Commerce  Subcommittee, and I am really grateful to my ranking Republican, her  authorship of this legislation and her work to get it passed that will  certainly protect us from foreign bad actors, scams, and deceptive  practices. It gives the Federal Trade Commission more authority.   Mr. Speaker, this is a bill that I am hoping that all of our  colleagues can endorse, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2647) to adopt a certain California flammability standard as  a Federal flammability standard to protect against the risk of  upholstered furniture flammability, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2647         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Safer Occupancy Furniture       Flammability Act'' or the ``SOFFA Act''.       SEC. 2. ADOPTION OF CALIFORNIA FLAMMABILITY STANDARD AS A                     FEDERAL STANDARD.         (a) Definitions.--In this section--        (1) the term ``bedding product'' means--        (A) an item that is used for sleeping or sleep-related       purposes; or        (B) any component or accessory with respect to an item       described in subparagraph (A), without regard to whether the       component or accessory, as applicable, is used--        (i) alone; or        (ii) along with, or contained within, that item;        (2) the term ``California standard'' means the standard set       forth by the Bureau of Electronic and Appliance Repair, Home       Furnishings and Thermal Insulation of the Department of       Consumer Affairs of the State of California in Technical       Bulletin 117-2013, entitled ``Requirements, Test Procedure       and Apparatus for Testing the Smolder Resistance of Materials       Used in Upholstered Furniture'', originally published June       2013, as in effect on the date of enactment of this Act;        (3) the terms ``foundation'' and ``mattress'' have the       meanings given those terms in section 1633.2 of title 16,       Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on the date of       enactment of this Act; and        (4) the term ``upholstered furniture''--        (A) means an article of seating furniture that--        (i) is intended for indoor use;        (ii) is movable or stationary;        (iii) is constructed with an upholstered seat, back, or       arm;        (iv) is--         (I) made or sold with a cushion or pillow, without regard       to whether that cushion or pillow, as applicable, is attached       or detached with respect to the article of furniture; or        (II) stuffed or filled, or able to be stuffed or filled, in       whole or in part, with any material, including a substance or       material that is hidden or concealed by fabric or another       covering, including a cushion or pillow belonging to, or       forming a part of, the article of furniture; and         (v) together with the structural units of the article of       furniture, any filling material, and the container and       covering with respect to those structural units and that       filling material, can be used as a support for the body of an       individual, or the limbs and feet of an individual, when the       individual sits in an upright or reclining position;        (B) includes an article of furniture that is intended for       use by a child; and        (C) does not include--        (i) a mattress;        (ii) a foundation;        (iii) any bedding product; or        (iv) furniture that is used exclusively for the purpose of       physical fitness and exercise.        (b) Adoption of Standard.--        (1) In general.--Beginning on the date that is 180 days       after the date of enactment of this Act, and except as       provided in paragraph (2), the California standard shall be       considered to be a flammability standard promulgated by the       Consumer Product Safety Commission under section 4 of the       Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C. 1193).        (2) Testing and certification.--A fabric, related material,       or product to which the California standard applies as a       result of paragraph (1) shall not be subject to section 14(a)       of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2063(a)) with       respect to that standard.        (3) Certification label.--Each manufacturer of a product       that is subject to the California standard as a result of       paragraph (1) shall include the statement ``Complies with       U.S. CPSC requirements for upholstered furniture       flammability'' on a permanent label located on the product,       which shall be considered to be a certification that the       product complies with that standard.        (c) Preemption.--        (1) In general.--Notwithstanding section 16 of the       Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C. 1203) and section 231 of the       Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (15 U.S.C.       2051 note), and except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and       (C) of paragraph (2), no State or any political subdivision       of a State may establish or continue in effect any provision       of a flammability law, regulation, code, standard, or       requirement that is designed to protect against the risk of       occurrence of fire, or to slow or prevent the spread of fire,       with respect to upholstered furniture.        (2) Preservation of certain state law.--Nothing in this Act       or the Flammable Fabrics Act (15 U.S.C. 1191 et seq.) may be       construed to preempt or otherwise affect--        (A) any State or local law, regulation, code, standard, or       requirement that--        (i) concerns health risks associated with upholstered       furniture; and        (ii) is not designed to protect against the risk of       occurrence of fire, or to slow or prevent the spread of fire,       with respect to upholstered furniture;        (B) sections 1374 through 1374.3 of title 4, California       Code of Regulations (except for subsections (b) and (c) of       section 1374 of that title), as in effect on the date of       enactment of this Act; or        (C) the California standard.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 2647.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2647, the Safer  Occupancy Furniture Flammability Act, also known as SOFFA.   This bipartisan legislation, which I have cosponsored, was introduced  by Representatives Doris Matsui and Morgan Griffith. It advanced out of  the Committee on Energy and Commerce by voice vote.   This bill adopts California's upholstered furniture flammability  standard as the Federal standard. This new standard will ensure all  Americans are protected from the rise of upholstered furniture fires  and will eliminate unnecessary consumer exposure to flame-retardant  chemicals. These toxic chemicals are associated with adverse health  effects, including hormonal disruption, reduced fertility, and even  cancer.   For too long, upholstered furniture has been laden with flame- retardant chemicals and has been a significant source of human exposure  to those toxic chemicals. Flame retardants are known to migrate out of  the furniture and into household dust and persist in the indoor  environment.   Since the chemicals also accumulate in our bodies over time, babies  and children, whose bodies and brains are still developing and who  spend a lot of time on the floor, are especially vulnerable to toxic  effects.   Firefighters have long expressed concern that they face additional  risks due to their unique exposure by the combustion of flame-retardant  chemicals that occurs when they are battling fires.   Flame-retardant chemicals in furniture are all risk and no reward.  Testing by the Consumer Product Safety Commission has shown flame  retardants added to furniture provide no meaningful fire safety benefit  and make no difference in how much time you have to escape in the event  of a fire.   With this legislation, consumers will no longer have to second-guess  whether or not the new sofa that they are purchasing meets stringent  flammability standards. Manufacturers will be required to include a  statement on a permanent label regarding the product's compliance with  this new standard.   Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to support this important  legislation for public health and safety, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Think of it, that in our upholstered furniture there can be toxic  chemicals that actually cause tremendous health hazards, not only to  the people who own that furniture, but, now, to firefighters who are  coming to put out fires. That is one.   And number two, we find that these don't really have any effect on  fires and make the time shorter that you can get out or actually reduce  the chance of fire. So as I said, there is no gain in having these  chemicals.   Mr. Speaker, I have two letters that I will include in the Record,  and they are:   One, a letter from 17 organizations, including the Natural Resources  Defense Council, Consumer Federation of America, Earthjustice, Green  Science Policy Institute, Safer Chemicals Healthy Families, and Toxic- Free Future, among many others, urging strong support by Members for  SOFFA; and   Two, a letter from 15 national organizations representing consumers  throughout the United States, including the Consumer Federation of  America, National Consumers League, Kids in Danger, Public Citizen, and  Safe Kids Worldwide, among many others, also urging strong support for  this legislation.                                                  December 16, 2019.        Dear Member of Congress: The undersigned groups urge you to       vote YES on the SOFFA Act (H.R. 2647), led by Representatives       Matsui and Griffith. This bipartisan legislation would help       safeguard public health. There is currently no flammability       standard for upholstered furniture at the federal level. This       is a major gap that Congress should fill. Fortunately, the       state of California recently conducted an extensive process       to identify a furniture flammability standard that would       provide protection against the vast majority of upholstered       furniture fires, without the need for flame retardant       chemicals, which have been linked to a variety of adverse       health effects, including impaired brain development,       reproductive problems, and cancers. Firefighters and children       face especially high exposures and risks. The SOFFA Act would       make California's flammability standard for upholstered       furniture the standard across the nation.        In 2013, California's Bureau of Household Goods and       Services (``Bureau'') determined that the vast majority of       upholstered furniture fires are started by smoldering       materials on the fabric surface of the furniture. Therefore,       it adopted a standard that addresses the safety threat of       smoldering materials igniting the cover fabric of furniture.       The result was California Technical Bulletin 117-2013 (TB       117-2013). TB 117-2013 was widely supported by firefighters,       environmental and public health groups, and independent fire       scientists.        Since the standard was adopted, additional science has       reinforced its importance and effectiveness. A 2019 study       published in the American Journal of Public Health found that       among furniture fires, those caused by smoking products were       the deadliest, and that the odds of someone dying in a       furniture fire caused by smoking was three times greater than       in a furniture fire caused by an open flame (such as a candle       or match). It also found that standards focused on fires       caused by an open flame and that relied on the addition of       toxic flame retardant chemicals to furniture were ineffective       in reducing the incidence of fires. The authors concluded       that ``[d]ata on injury and death in residential fires       support greater attention to smoking-related fires in       furniture, because they are associated with a much higher       risk of death than are fires ignited by open flames.       Standards such as TB117-2013 are designed to address       cigarette ignition of furniture without the use of toxic FR       [flame retardant] chemicals. Future regulations to increase       fire safety of residential furniture should continue to focus       on ignition from smoking materials.''        Making California's TB 117-2013 the national flammability       standard would end sporadic efforts to promulgate open flame       standards that promote the use of toxic, flame retardant       chemicals without providing a fire safety benefit. It would       also provide a uniform standard for the furniture industry,       while being health protective. The Consumer Product Safety       Commission (CPSC) has previously relied on California       flammability standards as the basis for federal health-      protective standards. The SOFFA Act will create strong public       health protections for people across the country and reduce       the risk of harm by furniture-related fires. We urge you to       safeguard public health for all Americans and vote YES on       H.R. 2647.            Sincerely,        Alaska Community Action on Toxics, Center for Environmental       Health, Clean and Healthy New York, Clean Water Action,       Coming Clean, Commonwealth Biomonitoring Resource Center,       Consumer Federation of America, Earthjustice, Ecology Center       (Michigan), Environmental Health Strategy Center, Green       Science Policy Institute, Healthy Baby Bright Futures,       Healthy Legacy Coalition, Natural Resources Defense Council,       Safer Chemicals Healthy Families, Safer States, Toxic-Free       Future.                                   ____                                                 September 12, 2019.        Dear Representative: As organizations dedicated to       improving consumer protections, we write to express our       support for three consumer product safety bills as they move       to the House floor. These bills would enhance protections to       prevent deaths from portable fuel cans, injuries and deaths       from carbon monoxide poisoning, and reduce exposure to       harmful flame retardants. We urge you to support these bills       to protect children and all consumers from preventable       injuries and deaths.        The Nicholas and Zachary Burt Carbon Monoxide Poisoning       Prevention Act of 2019 (H.R. 1618) would establish a grant       program, administered by the CPSC, that would encourage       states to require the installation of residential carbon       monoxide detectors, including for vulnerable populations.       According to the CDC, during 2010-2015, a total of 2,244       deaths resulted from unintentional carbon monoxide (CO)       poisoning, with 393 of those deaths occurring in 2015. This       bill seeks to reduce carbon monoxide poisonings.        The Portable Fuel Container Safety Act of 2019 (H.R. 806)       would help prevent flame jetting incidents through       establishing a binding and enforceable standard that would       require flame mitigation devices, or flame arrestors, on       portable fuel containers to prevent flames from entering       these containers and igniting the gases inside. According to       National Fire Protection Association estimates, fire       departments responded to an average of 160,910 fires per year       between 2007 and 2011 that started with ignition of a       flammable or combustible liquid, resulting in an estimated       454 civilian deaths, 3,910 civilian injuries, and $1.5       billion in direct property damage per year.        The Safer Occupancy Furniture Flammability Act, or SOFFA       (H.R. 2647), would adopt a California flammability standard       as a federal flammability standard to help protect against       the risk of upholstered furniture fires and consumer exposure       to flame retardant chemicals. Today's California standard, TB       117-2013, is currently the strongest measure U.S. consumers       have to keep them protected from purchasing upholstered       furniture that is either highly flammable or loaded with       flame-retardant chemicals. While this bill seeks to protect       consumers from both fires and flame retardant exposure, we       urge members to strengthen the bill through amending it so       that other states retain the ability to exceed TB 117-2013's       level of protection if they so choose.        These bills offer a critical opportunity to protect       children and all consumers from preventable injuries and       deaths. We urge you to support these child health and safety       bills, and to vote ``yes'' on them as they move to the House       floor.            Sincerely,        Alaska Public Interest Research Group (AkPIRG), Center for       Justice & Democracy, Chicago Consumer Coalition, Child Injury       Prevention Alliance, Consumer Assistance Council, Inc.,       Consumer Federation of America, Kids In Danger, National       Consumers League, OHSU/Doernbecher Tom Sargent Safety Center,       Parents for Window Blind Safety, Public Citizen, Safe Kids       Worldwide, Safe States Alliance, The Society for Advancement       of Violence and Injury Research  [[Page H10294]]       (SAVIR), Virginia Citizens Consumer Council.     Mr. Speaker, I urge strong support for this  bipartisan legislation. I urge all Members to vote in favor, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3172) to prohibit the manufacture for sale, offer for sale,  distribution in commerce, or importation into the United States of any  inclined sleeper for infants, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3172         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Safe Sleep for Babies Act of       2019''.       SEC. 2. BANNING OF INCLINED SLEEPERS FOR INFANTS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, inclined sleepers for infants,       regardless of the date of manufacture, shall be considered a       banned hazardous product under section 8 of the Consumer       Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2057).        (b) Inclined Sleeper for Infants Defined.--In this section,       the term ``inclined sleeper for infants'' means a product       with an inclined sleep surface greater than ten degrees that       is intended, marketed, or designed to provide sleeping       accommodations for an infant up to one year old.       SEC. 3. BANNING OF CRIB BUMPERS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, crib bumpers, regardless of the date       of manufacture, shall be considered a banned hazardous       product under section 8 of the Consumer Product Safety Act       (15 U.S.C. 2057).        (b) Crib Bumper Defined.--In this section, the term ``crib       bumper''--        (1) means any material that is intended to cover the sides       of a crib to prevent injury to any crib occupant from impacts       against the side of a crib or to prevent partial or complete       access to any openings in the sides of a crib to prevent a       crib occupant from getting any part of the body entrapped in       any opening;        (2) includes a padded crib bumper, a supported and       unsupported vinyl bumper guard, and vertical crib slat       covers; and        (3) does not include a non-padded mesh crib liner.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3172, the Safe Sleep  for Babies Act of 2019. This legislation combines a bill that was  introduced by Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee Vice Chair  Tony Cardenas, which bans inclined sleepers that have been associated  with many infant deaths, with a bill that I introduced, the Safe Cribs  Act, which bans crib bumpers that have led to suffocation deaths of  infants. I introduced this legislation with my friends and colleagues  from Illinois, Congresswoman Robin Kelly and Congressman   Bobby Rush.   For years, pediatricians have provided very clear recommendations for  keeping babies safe while they sleep. Babies should only sleep on a  firm, flat surface, free of any extra soft bedding. Infant inclined  sleepers and crib bumpers are two products that contradict these  longstanding recommendations of physicians.   Infant inclined sleepers, like the Fisher-Price Rock `n Play,  position babies for sleep on a dangerous incline. The inclined nature  of these products goes directly against the guidance of pediatricians  and medical experts.   In April of this year, the public learned just how deadly they are:  At least 32 babies have died in the Fisher-Price Rock `n Play since  they were first introduced 10 years ago, in 2009. According to the  latest figures, at least 73 babies have died in similar products like  the Rock `n Play.   With the ensuing outrage, the Consumer Product Safety Commission took  some action, recalling over 5 million infant inclined sleepers. And  thanks to pressure by Consumer Reports and Members of Congress,  including Representative Cardenas and myself, some retailers, including  Amazon, eBay, Walmart, and Buy Buy Baby, have recently announced plans  to stop selling these products.   However, too many new or used inclined sleepers remain for sale on  shelves and online. This class of product needs to be banned, and many  children would still be alive if they had never been sold.   Crib bumpers also remain widely used by parents and caretakers,  despite safe sleep recommendations that ``bare is best'' and that any  kind of soft bedding in a crib creates an unnecessary suffocation  danger.   That is, and the reason that they are so available is, because crib  bumpers are featured on displays in stores, on baby registry  checklists, and bundled as part of infant bedding sets.   These products, parents and caregivers are told, prevent babies from  bumping their heads or getting their arms or legs caught in the crib  rails. But these products are unnecessary. Worse than unnecessary, they  can be deadly. More than 100 babies have died because of crib bumpers  since 1990.   Consumers trust that the products that they see on the store shelves  are safe. They think that products wouldn't be sold if they were so  dangerous.   We must take these dangerous products off the shelf now. No family  should have to experience the heartache and the tragedy of losing a  baby in an unsafe sleep product.   The Safe Sleep for Babies Act of 2019 will save babies' lives.   I want to thank Congressman Cardenas for his leadership, and I call  on all of my colleagues to support this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I am so proud of our subcommittee, the Consumer  Protection and Commerce Subcommittee in the Energy and Commerce  Committee, for really saving lives.   If we pass this legislation, we will stop hazards that are known to  cause deaths of children in their beds by parents who have trusted that  these products, because they are on the shelf, are safe.   These bumpers and these inclined sleepers are proven killers, so this  legislation will make these nurseries, these places where we put our  precious babies to bed, much safer.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from 20 national  organizations and more than 50 State and local organizations  representing pediatricians and consumers throughout the United States,  including the American Academy of Pediatrics, Consumer Federation of  America, Consumer Reports, Kids in Danger, among many others, urging  strong support from Members for the Safe Sleep for Babies Act.                                                 September 11, 2019.        Dear Representative: As organizations dedicated to       children's health and safety, we write to express our strong       support for three bills as they move to the House floor.       These bills would improve protections against preventable       sleep-related deaths, as well as injuries and deaths from       preventable furniture tip-overs. We urge you to support these       bills to protect children from injuries and deaths.        The Safe Sleep for Babies Act of 2019 (H.R. 3172) would ban       infant inclined sleep products, such as the recently recalled       Fisher-  [[Page H10295]]       Price Rock `n Play Sleeper, which have been linked to the       deaths of at least 50 infants. While there have been four       recent recalls related to this product type, similar unsafe       products of this type remain on the market. These products       are deadly, and their design is inherently unsafe and       incompatible with expert safe sleep recommendations,       including from the American Academy of Pediatrics. This       legislation would help prevent more families from       experiencing the tragedy of losing a child by banning the       products' manufacture, import, and sale.        The Safe Cribs Act of 2019 (H.R. 3170) would ban crib       bumper pads. Bumper pads have led to dozens of infant       suffocation deaths and do not offer protection to babies.       These products are also inconsistent with expert safe sleep       recommendations. Maryland, Ohio, New York State, Chicago,       Illinois, and Watchung, New Jersey have taken action to       protect babies. If H.R. 3170 becomes law, all babies in the       Unites States would be similarly protected. This legislation       would help prevent more families from experiencing the       tragedy of losing a child to crib bumper pads by banning       their manufacture, import, and sale altogether.        The STURDY Act (H.R. 2211) would direct the U.S. Consumer       Product Safety Commission (CPSC) to create a mandatory       clothing storage unit standard to help prevent furniture tip-      overs. According to the CPSC, one child dies every ten days       from a tip-over. Stronger product testing and safety       requirements could prevent these fatalities. This bill is       critically important because it would establish a strong       mandatory standard for furniture stability. The STURDY Act       would require the CPSC to create a mandatory rule that would:       cover all clothing storage units, including those 30 inches       in height or shorter; require testing to simulate the weights       of children up to 72 months old; require testing measures to       account for scenarios involving carpeting, loaded drawers,       multiple open drawers, and the dynamic force of a climbing       child; mandate strong warning requirements; and require the       CPSC to issue the mandatory standard within one year of       enactment. To protect children from furniture tip-overs, we       need a strong mandatory standard and the STURDY Act includes       those critically needed provisions.        These bills offer a vital opportunity to protect children       from preventable injuries and deaths. We urge you to support       these child health and safety bills, and to vote ``yes'' on       them as they move to the House floor.
