 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding time.   Clearly, Mr. Speaker, the overregulation of Dodd-Frank, coupled with  unfettered agencies like the CFPB, have hurt Americans from Wall Street  to Main Street. But today, Mr. Speaker, I am not here to talk about  Wall Street or Main Street but a little two-lane street in Cassville,  Georgia, named ``Mac Johnson.''   Cassville is a rural community that has a small post office, a little  country store, and a lot of hardworking people who call it their home.  Many of the people who live in Cassville work at one of the many  factories in the local area.   While these hardworking Americans are not the upper middle class,  they are the backbone of America's economy. And like 22 million other  Americans, many of them live in a manufactured home. Along Mac Johnson,  you will find a number of manufactured homes--some on individual lots,  some on farmland, and some in quaint, little mobile home parks.   As it is across the Nation, almost half of those living in these  homes have incomes of less than $30,000 a year, and many are retired or  disabled. Historically, manufactured homes have allowed families, who  couldn't afford the cost of a traditionally constructed house, the  ability to achieve the American Dream.   However, the CFPB has expanded enforcement of regulations that were  designed for mortgage lending on traditional homes to include  manufactured home retailers. This has made it much more difficult for  consumers to obtain financing for these homes.                                time  1015    Mr. Speaker, this bill reins in Federal regulations just enough to  give needed relief to the manufactured housing industry and allow  families access to these affordable homes.   I fully support this bipartisan bill, which gained the support of  two-thirds of the Financial Services Committee industry, and I commend  my colleague from the great State of Kentucky for bringing this bill  forward.
