 Mr. Speaker, desperate attempts? Hijacking our voting  rights? That is exactly what our Republican colleagues are doing.   And why? Because when Democrats vote, Democrats win, and we provide  for our children, our families, and our businesses.   I stand here today in support of the Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis  Act of 2022 because Black people representing the Congressional Black  Caucus have stood in line, have been attacked by dogs, have put their  lives on the line, and crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge for us to have  the right to vote.   America, watch what is happening today. Watch what Republicans are  trying to do: Take away your fundamental right to vote.   Let us restore our democracy. Let's stand up for what four Republican  Presidents in the past did. They reauthorized the Voting Rights Act.  Republicans are scared, and they are hijacking Americans' rights.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate 109 years of  sisterhood, scholarship, and service in Delta Sigma Theta Sorority,  Incorporated.   Founders Day embodies the living legacy of our predecessors. Today  six members of the Congressional Black Caucus--Congresswoman Yvette  Clarke, Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, Congresswoman Val Demings,  Congresswoman Lucy McBath, Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett, and I--stand  proudly in our Founders' footsteps.   Happy Founders Day to the Columbus Alumnae Chapter, Delta Kappa  Chapter, and to all my sisters in Delta Sigma Theta Sorority.                            ____________________
