 Madam Speaker, these resources are a lifeline to our  fellow Americans, whose lives and livelihoods have been turned upside  down through no fault of their own.   They aren't just numbers on some government spreadsheet. They are  healthcare workers who rush to the front lines in this battle, risking  their lives for our safety. They are family farmers, independent energy  producers, and small businesses of all kinds who listened to their  leaders, did their part, made their sacrifices and stayed home,  shuttered their businesses, all to keep their communities and their  country safe.   This temporary support will compensate them partly, but more  importantly, will help them get on their feet so that they can keep  their employees on the payroll and off the unemployment roll. These  folks are the heartbeat of America. They are the lifeblood of this  economy, and they--not the government--will lead one of the greatest  American comebacks in our history.   Madam Speaker, let's suit up, let's strap it on, and let's get  America back to work.
