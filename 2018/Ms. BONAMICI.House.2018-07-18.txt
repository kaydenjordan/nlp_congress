 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Connie  Kurtz, an LGBT rights activist who passed away recently at the age of  81.   Connie was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, where she met and  fell in love with the woman who would become her wife, Ruthie Berman.  Ruthie and Connie became a couple in 1974, long before same-sex couples  were afforded equal rights.   Ruthie was a school counselor, and, in 1988, they found themselves at  the forefront of the gay rights movement when they joined two other  couples and sued the New York Department of Education for domestic  partner benefits for same-sex couples. Their advocacy led to the city  extending healthcare benefits to same-sex couples in 1994.   Ruthie and Connie's activism did not stop there. They continued to  fight for LGBT rights, including rights for older LGBT Americans. They  recognized the unique healthcare, social, emotional, and housing needs  of our aging LGBT population, and they sought to help minimize these  disparities.   I am honored to have introduced the Ruthie and Connie LGBT Elder  Americans Act with my colleagues Congressman Ted Deutch and Congressman  Charlie Crist. This legislation defines LGBT seniors as a vulnerable  population, requires the Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary  of Aging to collect data on the unique needs of this population, and  provides grants for service organizations that are working to improve  the health and long-term outcomes of the aging LGBT population.   Since Connie's passing, Ruthie has vowed to continue her activism.  Ruthie said of her wife: ``Connie took on responsibilities as an  activist with the belief that her role had a beginning, a middle, and  an end. Working to pass the Ruthie and Connie LGBT Elder Americans Act  was Connie's last political action before she passed away on May 27,  2018. I hope Congress will honor Connie by passing this law so, like  Connie, all LGBT older adults can age with the dignity and respect they  deserve. Let's make this happen.''   Mr. Speaker, I couldn't agree with her more. Today, in honor of  Connie's life, I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in  cosponsoring this legislation. Together, we can take another step  toward equality for LGBT older Americans.                            ____________________
