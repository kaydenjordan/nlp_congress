 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas for  yielding, and I thank him for his work.   Madam Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1994, the Setting  Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act.   I would like to thank Chairman Neal and Ranking Member Brady for  their leadership on this important piece of legislation.   For families in my district, putting away enough money for retirement  is a constant struggle. Now more than ever, we need policies that  empower workers to save more and save earlier for retirement.   I am pleased this legislation includes a provision I coauthored with  my colleague from Delaware (Ms. Blunt Rochester). Our bipartisan  provision clarifies rules surrounding annuity plans, making it possible  for more employers to provide guaranteed lifetime income products as  part of their benefits package. Our goal is to remove barriers to  saving and give workers a variety of tools so they can choose what  option best fits their needs.   Madam Speaker, we have a retirement income crisis in this country,  and the SECURE Act will help more Americans retire with dignity and  piece of mind. I urge its passage today.
