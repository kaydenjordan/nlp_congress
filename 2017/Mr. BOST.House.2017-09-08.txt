 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Alli Ragan, a  native of Carbondale, Illinois, on winning a silver medal at the 2017  World Wrestling Championships in Paris last month.   Alli, the Pan American champion, won silver for the second straight  year, and her strong performance helped propel the U.S. team to a  second place finish in the tournament.   Alli, southern Illinois is extremely proud of you, and we look  forward to cheering you on for many years to come.                            ____________________
