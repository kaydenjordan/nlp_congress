 Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, since the courts have weighed in,  Democrats have been attempting to use the securities laws to mandate  the disclosure of  [[Page H6536]]  companies' political spending activities in order to name and shame  companies from engaging in such free speech activity.   Time and time again, when the issue of political disclosure has come  up as a shareholder proposal at every company's annual proxy meeting  where it has been proposed, it has been shot down. It has been  defeated.   In fact, according to Proxy Monitor, the average percentage vote in  favor of a political disclosure shareholder proposal in 2016 was just  23 percent support. Shareholders have repeatedly weighed in against  requiring disclosure of this information and do not believe it is  important in making their own investment decisions regarding that  company.   Our securities laws and disclosure requirements have always centered  on the concept of materiality, as determined by the Supreme Court,  whether an omitted fact is material by looking at ``whether there is a  substantial likelihood that a reasonable shareholder would consider it  important in deciding how to vote.''   In fact, under the Obama administration, former SEC Chair Mary Jo  White declined to advance a political disclosure rule, stating it was  ``not one of the priorities we are advancing.''   Additionally, former Chair White was vocal about ensuring that  disclosures were not causing informational overload for investors. As a  member of the Financial Services Committee, we heard repeated-- repeated--testimony on that fact.   This provision to prevent the SEC from issuing a political disclosure  rule has continually been part of appropriations packages that have  been signed into law by Presidents of both parties and should continue  to stay as part of this package.                                time  2045    Now, earlier you heard that the mission of the SEC is to provide  transparency. Let me read exactly what the mission of the Securities  and Exchange Commission is:   ``The mission of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is to  protect investors; maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and  facilitate capital formation.''   This simply does not fit into that tripartite mission of the  Securities and Exchange Commission.   Now, with that being said, nothing--and let me repeat that, nothing-- prevents companies from voluntarily reporting this information if they  believe that it is important for them to make such disclosures or for  their shareholders to also vote that way.   So all companies, private and public, should remain free to do just  that: make that decision as they decide is the best course for that  particular company.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I will repeat a couple of things very  briefly.   All of these proxy proposals have garnered 23 percent, average,  support, so there is not widespread support among the investors.   And again, I will repeat that three-pronged mission that the  Securities and Exchange Commission has: ``protect investors; maintain  fair, orderly, and efficient markets; and facilitate capital  formation.'' This particular effort does none of those things, advances  none of those things, and that is why I oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time
