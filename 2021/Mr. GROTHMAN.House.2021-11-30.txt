 Madam Speaker, John Adams said that the Constitution  was made only for a moral and religious people and totally unfit for  any other kind.   How are we to know what John Adams meant by a ``moral and religious  people''?   In the 1600s, Massachusetts school children were required to study  the Bible. I don't think this was unusual for people who lived prior to  the time of the Revolution.  [[Page H6703]]    I am going to quote a little bit here from three of our Founders to  see what they felt about the Bible.   George Washington, ``It is impossible to govern the world without God  and the Bible. Of all of the dispositions and habits that lead to  political prosperity, our religion and morality are the indispensable  supporters.''   John Jay, the original Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. I  wonder if the Chief Justice would say this today. ``The Bible is the  best of all books, for it is the Word of God and teaches us the way to  be happy in this world and in the next. Continue therefore to read it  and to regulate your life by its precepts.''   I will go back to John Adams one more time. ``Suppose a Nation in  some distant region should take the Bible for their only law book, and  every member should regulate his conduct by the precepts there  exhibited. Every member would be obliged in conscience, to temperance,  frugality, and industry; to justice, kindness, and charity towards his  fellow men; and to piety, love, and reverence toward Almighty God . . .  What a Eutopia, what a paradise would this region be.''   It is primarily important to read the Bible to understand the history  of the world, the commandments we are to live by, and also the life of  Jesus Christ.   I may also point out, in particular, we should pay attention to the  books of the Old Testament in learning lessons that God taught Israel.   We cannot understand our Constitution without a thorough reading of  the Bible, and, therefore, I don't think you can be a decent  congressman without a thorough reading of the Bible, which is why we  have National Bible Week today. I hope as many Members as possible read  the Bible themselves.    Madam Speaker, prior to talking about the  reconciliation bill that passed last time we were here, I want to spend  just a second to talk about possible shortages in the food chain that  have been brought to my attention. I am not sure the administration is  doing enough to deal with the problem.   As with so many other things in today's world economy, critical  ingredients, including glucosaminide, are produced abroad in China and  Europe. These chemicals, including other things such as potash  fertilizer, are sitting in ships and not available for the United  States.                                time  2045    Our farmers only have one time a year to plant their crops. It is not  like a factory when something is not available, you can just start up  the factory again in 3 months. And we have real problems out there that  I think have some farmers very concerned and some feed co-ops very  concerned. I have not heard about this a lot. Though, whenever I tour  my manufacturers, I hear the same thing.   It is not unusual that some of these chemicals, which are very  important to today's agriculture, have gone up five times over what  they were this time last year. Well, you can see what that is going to  do to the cost of food, even if we get stuff. But I strongly encourage  the Biden administration to educate themselves on shortages, which are  hurting agriculture right now, to do something at the docks, to see if  he could bring Congress in to maybe change the laws or do something  about the draconian new laws they passed in California, making it more  difficult to get these chemicals on trucks.   But I do this just to warn people, in case anybody is listening from  the Biden administration, and we will send them letters as well, if you  want to avoid possible food shortages, dramatic increases in the cost  of food, you have got to act now because farmers who are producing the  corn and producing the soybeans are getting worried. And as far as I  can see, rightfully so.                                  Vitamin D     Madam Speaker, the next issue that I am going to bring  up is concerning vitamin D.   I haven't talked about vitamin D from this platform for quite a  while. I know some people are worried that if you talk about it, it  might discourage people from getting a vaccine, but I know somebody  else who passed away in the last few weeks and I don't believe they  were taking the amount of vitamin D that is recommended.   Vitamin D is very important for a variety of things: Bone health,  preventing a variety of diseases. But the evidence suggests it could be  very important in reducing both the severity and the amount of COVID.  The number of Americans who are vitamin D deficient is very high. I  don't normally like to talk about racial things, but I want to read  some statistics that some people back home can take.   Right now, there is disagreement as to the appropriate amount of  vitamin D a person should have in their system, the number of nanograms  per milliliter. Some people feel it is 20. Some people feel it is 30.  But let's assume, for the sake of an argument, that it should be 30.  Right now, 65 percent of the White population of this country would be  considered vitamin D deficient; 80 percent of the Hispanic population  would be considered vitamin D deficient; and 96 percent of the Black  population would be considered vitamin D deficient.   It is my opinion, and the opinion of the experts, that one reason  certain groups have more people dying of this horrible disease is  because of the much-elevated vitamin D deficiency. The way to handle it  is simple: You should be taking vitamin D on a daily basis. We are told  that Anthony Fauci takes 6,000 units a day. I don't know if that is  true or not. I wish he would talk about it a lot more, if he does.   But you have to remember, when you begin to take vitamin D, it  doesn't get in your system right away. If you begin to take vitamin D  today, it may get in your system 4 weeks from now. It may not get in  your system until 30 weeks from now.   There is a more expensive form of vitamin D called calcifediol, which  works in hours, not weeks or months. Unfortunately, that formula, which  is readily available, I am told, in Australia, is quite expensive. I  would encourage people who are interested in it to familiarize  themselves with how to get ahold of it and educate their own doctors as  to how to get ahold of it, because if you do get COVID, a lot of times  doctors now are prescribing vitamin D for people. But despite  prescribing it for people, if they give them like 5,000 units a day,  you are not going to have that kick in for a month. So you should  familiarize yourself with how to get this fast-acting vitamin D, which  will help people quite a bit quicker.   There are a couple things I will point out to the public health  establishment that the experts in vitamin D can't understand. First of  all, if you come in for an annual checkup, particularly an older  person, you ought to be tested for vitamin D to find out whether you  are deficient or not. It is not that expensive. It is something that  should be done automatically. And if you are diagnosed with COVID,  again, you should right away be tested for vitamin D deficiency,  because if you are deficient, things can be done. People suggest taking  as many as 50,000 units in a week if it is determined you are vitamin D  deficient.   But in any event, I would strongly encourage the CDC and NIH to do  more research regarding vitamin D. Again, I would strongly encourage  them to make a vitamin D test both in the annual checkup and it is  something all hospitals should be doing if people come in and they find  out they are COVID positive.   I will also point out, we do not know yet whether this omicron  variant, there are indications that it is going to be a little bit more  difficult to be taken care of with a vaccine. And it is another reason  why people ought to be paying more attention to vitamin D.   It is my personal opinion--nobody knows the amount of lives that can  be saved, but depending upon who the experts are that you are talking  to, to guess maybe on the low side, maybe 25 percent; on the high side,  over 50 percent. And the fact that this relatively cheap vitamin has  been out there for 2 years and has been left relatively untouched by  the public health establishment is, I think, a scandal. But I would  strongly encourage anybody that is listening today to familiarize  yourself with vitamin D, talk it over with your doctor, and get a  vitamin D test.                             Reconciliation Bill     Now, the reason I originally asked to speak today was  with regard to the reconciliation bill. I think it is something that  Americans should be paying attention to, not because of the cost,  though the cost is horrific, and it is going to result in still more  inflation and still more destruction of the value of the dollar. I  think there are three areas that would permanently change America. I  hope it is something that the public can bring up prior to the Senate  taking up the bill.    The number one issue is immigration. We are at a time where,  depending on the month, over 100,000 people can come cross our southern  border. The bill responds by changing the law and making up to 7  million people who  [[Page H6708]]  are currently in this country illegally, setting them on a path to  citizenship. It is changing things so it will be more difficult to  deport felons, even felons who have committed felonies.   My goodness, if you are not going to deport a felon who has committed  a felony, who are you going to deport? You are taking away the  flexibility as to whether you can deport them or not.   In this bill, we are giving free Pell grants, which are the grants we  give to people to go to college. We are giving these away to illegal  immigrants. I think this is such a bizarre decision because it is not  difficult to find Americans who are $30,000, $40,000, $50,000 in debt  because they are regular, middle-class, hardworking families, but we  are giving the people who come here illegally free college.   I just think that it is such a bizarre decision, but it goes to the  apparent attempt of the Biden administration and the majority party to  do all they can to get as many people here as possible. I will point  out, in this bill there was no money for new Border Patrol agents,  which is another green light to have more people come here.   Right now, the drug gangs will use this information, perhaps on ads  on Central American television, to tell people now is the time to give  the drug gangs $3,000, $5,000, $8,000 to come to the United States.   A couple other comments on what is going on at the border: Last time  I was down there, I saw on the path leading to this country, thrown- away identifications--like driver's licenses being thrown away.   You have to ask yourselves, if people are coming to this country and  throwing away their identification from Honduras, from Venezuela, from  Brazil, wherever, why are they doing that? Why do you not want people  to know what name you operated under in your prior country is? I can  only think because you are running away from something in the past.  This is common among the people that are coming here now.   There are two other things I am going to point out for America, one  is: They should weigh in with Congress on this significant bill. We are  having the government take care of all the three- and four-year-olds.   As I said before, insofar as we have flaws in our education system,  it is more in the middle-school area, not the preschool area.  Traditionally, in this country we are supposed to be a country of  strong families in which parents raise their children. It is a  fundamental change, I think, in the role of government for Congress to  pass a law saying from here on out it is up to the government to take  care of the three- and four-year-olds.   The other thing I want America to look out for is 85,000 IRS agents.  That is such a massive amount. I used to do taxes. I am somewhat  familiar with audits. It is not going to be pleasant for Americans, and  at a time when every business I can think of--manufacturing, tourism,  agriculture, medical field--everybody is short of people to work.   And how are we responding? Let's take 85,000 people and have them  work for the IRS. Manufacturing needs those people. Hospitals need  those people. Why in the world, 85,000 IRS agents? And, of course, the  amount of jobs that will be necessary is multiplied because if you have  more IRS agents poking around the businesses, you have to hire more  accountants to deal with the IRS agents.   So that is a very strange decision. But to me, it shows that this  administration wants to be the surveillance administration. And that is  another fundamental change in the way I think our forefathers imagined  this country or the way this country should be.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the remainder of my time.                            ____________________
