 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Section 3 of House Resolution  305, I am submitting the following explanatory material to accompany  Division N--Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017--of  H.R. 244, Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017.      DIVISION N--INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2017         The following is the explanation of the Intelligence       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.        This explanation reflects the status of negotiations and       disposition of issues reached between the House Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Select       Committee on Intelligence (hereinafter, ``the Agreement'').       The explanation shall have the same effect with respect to       the implementation of this Act as if it were a joint       explanatory statement of a conference committee.        The explanation comprises three parts: an overview of the       application of the annex to accompany this statement;       unclassified congressional direction; and a section-by-      section analysis of the legislative text.                Part I: Application of the Classified Annex         The classified nature of U.S. intelligence activities       prevents the congressional intelligence committees from       publicly disclosing many details concerning the conclusions       and recommendations of the Agreement. Therefore, a classified       Schedule of Authorizations and a classified annex have been       prepared to describe in detail the scope and intent of the       congressional intelligence committees' actions. The Agreement       authorizes the Intelligence Community (IC) to obligate and       expend funds not altered or modified by the classified       Schedule of Authorizations as requested in the President's       budget, subject to modification under applicable       reprogramming procedures.        The classified annex is the result of negotiations between       the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the       Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. It reconciles the       differences between the committees' respective versions of       the bill for the National Intelligence Program (NIP) and the       Homeland Security Intelligence Program (HSIP) for Fiscal Year       2017. The Agreement also makes recommendations for the       Military Intelligence Program (MIP), and the Information       Systems Security Program (ISSP), consistent with the National       Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, and provides       certain direction for these two programs.        The Agreement supersedes the classified annexes to the       reports accompanying: H.R. 5077, as passed by the House on       May 24, 2016; H.R. 6393, as passed by the House on November       20, 2016; H.R. 6480, as passed by the House on December 8,       2016; S. 3017, as reported by the Senate Select Committee on       Intelligence on June 6, 2016; and S. 133, as reported by the       Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on January 20, 2017.       All references to the House-passed and Senate-reported       annexes are solely to identify the heritage of specific       provisions.        The classified Schedule of Authorizations is incorporated       into the bill pursuant to Section 102. It has the status of       law. The classified annex supplements and adds detail to       clarify the authorization levels found in the bill and the       classified Schedule of Authorizations. The classified annex       shall have the same legal force as the report to accompany       the bill.            Part II: Select Unclassified Congressional Direction       Managing intelligence community personnel        This Agreement by the congressional intelligence committees       accepts the Senate's recommendations that IC elements should       build, develop, and maintain a workforce appropriately       balanced among its civilian, military and contractor       workforce sectors to meet the missions assigned to it in law       and by the president. The Agreement recognizes that the size       and shape of the IC's multi-sector workforce should be based       on mission needs, and encourages the IC to adjust its       reliance on contractors when appropriate, both as a matter of       general policy and as a way to conserve resources. The       flexibility afforded in this provision should support this       position. In addition, section 103 provides an increase in       the number of civilian personnel authorized in the Schedule       of Authorizations for the purposes of such contractor       conversions in the interim for the remainder of fiscal year       2017. Nothing precludes the Congress from addressing the end       strength for any element or office of the IC in the annual       authorization bills.        Therefore, the committees direct that the ODNI provide the       congressional intelligence committees briefings on the       workforce initiative as directed in section 306, beginning       July 1, 2017, and each 120 days thereafter until July 1,       2018, with benchmarks and milestones, for IC elements to       manage a multi-sector workforce without personnel ceilings  [[Page H3299]]       starting in fiscal year 2019. The ODNI, in coordination with       the IC elements, shall establish a common methodology for       collecting and reporting data, and include new exhibits in       the annual congressional budget justification books that       display full-time equivalents (government civilians, core       contractors, non-core contractors, and military personnel),       by program, expenditure center and project.        In the absence of authorized position ceiling levels,       agencies will be bound to authorized and appropriated       personal services funding levels.        Further, the transfer of non-personal services funding in       below-threshold reprogramming is a concern to the committees.       Therefore, the committees direct agencies to provide a       written notification to the committees of any realignment       and/or reprogramming of funding between personal services and       non-personal services.      Commercial Geospatial Intelligence Strategy        The congressional intelligence committees applaud the       National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) for issuing its       October 2015 Commercial Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT)       Strategy, which states a goal of fostering a ``more diverse,       resilient, agile, and responsive GEOINT program that provides       seamless user access to the best mix of commercial GEOINT . .       . to fulfill National System for Geospatial-Intelligence       (NSG) and Allied System for Geospatial-Intelligence (ASG)       mission needs.'' The committees also find merit in the NGA's       ``GEOINT Pathfinder'' project, which seeks to maximize the       use of unclassified and commercially available data sources       that can be easily and rapidly shared with a variety of       military, United States and allied government, and non-      government customers, and supports the project's continuation       and expansion.        The committees further commend the NGA for pursuing new       methods of intelligence collection and analysis to inform,       complement, and add to its support of warfighter requirements       by looking to emerging commercial technology providers,       including small satellite companies, which hold the promise       of rapid technological innovation and potentially significant       future cost savings to the U.S. taxpayer. The committees       further encourage the Director of the NGA to ensure       sufficient funding is available to acquire new, unclassified       sources, including commercial satellite imagery providing       unprecedented global persistence, as well as products and       services that provide information and context about changes       relevant to geospatial intelligence. The committees also       encourage the NGA to pursue new business models, including       commercial acquisition practices, to enable the NGA's access       to data, products, and services in ways consistent with best       commercial practices.        The committees fully support the NGA's course of action in       partnering with the commercial GEOINT industry to meet future       warfighter intelligence requirements, while recognizing the       need to take appropriate steps to protect national security,       and encourage the Director of the NGA and the Under Secretary       of Defense for Intelligence to keep the committees informed       of their progress in implementing this strategy. Therefore,       this Agreement directs the Department of Defense (DoD), in       building future-year budgets, to ensure continued funding is       provided for implementation, through at least Fiscal Year       2021, of the Commercial Geospatial Intelligence Strategy       issued by the NGA in October 2015.      Space Launch Facilities        The congressional intelligence committees continue to       believe it is critical to preserve a variety of launch range       capabilities to support national security space missions.       Spaceports or launch and range complexes may provide       capabilities to reach mid-to-low or polar-to-high inclination       orbits. The committees believe an important component of this       effort may be state-owned and operated spaceports that are       commercially licensed by the Federal Aviation Administration,       which leverage non-federal public and private investments to       bolster U.S. launch capabilities. Additionally, the       committees believe that these facilities may be able to       provide additional flexibility and resilience to the Nation's       launch infrastructure, especially as the nation considers       concepts such as the reconstitution of satellites to address       the growing foreign counterspace threat. The committees note       recent testimony by the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force,       General Mark Welsh, who stated,        As we look at this space enterprise and how we do it       differently in the future, as we look more at disaggregation,       microsats, cube sats, small sats, things that don't have to       go from a large launch complex all the time, I think       proliferating launch complexes is probably going to be a       natural outshoot of this. I think it's commercially viable,       it may be a way for companies to get into the launch business       who could not afford to get into it or don't see a future in       it and for large national security space launches, but I       think this has got to be part of the strategy that this whole       national team puts together as we look to the future.        Therefore, the Agreement directs the IC, in partnership       with the U.S. Air Force, to consider the role and       contribution of spaceports or launch and range complexes to       our national security space launch capacity, and directs the       Office of the Director of National Intelligence, in       consultation with the Department of Defense and the U.S. Air       Force, to brief the congressional intelligence committees on       their plans to utilize such facilities within 90 days of       enactment of this Act.      National Reconnaissance Office Workforce Optimization           Strategy        The congressional intelligence committees have had       longstanding interest in, and support for, a permanent       government cadre to provide the National Reconnaissance       Office (NRO) with a stable, expert acquisition workforce. The       committees applaud the substantial progress that the NRO has       made in the past year in this regard. The committees have       parallel interests in providing the IC with flexibility to       manage a multi-sector workforce and in continuing the       reduction in the reliance on contractors.        Therefore, the Agreement directs the NRO to conduct a       workforce review to optimize the mix between government       civilians and contractors and report to the committees with a       strategy within 90 days of enactment of this Act.      Guidance and reporting requirement regarding interactions           between the intelligence community and entertainment           industry.        The congressional intelligence committees believe that       there are important, valid reasons for elements of the IC to       engage with the entertainment industry, among other things to       ensure the correction of inaccuracies, demonstrate the IC's       commitment to transparency, and to ensure that the IC       recruits and retains highly qualified personnel to the       fullest extent possible. The committees further believe that       IC engagement with the entertainment industry should be       conducted in the most cost effective and deliberate fashion       possible, while ensuring that classified information is       protected from unauthorized disclosure.        These engagements--some of which have been described in       partially-declassified inspector general reports--cost       taxpayer dollars, raise potential ethics concerns, increase       the risk of disclosure of classified information, and consume       the time and attention of IC personnel responsible for United       States national security. Neither the production of       entertainment nor the self-promotion of IC entities are       legitimate purposes for these engagements.      Review of the National Intelligence University        The National Intelligence University (NIU) has made       significant progress in recent years in its transition from a       defense intelligence college to a national intelligence       university that provides advanced education in a classified       format. Such advanced education is integral to making       intelligence a profession with recognized standards for       performance and ethics and fostering an integrated IC       workforce. While progress has been significant since the       Director of National Intelligence (DNI) and Secretary of       Defense agreed to redesignate Defense Intelligence Agency's       (DIA) National Defense Intelligence College as NIU in 2011,       the institution must continue to adapt to functioning as a       university with a robust research agenda, and to serving the       entire IC, not just elements of DoD.        Fiscal years 2017 and 2018 are of great significance for       NIU, as it moves its principal facility to the IC Campus at       Bethesda, completes activities associated with its 2018       decennial regional accreditation reaffirmation, and receives       a new president. The congressional intelligence committees       believe that these developments position NIU to make further       progress in its vision to become the center of academic life       for the IC.        To guide these next steps, the Agreement directs DIA, in       coordination with ODNI and the Office of the Under Secretary       of Defense for Intelligence, to, no later than 30 days after       enactment of this Act, select a five member, external, and       independent panel to conduct a review of NIU. The panel shall       submit a report detailing the results of such review to the       congressional intelligence and defense committees within 180       days of enactment of this Act. The panel should be composed       of recognized academics, personnel from other DoD joint       professional military education institutions, national       security experts, and at least one member of NIU's Board of       Visitors.        This review and the resulting report shall, among other       things, assess:        (1) Methods for ensuring a student body that is more       representative of all IC elements;        (2) Incentives for IC elements to send personnel to NIU to       earn a degree or certificate, to include designating       attendance at NIU as positions reimbursable by ODNI and       requiring IC elements to employ the workforce concept of       ``float'' for personnel enrolled in higher-education       programs;        (3) How certificate programs align with NIU's unique value       as an institution of advanced intelligence education;        (4) Methods to enhance NIU's research program, to include       publication of a journal, hosting of conferences and other       collaborative fora, and more formalized relationships with       intelligence studies scholars;        (5) Whether and how educational components of other IC       elements could provide educational offerings as part of the       NIU curriculum;        (6) Potential advantages and risks associated with       alternative governance models for NIU, to include moving it       under the auspices of ODNI; and        (7) The feasibility and resource constraints of NIU       tailoring degree offerings to meet the needs of IC personnel       at different stages in their careers, similar to DoD's joint       professional military education model.  [[Page H3300]]           Cost of living consideration        The congressional intelligence committees are concerned       with the high cost of living for military, civilian, and       contractor personnel at overseas Combatant Command       intelligence centers. Although the committees recognize the       benefits of co-locating intelligence analysts with the       operational commander, the intelligence centers for both U.S.       European Command (USEUCOM) and U.S Africa Command (USAFRICOM)       are located over 600 miles from their Combatant Command       headquarters. Combatant Commanders based in the United States       regularly communicate with forward deployed units, and the       USEUCOM and USAFRICOM intelligence centers have developed       mechanisms to effectively employ various teleconferencing and       virtual communication tools to ensure collaboration across       large distances.        The congressional intelligence committees are concerned       that despite the utility of these virtual collaboration       tools, DoD has not taken action to reduce the number of       intelligence personnel stationed in high cost of living       areas. These costs can exceed $65,000 per person, per year in       annual cost of living allowances compared to the continental       United States (CONUS) expenses. The additional costs       associated with stationing intelligence personnel in high-      cost overseas locations detract from other critical       intelligence priorities. The committees are further concerned       that DoD does not adequately account for the long-run expense       of high costs of living when selecting locations for       intelligence facilities.        Therefore, the Agreement directs the DIA to evaluate       alternate mechanisms for staffing overseas Combatant Command       intelligence centers, particularly those that are not co-      located with Combatant Command headquarters, and to identify       cost-savings opportunities by shifting personnel to lower       cost locations, including in the continental United States.      Defense Intelligence Agency education opportunities        DIA presently allows DIA employees to receive pay for a       single year only while attending certain graduate degree       programs on a full-time basis. Employees may pursue such       opportunities at the National Intelligence University and       similar institutions; and, in certain circumstances, also at       public and private civilian universities. However, the one-      year limit discourages DIA personnel from pursuing multi-year       graduate degree programs. Expanding DIA's program to allow       highly qualified DIA employees to pursue multi-year graduate       degree programs from accredited civilian universities would       further improve retention, recruitment, and foster diversity       of thought at DIA.        Therefore, the Agreement directs DIA, no later than 180       days after the enactment of this Act, to:        (1) Provide for and fund a program that allows for DIA       employees to attend civilian graduate degree programs for up       to two years each, based on the standard length of the       relevant program, provided that:        (a) Where DIA deems appropriate, employees may pursue       academic programs extending beyond two years. Consistent with       current practices, the program should be made available to at       least five employees each year, with each employee receiving       a full-time salary while participating in the program; and        (b) Each DIA participant shall be subject to any program       approvals, service obligations, repayment obligations, and       other requirements pertaining to academic programs, as       prescribed by applicable laws and policies.        (2) Brief the congressional intelligence committees on the       status of the program's implementation.      Mental health prevalence        The congressional intelligence committees are committed to       supporting the men and women of the IC, who bravely risk       their lives serving their country as civilians in conflict       zones and other dangerous locations around the world. These       individuals often serve next to their military counterparts       in areas of active hostilities. As such, they are often       exposed to many of the emotional stresses generally       associated with a tour of duty abroad. The committees believe       there are deficiencies and inconsistencies in the pre- and       post-deployment mental health and wellness services available       to civilian employees.        Therefore, the Agreement directs the National Security       Agency (NSA), NGA, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and       DIA, no later than 180 days after the enactment of this Act,       to provide a joint briefing to the congressional intelligence       committees on the mental health screenings and related       services that these agencies offer employees, both before and       after they deploy to combat zones. Such briefing shall       include a description of:        (1) Existing services available;        (2) Agency resources for and analysis of these services,       including the frequency of use by employees compared to the       total number returning from deployment; and        (3) How agencies with deployed civilian employees are       sharing best practices and leveraging services or resources       outside their agencies.      Review of the Office of the Director of National Intelligence        It has been more than ten years since the Congress       established the position of the Director of National       Intelligence (DNI) in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism       Prevention Act of 2004, building on its predecessor, the       Director of Central Intelligence. Given this experience and       the evolving security environment, the committees believe it       appropriate to review the DNI's roles, missions and functions       and adapt its authorities, organization and resources as       needed.        Therefore, the Agreement directs the President to form an       independent, external panel of at least five individuals with       significant intelligence and national security expertise to       review ODNI's roles, missions and functions and make       recommendations, as needed, regarding its authorities,       organization and resources. The panel shall:        (1) Evaluate ODNI's ability to fulfill the responsibilities       assigned to it in law given its current scope and structure;        (2) Assess whether any roles and responsibilities currently       assigned to the DNI could be more effectively or efficiently       executed by other IC components or government agencies       outside the IC;        (3) Analyze the personnel, funding, and authorities       required for each component of ODNI to perform each of its       assigned responsibilities;        (4) Evaluate the organizational structure of ODNI;        (5) Review the size, role, purpose and function of ODNI's       mission centers;        (6) Assess the value of the national intelligence manager       construct;        (7) Review the size and mix of the ODNI workforce--to       include the ratio between cadre and detailees, the balance       between government and contractors, and grade structure--to       perform its roles, missions and functions; and        (8) Make recommendations regarding the above.        The Agreement directs the President, no later than 30 days       after the enactment of this Act, to select the individuals       who will serve on the external panel and notify the       congressional intelligence committees of such selection.        In addition, the Agreement directs the panel, no later than       180 days after the enactment of this Act, to provide a report       on this review to the congressional intelligence committees.       This report shall be unclassified, but may contain a       classified annex. The Agreement further directs ODNI to       reimburse the Executive Office of the President for any costs       associated with the review.      Improving pre-publication review        The congressional intelligence committees are concerned       that current and former IC personnel have published written       material without completing mandatory pre-publication review       procedures or have rejected changes required by the review       process, resulting in the publication of classified       information. The committees are particularly troubled by       press reports suggesting that officials are unaware of the       existence or scope of pre-publication review requirements.        The committees are also aware of the perception that the       pre-publication review process can be unfair, untimely, and       unduly onerous--and that these burdens may be at least       partially responsible for some individuals ``opting out'' of       the mandatory review process. The committees further       understand that IC agencies' pre-publication review       mechanisms vary, and that there is no binding, IC-wide       guidance on the subject.        The committees believe that all IC personnel must be made       aware of pre-publication review requirements and that the       review process must yield timely, reasoned, and impartial       decisions that are subject to appeal. The committees also       believe that efficiencies can be identified by limiting the       information subject to pre-publication review, to the fullest       extent possible, to only those materials that might       reasonably contain or be derived from classified information       obtained during the course of an individual's association       with the IC. In short, the pre-publication review process       should be improved to better incentivize compliance and to       ensure that personnel fulfill their commitments.        Therefore, the Agreement directs that, no later than 180       days after the enactment of this Act, the DNI shall issue an       IC-wide policy regarding pre-publication review. The DNI       shall transmit this policy to the congressional intelligence       committees concurrently with its issuance. The policy should       require each IC agency to develop and maintain a pre-      publication policy that contains, at a minimum, the following       elements:        (1) Identification of the individuals subject to pre-      publication review requirements (``covered individuals'');        (2) Guidance on the types of information that must be       submitted for pre-publication review, including works (a)       unrelated to an individual's IC employment; or (b) published       in cooperation with a third party, e.g.--        (a) Authored jointly by covered individuals and third       parties;        (b) Authored by covered individuals but published under the       name of a third party; or        (c) Authored by a third party but with substantial input       from covered individuals.        (3) Guidance on a process by which covered individuals can       participate in pre-publication reviews, and communicate       openly and frequently with reviewers;        (4) Requirements for timely responses, as well as reasoned       edits and decisions by reviewers;        (5) Requirements for a prompt and transparent appeal       process;        (6) Guidelines for the assertion of interagency equities in       pre-publication review;  [[Page H3301]]         (7) A summary of the lawful measures each agency may take       to enforce its policy, to include civil and criminal       referrals; and        (8) A description of procedures for post-publication review       of documents that are alleged or determined to reveal       classified information but were not submitted for pre-      publication review.        Additionally, the Agreement directs ODNI, no later than 180       days after the enactment of this Act, to provide to the       congressional intelligence committees a report on the       adequacy of IC information technology efforts to improve and       expedite pre-publication review processes, and the resources       needed to ensure that IC elements can meet this direction.        The Agreement further directs the DNI, no later than 270       days after the enactment of this Act, to certify to the       congressional intelligence committees that IC elements' pre-      publication review policies, non-disclosure agreements, and       any other agreements imposing pre-publication review       obligations reflect the policy described above.

However, the soaring cost of college and post-      graduate education in the United States is causing many young       people to forgo public service in favor of career       opportunities with more competitive pay or loan forgiveness       benefits.        Therefore, the Agreement directs ODNI, no later than 180       days after the enactment of this Act, to provide a report to       the congressional intelligence committees on programs that       seek to help IC personnel manage student loan debt. The       report shall include details about each IC element's program,       including loan forgiveness, loan repayment, and financial       counseling programs; efforts to inform prospective and       current employees about such programs; and the number of       employees who use such programs The report shall also include       an analysis of the benefits and drawbacks of creating new       programs and expanding existing programs, and shall identify       any barriers to the establishment of IC-wide programs      Workforce development partnership        The congressional intelligence committees have long       promoted novel recruiting, hiring, and retention practices,       especially with respect to highly expert, highly sought-after       Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) students       and professionals. Despite these efforts, the IC continues to       struggle with meeting STEM recruitment, hiring, and retention       goals inside the IC.        The committees are therefore encouraged to learn that the       IC is considering new and creative practices in this regard.       For example, the committees were intrigued by the Pacific       Northwest National Laboratory's (PNNL) budding Workforce       Development Partnership with the CIA. Partnerships like this       may allow IC agencies to leverage PNNL's robust employee       recruiting network and seek out STEM students who might not       otherwise consider IC employment.        Similarly, to address concerns that potential hires will       accept other job offers while awaiting clearances, NGA has a       program to allow interim hires to work on unclassified       projects until clearances are adjudicated. In addition,       several IC agencies have instituted a unique pay scale for       their junior STEM workforce. The committees recognize the       benefits of these initiatives, and believes that such efforts       could have wider applicability across the IC.        Therefore, the Agreement directs the DNI Chief Human       Capital Officer, no later than 180 days after the enactment       of this Act, to provide to the congressional intelligence       committees an interagency briefing on new approaches,       including outreach and advertising, the IC is considering or       conducting to attract a diverse, robust Science, Technology,       Engineering, and Math and information technology workforce to       meet the increasing demands in the IC.      Distributed Common Ground/Surface System-Army        The congressional intelligence committees believe the       Distributed Common Ground/Surface System-Army (DCGS-A)       provides operational and tactical commanders with enhanced,       state-of-the-art intelligence, surveillance, and       reconnaissance (ISR) tasking, processing, exploitation, and       dissemination capabilities and connectivity to the defense       intelligence information enterprise. DCGS-A is a critical       tool for enabling military intelligence warfighters to       process, fuse, and exploit data. In the past, the Army has       struggled to keep pace for pre-deployment and in-theater       training for DCGS-A. However, training for military       intelligence analysts must be prioritized in the pre-      deployment readiness cycle to ensure that those using this       intelligence tool can effectively utilize its capabilities.        The Army has fielded over 95 percent of DCGS-A Increment 1       systems, with mixed results and often negative feedback from       the users. The Army is in the process of fielding Increment       1, Release 2, which will address many of the initial concerns       and deficiencies of Increment 1. The committees remain       concerned that the Army has not sufficiently planned for user       training in support of the release of Increment 1, Release 2       to operational users.        Therefore, the congressional intelligence committees       request that the Army, no later than 90 days after the       enactment of this Act, submit a plan to the congressional       intelligence and defense committees on how the Army will       fully incorporate Distributed Common Ground/Surface System-      Army (DCGS-A) training into the readiness cycle for Army       personnel. The plan should specifically address any lessons       learned from the fielding of DCGS-A Increment 1 and any       ongoing corrective actions to improve the roll-out of       Increment 1, Release 2.      Common controller for unmanned aircraft systems        The congressional intelligence committees support the       Army's efforts to develop a common controller for the RQ-7A/B       Shadow and the RQ-11B Raven tactical unmanned aerial       vehicles. However, the committees are concerned that the Army       is not collaborating with the Marine Corps on similar efforts       to develop a ground controller for the Marine Corps family of       tactical unmanned aerial systems (UAS), including the RQ-11B       Raven, the RQ-12A Wasp, and the RQ-20A Puma.        Therefore, the Agreement requests that the Army and the       Marine Corps Intelligence Activity (MCIA), no later than 90       days after the enactment of this Act, jointly submit a report       to the congressional intelligence and defense committees on       the feasibility of developing a common controller for all       Brigade and Below unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) airframes,       as well as U.S. Marine Corps small unit UAS. The report       should address the potential performance and operational       benefits of a common controller, anticipated development       costs, and anticipated life-cycle cost savings of a common       controller.      Review of dual-hatting relationship        The congressional intelligence committees support further       evaluation of the dual-hatting of a single individual as both       Commander of U.S. Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and Director of       the National Security Agency (DIRNSA).        Therefore, the Agreement directs the Secretary of Defense,       no later than 90 days after the enactment of this Act, to       provide to the congressional intelligence and defense       committees a briefing that reviews and provides an assessment       of the dual-hatting of DIRNSA and Commander, USCYBERCOM. This       briefing should address:        (1) Roles and responsibilities, including intelligence       authorities, of USCYBERCOM and NSA;        (2) Assessment of the current impact of the dual-hatting       relationship, including advantages and disadvantages;        (3) Plans and recommendations on courses of action that       would be necessary to end the dual-hatting of DIRNSA and       Commander, USCYBERCOM, which satisfy Section 1642 of the       conference report accompanying S. 2943, the National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017;        (4) Suggested timelines for carrying out such courses of       action;        (5) Recommendations for any changes in law that would be       required by the end of dual-hatting; and        (6) Any additional topics as identified by the intelligence       and defense committees.        The congressional intelligence committees further believe       that a larger organizational review of NSA should be       conducted with respect to the eventual termination of the       dual-hatting relationship. The congressional intelligence       committees seek to promote the efficient and effective       execution of NSA's national intelligence mission.       Specifically, the congressional intelligence committees       believe that the organization of NSA should be examined to       account for the evolution of its mission since its       establishment, the current structure of the intelligence       community, and the fact that the NSA is predominantly funded       through the NIP.        Therefore, the Agreement further directs the DNI, no later       than 120 days after the enactment of this Act, to conduct an       assessment and provide a briefing to the congressional       intelligence committees on options to better align the       structure, budgetary procedures, and oversight of NSA with       its national intelligence mission in the event of a       termination of the dual-hafting relationship. This briefing       should include:        (1) An assessment of the feasibility of transitioning NSA       to civilian leadership appointed by the DNI in lieu of       military leadership appointed by the Secretary of Defense;        (2) How NSA could be organizationally separated from DoD if       USCYBERCOM were elevated to become a unified combatant       command; and        (3) Any challenges, such as those requiring changes in law,       associated with such a separation.      Acquisition security improvement        The congressional intelligence committees remain concerned       about supply chain and cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the       IC. The committees believe the IC should implement a more       comprehensive approach to address these vulnerabilities,       particularly during the acquisition process. However, ICD       801, the IC guideline governing the acquisition process, is       outdated and must be revised to reflect current risks. In       particular, despite issuance of ICD 731, Supply Chain Risk       Management, in 2013, ICD 801 has not been updated to reflect       this policy nor does it include consideration of       cybersecurity vulnerabilities and mitigation.        Therefore, the Agreement directs ODNI, no later than 180       days after the enactment of this Act, to review and consider       amendments to Intelligence Community Directive (ICD) 801 to       better reflect and anticipate supply chain and cybersecurity       risks and threats, as well as to outline policies to mitigate       both risks and threats. In particular, the review should       examine whether to:  [[Page H3302]]         (1) Expand risk management criteria in the acquisition       process to include cyber and supply chain threats;        (2) Require counterintelligence and security assessments as       part of the acquisition and procurement process;        (3) Propose and adopt new education requirements for       acquisition professionals on cyber and supply chain threats;       and        (4) Factor in the cost of cyber and supply chain security.        The Agreement further directs ODNI, no later than 210 days       after the enactment of this Act, to provide to the       congressional intelligence committees a report describing the       review, including ODNI's process for considering amendments       to ICD 801, and specifically addressing ODNI's analysis and       conclusions with respect to paragraphs (1) through (4) above.      Cyber information sharing and customer feedback        The congressional intelligence committees commend NSA's new       policies and procedures to facilitate greater information       sharing of cyber threat indicators and defensive measures       with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) at the       unclassified level.        With the recent enactment of the Cybersecurity Act of 2015,       which encourages greater information sharing between private       sector stakeholders, as well as with government entities, the       committees believe the next step is to ensure the entire IC       is working to disseminate timely, actionable information to       private sector stakeholders so they can better protect their       information technology networks. The vast majority of U.S.       networks reside in the private sector, and it is good       governance to ensure that those networks are safe and secure       for the general public.        The committees appreciate that the IC has begun efforts to       increase unclassified cyber threat sharing. Because an       increase in the quantity of reporting does not necessarily       indicate effectiveness or usefulness, this Committee       continues to monitor the quality of the information       distributed.        Therefore, the Agreement directs ODNI, no later than 120       days after the enactment of this Act, to brief the       congressional intelligence committees on IC-wide efforts to       share more information with the Department of Homeland       Security (DHS) for further dissemination to the private       sector. This briefing shall specifically address types of       information shared, metrics on output, tabulation of low       output producing agencies, recommendations on how low output       agencies can increase sharing, timeliness of information       shared, and average total time it takes for information to       transit the system.        The Agreement also directs ODNI, in coordination with the       DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&A), to conduct a       survey of government and private sector participants of the       National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center       (NCCIC). The survey shall be anonymous, provide an accurate       assessment of the usefulness and timeliness of the data       received, and determine if customers are satisfied with       intelligence briefings on threat actors impacting their       specific industry. The Agreement further directs ODNI, no       later than one year after the enactment of this Act, to       provide to the congressional intelligence and homeland       security committees an unclassified report detailing the       results of this survey.      Department of Homeland Security utilization of National Labs           expertise        The congressional intelligence committees believe that the       Department of Energy (DOE) National Labs represent a unique       and invaluable resource for the government and the IC in       particular.        Therefore, the Agreement directs, no later than 180 days       after the enactment of this Act, DHS I&A, in coordination       with DOE Office of Intelligence and Counterintelligence (DOE-      IN), to provide to the congressional intelligence committees       a report on the current utilization of Department of Energy       (DOE) National Labs expertise by DHS I&A. This report should       address opportunities to increase DHS I&A's utilization of       cybersecurity expertise of the National Labs as well as the       budgetary implications of taking advantage of these potential       opportunities.      Cybersecurity courses for Centers of Academic Excellence        The congressional intelligence committees are concerned by       a recent analysis from a security firm, which determined that       not one of the nation's leading undergraduate computer       science programs requires students to take a cybersecurity       course before graduating. Cybersecurity depends on IC       professionals having a strong understanding of the cyber       threat and how to mitigate it--which in turn requires a       strong academic background. NSA and DHS cosponsor the Centers       of Academic Excellence (CAE) in Cyber Defense program, which       includes an emphasis on basic cybersecurity. Nevertheless,       even some CAE-designated institutions lack cybersecurity       course prerequisites in their computer science curricula.        Therefore, the Agreement directs ODNI, no later than 180       days after the enactment of this Act, to submit to the       congressional intelligence committees a report on improving       cybersecurity training within NIP-funded undergraduate and       graduate computer science programs. The report should       specifically address:        (1) The potential advantages and disadvantages of       conditioning an institution's receipt of such funds on its       computer science program's requiring cybersecurity as a       precondition to graduation;        (2) How Centers of Academic Excellence programs might       bolster cybersecurity educational requirements; and        (3) Recommendations to support the goal of ensuring that       federally-funded computer science programs properly equip       students to confront future cybersecurity challenges.   Part III: Section-by-Section Analysis and Explanation of Legislative                                    Text         The following is a section-by-section analysis and       explanation of the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal       Year 2017.                      Title I--Intelligence Activities       Section 101. Authorization of appropriations        Section 101 lists the United States Government departments,       agencies, and other elements for which the Act authorizes       appropriations for intelligence and intelligence-related       activities for Fiscal Year 2017.      Section 102. Classified Schedule of Authorizations        Section 102 provides that the details of the amounts       authorized to be appropriated for intelligence and       intelligence-related activities and the applicable personnel       levels by program for Fiscal Year 2017 are contained in the       classified Schedule of Authorizations and that the classified       Schedule of Authorizations shall be made available to the       Committees on Appropriations of the Senate and House of       Representatives and to the President.      Section 103. Personnel ceiling adjustments        Section 103 provides that the DNI may authorize employment       of civilian personnel in Fiscal Year 2017 in excess of the       number of authorized positions by an amount not exceeding       three percent of the total limit applicable to each IC       element under Section 102, and ten percent of the number of       civilian personnel authorized under such schedule for the       purposes of contractor conversions. The DNI may do so only if       necessary to the performance of important intelligence       functions.      Section 104. Intelligence Community Management Account        Section 104 authorizes appropriations for the Intelligence       Community Management Account (ICMA) of the DNI and sets the       authorized personnel levels for the elements within the ICMA       for Fiscal Year 2017.   Title II--Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System       Section 201. Authorization of appropriations        Section 201 authorizes appropriations in the amount of       $514,000,000 for Fiscal Year 2017 for the Central       Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund.             Title III--General Intelligence Community Matters       Section 301. Restriction on conduct of intelligence           activities        Section 301 provides that the authorization of       appropriations by the Act shall not be deemed to constitute       authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity that       is not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or laws of       the United States.      Section 302. Increase in employee compensation and benefits           authorized by law        Section 302 provides that funds authorized to be       appropriated by the Act for salary, pay, retirement, and       other benefits for federal employees may be increased by such       additional or supplemental amounts as may be necessary for       increases in compensation or benefits authorized by law.      Section 303. Support to nonprofit organizations assisting           intelligence community employees        Section 303 permits the DNI to engage in fundraising in an       official capacity for the benefit of nonprofit organizations       that provide support to surviving family members of a       deceased employee of an element of the IC or otherwise       provide support for the welfare, education, or recreation of       IC employees, former employees, or their family members.       Section 303 requires the DNI to issue regulations ensuring       that the fundraising authority is exercised consistent with       all relevant ethical limitations and principles. Section 303       further requires that the DNI and the Director of the CIA       notify the congressional intelligence committees within seven       days after they engage in such fundraising.      Section 304. Promotion of science, technology, engineering,           and mathematics education in the intelligence community        Section 304 requires the DNI to submit a five-year       investment strategy for outreach and recruiting efforts in       the fields of science, technology, engineering, and       mathematics (STEM), to include cybersecurity and computer       literacy. Section 304 further requires elements of the IC to       submit STEM investment plans supporting this strategy for       each of the fiscal years 2018 through 2022, along with the       materials justifying the budget request of each element for       these STEM recruiting and outreach activities.      Section 305. Retention of employees of the intelligence           community who have science, technology, engineering, or           mathematics expertise        Section 305 authorizes a new payscale to permit salary       increases for employees in the IC with STEM backgrounds.       Section 305 also requires notifications to individual       employees if a position is removed from this new payscale.       Section 305 further requires the head of each IC element to       submit to the congressional intelligence committees a report       on the new rates of pay and number of positions authorized       under this payscale.  [[Page H3303]]           Section 306. Management of intelligence community personnel        Section 306 prohibits the Congress's use of government       personnel ceilings in the management of the IC workforce       starting in Fiscal Year 2019. Section 306 requires the DNI to       provide briefings on the IC's initiative to maintain both       employees and contractors within the IC, as well as both a       briefing and a report on the methodology, cost analysis tool,       and implementation plans. Section 306 further requires the IC       IG to provide a written report on the accuracy of IC       workforce data. This section will align the IC's management       of personnel consistent with the practices of the Department       of Defense and other federal agencies.      Section 307. Modifications to certain requirements for           construction of facilities        Section 307 clarifies that the requirement to notify the       congressional intelligence committees of improvement projects       with an estimated cost greater than $1,000,000 for facilities       used primarily by IC personnel includes repairs and       modifications.      Section 308. Guidance and reporting requirement regarding           interactions between the intelligence community and           entertainment industry        Section 308 requires the DNI to issue public guidance       regarding engagements by elements of the Intelligence       Community with entertainment industry entities. The guidance       will include DNI providing an annual report to the       congressional intelligence committees detailing interactions       between the IC and the entertainment industry. Section 308       also requires the report to include a description of the       nature, duration, costs, benefits, and results of each       engagement, as well as a determination that each engagement       did not result in a disclosure of classified information and       whether any information was declassified for the disclosure.       Section 308 further requires that before an IC element may       engage with the entertainment industry, the head of       that element must approve the proposed engagement.       Contractual relationships for professional services and       technical expertise are exempt from these reporting       requirements.      Section 309. Protections for independent inspectors general           of elements of the intelligence community        Section 309 requires the ODNI to develop and implement a       uniform policy for each identified Inspector General (IG)       office in the IC to better ensure their independence. The       provision specifies elements to be incorporated in such a       policy including (a) guidance regarding conflicts of       interest, (b) standards to ensure independence, and (c) a       waiver provision. Section 309 further prohibits the DNI from       requiring an employee of an OIG to rotate to a position in       the element for which such office conducts oversight.      Section 310. Congressional oversight of policy directives and           guidance        Section 310 requires the DNI to submit to the congressional       intelligence committees notifications and copies of any       classified or unclassified Presidential Policy Directive,       Presidential Policy Guidance, or other similar policy       document issued by the President which assigns tasks, roles,       or responsibilities to the IC, within the specified       timeframes. Section 310 further requires the Director to       notify the congressional intelligence committees of guidance       to implement such policies.      Section 311. Notification of memoranda of understanding        Section 311 requires the head of each element of the IC to       submit to the congressional intelligence committees copies of       each memorandum of understanding or other agreement regarding       significant operational activities or policy entered into       between or among such element and any other entity or       entities of the federal government within specified       timeframes.        Section 311 does not require an IC element to submit to the       congressional intelligence committees any memorandum or       agreement that is solely administrative in nature, including       a memorandum or agreement regarding joint duty or other       routine personnel assignments. An IC element also may redact       any personally identifiable information from a memorandum or       agreement which must be submitted to the intelligence       committees.      Section 312. Technical correction to Executive Schedule        Section 312 contains a technical correction regarding the       annual rate of basic pay for the Director of the National       Counter Proliferation Center.      Section 313. Maximum amount charged for declassification           reviews        Section 313 prohibits the head of an element of the IC from       charging reproduction fees for a mandatory declassification       review in excess of reproduction fees that the head would       charge for a request for information under the Freedom of       Information Act (FOIA). It also permits agency heads to waive       processing fees for declassification reviews in the same       manner as for FOIA.    Title IV--Matters Relating to Elements of the Intelligence Community         Subtitle A--Office of the Director of National Intelligence       Section 401. Designation of the Director of the National           Counterintelligence and Security Center        Section 401 renames the National Counterintelligence       Executive as the ``National Counterintelligence and Security       Center,'' with conforming amendments.      Section 402. Analyses and impact statements by Director of           National Intelligence regarding proposed investment into           the United States        Section 402 directs the DNI to submit to the congressional       intelligence committees, after the completion of a review or       an investigation of any proposed investment into the United       States, any analytic materials prepared by the DNI. This       requirement includes, but is not limited to, national       security threat assessments provided to the Committee on       Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) in connection       with national security reviews and investigations conducted       by CFIUS pursuant to Section 721(b) of the Defense Production       Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 4565). This section is not intended to       limit the ability of the DNI to transmit supplementary       materials to the congressional intelligence committees along       with the threat assessments.        Section 402 also directs the DNI to provide the committees       with impact statements when the DNI determines a proposed       investment into the United States will have an operational       impact on the IC.      Section 403. Assistance for governmental entities and private           entities in recognizing online violent extremist content        Section 403 requires the DNI to publish on a publicly       available Internet website a list of all logos, symbols,       insignia, and other markings commonly associated with, or       adopted by, State Department-designated foreign terrorist       organizations.                   SUBTITLE B--CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY       Section 411. Enhanced death benefits for personnel of the           Central Intelligence Agency        Section 411 authorizes the Director of the CIA to pay death       benefits substantially similar to those authorized for       members of the Foreign Service, and requires the Director to       submit implementing regulations to the congressional       intelligence committees.      Section 412. Pay and retirement authorities of the Inspector           General of the Central Intelligence Agency        Section 412 amends the Central Intelligence Agency Act of       1949 to authorize the IC of the CIA to consider certain       positions as law enforcement officers for purposes of       calculating retirement eligibility and entitlements under       chapters 83 and 84 of title 5, United States Code, if such       officer or employee is appointed to a position with       responsibility for investigating suspected offenses against       the criminal laws of the United States. Section 412 may not       be construed to confer on the IG of the CIA, or any other       officer or employee of the CIA, any police or law enforcement       or internal security functions or authorities.                          SUBTITLE C--OTHER ELEMENTS       Section 421. Enhancing the technical workforce for the           Federal Bureau of Investigation        Section 421 requires the Federal Bureau of Investigation       (FBI) to produce a comprehensive strategic workforce report       to demonstrate progress in expanding initiatives to       effectively integrate information technology expertise in the       investigative process. Section 421 further requires the       report to include: (1) progress on training, recruitment, and       retention of cyber-related personnel; (2) an assessment of       whether FBI officers with these skill sets are fully       integrated in the FBI's workforce; (3) the FBI's       collaboration with the private sector on cyber issues; and       (4) an assessment of the utility of reinstituting and       leveraging the FBI Director's Advisory Board.      Section 422. Plan on assumption of certain weather missions           by the National Reconnaissance Office        Section 422 requires the Director of the NRO to develop a       plan to carry out certain space-based environmental       monitoring missions currently performed by the Air Force. It       also authorizes certain pre-acquisition activities and       directs that an independent cost estimate be submitted to the       congressional intelligence and defense committees. The       Director of NRO may waive the requirement of Section 422 if       the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology,       and Logistics, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff;       jointly submit a certification to the congressional       intelligence and defense committees.               Title V--Matters Relating to Foreign Countries       Section 501. Committee to counter active measures by the           Russian Federation to exert covert influence over peoples           and governments        Nothing in this section shall authorize the Committee to       take action with regard to activities protected by the First       Amendment. Section 501 requires the President to establish an       interagency committee to counter active measures by the       Russian Federation that constitute Russian actions to exert       covert influence over peoples and governments.      Section 502. Limitation on travel of accredited diplomats of           the Russian Federation in the United States from their           diplomatic post        Section 502 requires the Secretary of State, in       coordination with the Director of the FBI and the DNI, to       establish an advance notification regime governing all       Russian Federation accredited diplomatic and consular       personnel in the United States, as well as to take action to       secure compliance and address noncompliance with the       notification requirement. Section 502 also requires the       Secretary of State, the Director of the FBI,  [[Page H3304]]       and the DNI to develop written mechanisms to share such       travel information and address noncompliance. Section 502       further requires written reporting to the specified       committees detailing the number of notifications, and the       number of known or suspected violations of such personnel       requirements.      Section 503. Study and report on enhanced intelligence and           information sharing with Open Skies Treaty member states        Section 503 requires the DNI, with support of other federal       agencies, to conduct a study to determine the feasibility of       creating an intelligence sharing arrangement and database       among parties to the Open Skies Treaty (OST) with higher       frequency, quality, and efficiency than that currently       provided by the parameters of the OST. Section 503 also       requires the Director to issue a report that includes an       intelligence assessment on Russian Federation warfighting       doctrine, the extent to which Russian Federation flights       under the Open Skies Treaty contribute to the warfighting       doctrine, a counterintelligence analysis as to the Russian       Federation's capabilities, and a list of the covered parties       that have been updated with this information.                    Title VI--Reports and Other Matters       Section 601. Declassification review of information on           Guantanamo detainees and mitigation measures taken to           monitor the individuals and prevent future attacks        Section 601 requires the DNI to complete a declassification       review of intelligence reports prepared by the National       Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) on the past terrorist       activities of each Guantanamo detainee, for a detainee's       Periodic Review Board (PRB) sessions, transfer, or release       from Guantanamo. To the extent a transfer or release preceded       the PRB's establishment, or the NCTC's preparation of       intelligence reports, Section 601 requires the DNI to conduct       a declassification review of intelligence reports containing       the same or similar information as the intelligence reports       prepared by the NCTC for PRB sessions, transfers, or       releases.        Section 601 further requires the President to make any       declassified intelligence reports publicly available,       including unclassified summaries of measures being taken by       the transferee countries to monitor the individual and       prevent future terrorist activities. Section 601 requires the       DNI to submit to the congressional intelligence committees a       report setting forth the results of the declassification       review, including a description of covered reports that were       not declassified. Section 601 also sets the schedule for such       reviews and further defines past terrorist activities to       include terrorist organization affiliations, terrorist       training, role in terrorist attacks, responsibility for the       death of United States citizens or members of the Armed       Forces, any admission thereof, and a description of the       intelligence supporting the past terrorist activities,       including corroboration, confidence level, and any dissent or       reassessment by the IC.      Section 602. Cyber Center for Education and Innovation Home           of the National Cryptologic Museum        Section 602 amends 10 U.S.C. 449 to enable the       establishment of a Cyber Center for Education and       Innovation--Home of the National Cryptologic Museum (the       ``Center''). Section 602 also establishes in the Treasury a       fund for the benefit and operation of the Center.      Section 603. Report on national security systems        Section 603 requires the Director of the National Security       Agency, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense and       Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to submit to the       appropriate congressional committees a report on national       security systems.      Section 604. Joint facilities certification        Section 604 requires that before an element of the IC       purchases, leases, or constructs a new facility that is       20,000 square feet or larger, the head of that element must       first certify that all prospective joint facilities have been       considered, that it is unable to identify a joint facility       that meets its operational requirements, and it must list the       reasons for not participating in joint facilities in that       instance.      Section 605. Leadership and management of space activities        Section 605 requires the DNI, in consultation with the       Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of       Staff, to issue an update to the strategy for a comprehensive       review of the United States national security overhead       satellite architecture required in the Intelligence       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. Section 605 requires       the DNI, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, to       submit a plan to functionally integrate the IC's governance,       operations, analysis, collection, policy, and acquisition       activities related to space and counterspace. The       congressional intelligence committees believe the current       fragmented arrangement across the IC does not provide       sufficient coherence to meet the threat, fosters duplication,       hinders integrated congressional oversight, and impedes       effective alignment with the Department of Defense space       activities. Section 605 also requires the DNI to submit a       workforce plan for space and counterspace operations, policy,       and acquisition. Section 605 further requires the Director of       the NRO and the Commander of U.S. Strategic Command to submit       a concept of operations and requirements documents for the       Joint Interagency Combined Space Operations Center, and to       conduct quarterly update briefings.      Section 606. Advances in life sciences and biotechnology        The congressional intelligence committees recognize the       rapid advancements in the life sciences and biotechnology and       firmly believes that biology in the twenty-first century will       transform the world as physics did in the twentieth century.       The potential risks associated with these advancements are       less clear. The posture of the IC to follow and predict this       rapidly changing landscape is a matter of concern recognizing       the global diffusion and dual-use nature of life sciences and       biotechnology along with the dispersed responsibility of the       life sciences related issues across several National       Intelligence Officer portfolios.        Section 606 requires the DNI to brief the congressional       intelligence committees and the congressional defense       committees on a proposed plan and actions to monitor advances       in life sciences and biotechnology to be carried out by the       DNI. The Director's plan should include, first, a description       of the IC's approach to leverage the organic life science and       biotechnology expertise both within and outside the       Intelligence Community; second, an assessment of the current       life sciences and biotechnology portfolio, the risks of       genetic editing technologies, and the implications of these       advances on future biodefense requirements; and, third, an       analysis of organizational requirements and responsibilities       to include potentially creating new positions. Section 606       further requires the DNI to submit a written report and       provide a briefing to the congressional intelligence       committees and the congressional defense committees on the       role of the IC in the event of a biological attack, including       a technical capabilities assessment to address potential       unknown pathogens.      Section 607. Reports on declassification proposals        Section 607 requires the DNI to provide the congressional       intelligence committees with a report and briefing on the       IC's progress in producing four feasibility studies       undertaken in the course of the IC's fundamental       classification guidance review, as required under Executive       Order 13526. Section 607 further requires the Director to       provide the congressional intelligence committees with a       briefing, interim report, and final report on the final       feasibility studies produced by elements of the IC and an       implementation plan for each initiative.      Section 608. Improvement in government classification and           declassification        Section 608 assesses government classification and       declassification in a digital era by requiring the DNI to       review the system by which the Government classifies and       declassifies national security information to improve the       protection of such information, enable information sharing       with allies and partners, and support appropriate       declassification. Section 608 requires the DNI to submit a       report with its findings and recommendations to the       congressional intelligence committees. Section 608 further       requires the DNI to provide an annual written notification to       the congressional intelligence committees on the creation,       validation, or substantial modification (to include       termination) of existing and proposed controlled access       programs, and the compartments and subcompartments within       each. This certification shall include the rationale for each       controlled access program, compartment, or subcompartment and       how each controlled access program is being protected.      Section 609. Report on implementation of research and           development recommendations        Section 609 requires the DNI to conduct and provide to the       congressional intelligence committees a current assessment of       the IC's implementation of the recommendations issued in 2013       by the National Commission for the Review of the Research and       Development (R&D) Programs of the IC.      Section 610. Report on Intelligence Community Research and           Development Corps        Section 610 requires the DNI to develop and brief the       congressional intelligence committees on a plan, with       milestones and benchmarks, to implement a R&D Reserve Corps,       as recommended in 2013 by the bipartisan National Commission       for the Review of the R&D Programs of the IC, including any       funding and potential changes to existing authorities that       may be needed to allow for the Corps' implementation.      Section 611. Report on information relating to academic           programs, scholarships, fellowships, and internships           sponsored, administered, or used by the intelligence           community        Section 611 requires the DNI to submit to congressional       intelligence committees a report on information that the IC       collects on certain academic programs, scholarships, and       internships sponsored, administered, or used by the IC.      Section 612. Report on intelligence community employees           detailed to National Security Council        Section 612 requires the DNI to submit to the congressional       intelligence committees a classified written report listing,       by year, the number of employees of an element of the IC who       have been detailed to the National Security Council during       each of the previous ten years.      Section 613. Intelligence community reporting to Congress on           foreign fighter flows        Section 613 directs DNI to submit to the congressional       intelligence committees a report on foreign fighter flows to       and from terrorist safe havens abroad.  [[Page H3305]]           Section 614. Report on cybersecurity threats to seaports of           the United States and maritime shipping        Section 614 directs the Under Secretary of Homeland       Security for Intelligence and Analysis (I&A) to submit to the       congressional intelligence committees a report on the       cybersecurity threats to seaports of the United States and       maritime shipping.      Section 615. Report on reprisals against contractors of the           intelligence community        Section 615 directs the IC IG to submit to the       congressional intelligence committees a report on known or       claimed reprisals made against employees of contractors of       elements of the IC during the preceding three-year period.       Section 615 further requires the report to include an       evaluation of the usefulness of establishing a prohibition on       reprisals as a means of encouraging IC contractors to make       protected disclosures, and any recommendations the IC IG       deems appropriate.
