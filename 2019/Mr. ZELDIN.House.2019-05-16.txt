 Madam Speaker, during this National Police Week, I  encourage all my colleagues to cosponsor Never Forget the Heroes Act,  H.R. 1327, introduced by Congress Members Maloney, King, and Nadler,  which would fully fund and extend the Victim Compensation Fund  authorization through 2090.   There are currently 279 cosponsors, but we need more, and we need  action on this important legislation.   This should not be a partisan issue. It is not a partisan issue. This  needs to be an American issue.   September 11th first responders came from at least 433 out of 435  congressional districts. We lost thousands of Americans on 9/11. We  have lost more Americans since 9/11 due to toxic exposure than we did  on 9/11 itself.   Any colleagues out there who haven't cosponsored yet, I encourage you  to look at H.R. 1327.   Chairman Nadler has scheduled it for a hearing on July 11. Please do  what you can to get this passed and signed into law.                            ____________________
