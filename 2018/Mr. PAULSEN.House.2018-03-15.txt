 Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Orono  High School boys hockey team on winning the Minnesota State  championship, their very first State championship in school history.  Their win came against Alexandria under the lights in the Xcel Energy  Center.   Orono took the lead early in the first, but their advantage was very  short lived. Alexandria's Cardinals came back to tie it up in very  little time. Despite outshooting the Cardinals 11 to 1 in the second  period, Orono just couldn't connect, which made the winning shot, taken  midway through the third period, all the more exciting.   Madam Speaker, the student athletes brought home more than just a  statewide trophy. They set the example for their classmates because of  their work in the classroom and managing other activities.   Congratulations again to the coaches, the players, the parents, and  all of the fans of the Orono High School boys hockey team.                            ____________________
