 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Congresswoman Debbie  Lesko for her fight and for our fight regarding gas stoves.   What the Biden administration is trying to do with gas stoves is  something that has become, sadly, more and more common from President  Biden's party.   It doesn't matter to the Hollywood elite, it doesn't matter to the  limousine liberals, it doesn't matter to the Silicon Valley  billionaires, and it doesn't, quite frankly, matter to the welfare  classes. However, it matters to the middle class as to what their  electric or monthly energy bill is.   This is part of the Biden administration's effort to shut down gas  stoves, which are much cheaper to operate than electric stoves, and it  is a growing trend towards ignoring the middle class in America.   These other groups I don't think would know what their electric bill  is, but we have to bring back the gas stoves on the grounds that it  will save money for the middle class who does know exactly what their  electric bill is.                            ____________________
