 Madam Speaker, and still I rise, and still I  rise. And I rise as a very proud American, proud of my country, proud  to be a part of  [[Page H1654]]  this great Nation. I am also proud to be a liberated Democrat,  unbought, unbossed, speak truth to power, speak truth about power, a  liberated Democrat. And I rise tonight with a very special message at  this time in the history of our country.   We find ourselves now in a state of fear. Unfortunately, too much of  what we have based our response on to the novel coronavirus has been  fear, not facts. We should act on facts, not fear. My hope is that  after I say a few words tonight, I will at least cause some persons to  rethink some of what they have already concluded.   I am a person who believes that there is a philosophy, an adage, if  you will, of live and let live. This is not my philosophy, live and let  live. It simply says: You go your way and live your life; I will go my  way and live my life.   If this philosophy prevailed, I would not be in the Congress of the  United States of America because a good many people did not embrace  live and let live. Dr. King did not embrace it.   A good many people embrace a philosophy that I now embrace, and that  is live and help live. It is because of other people who made great  sacrifices that I am able to stand here in the well of the Congress of  the United States of America. It was a live and help live philosophy  that made it possible for me to be here. There were persons who lived  and some who died so that I would have this opportunity.   I can bring Schwerner, Goodman, and Chaney to your attention.  Schwerner and Goodman were not African Americans, by the way. They lost  their lives in the cause of freedom along with Goodman, who was an  African American. They were trying to help somebody. That was a live  and help live philosophy.   There was John Shillady in Austin, Texas, an NAACP fieldworker, who  was beaten by a mob. He was trying to help Black people.   In a sense, there is a debt that I owe, and whenever I have the  opportunity, I try to repay it. So tonight, with our country in this  state of fear, I would like to ask some things of people and share some  thoughts.   The first thing that I want to address is what we expect from others.   We now expect others who are sick to stay home. If you are sick and  you think that you have a virus and you are concerned, we want you to  stay home. Of course, see your physician, get an opinion from your  physician, but if you are ill and you may be contagious, we believe  that you should stay home.   That is what we are saying to people across the length and breadth of  the country. We believe that this is a patriotic thing to do, to stay  home. Do what you can from home. Work from home.   Well, that can work for a lot of people. It can work for Members of  Congress because we will be paid if we work from home. We will be paid,  and we will be appreciated for staying home because we don't want to  spread an illness from one person to another by being in the workplace.  That works quite well for Members of Congress.   But what about the person who works for minimum wage? $7.25 an hour  is still the minimum wage, the Federal minimum wage in this country. A  good many places pay more than $7.25 an hour, but it is the Federal  standard for the minimum wage.   $7.25 an hour, that is not a lot of money for most of the people who  work here, but to a good many people it is the means by which they  maintain their dignity and keep food, clothing, and shelter for  themselves and others.   A good many of them are not in jobs that will pay them if they stay  home. They are being patriotic Americans. They are doing what we are  asking, but they won't get paid. They have to make a choice: Do they  stay home and do that which we deem to be prudent and necessary, or do  they come to work so that they will be able to put food on the table,  so that they will have the shelter necessary to protect them from the  environment? Will they have the necessary clothing so that they may  continue to traverse through the elements?   But even at $7.25 an hour, there is another case to be made, because  some workers make less than the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. These  are the persons who work and they receive tips. They make $2.13 an  hour. We expect them to stay home if they are sick.   Many of them work in the food service industry. They will serve our  food. We want them to stay home if they are ill because we don't want  them to contaminate the food. But these persons who serve our food,  $2.13 an hour, patriotic Americans, if they stay home and they are not  paid, they have a choice: Do they stay home or do they come to work  ill?   I say to the employers: Please give consideration to your minimum  wage workers, $7.25 an hour. Perhaps it is $15 an hour. Give some  consideration to them. And especially those who are working for $2.13  an hour. Give them some consideration. Help them through this time of  crisis, because they are helping us through this time of crisis.   They are there for us by staying home. They are doing the patriotic  thing. We should do the patriotic thing and give them some  consideration.   I plan to support legislation, hopefully, that will emanate from this  House that would give persons some amount of money.                                time  1845    I think that we are at a point in our history when people who are  going to have to stay at home are going to have to be accorded some  sort of emolument because we don't want them to come to work and  contaminate others. We don't expect them to do that which we would deem  to be unpatriotic, so we have to help them.   I heard a person this morning talk about $1,000 for persons who need  help or $1,000 to persons in general, some amount. I am not sure what  the exact amount should be, but I do know we have to give some  consideration to persons who are working for minimum wages and  especially persons who are working for $2.13 an hour, for tips.   There are those who contend that if you are working for $2.13 an  hour, you will get a lot of money in those tips, and you will be able  to do what some will say, that ``I did.'' That is not me saying the  ``I,'' but I am now speaking the words of others. They will say: ``I  was able to work my way through college on tips.'' Well, good for you.  A good many others are not able to do such. A good many others are  barely getting by on $2.13 an hour.   I talk to people when I eat at these various cafeterias, and I have  spoken to people who work in cafeterias in Houston, Texas, who tell me  that they have gone home and made not more than $2.13 for each of the  hours. They didn't get any tips. There are days when they get no tips.   I would hope that they would get an abundance of tips, but the truth  is, there are days when they do not. And they deserve some help because  they are doing what we are asking when they stay at home. So, if they  stay at home and don't come to work, I would hope that we would give  them some consideration.   Live and help live. That is the philosophy I embrace. That is the  philosophy that will cause an employer to conclude that he or she, or  the company, should help people who we are asking to stay at home.   Live and help live, not live and let live: ``I am going to live my  life. You stay at home. Sorry. Can't help you.''   No, let's help those persons who have to stay at home because they  are ill and are wage earners. Live and help live.   Live and help live is a philosophy that I think we should embrace  when we speak of persons who are of different ethnicities. More  specifically, now, I am going to talk about persons of Asian ancestry.   I am standing here tonight to speak up on behalf of persons of Asian  ancestry, and I am going to speak on their behalf as it relates to the  novel coronavirus because ugly things are happening to persons of Asian  ancestry.   I am here because I want to live and help live. I want to help them  through this time of crisis when they are having to experience  xenophobia and nativism.   I have here some examples of what persons of Asian ancestry are  experiencing, and I am here to live and help them live. I believe that  somebody helped me to get where I am, and I have a debt that I owe,  that I pray that I will be able to repay.   Tonight, I would call to everybody's attention a person in New York,  a  [[Page H1655]]  woman on a subway who was attacked by persons who said that she was  diseased. They used a word that I would not use--the b-word is what it  is called in this forum tonight--because she had on a face mask.   People have assumed that this is beneficial. It may not be. Many  scientists--the persons who are supposed to know, the persons who deal  with these things, who have studied these things--are saying to us that  the mask doesn't help people, in general. It does help the persons who  are aiding and assisting us, perhaps the physicians and nurses.   Be that as it may, if a person chooses to wear the mask and happens  to be of Asian ancestry, that person ought not be attacked, that person  ought not be spoken to in harsh language.   People have a right in this country to wear the type of face gear  that they choose. If they choose to wear a mask, so be it.   We ought to respect people and not assume things and say things about  them because of their ethnicity, because of their ancestry.   Another example, a person who is of the Hmong ancestry was checking  in at a hotel and was told that Asians are not welcome. That is not a  live-and-help-live philosophy. That is a form of nativism and  xenophobia that is invidious, that is harmful to our society and  harmful to this person trying to check into a hotel.   I remember a time in this country when there were certain places that  I could not check into simply because of the hue of my skin. I was not  allowed. There were signs that said: ``No coloreds allowed.'' Those  were the polite signs. There were some that had words that I will not  repeat.   But I remember this. And when I remember this, I relate to persons of  Asian ancestry told that they can't come into a given business place  simply because of who they are.   I am here because I believe in live and help live, and I want to help  them through this time of crisis.   In California, a 16-year-old high school student was sent to the  emergency room after being attacked by bullies who accused him of  having the coronavirus simply because of his ethnicity.   I have been attacked in my life, chased because of my ethnicity. I  reflect on this, and it causes me to understand the plight of this  person.   I stand here tonight to speak up, to speak on behalf of people of  Asian ancestry who are being assaulted, who are being accused, who are  being denied simply because of who they are.   I have an indication that even just looking Asian has been enough to  incite attackers, to hurl insults and accuse individuals of being  disease carriers.   Friends, this is a time for us to band together and come together as  a Nation. This is not a time for us to engage in this sort of phobia,  this xenophobia, this nativism. This is not the time.   This disease is not something that is related to any ethnicity. It is  not related to any party. It doesn't assault or attack Republicans or  Democrats because they happen to be of a certain party. It doesn't  matter what your gender is.    This disease attacks you because you are a human being and because  you have been exposed to it in such a way as to allow it to enter your  body.   We ought to see each other now as people of one race, the human race.  We ought to see each other as people who we should help live.   We should embrace the philosophy of live and help live. Help the  minimum wage worker. Help those who are not as fortunate as we are.  Help those who may not be of the same hue as you. Help those who have  been accused and attacked. This is a time for us to send a message that  we won't tolerate it.   I am here because I believe that Asian Americans, those of Asian  ancestry, should not have to defend themselves by themselves.   I think that it is important for persons who are not of Asian  ancestry to send a message that we stand with them, and we stand  against the Islamophobia that might ensue, the homophobia, all the  various invidious phobias that can ensue from persons deciding that  they are going to attack people because they are different.   I have moved on from the Asian ancestry now to persons who are  different. In this country, we ought not attack people simply because  they are different.   I believe that the differences that we have can make a difference in  the culture, and it makes us richer for having these various  differences. They are good for the country.   Please, let us send a message that we will not tolerate persons being  assaulted because of who they are, that we will not tolerate persons  being denied the opportunity to have access to various places within  our society that we ordinarily would have access to simply because we  happen to have the bill of fare. If we can pay our way in, pay for the  hotel room, then I think we ought to allow people to have access.   More important than all of these, I think that it is important for us  to treat each other with dignity and respect simply because we are  people of the same creator. That creator, I believe, expects us to  treat each other the same, regardless of our hues, regardless of our  various differences.   This is an opportunity for us to pull together. I believe that this  is a great adversity, but I also believe that it provides us a great  opportunity to come together and stand up for each other.   Let us live and help live. Let us not live and let live, simply leave  people to find their way as best they can.   Let's help people through life. I am here because somebody helped me,  and I want to be there to help others.   I promise that I will do what I can to be of service to man, to  humans, more specifically, to men and women in this society.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
