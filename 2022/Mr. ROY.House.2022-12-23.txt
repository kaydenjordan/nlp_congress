 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for  yielding. I can't help but be amused when the gentleman from  Massachusetts says that we refused to come to the table. As if the  gentlewoman who will soon be the chair of the Appropriations Committee,  Ms. Granger, my colleague from Texas, doesn't want to sit at the table  with colleagues on either side of the aisle to come to consensus about  how to spend taxpayer dollars; or better stated, how to borrow money we  don't have, as if that is actually true.   What table is the gentleman referring to?   At what table does he want us to come sit down and negotiate?   It is not this table.   I don't have the power to offer an amendment on the floor of the  House of Representatives, despite being elected by 750,000 Texans. I  don't have the ability or the right to be able to stand up for them and  have a debate on the floor of this Chamber.   Everything the American people are watching right now is a complete  sham. It is a fraud, a fraud being perpetrated on the American people  right before their eyes, right as we head into Christmas, sitting here  on the 23rd of December when--240-what--246 years ago those boys  crossed the Delaware and we were dealing with Valley Forge, or the boys  in 1944 sitting in foxholes in Bastogne over Christmas.   We had 18 Republicans who joined with Democrats in the Senate get in  their fancy planes and go home, and we are sitting here trying to do  the work of the people, not spend money we don't have, not drive up  more inflation, not have 7,500 earmarks for $16 billion for pet,  leftist projects across this country.   What you see here on the floor of the House of Representatives should  make everybody ashamed. This is the people's House. Not one amendment  has been offered on the floor of this body since May of 2016 in open  debate.   The gentleman from Massachusetts dares to impugn the character of the  Appropriations Chairwoman Kay Granger and those Republicans he says  won't sit at the table when, in fact, what you see here is a 4,100-page  bill cooked up by a handful of people behind closed doors brought  before the Rules Committee with no ability to offer an amendment, no  ability to debate, no actual discussion on the people's House floor.                                time  1100    My colleagues on the other side of the aisle know it. We are spending  money we don't have.   Go home and sell your projects. Go home and talk about all the pork  you are bringing home. But you are destroying the United States of  America, and you are absolutely destroying this body.   The American people did not send us here to do that. My colleagues on  the other side of the aisle know that. My colleagues on the other side  of the aisle know full well that this body is broken, but they do not  care.   Mr. Speaker, $45 billion to Ukraine.   Have we had a full debate on Ukraine?   Or do we take $45 billion of funding for Ukraine, package it in a  $1.7 trillion bill, and invite the President of Ukraine to address this  body for theatrics while heading out for Christmas in order to jam  through a big spending, Democrat-priority bill that the American people  resoundingly rejected in November?   For 70 years, we in this body, when we have had a transfer of power  in the Senate, have not done this in a lameduck. Yet, that is what my  Democratic colleagues are doing.   There are consequences to this.   You can't go out and talk about inflation and talk about what the  American people are feeling right now--when they are trying to fill up  their tanks with gas, they are trying to have presents for their  families, and they are trying to pay their bills--and then come here  and dump hundreds of billions of dollars in the economy while the Feds  are raising interest rates, people can't afford to buy homes, and they  can't live, and then say that you are doing the people's work.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle the night before last  were apoplectic that Mike Lee was daring to challenge the idea that we  should have a bill that literally prohibits Border Patrol from securing  the border. He wanted to try to fix that. He tried to extend title 42.   My Democratic colleagues rejected it. I sat here on the floor, and  they were more concerned about catching their flights for Christmas.  They were coming to me and saying: We can't be here over Christmas.   Well, why the hell not?   The American people deserve us to be here over Christmas actually  fighting for them instead of trying to catch planes while one half of  this body is going to vote by proxy. One half of this body is not even  going to be here, and they are lying. They are lying on forms saying  that they are voting by proxy because of COVID, and it is a lie. One  half of this body is going to do it, you know it, and it is destroying  this country.   I am not going to just sit here and roll over on this. This is going  to continue. The American people are going to know precisely what is  happening to them by the people's House.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 193,  nays 227, not voting 11, as follows:                               [Roll No. 548]                                 YEAS--193       Aderholt      Allen      Amodei      Armstrong      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Baird      Balderson      Banks      Barr      Bentz      Bergman      Bice (OK)      Biggs      Bilirakis      Bishop (NC)      Boebert      Bost      Brady      Brooks      Buchanan      Budd      Burchett      Burgess      Calvert      Cammack      Carey      Carl      Carter (GA)      Carter (TX)      Cawthorn      Chabot      Cline      Cloud      Clyde      Comer      Conway      Crawford      Crenshaw      Curtis      Davidson      Davis, Rodney      DesJarlais      Donalds      Duncan      Dunn      Ellzey      Emmer      Estes      Fallon      Feenstra      Ferguson      Finstad      Fischbach      Fitzgerald      Fleischmann      Flood      Flores      Foxx      Franklin, C.

Mr. Speaker, I would note that this $1.7 trillion  legislation is moving off the floor without a physical quorum present.  There were 218 votes cast by proxy on the rule and 226 votes cast by  proxy on the final passage of the bill.                           Parliamentary Inquiries     Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiries.    Can the Speaker advise whether there is a physical quorum  present as required under the Constitution and whether there is any  recourse for any Member under our rules to challenge a ruling that  there is a quorum?    Under what rule does the Speaker make the assertion that a  quorum is present when there were 226 votes cast by proxy, i.e., not  physically present in the Chamber?    One last parliamentary inquiry. Does any Member of this body  have recourse to ask the Speaker to count the Members physically  present here in the body?    Mr. Speaker, withdrawn. No objection.
