 Madam Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4606, the  Ensuring Small Scale LNG Certainty and Access Act, bipartisan  legislation introduced by my good friend and colleague, Representative  Bill Johnson.   I applaud the gentleman from Ohio for his strong leadership in  bringing forward this important bill. This commonsense legislation will  further increase American energy dominance by expediting the permitting  process for the small-scale liquefied natural gas, or LNG, market. Such  action will create thousands of jobs, increase regulatory certainty,  and help reduce global emissions.   Thanks to American ingenuity and the efforts of private companies,  the United States is now the world's leading producer of oil and  natural gas. Despite this remarkable achievement, businesses still face  a plethora of bureaucratic hurdles that are unable to export small  quantities of LNG expeditiously. Removing unnecessary roadblocks that  are shackling LNG job creators will foster economic growth and increase  global influence.   As DOE Secretary Rick Perry likes to say, we are not just exporting  energy, we are exporting freedom. I saw that firsthand in Lithuania  last year.   Further, the U.S. has the highest regulatory standards for producing  and exporting oil and gas in the world. Put quite simply, if we aren't  making it in America, someone else will, and they will most likely do  it in a way that is worse for the environment.   I urge adoption of this excellent legislation introduced by the  gentleman from Ohio.
