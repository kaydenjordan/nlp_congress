 Madam Speaker, biofuels drive the rural  economy and strengthen our energy security. Two weeks ago, President  Biden's agriculture Secretary suggested it was unfair of me to suggest  that he wasn't doing enough for biofuels.   This week, the Biden EPA announced that they are delaying RFS  deadlines, which creates uncertainty for American farmers. Instead of  putting American farmers first, the Biden administration is pushing  Chinese batteries and Green New Deal policies.   The Biden administration must stop creating uncertainty for the  biofuels industry and misleading our farmers about support for  biofuels. We need clear answers from the Biden administration on RFS  blending targets.                            ____________________
