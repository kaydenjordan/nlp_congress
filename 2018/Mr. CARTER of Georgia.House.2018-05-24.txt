 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Gordon  ``Batman'' Varnedoe's 80th birthday, which he celebrated on May 19. Mr.  Varnedoe is a staple of Savannah, who lives to put a smile on  everyone's face and is never afraid to try something new.   Known to locals as Batman, he is often seen in parades wearing his  cape and mask, but he earned the nickname in high school for his  passionate belief in truth, justice, and an American moment.   Mr. Varnedoe breaks out of his cape and into 18th century English  attire as General James Oglethorpe, Savannah's founder, to welcome  visitors to this historic city. His latest projects include substitute  teaching at various schools and officiating weddings in his General  Oglethorpe persona.   He sets records in international weightlifting competitions at 73  years old. He is likely the oldest rugby player in Georgia, and he has  founded numerous organizations to help sports thrive.

Happy birthday, my friend.                            ____________________
