 Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to celebrate  the 54th anniversary of Head Start and the 25th birthday of Early Head  Start.   Head Start and Early Head Start provide essential early childhood  education services to almost 6,000 low-income children and families in  Connecticut. In addition, across the 38 Connecticut centers, over 7,000  children have been able to access healthcare services, 2,000 families  have gotten help through crisis intervention programs, and over 800  parents advanced their own education. For these families and  [[Page S2880]]  thousands of others across the country, Head Start is a lifeline for  struggling families and a stepping stone out of poverty.   Fifty-four years since its founding, the work of Head Start and Early  Head Start remains paramount. Children in poverty are more than twice  as likely to suffer traumatic childhood experiences such as abuse,  neglect, homelessness, and parental substance abuse. Exposure to these  kinds of trauma results in greater likelihood of chronic disease,  mental illness, and substance use disorders, as well as decreased  likelihood of high school graduation and increased likelihood of  involvement with the juvenile justice system. We know that children  having access to safe and stable environments mitigates these effects  and that Head Start is on the frontline of providing children with  nurturing relationships.   This Saturday, not only do we celebrate the Head Start program  reaching another milestone, but we celebrate the hundreds of thousands  of dedicated Head Start staff and educators who work hard every day to  support and teach the next generation.                            ____________________
