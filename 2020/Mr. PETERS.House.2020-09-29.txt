 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and the  chairman for his leadership.   Mr. Speaker, last year, I visited Bernardo Heights Middle School in  Rancho Bernardo to meet with students of the school's SAVE Promise Club  and the Mental Health Awareness Club.   The kids told me about their efforts to make their peers feel more  accepted by creating a culture of kindness and by using their voices to  end the stigma surrounding mental health. They explained their work  with programs intended to promote inclusivity and to prevent violence  by teaching children and adults to identify, intervene, and help those  at risk of harming themselves or others.    According to the National Institute of Mental Health, suicide is the  second leading cause of death by those 10 to 24 years old, with cases  of suicide among Black and other minority youth rapidly rising.   The good news is that adolescent suicide and violence can be  prevented if others heed the warning signs.   Seventy percent of those who die by suicide tell someone their plans  or demonstrate warning signs ahead of time. Eighty percent of school  shooters tell someone their plans ahead of time.   That is why I teamed up with my friend from Florida, Mr. Gus  Bilirakis, to introduce the bipartisan STANDUP Act.   The Act requires States, schools, and Tribes to implement evidence- based policies to prevent suicides in order to receive Project AWARE  grants, which boost youth mental health awareness among schools and  communities.   These policies are key to preventing school violence by encouraging  early prevention, teaching warning signs, and providing schools with  crucial tools to help stop violence before it happens.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Sandy Hook Promise, who helped champion this  bill, and for hosting my visit at Bernardo Heights Middle School. Along  with them, over 50 student and mental health-focused organizations  support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all the Bernardo Heights Bobcats, who care so  well for each other's mental health. We want to bring that same spirit,  their same spirit, to every school in the country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass the STANDUP Act to protect  our students and enhance school safety.   Go Bobcats.                                time  1615
