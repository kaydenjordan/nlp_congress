 Mr. Speaker, I certainly appreciate my  colleagues and their support of our effort to change the name from  Homestead National Monument of America to the Homestead National  Historical Park. Obviously, some of the reasons have been outlined.   I appreciate the chairman and ranking member for bringing this  legislation to the floor. It is supported by the entire Nebraska  delegation, and even more importantly, by local stakeholders.   And as was mentioned, the Homestead Act of 1862 was signed by  President Lincoln, and it absolutely helped shaped the American West.  It allowed U.S. citizens to earn ownership of a portion of the vast  public lands owned by the Federal Government across the Western U.S.   Ultimately, the Federal Government granted title to 10 percent of the  land in the U.S. through this program. It gave millions a chance to  build a new life for themselves, their families and for future  generations.   In order to claim a 160-acre parcel of land under the Homestead Act,  a homesteader was required to be at least 21 years of age or the head  of a household, build a home on the land, improve and farm the land for  5 years, and pay an $18 filing fee.                                time  1515    The Homestead Act remained in place through 1976, with provisions  allowing for homesteading in Alaska through 1986.   President Ronald Reagan said the Homestead Act ``ensured that the  great western prairies of America would be the realm of independent,  property-owning citizens--a mightier guarantee of freedom is difficult  to imagine.''   We are very proud that the very first claim under the Homestead Act  was made by a man named Daniel Freeman, near Beatrice, Nebraska, in  Nebraska's Third District. To memorialize this milestone, as well as  the 1.6 million other claims which built the American West, the  Homestead National Monument of America was established, also near  Beatrice.   Unfortunately, referring to this site as a monument brings images of  a single, static monument, such as a statue, an obelisk, or even a  natural feature like the Scotts Bluff National Monument near my  hometown of Gering, Nebraska, not of an extensive park that celebrates  the pioneering homesteaders of many years ago.   Homestead National Monument consists of a heritage museum, the  Freeman School mentioned earlier, as well  [[Page H9088]]  as the tallgrass prairie, hiking trails, a forest, farming  demonstrations, and much more.   Referring to this site as a historical park instead of a monument  would far more clearly describe the opportunities to take in this  living-history site. In fact, according to the Friends of Homestead, 89  percent of first-time visitors to the facility were confused by the  name.   On behalf of the people of Nebraska and, particularly, the citizens  of Beatrice and Gage County, Nebraska, I appreciate this opportunity to  advocate in support of this proposal today.
