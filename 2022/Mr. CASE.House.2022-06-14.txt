 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2773,  the Recovering America's Wildlife Act. I thank the gentlewoman from  Michigan, Congresswoman Dingell, and Chairman Grijalva for their  leadership in moving this critical legislation through our Natural  Resources Committee and to the Floor.  [[Page H5520]]    The world is in the middle of an extinction crisis and,  unfortunately, my state is at its center. As a result of climate  change, invasive species and other environmental stressors, our islands  have earned the unfortunate distinction of becoming the endangered  species capitol of the world. Of the 1,225 endangered species listed by  the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, nearly 500 are found in Hawaii.  Just last year, nine more of Hawaii's endemic species were officially  reclassified as extinct.   The Recovering America's Wildlife Act will provide $1.3 billion in  support to states, territories and tribes to address wildlife  conservation. The estimated $60 million in annual funding to Hawaii  will be essential to my state's ability to save our imperiled  biodiversity and will increase the chance that species like the `l`iwi  (a Hawaiian Honeycreeper), `Ope`ape`a (the Hawaiian Hoary Bat) and  Kahuli (Hawaiian tree snail) survive.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes on this legislation. Mahalo.
