 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to  include the text of my amendment in the Record immediately prior to the  vote on the motion to recommit.    Madam Speaker, as you know, our ally  Israel was forced to defend itself in May from Hamas and the  Palestinian Islamic jihad, who over the course of 11 days  indiscriminately fired over 4,000 rockets from Gaza into Israel.    My motion to recommit would provide $1 billion to Israel to replenish  and maintain its Iron Dome defense system.   We must continue to stand with our ally Israel. We must continue to  show that the United States believes in the right to existence and  defend themselves. We must do everything within our power to ensure  they are equipped to defend against these heinous attacks and defeat  these terrorists.    Madam Speaker, I have a motion to  recommit at the desk.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.
