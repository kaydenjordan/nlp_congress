 Madam President, reserving the right to object, this is  outrageous. On September 27, there were over 80,000 new COVID-19 cases  and over 1,000 COVID-19 deaths in our country; and yet, the next day, I  had to come to the Senate floor to explain why undermining our efforts  to end this pandemic would be reckless. And now, 2 days, with thousands  more cases and deaths later, I have to do it again. And this is the  second time today Republicans have tried to do something like this.   This virus has killed over 685,000 people in our country. And if  people do not get vaccinated, variants like Delta will continue to  spread, undermine our economy, and take lives.   So why in the world, for the second time in a week, do I have to come  down here and explain to some of my Republican colleagues that  weakening one of our strongest tools to fight this virus is a dangerous  and deadly idea?   Getting people vaccinated is one of the most important things we can  do to stop COVID-19. And let's be clear, immunization requirements are  nothing new in this country. So I hope we can stop with this political  theater and focus on ending this pandemic, rebuilding our economy, and  keeping people alive.   I object.
