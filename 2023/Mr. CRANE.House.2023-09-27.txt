 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my colleague's amendment.  As my colleague pointed out, we can't afford it. The gentlewoman just  said that all the money that we are sending over there is for training  and equipment. That is not true.   ``60 Minutes'' just discovered the U.S. is financing more than  weapons in Ukraine. The government is buying seeds and fertilizer for  farmers, paying the salaries of 57,000 first responders, and  subsidizing small business.   Again, like my colleague said, we are $33 trillion in debt. It is no  wonder we are $33 trillion in debt. This is getting out of hand, and we  need to stop it.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer my amendment to the  Department of Defense appropriations bill, which would prohibit  American troops from being sent to fight on the ground in Ukraine.   The United States ought to be encouraging peace talks between Russia  and Ukraine, not giving into calls for deadly escalation that could  turn nuclear.   It is well past time for the United States to disentangle itself from  this misguided war effort and start promoting a peaceful resolution to  the conflict.   To date, we have shipped more than 100 billion American tax dollars  to Ukraine, a country not known for its strict commitment to  anticorruption measures.   Sending money is bad enough. Our men and women being sent to die over  this conflict is unthinkable.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment to  prevent American lives from being sacrificed.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Calvert).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Gaetz).    Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
