 Madam Speaker, it is my honor today to recognize the  achievements of Zena Cardman, a resident of Pennsylvania's 12th  Congressional District who just became one of America's newest  astronauts.  [[Page H205]]    In a ceremony on Friday, Zena, who lives in State College, graduated  from being an astronaut candidate in NASA Astronaut Group 22 and is now  a full-fledged astronaut.   Zena's academic achievements are numerous. She is trained as a marine  biologist, and Zena has focused her research on microorganisms in  subsurface environments.   It is clear that her success shows that she possesses both the work  ethic and intrepid spirit exemplified by many across Pennsylvania's  12th Congressional District.   As an astronaut, Zena faces an exciting time in the history and  future of NASA. The Artemis missions aim to return humans to the Moon  by 2024. That also includes putting the first woman on the Moon.   Since the beginning of the space program, the work of our Nation's  astronauts in advancing the cause of discovery in space and on Earth  shows the best of mankind and that our achievements are limited only by  our ambitions.   Madam Speaker, again, it is my honor to recognize the achievements of  Zena Cardman on becoming an astronaut and joining the rich history of  pride and wonder that comes with that distinction.                            ____________________
