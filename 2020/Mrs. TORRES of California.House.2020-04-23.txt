 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this  bill and to highlight the need for reliable testing.   Last week, Pastor Joseph Owes succumbed to COVID-19. He was a pillar  in our community, hosted food banks, health fairs, job and financial  literacy workshops to help his community.   He tried repeatedly to get tested but was denied time and time again  because testing hasn't been available in my community. If he had been  tested and treated earlier, he would still be here with us today.   Without tests, we don't know who has COVID and we can't open up our  economy.
