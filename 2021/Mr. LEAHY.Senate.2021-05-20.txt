 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am opposing this amendment before us. I  just thought I would mention some of the pragmatic reasons for that. A  mandate to offer dollar-for-dollar parity between defense and  nondefense programs unless there are 60 votes to overcome the point of  order is not limited to discretionary spending, which would be in the  fiscal year 2022 appropriations bills, but in all Federal spending.   Let me tell you what that means. It may make people feel good, but  let me tell you what it does. If you provide a dollar to the Defense  Department for every dollar of nondefense spending, well, it is simply  arbitrary.   These are some of the absurd results. Under this amendment, if we  pass an infrastructure bill through reconciliation--and we know that in  the States represented by all 100 of us, we have roads, bridges, water  systems, everything else breaking down and deteriorating and has to be  fixed. If we don't do it now, it is going to cost us a heck of a lot  more in the future.   So let's say we have $2 trillion to rebuild our bridges, our roads,  our water systems, broadband, and so on, but then we would have to  automatically provide $2 trillion more for defense, nearly tripling the  defense budget and spending more on defense than the rest of the world  put together. And the Department of Defense says very frankly that  there is no way they could spend that kind of money--unless we have 60  votes, a supermajority. Now, come on.   I will give another example. This can get really weird. Suppose a  hurricane hits somewhere in the South. We have seen that happen-- hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding--or you have massive fires that rage  out in the West.   So as we have always come together in the past, Republicans and  Democrats alike, to help those communities that have been destroyed--we  are the United States of America--then let's say we provide $10  billion, which we have in the past, to help communities recover and  rebuild. Well, then, even though they don't want it, we have to provide  $10 billion to the Department of Defense.   And why are we spending that? Because they had a flood in Louisiana  or a tornado in the Midwest or an earthquake in the West or a forest  fire. Well, we have got to rebuild them, but we have got to spend an  equal amount at the Department of Defense, whether they want it or not.   In another way, let's say we increase funding for veterans, which we  should. Well, then, we would have to say: Well, wait a minute. The  Department of Defense will have to have a dollar-for-dollar increase. I  can go on and on with a whole lot of other examples.   We are going to have to obviously address the costs and the efforts  that we went through here because of the riots on January 6. Do we do  an equal amount for the Department of Defense if we repair the damage  done to the Capitol?   Now, why don't I suggest that we do what we were taught to do, and I  have seen the Senate do over the past 40-some-odd years, we actually  have debate about appropriations? Have a debate about the defense  level. Either vote up or down. Have a debate about nondefense spending  in fiscal year 2022 and vote it up or down. Let's not start off with  some arbitrary rules, which make no sense--an arbitrary rule that says  we are probably going to have to hesitate to help out the communities  that have been struck by a tornado because we have to spend twice as  much money as it would cost to repair those communities because we have  to put an equal amount into the defense budget, whether they want it or  not.   Now, I can say this, as chairman of the Senate Appropriations  Committee, I understand some annual increases in the Defense bill, but  that should be considered as the Defense bill, just as we should  consider our healthcare bills, just as we should consider  infrastructure bills, education, and all those. We can easily do each  part of these appropriations bills that make some sense to the American  people.   In the past, many times we have been able to get bipartisan  agreement. Let's do that. Let's stop playing like children or some  arbitrary ``You give me this; I will give you that'' kind of rule. We  are U.S. Senators. We should be above that. We should be the conscience  of the Nation. There are only 100 of us. The country looks at us. We  ought to respond to the country.                             January 6 Commission    I note that no one is seeking recognition at the moment. I just had  another thing. The House of Representatives did the right thing. They  passed a bipartisan vote to have an independent Commission to find out  what happened on January 6--what sparked it; who was involved; how many  crimes were committed; why did police officers who protect the Capitol  lose their lives; why did others lose their lives; why did we have such  a huge amount of damage; why did we end up spending hundreds of  millions of dollars; why were the lives of Republican and Democratic  [[Page S3179]]  Members of Congress put at risk? Why not have, as we did after 9/11 and  other major things in our country, a bipartisan committee to look at  it?   That is what the House voted on last night. I am disturbed when I  hear Republican leaders, both in the House and the Senate, say: We  don't want to have any kind of a hearing. We don't want to know what  happened. We don't want anybody to ask a question.   Well, I don't know about your State, but I can imagine you probably  heard a lot of questions from the people in your State. I heard a lot  of questions from Republicans and Democrats alike in my State who  basically said: What in heaven's name has happened? We are the greatest  country on Earth, and we are seeing our symbol of democracy with a mob  of people going in. People are dying. Property is being smashed. People  are posing for selfies: Hey, I am breaking the law; don't I look great?  There was a gallows with a noose and with the name of the Vice  President of the United States on it put outside here.   Come on. We ought to find out what happened. We were shamed  throughout the world by what happened. Let's not have that happen  again. Let's have a real committee. Find out what happened and who was  responsible and see what steps we take not to have that happen again.   I am proud of the U.S. Capitol. I have had the opportunity to serve  here for decades. I remember coming through this body as a teenager  with my parents and being awed by it. I looked at the Brumidi paintings  with my Italian-American mother and the pride she felt looking at that.  I looked at other things with my Irish-American father and the pride he  had in the history. All of us did. I have taken Vermonters from both  parties through here, enjoyed pointing it out, and everybody feeling  the sense of history.   So what do we see now? A locked-down Capitol because of the  insurrection. And we don't want to actually ask questions? What is  this? What is this? Why don't we all just cower under our desks?   Well, we can't ask a question. I am going to hide down here. I see  nothing. Oh, come on now. The American people saw plenty. Let's have  that committee. Let's have that Commission. Let's find out what  happened and make sure, for God's sake, it never happens again.   I yield the floor    Mr. President, the late Walter Mondale is widely known for  having transformed the role of Vice President, ably taking on many key  responsibilities that were delegated to him by President Jimmy Carter.  Less noted are his many accomplishments in this body while he served as  a Senator from the State of Minnesota.   Walter Mondale is sometimes described as the paradigm figure of the  transition between two eras--the FDR Coalition up to the war in Vietnam  and the social ferment that came after the war. And perhaps this is so,  but to me, who Fritz Mondale was and what he stood for are just as  important as when he stood there. The issues he led on then are as  fresh as today's news and as enduring as our founding documents, issues  like the concentration and abuse of power or social and economic  justice and the consolidation of wealth in the pockets and portfolios  of just a few or the role of government in protecting the little guy  when powerful market forces run roughshod or the tension between  freedom and security; even the question of whether a woman ever could  credibly assume the highest office in the land. Trace any of these  issues back in time, and you will find Fritz Mondale at earlier  decision points.   Fritz Mondale was a good man whose decency elevated every institution  in which he served. Who he was has everything to do with what he  achieved. He loved the Senate, and the Senate loved him back. He said  the Senate ``was like mainlining human nature.''   One side of Fritz that the public did not see as readily as we did in  the Senate was his sense of humor--one of the  [[Page S3190]]  best I have ever known. In many a tense moment, his sense of humor  often defused the tension and restored the spirit of comity that is so  crucial in getting things done in the Senate. He knew the art of being  able to disagree without being disagreeable. I wish the American people  had seen more of that side of Fritz Mondale.   That was a heady and vibrant legislative era, and Fritz had a hand in  virtually every major piece of civil rights, education, and childcare  legislation that emerged from Congress during that period.   Another of Fritz Mondale's most remarkable and lasting achievements  in the Senate was to engineer a change in the Senate's rules, to curb  the abuse of filibusters in thwarting the will of clear majorities of  the American people. The difficulty in passing the civil rights laws of  the sixties had gradually convinced more and more Senators that the bar  for cutting off debate in the Senate was set too high.   That might not sound difficult, but changing the way the Senate  operates is something akin to trying to change the weather.   As a freshman Senator, I had a front seat and a bit part in Fritz's  highly organized campaign to change the cloture rule. He won the change  in the cloture rule, and it is not an exaggeration to point out that  his efforts probably saved the Senate as we know it, and he did it  without changing the Senate's fundamental character.   The Senate at its best can be the conscience of the Nation. It takes  constant work and vigilance to keep our system working as it should for  the betterment of our society and its people. Keeping faith with these  fundamentals accounts for much of the legacy of Fritz Mondale.   It is easy for politicians to appeal to our worst instincts and to  our selfishness. Political leaders serve best when they appeal to the  best in us, to lift our sights, summon our will and raise us to a  higher level.   Fritz Mondale's farewell message to his staff made clear that this is  how he thought of himself to the end of his days: as a public servant.  He represented the best of what public service means.   Through his own public service Fritz Mondale invested himself in the  belief that our democracy gives each of us the opportunity to thrive,  to make justice real, and to make the economy work for all and not just  for some.   His legacy in the Senate deserves to be and will be an enduring one.                            ____________________
