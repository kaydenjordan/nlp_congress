 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a family from  Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who is dedicated to making our world a  better and safer world.   Ashley and Chris Gasperi, ER nurses, were residents of Feasterville  and worked at Temple University Hospital and St. Mary Medical Center.  Despite dedicating their careers to caring for others, they both craved  more and later decided to move to Kenya to establish a nonprofit  organization that seeks to break the vicious cycle of poverty in rural  communities.   Together, they established Ekenywa. Ekenywa works to dig wells,  sometimes hundreds of feet deep, to establish a reliable water source  to communities and schools in rural Kenya. The creation of these wells  allows for solar-powered irrigation systems, enabling communities to  farm year-round, even in the presence of a drought.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud the work of the Gasperi family and Ekenywa.  They are truly making a difference in the lives of countless people  across the world.   I speak on behalf of our entire Bucks County community when we tell  them how much we appreciate their service and their sacrifice.      Recognizing Walker Anderson for His National Science Competition                                Achievements     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a young  citizen in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who recently was recognized in a  national science competition.   Walker Anderson, a Doylestown resident and a senior at Central Bucks  West High School, recently won $2,000 as a semifinalist for the  Regeneron Science Talent Search competition. This recognition was  received by only 300 students nationwide and only four in the State of  Pennsylvania.   As impressive as this may be on its own, this is only one academic  achievement of Walker's. Walker previously placed first in the under-18  category at the World Puzzle Championship in Prague, competing on the  U.S. team, and was recently accepted into the Massachusetts Institute  of Technology.   Mr. Speaker, I am sure we will hear of Walker well into the future,  as his STEM research and grasp of complex mathematical and scientific  concepts is truly remarkable.   I wish Walker and his parents, Susan and Ken Anderson, all of the  best. I also thank Mark Hayden, Walker's STEM Research Club adviser,  for his guidance and his vision.                            ____________________
