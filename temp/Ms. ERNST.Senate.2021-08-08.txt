 Madam President, reserving the right to object, I would  ask unanimous consent that the request be further modified to include  my amendment No. 2639, and my amendment is very simple. It requires a  public price tag to be put on projects funded with taxpayer dollars by  the Department of Energy and the Department of Transportation. It  allows taxpayers to see exactly how their dollars are being spent,  whether it is on an airport, a bridge, or any other project.   Congress has renewed the provision--referred to as the Stevens  Amendment--annually for more than 30 years for some Federal Agencies,  including the Departments of Health and Human Services, Education, and  Labor. It was most recently approved by Congress and signed into law as  part of both the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and the  National Defense Authorization Act of 2021.   The infrastructure bill we are now considering will finance many  projects across the country. My amendment would provide some much  needed transparency for taxpayers by showing what projects are being  funded with their tax dollars and the actual costs associated with  them.   In practice, my amendment requires nothing more than a single  sentence disclosing the dollar amount paid by taxpayers and what that  amount represents of the overall percentage of the project's budget.  The only reason to oppose this commonsense transparency is if there is  something to hide.   I urge the consideration of my amendment and ask that my colleagues  vote yes.   Again, I ask unanimous consent that the request be further modified  to include my amendment, Ernst No. 2639.
