 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of my amendment,  which would bolster the mandate that no voter be forced to wait longer  than 30 minutes to cast their ballot.   In my home State of North Carolina, it is not uncommon for voters to  wait in line for hours on election day to vote. Long wait times come at  a cost. For people who work or have family obligations, it is  challenging to stand in line for hours to exercise their constitutional  right to vote.   Sadly, North Carolina is not alone. In recent elections, we have  witnessed lengthy wait times at polling locations across the country.  Research shows that people who live in poor and more diverse  neighborhoods are more likely to wait over an hour or more to vote.   Long wait times amount to voter suppression, plain and simple, by  causing voters to leave before voting, by  [[Page H1008]]  discouraging people from voting in future elections, and by decreasing  confidence in our democratic process.   Mr. Speaker, we must end this tactic of voter suppression, and I urge  my colleagues to vote for this amendment.
