 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. I am grateful to  all the women who have come forward with their own story of sexual  harassment and to my own colleagues in Congress who have shared their  own very, very personal stories. Thanks to their courage and strength,  it has become clear how pervasive this problem truly is across our  Nation. That must stop. Today starts the beginning of much-needed  change.    Sexual harassment and assault comes in many forms, but none of it has  a place here in Congress or in any other work environment, period.  Stop. That is especially true here in the Halls of Congress. We must  not set the gold standard. We must set the platinum standard. We must  be that beacon on the hill. That is why we must pass this resolution.   This is an important first step in our national conversation to  change our culture of harassment, but this is not and cannot be the  last stop. We must reform the entire reporting system here in Congress.  We must make sure victims are heard and are cared for. We must shine  light on the settlement process.   Then we must work to ensure that, from Congress to Hollywood, to  media and to every kitchen table across our great Nation, men and women  know that when they go to work, they will be treated with respect,  especially here in the Halls of Congress.   It will take time and commitment to make that meaningful change, and  I stand ready to help fulfill that commitment with this important, yet  vital, first step.
