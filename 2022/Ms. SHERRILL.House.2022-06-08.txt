 Madam Speaker, like so many parents across the Nation,  when I sent my four kids off to school this past week, I worried that  they wouldn't be coming home, like so many children across the country.   I got a bit hopeful when I heard that my colleagues are speaking for  women across the country, and I expected to hear then that they were  going to talk about passing universal background checks because we know  that 88 percent of the country wants to see universal background checks  passed. I am sorry, I must have missed that in their conversation.   When I heard how devastated my colleagues are for the little children  that have been dying, like I am, I thought, well, great, maybe we will  hear something about passing a law that restricts people 21 and under  from purchasing guns, like Mitch McConnell said he is willing to  consider. I must have missed that, too.    I have to tell you, we know these gun safety legislation pieces work  because in New Jersey, we have passed most of them, and we have made  major progress. In fact, while the rest of the country has seen gun  rate deaths increase by 33 percent, in New Jersey they fell by 10  percent.   Again, I am hoping, as we speak for mothers and women and children  and families across New Jersey, we start to hear about how we are going  to pass this great legislation.
