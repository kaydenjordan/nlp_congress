 Mr. President, I rise in strong support of       Senator Wyden's request for unanimous consent for the Senate       to proceed to consideration of H.R. 4004, the U.S.-Taiwan       Initiative Implementation Act.        This is a short bipartisan bill--but the principles it       defends are immense. The U.S.-Taiwan Initiative       Implementation Act provides a firm ``no'' to attempts to take       away power from where it properly belongs.        First, it says ``no'' to China's demand that the United       States ``immediately revoke'' the agreement that the bill       approves. The agreement itself is very limited--and based on       a small subset of commitments in the United States-Mexico-      Canada Agreement.        Many in this chamber correctly wanted something far more       ambitious. Yet, even this narrow agreement is too much for       China. China has no right to interfere in Taiwan's trade       policy.        For decades, Taiwan participated independently of China at       the World Trade Organization and negotiated trade agreements.       This bill rejects China's attempt to deny the people of       Taiwan their right to deepen economic relations with their       trading partners.        Second, this bill says ``no'' to the attempts made by the       executive branch to usurp the constitutional authority       Congress has over trade. This Administration wrongly asserts       that it can conclude trade agreements if changes to existing       law are ``unnecessary.'' It is Congress that constitutionally       leads on trade.        Finally, this bill says ``no'' to denying Congress and the       American people a fair understanding of our trade policy. It       requires the Administration to share negotiating texts with       Congress and make public any subsequent agreement under this       initiative for at least 60 days before the Administration       signs it.  [[Page S2213]]         The Senate should join me in saying ``yes'' to this bill,       as did every single one of our colleagues in the House of       Representatives. I second Senator Wyden's request and ask the       Senate to agree.    Mr. President, I thank Ranking Member Risch for his  leadership in completing the resolution approving the ratification of  this tax convention with Chile. And specifically, I am grateful for the  opportunity to work together to include the following declaration in  this resolution: ``In light of substantial changes made to the  international provisions of Internal Revenue Code in 2017, the Senate  declares that future tax treaties need to reflect such changes  appropriately, including in Article 23. Therefore, based on discussions  with the U.S. Department of the Treasury, additional work is required  to evaluate the policy of Article 23 in addressing relief of double  taxation and to agree on whether further changes to the terms of the  Article are necessary for future income tax treaties.''   In light of the reservation amending article 23, I yield to the  ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to elaborate  on the importance of this declaration.    Thank you, Ranking Member Risch. Without that  clarification, article 23 does not describe the primary mechanism that  mitigates double taxation for U.S. companies doing business abroad.   Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, TCJA, U.S. companies' foreign  earnings were generally not subject to tax in the U.S. until the  foreign earnings were distributed as dividends to the U.S., a concept  generally referred to as ``deferral.''   For example, pre-TCJA, if a U.S. company operated in Chile through a  subsidiary, the earnings of the Chilean subsidiary were generally not  subject to U.S. tax until the subsidiary paid a  [[Page S2216]]  dividend to the U.S. parent company. In order to prevent double  taxation of the foreign earnings, under section 902 of the Tax Code,  the U.S. provided a foreign tax credit for tax paid on those earnings.  In this scenario, with respect to tax paid by the foreign subsidiary in  Chile, the U.S. company would receive a dollar-for-dollar credit  against its U.S. tax liability once the income was distributed, and  subject to tax, in the U.S. in order to prevent double taxation of the  dividend income.   TCJA made significant changes to these rules. For one, it ended the  concept of ``deferral.'' As a result of TCJA, U.S. companies are now  generally subject to current U.S. tax on their foreign earnings, even  if they are not immediately distributed to the U.S. parent, under the  global intangible low-taxed income, GILTI, which consequently  eliminated the need to impose U.S. tax on dividends when ultimately  distributed from the foreign subsidiary to the U.S. parent company.   As a result, in order to mitigate double taxation, TCJA modified and  expanded section 960 to provide indirect tax credits for taxes paid on  GILTI. TCJA also repealed section 902 foreign tax credits because,  generally, dividends received by U.S. companies from a foreign  subsidiary are no longer subject to U.S. tax. Instead, U.S. companies  receiving foreign-source dividends are generally allowed a deduction  under section 245A of the Tax Code for those dividends received.  Because U.S. companies' foreign earnings are now largely subject to tax  under GILTI, the primary mechanism for relieving double taxation under  current law is through an indirect tax credit under section 960.  Indeed, recent IRS data confirms that an overwhelming majority of  TCJA's new category of U.S. companies' foreign earnings subject to  current U.S. tax requires a foreign tax credit to mitigate double tax  relief.   As Ranking Member Risch referenced, because Treasury did not agree to  include in the reservation a reference to the primary method for  alleviating double taxation on a U.S. company's foreign earnings, it  calls into question whether article 23 provides sufficient double tax  relief post-TCJA. While I understand this lack of clarification should  not result in increased taxation on earnings of a U.S company's Chilean  subsidiary based on current law, U.S. taxpayers may not have adequate  protection from double taxation with respect to future treaties.   In short, this outstanding issue is fundamental to one of the core  motives for entering into income tax treaties, to mitigate double  taxation to reduce barriers to cross-border investment. Thus, I intend  to hold Treasury to its commitment to include language in future income  tax treaties to more comprehensively address the post-TCJA foreign tax  credit system. And if it fails to do so, I will not support approving  ratification of any future U.S. income tax treaty.
