 Mr. Speaker, on October 7, Hamas invaded Israel in a  horrific, barbaric terrorist attack, killing more than 1,400 people,  injuring thousands more, and taking 240 citizens hostage, including  American citizens.   Today, Israel finds itself in a war with Hamas. Hundreds of thousands  of Israelis have been evacuated. A million Palestinian citizens have  had to evacuate from the fighting as Hamas holds human shields, still  holds its captives, and continues to fire more than 8,000 rockets into  Israel.   Israel needs our support. On Friday, this body will consider  legislation providing that emergency supplemental support. On Friday,  for the first time, Republicans in this body will condition that aid  and try to add legislation to rescind IRS agents that will cost the  United States Treasury $12.5 billion.   This is dangerous, reckless, and irresponsible. It is irresponsible  because it costs the Treasury money, reckless because it is  conditioning aid for the first time, and dangerous because it puts  Israel in a precarious position.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues not to allow this bill to come to  the floor and instead to put a clean supplemental bill on the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. This House of Representatives has a long history of working to  halt Iran's nuclear program. We all know why the terrorist regime in  Tehran must never ever obtain a nuclear weapon.   Look at what Iran is doing right now. They are complicit in Hamas'  terrorism in Israel. Through proxies the regime is targeting American  forces in the region with deadly force. They have built the region's  most powerful terrorist organization, Hezbollah, which destabilizes  Lebanon and threatens Israel with hundreds of thousands of  sophisticated missiles. Iran props up the criminal Assad regime in  Syria and the Houthis in Yemen. They interfere with global shipping,  evade sanctions, and attempt to murder Israelis and others around the  world.   These are only a few of the examples of Iran's nefarious behavior.  Imagine what they could and would do if they operated under the safety  of a nuclear umbrella.   Democrats and Republicans alike have said for many years: Iran can  never be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon. Since the 2018 ill- conceived withdrawal from the JCPOA, Iran's nuclear program has surged  to extraordinarily dangerous levels, and the options to stop Iran from  processing weapons grade, 90 percent highly enriched uranium are  increasingly limited.   In August, the IAEA reported that Iran's stockpile of 60 percent  enriched uranium has grown since its May report. Iran now possesses  almost 15 times the amount of enriched uranium allowed under the JCPOA.  Furthermore, in September, Iran informed the IAEA of its decision to  remove about one-third of the IAEA inspectors from the country.   I will argue that we cannot take diplomacy off the table. We must  keep all options open, but this is a very dangerous moment in dealing  with Iran's nuclear program.   In May, White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said:  ``We are also engaging Iran diplomatically regarding its nuclear  program, and we continue to believe that it was a tragic mistake to  leave the deal with nothing at all to replace it. But we have made  clear to Iran that it can never be permitted to obtain a nuclear  weapon. As President Biden has repeatedly reaffirmed, he will take the  actions that are necessary to stand by this statement, including by  recognizing Israel's freedom of action.''   The resolution before us today complements the Biden administration  policy of leaving all options on the table, and I am pleased to co-lead  it with my friend, Chairman McCaul. I will repeat: The regime in Iran  can never have a nuclear weapon.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Manning), who is the vice ranking member of the  House Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Castro), who is an esteemed member of our Foreign Affairs  Committee and ranking member of the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 559 is an important restatement of  administration policy. The Iranian regime should never ever be allowed  to acquire a nuclear weapon.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the measure, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 340, and I  yield myself such time as I may consume.   Since its inception, Hamas has been a military and political entity  dedicated to the destruction of Israel.   Rather than addressing the needs of the Palestinian people, Hamas has  furthered their suffering and has destabilized the Gaza Strip. Rather  than building schools, industries, and public infrastructure to lift up  their own people, Hamas has built a terrorist army and a network of  sophisticated attack tunnels to destroy Israel and kill Jews. The group  has terrorized its people rather than govern, using Palestinian  civilians as human shields and has terrorized its own population and  that of Israel.   Since 2007, when Hamas violently seized governing control of the Gaza  Strip, it has launched tens of thousands of rockets targeting Israeli  cities and towns from hospitals, schools, and Palestinian neighborhoods  in Gaza. It has conducted countless terrorist attacks, engaged in  hostage taking, and tortured its own, the Palestinian people.   The State Department first designated Hamas as a foreign terrorist  organization in 1997. The EU and other Western countries have done the  same. Passage of this legislation today will provide more tools for  this and future administrations to hold Hamas accountable for its  terrorism and brutality.   While Hamas leaders don't have financial assets in the U.S., new  sanctions have been unveiled by the Biden administration in recent days  that will increase pressure on some of the countries that host them.  With this legislation before us, the United States will now be able to  penalize third parties who provide assistance to Hamas.   While we desire to put more pressure on Hamas, we want to make  certain  [[Page H5192]]  that American and partner NGOs and governments are still able to assist  the people of Gaza and their humanitarian needs. The waiver present in  this legislation, while strict, will allow that assistance to continue.   Hamas' reign of terror must end. It is our only chance at a lasting  peace.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Manning), my dear friend and the vice ranking  member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Castro), an esteemed member of our Foreign Affairs Committee  and the ranking member on the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 340 is an important effort to strengthen sanctions  on Hamas, a genocidal terrorist organization that showed its true  intent and core evil on October 7, when it crossed over a border and  savagely massacred 1,400 people, took more than 240 people hostage,  wounded thousands of others, and continues its assault, as it is  written in its charter, to destroy the State of Israel and to murder  Jews.   I will remind my colleagues, if I can, that what we saw on October 7  was the worst day for the murder of Jews since the Holocaust, but I  also believe it is important that, unless we are talking about Nazis  and the Holocaust, we are very careful and avoid making comparisons.   I also think it is important that as Israel prosecutes its war  against Hamas--and it is against Hamas, not against the Palestinian  people--we recognize the humanity of the civilians, all the civilians  who are caught in the middle of this horrific war.   Hamas is a terrorist organization and must be eliminated from being a  threat to Israel, an oppressor of its people, and in control of Gaza.  That is why this legislation is so critically important. We have to see  the humanity of people.   I am a co-chair of the bipartisan, bicameral Abraham Accords Caucus.  I have committed my life to seeking and pursuing peace for Israel and  its neighbors. The Abraham Accords Caucus recognizes for the first time  that both Arabs and Jews belong to the same land and records in its  essence and in its being that by embracing each other, Arabs and Jews  cannot only live together but lift each other up and lift up the future  for the same land.   Hamas does not see that future. Hamas is a terrorist organization. It  is a threat to peace, a threat to Israel, a threat to democracy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3774.   The goal of this legislation is simple: to prevent Iran from  profiting off of its petroleum reserves.   The tyrannical Iranian regime uses these profits to fund its  terrorism and proxy activities, as well as to make advancements in its  nuclear program.   The SHIP Act aims to apply unilateral, mandatory sanctions on anyone  who does any of the following with Iranian oil: operate a port that  accepts or transfers the oil; operate a refinery that possesses Iranian  oil; run a business that purchases, sells, or finances Iranian oil;  ships Iranian oil; or knowingly works at any facility that handles  Iranian oil.   Without a doubt, the target of these sanctions is China, the largest  purchaser of Iranian oil. If China stopped buying oil from Iran, Iran  would be starved of the funds it uses to destabilize its region and the  world.   This is not something we can achieve overnight without impacting the  global energy and shipping economy. In today's interconnected world,  where China is a major player and a trading partner of the United  States, we cannot be shielded from the economic impacts these sanctions  might cause. That is why if this legislation is signed into law, we  must be both smart and forceful during its implementation, and we must  be honest with the American people about why we are willing and why we  must take this risk.   Sanctions are a diplomatic tool. They are not an end in themselves.  The bold petroleum and financial sanctions that drove Iran to the table  to negotiate JCPOA were multilateral, and we did the hard work of  uniting the world behind the policy before the implementation of those  sanctions.   As it stands today, we would be going at this policy alone. That is  why Congress should work with this and any future administration to do  the hard diplomatic work of bringing allies and partners into the plan.  That is what will ultimately increase our chances of succeeding.                                time  1500    While I am a proud cosponsor of this bill, I am also concerned by the  very  [[Page H5196]]  limited flexibility the administration would have with the waiver in  this bill. It is one of the strictest standards that can be found in  law. I am open to addressing that aspect of the bill if this measure  goes to conference with the Senate to ensure that the waiver provision  isn't virtually unusable.   Due to the clear and present threat posed by Iran to the United  States and our allies, I believe we must use every tool at our disposal  to address the challenge. The new sanctions offered by the SHIP Act  provide important tools in our toolbox that could end Chinese purchases  of oil.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I do want to reflect on the comments of  my friend, Mr. Hill, because he brings up a really important point.   It is vitally important to understand that Iran connects a lot of  dots:   Iran is funding Hamas that attacked Israel and massacred 1,400 people  and took 240 hostages, including Americans.   Iran is providing weapons to Russia in their attack on Ukraine.   Iran is selling oil to China.   The war in Gaza and the war in Ukraine have a lot of common  denominators. Both are wars against democracies with the intent of  wiping out those democracies, but no intent, either with Putin in  Russia or Hamas against Israel, in stopping there.   The United States has an important role in leading and bringing  together the world to support our allies in Ukraine and Israel. That is  why it is so important that, as we stand here in a most perilous time,  we unite as a body in this Congress to support our allies, not to  divide, not to use political gamesmanship to use Israel as a partisan  wedge, but to say we will stand together and support our allies. That  is why I call our folks to come to this body and support the  President's supplemental request.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3774 is an important effort to cut  funding off from the Iranian regime. I strongly urge my colleagues to  support this measure.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, and I  yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have spoken about Iran, Hamas, and the various bills  on the floor today seeking to bring peace and prosperity to the region.  That is why I am proud to lead H. Res. 599, urging the European Union  to designate Hezbollah in its entirety as a terrorist organization.   I thank our former colleague and the current president of the  American Jewish Committee, Ted Deutch, for his groundbreaking work on  this issue.   Like Hamas, Hezbollah is an Iran-backed terrorist organization  committed to the destruction of Israel and of peace throughout the  region, and the U.S. has done the right thing by recognizing it as  such.   Our good friends in Europe often make a distinction between the  organization's political and military wings, seeing the former as a  partner they can try to work with. Looking at how Lebanon has been on  the verge of becoming a failed state, we cannot underestimate the  pernicious role played by Hezbollah.   Hezbollah bombed our Embassy in Beirut in April 1983, killing 63  people. Then, in October of the same year, attacked a Marine Corps  barracks, killing 241 Americans.   Their nefarious behavior has never stopped. They murdered Israeli  tourists in Bulgaria in 2012 and tried to do so again in Cyprus in  2013. Two years later, they got caught in Cyprus with 8 tons of  ammonium nitrate.   That year, Congress passed the Hezbollah International Financing  Prevention Act of 2015, which I was proud to help lead and follow up on  in 2018.   Despite our best efforts to counter it, the resolution describes in  detail Hezbollah's nefarious activities in Belgium, France, and Germany  and throughout the European Union.   I have always said that the world is at its best when America leads.  We have led in countering Hezbollah, and now we must urge our European  allies to join us as we look at Hezbollah's skirmishing with Israel and  loudly supporting Hamas and threatening a war on a second front at a  most perilous time.   I hope and trust our European partners will take this as a wake-up  call. Hezbollah is a terrorist organization in its entirety and must be  designated as such in its entirety.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Manning), my good friend and the vice ranking  member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 599 is critical for making sure our friends and  allies in Europe join us in pushing back against Hezbollah and making  sure it no longer can pose a threat to Lebanon, Israel, and the people  of the region.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, the United States and many of our allies have long been  concerned about Palestinian textbooks that contain blatant anti-Semitic  and anti-Zionist references that incite hatred and violence toward the  Jewish people.   In May, the European Parliament went so far as to pass a resolution  condemning the Palestinian Authority over the hateful content of its  textbooks and conditioned future funding for education on the removal  of that anti-Semitic material.   The United Nations Relief and Works Agency, known as UNRWA, which  administers many schools in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, is  required by its mandate to use host country books.   Let me say that again in another way. UNRWA does not write  Palestinian textbooks, the Palestinians do, and UNRWA is required to  use the host nation's book under its mandate.   The bill before us tasks the Secretary of State to write a report to  Congress that reviews the curriculum, including textbooks, leaflets,  pamphlets, magazines, and other instructional materials used in UNRWA  schools. This report will be important and will help both the Congress  and the executive branch understand the full scope of the problems,  work to improve these textbooks, and remove the content that is not  only untrue but leads to further violence and instability in the  region.   I will add one more important comment about UNRWA. Despite the issue  related to the Palestinian Authority's textbooks that we are discussing  at this moment, thousands of UNRWA employees, many of whom have  yearslong relationships with the U.S., remain in Gaza doing dangerous  humanitarian work. Some have, sadly, lost their lives.   Let's keep them in mind as this conflict continues, but let's also  keep in mind that Israel must defeat Hamas.   I am proud to cosponsor this legislation and ask my colleagues to  vote in support of this important bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman), a senior member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee and, importantly, the author of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Manning), the vice ranking member of the House  Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, my colleague Mr. Sherman made mention of the stated  intent of the terrorist scheme to destroy Israel, to try again and  again. I want to share an email I got today talking about what is going  on right now.   It says: Among the IDF soldiers killed in Gaza yesterday, eight were  in a single armored personnel carrier that was hit by a rocket- propelled grenade. They were part of the Givati infantry brigade. One  of them, 2nd Lt. Pedayah Mark, lost his father in a terror attack on  their family car near Otneil 7 years ago. Pedayah, who was 13 years old  at the time, was injured along with his mother. His uncle was among  those murdered in Kibbutz Be'eri on October 7.   The terrorists continue to attack and attack, oftentimes striking the  same family. We need to make sure we change what the kids are learning.   H.R. 3266 is an important tool in our fight against the hatred and in  support of peace in Palestinian education, the education of the  children.   Let me add one more statistic. In the attack on October 7, 20  children under 18 were orphaned, both their parents were killed.  Eighteen young people between the age of 18 and 25 lost both parents.  Ninety-six children under 18 lost one parent.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues, every one of them, to support  this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
