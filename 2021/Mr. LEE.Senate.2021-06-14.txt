 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a piece of  legislation called the Tougher Enforcement Against Monopolists Act, or  the TEAM Act. I am grateful that my good friend and ranking member of  the Judiciary Committee, the senior Senator from Iowa, Chuck Grassley,  has joined me as a cosponsor of the bill.   Now, I am aware that our House colleagues just recently introduced  several bills intended to fight anti-competitive conduct by Big Tech.  Those bills, in my view, don't go far enough. America is facing a  panoply of competition concerns not just in Big Tech but across the  entire economy. We need a holistic approach that benefits all  consumers, in every industry. We need to deal with all the monopolists  hurting competition.   Even worse, the House bills not only have too small of a target, but  they use too big of a sledgehammer to hit it. They create a truly  massive expansion of Federal regulatory power and are the first steps  toward a command-and-control economy.   Responding to Big Tech with Big Government is adding insult to  injury, not to mention something I doubt any conservative will be able  to support. We don't need a bigger government. We need to make the one  we have work better.   The TEAM Act avoids each of these mistakes. Instead of a narrow focus  and Big Government approach, this bill will improve Federal antitrust  enforcement for the entire economy without making government bigger.   The TEAM Act improves antitrust law in two ways. The first is putting  all of our antitrust enforcers on one team. The TEAM Act unites our two  Federal antitrust enforcement Agencies into one. For over a century,  American antitrust enforcement has been something of a two-headed  creature sometimes at odds with itself. The results have been delays to  enforcement and consumer redress, uncertainty for businesses, and even  conflicting antitrust enforcement policy.   Just recently, the two Agencies actually argued against each other on  opposite sides of an appeal before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  Ninth Circuit. This arrangement isn't working for anyone--anyone, that  is, perhaps, except corporations looking for an opportunity to game the  system.   I hope that the bill can also put our two parties on the same team  when it comes to antitrust reform. Our present reform movement is  filled with bipartisan fervor to improve the lives of our constituents  by improving competition in the markets that serve them and protecting  them from the monopolists that exercise so much unearned power over  huge swaths of our economy. Now, we don't agree on everything, but we  do agree on this. It is my sincere belief that this bill represents the  best and, hopefully, most bipartisan path forward.   That brings me to the second focus of the bill: preventing antitrust  harm by monopolists. I use the term ``antitrust harm'' here very  deliberately. In certain corners of the antitrust policy world, it has  become fashionable to talk of being pro-monopoly or anti-monopoly,  which is often tied to being pro- or anti-democracy. That is also  deliberate terminology, and I think it is dangerous. It is a sleight of  hand meant to move the conversation away from specific conduct and  whether that conduct harms competition, to do so regardless and to  instead imply that all that matters in this context, in this inquiry,  is size and whether you support or defend a business based on its size.  That position is both unserious and economically indefensible. Even the  briefest, most passing moment of reflection on this will demonstrate  its absurdity.   If you are anti-monopoly, are you also anti-patent? Patents are,  after all, government-granted monopolies. The entire purpose of the  patent is to allow  [[Page S4520]]  its holder to exclude competition for a limited period of time and  charge the highest price that the market will bear. But we allow this  because the prospect of collecting monopoly profits acts as an  incentive to innovate and invest in new ideas.   The same principle is at work in market monopolies. The prospect of  obtaining a monopoly through competition on the merits incentivizes  competitors to offer consumers better products and services at lower  prices. This free market system built on competition and innovation is  responsible for many of the great achievements of mankind and the  economic flourishing of the greatest civilization the world has ever  known.   But even more important is the foundational principle of our Republic  that the law deals with conduct, not status. We punish people for what  they do, not who they are. ``Big is bad'' abandons that fundamental  American principle of law. Instead, the facile insistence on being  simply ``anti-monopoly'' belies the proponents' true priorities. It  means being anti-business even when it hurts consumers. It is the  economic version of cutting off your nose to spite your face.   The ``big is bad'' philosophy is also part of a broader effort to  overturn the consumer welfare standard. This critical component of U.S.  antitrust law has been widely misunderstood, often as a result of  willful misrepresentation. The consumer welfare standard does not  protect monopolists. It does not mean the government loses, and it is  decidedly not limited to a narrow focus on prices.   Rather, the consumer welfare standard is a statement about the  overarching goals of antitrust law; namely, that the purpose of  antitrust is to advance the economic welfare of consumers as opposed to  protecting the competitors themselves or advancing unrelated social  policies.   As I note in my introduction to the new edition of ``The Antitrust  Paradox,'' Judge Robert Bork himself explicitly described the consumer  welfare standard as being broader than an inquiry into price, and it is  one that certainly includes an inquiry into quality, innovation, and  consumer choice. In other words, whatever consumers value, that is what  is captured by ``consumer welfare.''   But it is much easier to argue against the consumer welfare standard  by pretending that it only cares about lower prices and, therefore, is  incapable of addressing consumer harm in markets with free products,  such as many online services. This misrepresentation says a lot about  the true goals of the so-called anti-monopoly crowd. If they really  cared about the nonprice facets of competition, they wouldn't need to  abandon the consumer welfare standard to promote it. But that isn't  their true goal.   The real problem they have with the consumer welfare standard is the  way that it constrains judges from advancing unrelated policy goals. It  turns out the push to abandon the consumer welfare standard is not  about stopping monopolies or helping consumers. It is simply a Trojan  horse for woke social policy.   Now, a proper application of the antitrust laws does have political  benefits--what Utah's State constitution refers to as ``the dispersion  of economic and political power''--but those are secondary benefits.  Antitrust is not primarily a political tool.   If a company acquires market power as a result of competing on the  merits, then any influence that flows from that will, at least, be a  result of consumer choices. Just as citizens vote at the ballot box,  consumers vote at the checkout aisle. But if that market power is  obtained or grown through nefarious or anti-competitive means, the  resulting market power is illegitimate and a threat to the Republic,  which leads to the point that, of course, many monopolies are bad. They  are genuinely bad.   These are those monopolies obtained or prolonged not through  competition on the merits but through anti-competitive and exclusionary  conduct. This conduct obstructs rather than facilitates the natural  operation of the free market, using raw market power to prevent  consumers from making optimal choices and then starving them of lower  prices, higher quality, and new offerings.   Competitive conduct benefits both businesses and consumers. Anti- competitive conduct only helps the monopolist.   Unfortunately, there have been attempts to defend some anti- competitive conduct. This is most often done through the use of  speculative and convoluted economic models that claim to predict the  future, almost always predicting that a merger or specific conduct  won't actually harm competition.   We have, sadly, seen an overcorrection from the days lamented by  Judge Bork when courts and enforcers ignored basic economic analysis.  Now ``the age of sophists, economists, and calculators has succeeded,''  and our antitrust enforcement efforts are frequently hampered by what  Judge Bork called an ``economic extravaganza.'' The result has been  that some conduct and mergers that should have been condemned have  instead escaped much needed scrutiny.   All of this is why the TEAM Act categorically rejects the Manichean  belief that big is always bad, while still acknowledging that  concentrated economic power can be just as dangerous as concentrated  political power, and, in fact, one often leads to the other In this  way, it embraces antitrust laws as sort of federalism for the economy,  and it does so by focusing not on mere size but on antitrust harm; that  is, whether something actually harms consumers by harming competition.    The bill strengthens our ability to prevent and correct antitrust  harm in three ways.   The TEAM Act strengthens the antitrust laws. It includes a market  share-based merger presumption, improves the HSR Act, codifies the  consumer welfare standard, and makes it harder for monopolists to  justify or excuse anti-competitive comment.   The TEAM Act strengthens antitrust enforcers. In addition to  consolidating Federal antitrust enforcement at the Department of  Justice, the bill also includes a version of the Merger Filing Fee  Modernization Act, introduced by Senators Klobuchar and Grassley. Most  significantly, the bill roughly doubles the amount of money  appropriated to Federal antitrust enforcement, ensuring that our  antitrust enforcers have all the resources they need to protect  American consumers.   The TEAM Act strengthens anti-trust remedies. The bill repeals  Illinois Brick and Hanover Shoe to ensure that consumers are able to  recover damages from anticompetitive conduct. Even more significantly,  the bill allows the Justice Department to recover trebled damages on  behalf of consumers and imposes civil fines for knowingly violating the  antitrust laws.   Now, I believe these reforms reflect the best way to strike the  balance of protecting competition and consumer welfare, while limiting  government intervention in the free market. In an era in which would-be  monopolists want to move fast and break things, it is essential that  our antitrust enforcers are empowered to move fast and break them up.   This is the prudent and the conservative approach. Better antitrust  enforcement means less regulation and thus smaller government.   This is also a wiser approach than attempting to statutorily prohibit  certain categories of conduct. That approach abandons one of the  greatest strengths of American antitrust law: the fact-specific nature  of every inquiry. Case-by-case adjudication is what allows us to  maximize enforcement while minimizing false positives. The TEAM Act  avoids the black-and-white pronouncements of other legislative  proposals and instead updates the mechanics of how the antitrust laws  are applied to address the enforcement gaps of recent decades.   As I have said before, we find ourselves at a critical moment. The  threat to competition and free markets is real. Doing nothing is not an  option. At the same time, we simply cannot allow the need to ``do  something'' to push us into embracing bad policy that will have  unintended consequences and push America closer to a government- regulated economy.   I look forward to working closely with my colleagues and with friends  on both sides of the aisle and at both ends of the Capitol in order to  advance the TEAM Act and help protect American consumers  [[Page S4521]]                                       ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Carper, Mr. Brown,          Ms. Hirono, Mr. Wyden, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Booker, Mr. Reed, Mr.          Blumenthal, and Mr. Kaine):   S. 2043.
