 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on this bill.   First, I would like us to clarify exactly some of the things that we  are able to deliver in this bill:   One is low-income taxpayer exception to the Private Debt Collection  program.   The second is that it codifies the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance  program that helps low-income taxpayers prepare their tax returns.   The third is that the bill allows the IRS to refer taxpayers needing  assistance to low-income taxpayer clinics.   The bill also creates a single point of contact within the IRS to  identify identity theft victims.   And, lastly, the bill allows all taxpayers, over the next 5 years, to  request an identity protection personal identification number to use to  prevent identity theft.   So, I would like to commend all of those positive concessions  delivered to the American people in this bill. However, I would also  like to lodge some of my concerns perhaps for us to address in the  future.   Dylan Matthews at Vox recently published an article that said: ``It  is a huge scandal that Congress has not yet instructed the IRS to  automatically prepare taxes for the vast majority of Americans. The IRS  has all the information required to do that for all but  [[Page H3166]]  a few taxpayers,'' and the main reason it doesn't may have to do with  the role of money in politics.   So, with this bill, I would like to again commend the advancements  that we have made for working-class people, but, long term, we should  be looking at a solution where everyday people do not necessarily have  to spend hours every year preparing tax returns when the majority of  Americans have relatively simple and straightforward returns. I would  like to just rise and commend those positive contributions and also  point the way forward in the future.
