 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, but  like a typical marine, he actually got it wrong. I was actually in the  Navy.    I was a Navy officer. I am sure that was on purpose.   So standing here actually as a Navy officer, being asked to address  this bill, H.R. 873, and to support this bill, being asked by a bunch  of marines is a true honor, and it is very humbling at the same time.   Mr. Speaker, I do rise in support of H.R. 873, the Global War on  Terrorism War Memorial Act, to create the foundation, which will then  provide for the Global War on Terrorism Memorial right here on the  National Mall.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Gallego from Arizona; Mr. Moulton from  Massachusetts; and, of course, Mr. Gallagher from Wisconsin, my  classmate here in the 115th Congress, a fellow freshman. Again, it is  quite a privilege to stand here with these fellow veterans as peers,  but also as a true sign of bipartisanship in the House of  Representatives.   Now, I had remarks prepared yesterday to address the House about this  topic, but last night I went to Arlington National Cemetery. I took my  two daughters, who are here in town. We saw what people normally see,  the changing of the guard, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, the tomb of  President Kennedy. But I made it a point to go to area 60, the area  where there are many recent interments from the people, from our  veterans, from our brethren, who have served in the global war on  terrorism.    On that hallowed ground, I made it a point to seek out someone I  served with, a gentleman by the name of Brendan Looney. I served with  Mr. Looney in Korea. He was an intelligence officer back then. Both of  us made sure that we wanted to do more. I went forward, but Brendan  Looney wanted to do more than just that: he wanted to become a SEAL,  and he did. He served in Iraq and he served in Afghanistan. It was in  2010 when the Blackhawk he was riding in went down and crashed, killing  everybody onboard.   Now, Brendan is interred in area 60 at Arlington National Cemetery  right along with his brethren, with his brother in arms, Travis Manion.  I looked at Travis Manion's tombstone, and on that tombstone is a quote  that I would like to share. On that tombstone, it says:         If not me, then who?    And right next to Mr. Manion's tombstone was another 19-year-old who  was interred there, a veteran of the global war on terrorism. And on  his tombstone was a quote that I would like to share. It said:         I just want to do my part.    Mr. Speaker, it is this attitude that was inscribed on those  tombstones which is the attitude of this generation of veterans who  served in the global war on terrorism, my generation, our generation,  men and women who didn't step back; instead, they stepped forward. They  didn't just step forward; they ran forward, they ran to the fight.   Now, also at Arlington National Cemetery was another quote that I  would like to share, and it was from John F. Kennedy. The quote that  they had up there by his tomb was from one of his speeches, in which he  stated:         In the long history of the world, only a few generations       have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour       of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibility.       I welcome it.                                time  1145    The men and women who served in the global war on terrorism did not  shrink from that responsibility. They did not run away. They ran  forward.   So, Mr. Speaker, I believe that it is important to have this memorial  because the families, the friends, the men and women of this country  should not just have to go to cemeteries to honor those who served and  paid the ultimate sacrifice. That is why I stand here, Mr. Speaker, in  full support of the memorial here on the National Mall to not just  honor, but to celebrate the service and the sacrifice of the veterans  of the global war on terrorism.
