 Madam Speaker, so we just took up the humanitarian  crisis that is going on at our border and passed the Senate bill, so  there will be a tremendous amount of money that will be going to  provide more beds, shelter, food, transportation, whatever is needed.  The one thing that the Senate bill is especially void of is money to  secure our border.   It is something to say that, with all of the problems in the Senate  bill, the things that were not addressed in the Senate bill, the fact  that it was so much better than the House bill says an awful lot about  the House bill and its shortcomings.   We have, still, and will after this bill is signed into law and money  is put into use, a crisis on our southern border.   As was pointed out to me after some of us visited Normandy with the  Speaker on the 75th anniversary of D-Day, on D-Day, we had 150,000 or  so Allied troops that invaded Normandy, over 150,000, a tremendous  number, landing craft, parachuting. Yet just in the month of May, that  is about how many invaded our southern border--that we caught. We don't  know how many didn't get caught.   Some think that for every one we actually catch and in-process, there  is one that gets away. We don't know.   We know that there are a great number of people who are not caught  because they are picked up on cameras  [[Page H5253]]  and with other information that is gleaned on the border.   But it will continue to be a problem after this money is spent, and  there is some concern--it is legitimate--that when you have what the  civil litigation would indicate is an attractive nuisance--that is the  terminology in a lawsuit--and you don't put up a fence, a wall,  something to impede people from coming into property illegally, then,  if they hurt themselves--and the example most people think of is a  swimming pool or a pool or a pond.                                time  1745    If you have that water on your property, and you don't bother to put  up a fence or a wall, and someone comes onto your property and drowns,  you are going to end up paying a tremendous amount of money, normally,  to the family of whoever drowned coming onto your property when it was  not properly secured with a fence or a wall.   That is not to say it has to be electrified or some kind of really  intense structure. But you need to have something that would impede  somebody from coming in and drowning in your water.   Now, the moment of silence earlier, most of us were deeply moved by  the picture, horrendously tragic, of a child, who seemed to be so  close, even sharing the father's shirt, with her little arm around his  neck.   Having had girls growing up, that is an emotional picture for some of  us especially.   But we have what most would say is the highest-evolved justice  system, judicial system, litigation system in history. It has come  through thousands of years of different types of laws, be them looking  up at the bust of Hammurabi, the Code of Hammurabi, the Justinian Code.  We have a Napoleonic Code.   We have had thousands of years of laws, and the civil litigation in  this country is perhaps at the most perfected--a long way from being  perfect, but as perfected as it has ever been anywhere.   That is where this concept of attractive nuisance has evolved and  arisen from. There is a responsibility when you know there is something  so attractive that people will be tempted to break the law and enter  that property illegally, potentially, to their own detriment.   What are you supposed to do if you are a caring individual in charge  of property? You put up a fence or wall, just like our former President  Obama did.   I understand he built a 10-foot wall around his home. That is a good,  responsible thing to do. It was good enough for the President when he  was in the White House to raise the height of the fence and wall around  the White House, and it is good enough for the former President as he  built a wall around his private residence.   It is a good, responsible thing to do by a responsible person in  charge of property, not only to provide privacy, but also to keep  people from being lured to their own detriment.   It is high time we address that on our southern border. There are  very few people in this body, on either side of the aisle, who have not  at some point said that we need to secure our border, that we can't  keep having people pour into this country illegally.   But something strange has happened as our friends have taken over the  majority and Republicans have moved into the minority. Some people have  realized: Wait a minute. If these people keep flooding into our country  from other countries illegally, and they see us as the party that keeps  the border porous and open for them to keep pouring in, they will  surely reward us with their votes, so we will be able to develop a  permanent majority.   The only trouble with that is that when that happens, we are  destroying the goose that had been laying golden eggs of opportunity,  freedom, incredible liberty like the world had never seen before, the  United States of America and our Constitution, followed with the Bill  of Rights.   Yes, it has taken a while to get them continuing to evolve toward  greater perfection. But we have to do something, because if we don't,  if we continue to have people pouring into the United States--when you  look at the example of Normandy with 150,000 or so, we had that many  illegally invading America in 1 month.   We have to do something because the people pouring in have not been  educated on the responsibilities of maintaining self-government. They  will end up forcing this country--not intentionally but because they do  not understand the responsibility involved in continuing this little  experiment in self-government that has lasted 230 years. They will  unintentionally give way to either communism or progressivism, if you  prefer that these days, or a pure dictatorship.   It is very disconcerting that, in this country, there is more and  more rising emotion between different political thought.   Look at the difference between the American Revolution, the 8 years  that it took to win our independence, 1775 to 1783, and toward the end  of the year when the Treaty of Paris was signed. It started, ``In the  Name of the Most Holy and Undivided Trinity.'' The British signed that.  They thought that would be an oath that they would have to take so  seriously in England that they would not breach that oath taken in the  name of the ``Most Holy and Undivided Trinity.''   Historians know, normally, a government doesn't last more than 200  years, and they are lucky if they last 200 years. We have gone 230.   People look at the 10 years of the French Revolution, from about  1789, when our Constitution was ratified and when the Bastille was  stormed, to 1799. What was the result of the French Revolution? It was  an Emperor named Napoleon.   Some historians say that they think the big difference between the  U.S. Revolution resulting in liberty and the French Revolution  resulting in hundreds of thousands of heads being cut off was our  Revolution was about liberty.   The Founding Fathers were not out there to cut off heads. They were  out there to grab and preserve liberty, whereas in the French  Revolution, there was so much sentiment of getting revenge that it  ended up culminating in an Emperor named Napoleon.   We now seem to have so much animus and so much anger. There is some,  from time to time, in this body. But some of the most vocal people  pushing for impeachment, like my friend Al Green, he, literally, is a  friend. He is a Christian brother. I disagree with him strongly on the  need for impeachment, but I like the guy. He is my brother. I know he  would not be saying what he does unless he really believes it.   I would never wish harm on somebody that I cared about like that. We  can disagree without being mean. Yet, too often now, that is being  lost.   We have to preserve this place. We are about to recognize our  anniversary, the Fourth of July, when the Declaration of Independence  was made public. This needs to be a time of serious reflection.   It ought to include John Adams' encouragement to celebrate, have  parades, enjoy families, enjoy the country. Of course, he says the  firing of guns. We try not to do that. Instead, they use fireworks.   He knew there ought to be a celebration to remind us of the  sacrifice, what was gained through that great sacrifice, and the  responsibility that ensued, along with the liberty.   We should also remember the way they got to the Constitution was when  Randolph, from Virginia, proposed that, after 5 weeks of yelling and  fussing, that even though they didn't have money to hire a chaplain,  why don't they take a few days off and gather together, on our Nation's  Independence Day, at a local church there in Philadelphia. They ended  up settling on the Reformed Calvinist Church, with the Right Reverend  William Rogers presiding, and they worshipped God together. They were  led in prayer by Reverend Rogers. They came back after that and gave us  the most extraordinary founding document in the history of the world  that we still use 232 years later. It was a time of reflection.   Unless we secure our border though, we will not be a shining light on  a hill. We will be a transit station for people around the world to  pass through, hoping for something great but, instead, only seeing a  once-great country whose experiment in self-government was destroyed by  too many people coming in too quickly, who did not know, as they hadn't  been educated, how to go about preserving self-government.  [[Page H5254]]    My hope and prayer for this Independence Day is that we will return  to an appreciation for the God from whom all blessings, all good  things, flow. If we do that, we can preserve this place for generations  to come.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.
