 I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule XXII,  the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 33,  H.J. Res. 7, and that at 5:45 p.m. today it be considered read a third  time, and the Senate vote on passage of the joint resolution without  any intervening action or debate.   PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.   The clerk will report the joint resolution by title.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         A joint resolution (H. J. Res. 7) relating to a national       emergency declared by the President on March 13, 2020.    There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the joint  resolution.                        Tribute to Dr. Ariel Marshall     Mr. President, I now get to the reason that I came to  the floor today, which is to recognize and express appreciation for a  member of my staff, my legislative director, Dr. Ariel Marshall. Ariel  will be leaving for a new opportunity next month, and I can't let her  go without thanking her for her service and sharing how much she has  meant to me, to her colleagues, and to the State of New Hampshire over  the past 8 years. And all you have to do is look at all of our staff  from our DC office who are here on the floor as part of this  recognition of Ariel.   Ariel came to my Senate office in 2015 through a congressional  fellowship for scientists and engineers with an interest in public  policy. As a chemist with a Ph.D. in hand, Ariel approached  policymaking as if it were a research topic or an experiment. She asked  questions. She identified problems. She dove into research to  understand different subjects and issue areas and their relationship to  one another. She formed theories based on her observations. She looked  for creative ways to test her ideas and analyze her findings, and she  eagerly shared her conclusions with her colleagues and with an open  mind on how the process could be improved.   With her background, it is no surprise that Ariel quickly developed a  reputation as a capable and friendly team player. As her fellowship  came to an end, Ariel made the decision to stay on staff as a  legislative assistant with a focus on energy and environmental issues.   Her responsibilities grew in a very short time when she became a  senior domestic policy adviser. And when the legislative director  position opened on my team, Ariel was a natural fit, and she accepted  her new leadership role with her trademark positivity, grace, and good  humor.   Over the last 8 years, there have been historic moments that I know  will be the cornerstone of Ariel's memories in the Senate. At the top  of that list--for me, anyway--is Ariel's success in getting the  Shaheen-Portman--Portman-Shaheen energy efficiency bill across the  finish line and signed into law.   Her steady, unwavering efforts to move that bill forward, year after  year, piece by piece, should be taught to every incoming legislative  staffer in the Senate. It is a study in perseverance and effectiveness.    Her work on Shaheen-Portman--and the work of others before her--is  making a huge difference in the global fight against climate change.   Ariel was also instrumental during one of the most difficult, most  intense, and most important crises this body has had to face--the fight  against COVID. Ariel led our legislative team at a time of great  uncertainty here in the Senate. She was a key negotiator of the  Senate's legislative response, including the historic CARES Act.  Ariel's work on that bill, particularly on the small business  provisions and the PPP program--in the midst of a nationwide pandemic  and a potential economic collapse--helped to save millions of jobs  around the country. Her efforts kept workers employed and food on the  table for countless concerned families across this country.   Finally, Ariel was also our leading negotiator throughout the  bipartisan infrastructure debate during the summer and fall of 2021.  Ariel was particularly integral to both the water infrastructure and  broadband investments, and she spent countless late nights--and had  numerous slices of cold pizza--with me, with Senator Collins, and with  the other bipartisan members of that group.   The infrastructure bill is a huge legislative achievement. It is one  that will bring countless benefits to Americans for years to come. One  of its most important accomplishments was proving that Republicans and  Democrats could still work together to get big things done even in this  difficult political climate. This would not have happened without the  work of people like Ariel, who is tough, patient, effective, and  focused on making a difference.   I am proud of all of the legislative work we have accomplished over  these last 8 years in my office, and Ariel's leadership has been  integral to these successes.   The legislation, the negotiating, the policymaking--that is just one  measure of Ariel's impact. With her background in research and  chemistry, Ariel knows that it is a community, or a team, that finds  innovations and makes discoveries. That much is clear in her leadership  of our legislative staff. She has shaped a team that approaches issues  and problems just as she would: by asking the right questions, by  searching for solutions, by evaluating all of the options, by getting  the job done.   All who work with Ariel view her not only as a wealth of knowledge  but also as a dear colleague, a sympathetic ear, and a treasured  friend. The relationships she has built and the values she has  instilled in her team--I think that is an equal part of her legacy and  long tenure on my staff.   These last few weeks have been bittersweet because, while all of us  are excited about what is ahead for Ariel, we will also miss her  wisdom, her counsel, her can-do attitude, her humor, and her infectious  laugh.   Thank you, Ariel, for giving so much to me, to your colleagues, to  New Hampshire, and to the country during your service in the U.S.  Senate.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that my  Defense fellow, Quentin Miller, and my foreign policy fellow, Alicia  Edwards, be given floor privileges for the remainder of the 118th  Congress.
