 Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend, Chairman Engel.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 809, which, as the  chairman mentioned, I authored. This resolution expresses the  importance of our country's alliance with the Republic of Korea.   Affirmation of this alliance during this time of transition to a new  administration and a new Congress is being closely watched throughout  the Indo-Pacific region, and it is encouraging to note that support for  this resolution is bipartisan and was passed unanimously by the House  Committee on Foreign Affairs.   A little over 100 years ago, the Republic of Korea declared itself  sovereign and formed a provisional government. Today, it is one of the  most vibrant, prosperous, and free societies in the world.                                time  1300    The United States and South Korea have a special diplomatic,  economic, and security relationship, strengthened by shared strategic  interests and a commitment cemented by democratic values.   Our alliance is central to advancing democracy, free markets, human  rights, the rule of law, peace and security, and crushing COVID-19, not  only in the Indo-Pacific region, but throughout the world.   But this alliance is not limited to international cooperation. Korean  Americans contribute so much to the fabric of our American communities,  including the communities in my district in New York. Nearly 2 million  Korean Americans live across our country, and I know from my personal  experience that Korean Americans enrich all aspects of our society.   I am proud to lead this resolution through the House of  Representatives today and call on my colleagues to continue to  strengthen diplomatic, economic, and security ties between the U.S. and  our vital ally, South Korea.
