 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my  alma mater, Ewing High School, on winning the NJSIAA 2022-2023 Group 3  girls' basketball championship--and their first State title in 24  years.   Their hard-fought victory comes after months of diligent work,  consistent growth, and exceptional achievement.   I hope this big win instills in them the confidence and determination  to succeed in any challenge that comes their way. There is no obstacle  that these young women cannot overcome.   I hope head coach Dan Montferrat and the girls' basketball team are  celebrating their accomplishment and enjoying this exciting time.   I wish Ewing High School all the best, and, as always, go Blue  Devils.                            ____________________
