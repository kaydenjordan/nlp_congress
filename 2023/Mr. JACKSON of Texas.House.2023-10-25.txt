 Mr. Speaker, there has never been a more  important moment in the relationship between the United States and  Israel. I call upon this body to take all necessary actions to  unequivocally stand with Israel as it fights for its very existence in  this unprovoked war launched by Iranian-backed Hamas terrorists.   I have and always will do everything in my power to stand with  Israel. I, like the rest of the civilized world, have been disgusted  with the unspeakable and barbaric atrocities imposed on innocent  Israeli women and children by these animals that call themselves Hamas.   We must enact policies to provide Israel with anything and everything  it needs to defend itself, to immediately end all illegal aid payments  to the Palestinian terrorists, and to hold Iran accountable. As long as  I have a vote in Congress, I will always cast my vote in support of the  Jewish state.
