 Madam Speaker, thank you very much and thank you for  conducting the ceremony today.   I want to thank Representative Lowey and Representative King for  those kind introductions.   I also want to acknowledge the Members of the entire New York State  delegation that are here today. I look forward to working with all of  you to help our State in a time that they are clearly in need, in a  fiscal crisis.   I also want to acknowledge my family members that are here today: My  wife, Martina, and my daughter, Anna. Thank you for your love and  support during this campaign. My mother, Pamela, and my two brothers,  Larry and Luke, are also here. Thank you for all your support during my  entire time of public service. I love you all very much.   I also want to acknowledge two special friends of mine that are here  in the audience today, Marina Woolcock and Dr. John Long. John Long has  been an adviser and mentor to me my entire career in public service.  Dr. John Long is 93 years young, and he is a veteran of World  War II.  If we could just acknowledge Dr. Long and thank him for his service to  our country.    Finally, yesterday was my late father's birthday. He would have been  82. My father was a doctor in Buffalo, New York. I want to wish him a  happy birthday in heaven, and I want to thank him for instilling in me  a desire to serve others as he did.   I just want to conclude with a message to the citizens of the 27th  Congressional District. It is the greatest honor of my life to be  chosen by you to represent you in Congress. As your Congressman, I  promise to fight hard every day for the comeback of our region and to  always serve with honesty and integrity.   Thank you very much.                            ____________________
