 Madam President, today the Senate takes up legislation to  avert an economically catastrophic default on U.S. sovereign  obligations. The Department of the Treasury has advised the Congress  that without passage of this legislation by June 5, the United States  will default.   Any modifications to the legislative text under consideration by the  Senate will require reconsideration of the measure by the House,  pushing passage of such legislation past Treasury's June 5 deadline and  forcing a default. Our overriding governing responsibility is to avoid  default and the massive economic damage it would impose on American  families and businesses.   Accordingly, I will oppose all amendments offered to this measure to  ensure Senate passage of the measure as passed by the House and to  protect families and businesses from economic catastrophe.
