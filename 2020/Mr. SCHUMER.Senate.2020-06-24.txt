 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the names of George Floyd, Breonna  Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery continue to ring in the Nation's ears, a  searing reminder of the desperate need to reform policing and truly  address injustice in America. Their memory is a national call to  action.   Democrats answered that call by proposing a broad, strong,  comprehensive policing reform bill that would bring deep and lasting  change to police departments across America. House Democrats will pass  that bill, the Justice in Policing Act, as early as tomorrow.   However, here in the Senate, the Republican majority proposed the  legislative equivalent of a fig leaf, something that provides a little  cover but no real change. In less than an hour, Leader McConnell will  ask the Senate to proceed to the so-called policing reform bill.   We have all gone over the bill's deficiencies over and over. There  are no good answers. Some on the other side have said the bills are  similar. They are like night and day.  [[Page S3163]]    In response to the brutal killing of George Floyd--his wind pipe  crushed by a police officer--my Republican friends drafted a bill that  does not even fully ban the type of brutal tactics that led to his  death.   In response to the death of Breonna Taylor, killed by police  executing a no-knock warrant, my Republican friends have drafted a bill  that doesn't even ban that type of tactic--what weak tea. For Leader  McConnell to come on the floor with this bill and say he is solving the  problem--no one believes that, except maybe a few ideologues who really  don't want to solve the problem to begin with.   The bill doesn't ban choke holds. It doesn't back no-knock warrants.  It does nothing to stop profiling, the militarization of police or  reform, use of force standards, and qualified immunity--all of the  things that need to be done, almost none of which are in this bill.   The last piece is particularly surprising. So much of the anger in  the country right now is directed at the lack of accountability for  police officers who violate Americans' rights. As far as I can tell,  the Republican bill does not even attempt one significant reform--not  one--to bring more accountability to police officers who are guilty of  misconduct.   If you present a bill, as Republicans have here in the Senate, that  does nothing on accountability and say they are solving or dealing with  the problem in even close to an adequate way, they are sadly mistaken.  No one--no one--believes that.   I could spend more time in describing what the Republican bill  doesn't do than what it does do. The harsh fact of the matter is the  bill is so deeply, fundamentally, and irrevocably flawed, it cannot  serve as a useful starting point for real reform.   Don't ask me. Don't ask the Democrats here. Ask the leading civil  rights organizations, which have declared their strong opposition not  only to this bill but have urged us not to move forward because they  know this bill is a sham, a cul-de-sac, which will lead to no reform  whatsoever.   Yesterday, 138 civil rights groups sent an open letter to Senators  demanding that we vote no on moving to proceed today. I have the letter  here.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record the full letter   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                        The Leadership Conference on                                          Civil and Human Rights,                                                      June 23, 2020.          Vote NO on the Motion to Proceed--S. 3985 the JUSTICE Act         Dear Senators: On behalf of The Leadership Conference on       Civil and Human Rights (The Leadership Conference), a       coalition charged by its diverse membership of more than 220       national organizations to promote and protect civil and human       rights in the United States, and the undersigned 138       organizations, we write to express our strong opposition to       S. 3985, the Just and Unifying Solutions to Invigorate       Communities Everywhere (JUSTICE) Act. The JUSTICE Act is an       inadequate response to the decades of pain, hardship, and       devastation that Black people have and continue to endure as       a result of systemic racism and lax policies that fail to       hold police accountable for misconduct. This bill falls       woefully short of the comprehensive reform needed to address       the current policing crisis and achieve meaningful law       enforcement accountability. It is deeply problematic to meet       this moment with a menial incremental approach that offers       more funding to police, and few policies to effectively       address the constant loss of Black lives at the hands of       police. We therefore urge you to oppose the JUSTICE Act and       vote no on the motion to proceed when this legislation is       brought to the floor. The Leadership Conference will score       this vote in our voting record for the 116th Congress.        Abusive policing practices, coupled with devastating state-      sanctioned violence, have exacted systemic brutality and       fatality upon Black people since our nation's founding.       Police have shot and killed more than 1,000 people in the       United States over the past year, and Black people are       disproportionately more likely than white people to be killed       by police. The chronic structural issue of police killings       and lawlessness against Black people have escalated to a       boiling point in recent weeks following the deaths of       individuals like Breonna Taylor, Dreasjon ``Sean'' Reed,       George Floyd, Tony McDade, and others. The current protests       in our cities are a response not only to the unjust policing       of Black people, but also a call for action to public       officials to enact bold, comprehensive, and structural       change.        That is why, on June 1, 2020, The Leadership Conference       sent Congress a letter outlining accountability principles       that must be adopted as a baseline to address rampant,       systemic, white supremacy in law enforcement across America.       In less than 12 hours, more than 450 of this country's most       diverse civil rights, civil liberties, and racial justice       organizations signed onto that letter because what was asked       of Congress aligned with what advocates, policing experts,       and other stakeholders agree is needed. The priorities       highlighted are not only reasonable but reflect a bare       minimum of what must be included in any policing legislation       Congress adopts in order for systemic reform to occur.        These priorities are: (1) the creation of a use of force       standard that allows force only when necessary and as a last       resort; (2) a ban on chokeholds; (3) a ban on racial       profiling; (4) the establishment of a police misconduct       registry; (5) the inclusion of a ``reckless'' standard in 18       U.S.C. Section 242 that enables federal prosecutors to hold       law enforcement accountable for criminal civil rights       violations; (6) a prohibition on no-knock warrants,       especially in drug cases; (7) the elimination of the judge-      made doctrine of qualified immunity, which allows officers       and other government actors to evade accountability when they       violate individuals' rights; and (8) the demilitarization of       law enforcement agencies. This accountability framework is       reflected in S. 3912, the Justice in Policing Act of 2020.        Unfortunately, Senate majority leadership ignored these       critical policies and introduced the JUSTICE Act, a bill that       fails to align with our framework principles and will       therefore not bring about the fundamental shift in policing       our country needs. The bill does nothing to address current       barriers to holding law enforcement accountable, such as       abolishing qualified immunity or criminalizing the reckless       use of force. It does not address, let alone prohibit, the       perverse yet pervasive practice of racial profiling, nor does       it include explicit bans on dangerous practices like       chokeholds or no-knock warrants. It fails to address the       militarization of police or the need for a national standard       restricting the use of force, and lacks the national, robust,       and publicly available misconduct registry required for true       transparency.        Further, the JUSTICE Act provides more than $7 billion of       additional federal dollars for law enforcement over the next       five years, directly contradicting our coalition's call and       that of those marching in the streets to redefine public       safety by reducing the footprint of our criminal legal       system. Many of the crises that currently involve police       responses, and which too often lead to mistreatment and       increased mistrust, would be better handled through the       addition of health providers, social workers, and others who       can meet the needs of communities in a non-punitive manner.       Pouring additional funding into a broken system is bad       policy. Furthermore, considering the limited financial       resources prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, all policing       reform models must reprioritize how limited dollars are       spent. The programs authorized by the JUSTICE Act will       necessarily mean fewer funds to tackle other issues critical       to longlasting safety, such as housing, education, and health       care. Millions of people in the United States are calling for       these kinds of direct investments into communities, and       Congress should heed that call.        Now is the time for Congress to be bold and pass meaningful       police accountability reform legislation. A vast and diverse       collection of people from coast to coast are calling on       lawmakers to prioritize Black communities and protect them       from the systemic perils of over-policing, police brutality,       misconduct, and harassment. It is your moral and ethical duty       to ensure Black people and communities are free from the harm       and threats from law enforcement and militarized police       responses. It is also your responsibility to ensure that any       legislation passed does not just provide lip service to       these problems, but fully meets the critical needs of this       moment and beyond. Passing watered-down legislation that       fails to remedy the actual harms resulting in the loss of       life is a moral statement that is inconsistent with a       genuine belief that black lives matter. Anything less than       full support for comprehensive legislation that holds       police accountable is inexcusable. Further, any attempt to       amend or salvage the JUSTICE Act will only serve to       ``check the box'' and claim reform when, in actuality, no       reform has occurred to combat police misconduct and to       protect Black lives. For these reasons, we urge you to       oppose the JUSTICE Act and vote no on the motion to       proceed on this legislation.        Thank you for your leadership in advancing these important       policy recommendations.

Madam President, I want to ask the American people, I  want to ask Republican Senators: Who is a better guardian of the civil  rights of African Americans when it comes to police reform--the NAACP  or Mitch McConnell?   If this bill were such a good path to reform, why wouldn't civil  rights organizations from one end of America to another say: Go  forward; maybe we will get something done. Because they know the bill  is a ruse, and nothing will get done. That is the way it is designed.  Whom do you believe when it comes to civil rights and police  accountability--Mitch McConnell or the lawyer for the families of  George Floyd and Breonna Taylor? Whom do you believe--the lawyer of the  Floyd and Taylor families or Mitch McConnell, whom we have never heard  speak on this issue on the floor until the last few weeks? These groups  have been speaking about it for decades.   The idea--the idea--that this bill is a step forward when it will  lead to nowhere? It will not be. Mitch McConnell keeps saying you can  cut the bill off when you don't get your 60 votes. What kind of  solution is that, when it is a junky bill, when it is a bill that  doesn't go far enough at all? Why don't we put a good bill on the floor  that can pass?   Let me read what the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights  said. They have had a hand in crafting every piece of meaningful  legislation passed in Congress in the last few years.         The JUSTICE Act--    The Republican bill--       is an inadequate response to the decades of pain, hardship,       and devastation that Black people have and continue to endure       as a result of systemic racism and lax policies that fail to       hold police accountable for misconduct. This bill falls       woefully short of the comprehensive reform needed to address       the current policing crisis and achieve meaningful law       enforcement accountability.    Listen to this sentence, from 136 civil rights organizations about  this bill that Leader McConnell has put on the floor:         It is deeply problematic to meet this moment with a menial       incremental approach that offers more funding to police, and       few policies to effectively address the constant loss of       Black lives at the hands of police.    Leader McConnell, here is what the civil rights organizations say  about your bill. They rip off any cloaking about what this bill really  does and what it is. I want to read it again--specifically to our  Republican leader, who thinks this is a good bill and a great attempt  to go forward:         It is deeply problematic to meet this moment with a menial       incremental approach that offers more funding to police, and       few policies to effectively address the constant loss of       Black lives at the hands of police.    Whom do you believe, America--the Leadership Conference on Civil  Rights or Mitch McConnell? Whom do you believe, America--the NAACP or  the Republican caucus? Whom do you believe, America--the lawyer for the  Taylor and Floyd families or Donald Trump, who has these Members  quaking in their boots if they do something that he doesn't like?   That is one of the other reasons we are in such a pickle here. They  are so afraid of Donald Trump, who is willing to say overtly racist  statements, like ``Kung Flu'' several times yesterday, that they can't  even bring themselves to put a bill on the floor that has a modicum of  respect from the civil rights community? When you call it ``menial,''  you are not respecting a bill.   The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, founded by the great  Justice Thurgood Marshall--here is what it said. They have been  fighting for these things for 80 on years, not 8 days. ``It cannot  support legislation that does not embody a strong accountability  framework for police officers and [other] law enforcement who engage in  misconduct.''   Here is what Benjamin Crump, the lawyer, said: The Republican  legislation is ``in direct contrast to the demands of the people'' who  have been protesting; and ``the Black Community is tired of lip  service, and shocked that the [Republican proposal] can [even] be  thought of as legislation.'' That is the lawyer for the Taylor and  Floyd families. Leader McConnell has invoked their names--that is the  right thing to do--but then deviates totally from what their lawyer  says needs to be done to deal with these kinds of deaths. Again,  Benjamin Crump, the lawyer for the Floyd and Taylor families: ``The  Black community is tired of the lip service, and shocked that the  [Republican proposal] can [even] be thought of as legislation.''   Don't get on your sanctimonious horse, Leader McConnell. You have  none of the civil rights community behind you.   The most preeminent civil rights groups in our Nation's history are  speaking. The lawyer representing the families of Americans who have  lost their loved ones at the hands of those who are sworn to protect  and serve are speaking. They have one simple, urgent goal, and it has  nothing to do with politics.   Leader McConnell accuses what we are doing as being filled with  politics. Does Leader McConnell accuse all 138 civil rights  organizations of wanting to do this for politics? No, no, no. I think  the shoe is on the other foot. I think the politics here is that Leader  McConnell wants to show that he is doing something and get nothing  done.   He may be afraid of President Trump. He may be afraid of some police  organizations. I don't know what it is.   Here is what they say in their letter: ``We therefore urge you''--the  Senators--``to oppose the JUSTICE Act and vote no on the motion to  proceed.''   I dare the leader to come out here and say they are playing  politics--  [[Page S3165]]  come right out and say it--because it is false, and we, the Democrats,  are aligned with what they believe   This morning, we heard more predictable histrionics from the  Republican leader--the accusation of mindless obstruction and  outrageous hypocrisy. Leader McConnell should spare us the lectures  about how laws get made. He knows how. It is through bipartisanship.  The leader talks about bipartisanship and introduces a totally partisan  bill and introduces a process where Democrats have had no input. That  is partisanship.   Do you want to be bipartisan, Leader McConnell? Sit down, assemble a  group--some from your side, maybe Senator Scott, who is greatly  respected; some from our side, maybe Senators Booker and Harris, who  are greatly respected; and a few others. Let them sit down and come up  with a proposal. It does not have to be behind closed doors.   The leader is worried about closed doors? There is something called  the Judiciary Committee. It doesn't meet in secret. Why wasn't this  bill referred there, where there would be at least something of a  bipartisan process? Who is he kidding? Who is he kidding?   You don't want closed doors, Leader McConnell? Send it to the  Judiciary Committee. Something as important as this should have gone  through that to begin with.   Let me repeat: Republicans came here, dropped the bill on the floor,  and said: Take it or leave it. Even if we were to get on the bill,  there is no conceivable way to rectify all of its many problems. It is  not realistic that we can fix this bill even with a series of  amendments because they will require 60 votes, and we will not get 60  on any of them. If they believed in these ideas, as Senator Harris  said, they would have put them in the bill to begin with. They didn't.   The Republican majority has given the Senate a bad bill and no  credible way to sufficiently improve it. Senator McConnell--cleverly,  maybe cynically--designed a legislative cul-de-sac from which no bill-- no bill at all--could emerge. And whether the bill lacks 60 votes now  or 60 votes in a few days, we know the Republican leader will accuse  Democrats of filibustering and claiming we are the opponents of  progress, as he did this morning.   Please, does anyone believe that Democrats are the obstacles to  reforming our police departments? Does anyone believe that? We  announced a much bolder, stronger, better, more effective bill 3 weeks  ago. And, unlike the Republican legislation, the Justice in Policing  Act will actually pass a Chamber of Congress. When it passes the House,  the Nation is going to say to Leader McConnell: Get something moving in  the Senate. And Leader McConnell knows, and everyone in this body  knows, that you have to do that in a bipartisan way. That is how the  Senate has always worked and still does.   Senate Republicans and their President, who proclaims we should  cherish the memory of Confederate traitors who fought to preserve  slavery, who gleefully called the coronavirus ``Kung Flu,'' with hardly  a word of criticism from his party, expects you to believe that  Republicans are, all of a sudden, the true champions of racial justice  and police reform? That is what Senate Republicans want America to  believe, and America ain't buying it.   The same Republican majority that has demonstrated a complete lack of  urgency to address the public health and economic crises that are  devastating Black America, the same Republican majority that has  refused time and again to call out President Trump's bigotry and  intolerance, the same Republican majority that has run a conveyor belt  of anti-civil rights votes for judicial nominees, including one today-- today, the very same day we vote on policing reform--wants you to  believe that all of a sudden they want to get something done. As they  say in Brooklyn, forget about it.   When you hear President Trump and Senator McConnell trying to cast  blame for lack of progress on police reform, I have three words for  you: Consider the source. Look at their history. Look at what they have  done. Look at just today. Leader McConnell proudly brags that he is  putting someone on the Fifth Circuit who has opposed voting rights for  his whole career. That is who wants to move things forward? I doubt it.   Here is the truth. Senator McConnell has been around a long time and  knows how to produce a workable outcome in the Senate if he really  wants to. We have done it before on criminal justice reform, on annual  budgets, on the national defense bill, and on the lands package we just  passed.   Even on difficult issues like immigration, the Senate can function if  the leadership allows it to. In 2013, a bipartisan group of Senators  produced compromise immigration legislation that garnered two-thirds of  this Chamber on immigration, no less. What do bills that pass have in  common? Bipartisanship, sponsorship, and support. What does this bill  have? Only partisan support. Not a single Democrat supports this bill,  their bill.   While I certainly feel obligated to point out the contradictions and  hypocrisy in the Republican leader's statements and history, I am not  dismayed by the likely failure of the Republican bill today. All is not  lost. There is a better path and one we should take once this bill  fails to go forward.   After this bill goes down, there should be bipartisan discussions  with the object of coming together around a constructive starting point  for police reform. Leader McConnell can pick a few of his Members as  negotiators. I could designate a few from our caucus. They can sit  down, talk to one another, and find a bill that we are ready to start  debating. We could send that bill to the committee and have an open  process, as it would be refined. This is an important issue.   That, Leader McConnell, is what successful legislating will be. I  have no doubt that we could come up with a bill that is ready for the  floor in a few weeks. We know how to do this. But in the rush to get  this issue off their backs, to check some political box and move on, my  Republican colleagues have forgotten or are simply ignoring everything  they know about how the Senate works.   My hope, my prayer is that after this bill fails today, after Leader  McConnell's path reaches its preordained dead end, we can start down  the path of bipartisanship--real bipartisanship--not a bill designed to  be put on the floor by one party.   If Americans of all ages and colors and of all faiths can join  together in a righteous chorus calling for change, as they have in big  cities and small towns across America, then we in the Senate can at  least try to come together to deliver it--Democrats and Republicans  working together to solve an age-old problem that is a deep wound in  America.   These past few weeks have magnified a very old wound in our country.  The binding up of that wound is a project that demands more from all of  us: Black Americans, White Americans, police departments, and the  protesters in the streets--Democrats and Republicans.   So, please, let us not once again retreat to our partisan corners  after today's vote. Let us appeal, instead, to the better angels of our  nature, reach out to one another, Democrats and Republicans, and try to  forge a path forward together.   I yield the floor.
