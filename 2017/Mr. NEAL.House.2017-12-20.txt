 Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished leader of the Democratic  Party.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished leader of the Democratic  Party.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished leader of the Democratic  Party.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.   Mr. Speaker, the President just said in the last few minutes that the  most important part of this legislation is the corporate tax cuts.   Stop the nonsense that you are doing this for the middle class.   In the 20 hours that have elapsed, Mr. Speaker, since we last had  this debate, we were promised a number of things. The only thing they  left out was that this tax bill was going to stem the tides, take us to  Mars tomorrow, and the Cleveland Browns were going to win the Super  Bowl.   The certainty of what they are telling us--if the stockmarket goes  up, then they did it. The stockmarket has been going up since March of  2009. They talk about economic growth. Economic growth has now  proceeded for 88 straight months. They keep telling us the rocket is  about to launch because of this tax bill.   Do you know what is great about this, Mr. Speaker?   Reporters outside are starting to ask: Are you going to help them out  if all of these things don't occur in the way they have said they are  going to occur?   I said: After the appropriate period of review.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who is the Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Levin), who is the longest-serving member of the Ways and  Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Lewis), who is an extraordinary man. Our friend is the  ranking member of the Oversight Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Doggett), who is a valued member of the Ways and Means Committee  and the ranking member of the Tax Policy Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson), who is a Vietnam veteran and a distinguished  member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Crowley), who is the chairman of the Democratic Caucus and a  valued member of the Ways and Means Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), who is a champion of any and all things  Chicago.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, think of Robin Hood in  reverse: take from the poor and give to the rich.   When you take away social safety net programs and when you take away  Medicare and Medicaid, then it reminds me of Marie Antoinette. When the  people had no bread, she said: Let them eat cake.   I was opposed to this before it was released, I was opposed  yesterday, I will be opposed tomorrow, and I will be opposed next week.  It is no good for the American people.    Mr. Speaker, might I inquire as to how much time is  remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 3\1/2\  minutes remaining. The gentleman from Texas has 1 minute remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close on this side, and I  yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, so in 1 month we have taken the entire revenue system of  the United States without hearing from one expert witness, without  having had one public hearing, without using any precedent, and we  changed the entire tax system of the country, tilting it clearly to the  people at the very top.                                time  1230    When they say, as they certainly will, ``We have been doing hearings  for 5 years,'' we never had one hearing on this legislation. Not one.  We did not seek testimony from one witness in the conference committee.  We got to offer opening statements and no amendments. There was no  chance for any input on our side.   More than anything else, this is a missed opportunity. This was a  missed chance to take a system that we all know to have fallen into  competitive failure across the globe. But instead, they decided to go  it alone.   So here is the way you want to think of this, for those of you who  are following this debate:   They are borrowing $2.3 trillion for the purpose of cutting the top  tax bracket from 39.6 percent to 37 percent and calling that middle  class tax relief;   They are doubling the exemption on the estate tax to $22 million and  calling that middle class tax relief;   They are eliminating the alternative minimum tax for people at the  very top and calling it middle class tax relief.   By the 10th year of this tax proposal, 83 percent of the benefit  accrues to the people at the very top of our economic system. That is  not in dispute.   They say things like: Well, in 5 years, we are going to correct this  measure. Then they talked about the idea that somehow this was about  simplicity. When you get into the phase-ins and the phaseouts, you are  all going to pass out from trying to read this tax proposal.   The complexity they add to the system is unparalleled, all to secure  a tax cut for people at the top.   So here we are in the holiday season, and they are telling us, by the  way, that if we just borrow this money, everything is going to be fine.   What did they say about borrowing when Bill Clinton was President?  What  [[Page H10312]]  did they say about borrowing when Barack Obama was President?   They lectured us, day in and day out, in an unyielding manner, even  though the economic performance of Clinton and Obama outweighed the two  Republican Presidents in between.   So here is the game plan for the holiday season. Do you know what the  holiday hangover on your credit card is? People go out and use their  credit cards, and they figure out all year how to try to pay for it.   It is going to take you more than 10 years to try to pay for this,  all upon the spurious notion that they guarantee economic growth, as  the President said, by the way, that is going to exceed 6 percent. That  is 6 percent.   They are telling us that the stock market has gone up because of  them, even though it has gone up since March of 2009. They are telling  us now that this is going to spur unparalleled economic growth, even  though the economy has been growing for 88 straight months, all on the  credit card for the American people.   Mr. Speaker, this is the worst piece of legislation that has come  from the House in the 29 years that I have served here, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore.
