 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   The United States and our allies are safer with Qasem Soleimani gone.  President Trump's decisive leadership was justified, and it was right.   Soleimani had the blood of over 600 American servicemembers on his  hands. For more than 20 years, he attacked our troops, established a  brutal reign of terror across the Middle East, and was directly  responsible for the death of thousands of innocent civilians, including  in his own country. And he had more terror planned.   As President Trump said, this strike was done to prevent a war, not  start one. In yesterday's address, he was true to his word. He was  confident and restrained. Even as he underscored our strength and  resolve, he extended the people of Iran our hand in peace and  friendship. President Trump's decision to embrace the Reagan doctrine  of peace through strength in dealing with Iran has worked.   Those who criticize President Trump for Iran's dangerous foreign  policy should actually spend a few moments to review their history. It  is Iran that is responsible for escalating tensions by creating chaos  to spread fear and accumulate power.   In the decades since 1979's revolution, Iran has become the number  one state sponsor of terrorism in the world. More recently, it shot  down an American military drone and seized a British oil tanker.   On December 27, Iranian proxies crossed the line by killing an  American. For the first time since 1988, we have an administration  willing to strike back. From most of the media reports, many may know  him only as an unnamed U.S. contractor killed in Iraq, but he was more  than that. His name was Nawres Hamid. He was a husband. He was the  father of two young sons. He was a resident of California.   Before Nawres became a citizen, he was valiantly serving alongside  our troops as a linguist. All of our hearts break for his wife and  children, who are left mourning his death.   There are some in this Chamber who seem to be downplaying his death,  but his death matters. It matters to his family. It matters to his  countrymen. It matters to the President. It matters to me. His death  was unnecessary, unprovoked, and it deserved justice.   That is why my next statement carries even more meaning. Red lines  should mean something. In this administration, they do. Killing Nawres  was a red line. Planning to kill Americans is a red line.   I am confident that the right decision was to take out the man  responsible for Nawres' death and the death of hundreds of other  Americans.   Iran responded earlier this week by sending missiles to U.S. bases in  Iraq. I believe we are all relieved and grateful that there were no  American casualties. Iran appears to be pulling back from its strategy  of provocation in the face of firm American determination. Iran seems  to understand that deescalation is right for them and the world.   Now is the time for our country to come together and speak with one  voice, not as Republicans, not as Democrats, but as Americans.                                time  1500    Instead of working with this administration to continue to work  toward shared goals, Democrats are using this moment to continue their  hatred toward the President.   As my colleague and former CIA officer Will Hurd said, he never  thought he would see the day that the Iranian Government would be able  to manipulate Members of Congress, Democratic Presidential candidates,  and the Western media, yet here we are on this floor today.   If President Trump's instinct is to put America first, his critics'  instinct is to blame America first.   The words of my Democratic colleagues, including the Speaker of the  House, blame the United States for attacks Iran has been initiating for  the past four decades. Now, they want to limit the President's ability  to defend America. That is just dangerous.   I want to clear up some news, Madam Speaker, that I actually even  recently heard on this floor. I would probably consider it fake news  that Democrats have told the American people.   Contrary to their claim, the resolution before the House today is  nonbinding. It is called a concurrent resolution. This resolution, if  passed, won't go to the President's desk for signature. It won't have  the power of law.   Madam Speaker, I heard the chairman try to claim that this had power.  I know we have three coequal branches of government.   Madam Speaker, I think the chairman should actually look at what the  Supreme Court ruled in the Chadha case, that concurrent resolutions are  unconstitutional as a means to limit the executive branch. I think I  may need to read it twice, so let's do that.   In fact, the Supreme Court ruled in the Chadha case that concurrent  resolutions are unconstitutional as a means to limit the executive  branch. The purpose of a concurrent resolution is to deal with mundane  housekeeping matters in Congress.   Now, I want everybody to know and understand what we have used  concurrent resolutions for--it is very important: to authorize the use  of the Capitol Grounds for the Soap Box Derby, to use the rotunda to  present a congressional medal to Jack Nicklaus, and to host a birthday  party in the Capitol Visitor Center. But the new majority decided to  use it for something different.   For a party that wants to claim they care about the Constitution,  Madam Speaker, Democrats may want to brush up on their facts. If they  did, they would realize their actions today are shameful and  embarrassing, even by the low standards they set in their impeachment  inquiry.   They seem to have forgotten that we are not the House of Resolutions.  We are, actually, the U.S. House of Representatives. Our job isn't to  debate feelings. Our job isn't to make recommendations. We are,  actually, elected to make law.   But that is not how we are spending our time today. This resolution  has as much force of law as a new year's resolution. It is nothing more  than a press release to appease their socialist base.   What message is it sending to Iran? That we are strong, determined,  and united as a country, or that we are divided, shortsighted, and  weak?   Madam Speaker, ``In war, resolution,'' and, ``in peace, goodwill.''  Winston Churchill wrote those words after he led Britain to victory in  the Second World War. They describe what he believed were the right  actions for great leaders to take at history's defining moment.   We should keep Churchill's words in mind today. President Trump  clearly has. Because of President Trump's leadership, the United States  and our allies are safer today than we were exactly 1 week ago.   Petty politics are wrong for the country, especially now. Not liking  President Trump is not an excuse for failing to see that the President  and his administration have a sensible and deeply American strategy for  dealing with Iran.   Madam Speaker, I imagine we will continue to hear from other  Democrats defending Iran for their escalation and the death of an  American. Madam Speaker, I imagine that the Democrats will try to claim  a concurrent resolution is more than a Soap Box Derby, but the Supreme  Court says otherwise.  [[Page H96]]    Madam Speaker, I imagine I will hear a lot from the Democrats today.  I would like to hear a Democrat speak to the 600 Gold Star families  whose loved ones were killed by Soleimani. I would like to hear them  defend that.   I would like to hear them defend Iran and their actions of burning an  embassy, of killing an American, of killing thousands of civilians even  in their own country. But they are going to take our time today with  something that means nothing.   Yes, they will run to the mikes. They will get on TV. They will tell  a little more fake news, that it meant something today.   The only thing that will happen today is it will make Iran believe  they are stronger. It will make Iran believe they have allies in the  House of Representatives.   Today is a day that we will not be proud of.   Madam Speaker, in light of the information that we have coming out of  Iran, if it is true, of why an airliner was shot down, if that was the  case, I would like to see a Democrat move to the floor and pull this  concurrent resolution. If it means nothing else, I think we should have  all the facts.   I look forward to listening, Madam Speaker, to any Democrat who wants  to speak to the Gold Star families about why they want to have a debate  today and tell them that ``Soleimani is bad, but.'' It is not ``but'';  it is ``because,'' because he killed Americans, because he killed  thousands of civilians. That is why he was taken out, and the world is  safer because of it.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to hearing the defense from the other  side.
