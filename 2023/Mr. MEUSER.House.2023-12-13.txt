 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Foxx very much for her  leadership on this very important issue.   Mr. Chair, kids love milk, but our schools have been prohibited from  providing children whole milk since 2010 and, frankly, it was based  upon false science.   Milk is a healthy choice for our children. It has 13 essential  nutrients that kids need--calcium, protein, iron, vitamin D, potassium,  and more. Compared to soda or iced tea, which kids will turn to without  a healthy alternative, a carton of milk has only one-third of the sugar  as a can of Coca-Cola.   We, as adults and Representatives, need to give our children and  grandchildren the options to make healthy choices. We need this  legislation to put whole milk back in our schools.   Mr. Chair, would you be surprised to know that whole milk is 96.75  percent fat free? To say whole milk is unhealthy for kids is, if you  will, ``udderly'' ridiculous.   Let's do the right thing by our children, families, and dairy farmers  by passing the Whole Milk for Healthy Kids Act. It is time to ask  American schoolchildren if they, once again, ``Got Milk?''
