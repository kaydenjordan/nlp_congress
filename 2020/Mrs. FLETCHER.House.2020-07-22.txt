 Mr. Speaker, John Robert Lewis was one of the most  courageous and committed citizens that our country has ever known. With  unparalleled courage, with deep faith, and with profound hope, he  personified a belief in this country and a belief in his fellow  citizens all the days of his life.   Through his life, he gave all of us a gift: a chance to see the world  as it should be and a way to make it so.   At this pivotal time in our country's history, his faith in America  and in Americans must guide us now. We have the opportunity and the  responsibility as Members of Congress and as citizens to honor him by  believing, as he did, in an America as good as its promise and by  working to make it so.   We have many miles to go to build the beloved community, but he  showed us the way. How lucky we are, and how we miss him so.
