 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Hope That Binds, a  ministry based out of Cunningham, Kentucky, that supports west Kentucky  families by providing critical adoption resources.   Hope That Binds is an outstanding regional leader when it comes to  helping families pursuing adoption through financial assistance and  counseling.   I am proud of my constituents, Wendy Davis-Wilson, Jeff and Benita  Davis, Brooke Kelly, and Gracie Reynolds, for their significant  contributions to this great organization.   Adoption provides a home for needy children as well as an opportunity  to raise a child for hopeful parents. Belonging to a family is a  natural and vital component of life, and every child deserves a loving  and nurturing home.   Hope That Binds' commitment to the gift and treasure of adoption is  heartwarming and a great example of giving back to the less vulnerable.   February 7 to 11 is a week of celebration and awareness for this  wonderful nonprofit, and I am proud to recognize them for their  incredible work. On behalf of my constituents, I congratulate Hope That  Binds for supporting some of the most vulnerable members of our  society.                            ____________________
