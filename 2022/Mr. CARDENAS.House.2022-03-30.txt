 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of labor and civil rights leader, Cesar E. Chavez.   Born in Yuma, Arizona, Cesar worked with his family in the fields of  America's southwest.   After serving in the United States Navy, Cesar began organizing for  the human dignity and respect of all farmworkers, farmworkers like my  father and grandfather, who did backbreaking working in the fields of  California.   Cesar's powerful message of hope and opportunity motivated a  generation to stand up and demand the respect and dignity their work  deserves.   He taught us the importance of nonviolent activism to fight for fair  wages and fair treatment that helped put the American Dream within  reach for hardworking immigrant families, but his legacy extends beyond  agriculture.   He spent his life making sure our Nation lived up to its core values  of freedom, justice, and equality for all. His timeless vision of hope  for a better world continues to inspire us every single day.   Today, on what would have been his 95th birthday, let us reflect on  Cesar's life's work and carry forward the legacy he set forth. ``Si, se  puede.'' ``Yes, we can.''                            ____________________
