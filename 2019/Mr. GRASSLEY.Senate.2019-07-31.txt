 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in  morning business for 1 minute.    Madam President, there is too much secrecy in drug  pricing, particularly in who benefits from rebates. Not all rebates are  created equal in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.   Rebate obligations for brand-name drugs are currently based on both  brand-name and authorized generic drug sales. That means brand-name  drug manufacturers pay less in rebate obligations.   The bipartisan legislation I introduced with Senator Wyden fixes  this. It ensures that brand-name drug manufacturers pay--like common  sense ought to dictate--brand-name rebates. This reduces gaming in the  system to make sure authorized generics come to market for a purpose  related to patient access, not just to lower brand-name rebate  obligations.   Transparency brings accountability, and with transparency and  accountability, the market works better, competition works better, and  in the end, gets the price of drugs down.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
