 Mr. President, today I joined President Trump in  Florida to discuss the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act with local  businesses. Due to these important discussions, I will miss today's  vote.   (At the request of Mr. DURBIN, the following statement was ordered to  be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
