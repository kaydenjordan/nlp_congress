 Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Democrats' mandates  that forced our young Senate pages to be vaccinated three times. In a  free society, no one should be forced to take an injection; no one  should be forced to have a surgery; no one should be forced to submit  to a medical procedure--particularly a medical procedure that was  approved under emergency-use authorization.   Democrats' support for medical choice when it comes to vaccines  appears to be inconsistent and selective. But I fear they won't be  persuaded by any arguments towards liberty, so I would like to direct  the majority of my remarks to the actual science about whether or not  adolescents should have to be forced to have three COVID vaccines.   Initially, there were arguments made saying: We must forcibly  vaccinate these kids or they will infect the older folks, the  antiquarian Senators. But it turns out that argument fails because the  science in the end showed that the vaccine didn't prevent transmission  of the disease.  [[Page S4370]]    In fact, in August 2021, CDC Director Rachel Walensky admitted for  COVID-19 that the vaccine does not stop transmission:         Our vaccines are working exceptionally well . . . But what       they can't do anymore is prevent transmission.    So the government, the proponents, those for the mandates argue:  Well, we have to do it; it will stop the disease and we won't have any  more spread.   Well, it turns out that wasn't true. The vaccine does not stop  transmission. With that, it should have been the end of the arguments  for mandates, because you are no longer talking about your health  versus someone else's health. The only argument that those who are for  the mandates argue now and those who argue for taking the vaccine is  that it reduces your health risk--the individual who chooses to get  vaccinated. However, when you look at the data, that appears only to be  true for targeted populations.   If you are at risk for being hospitalized or dying from COVID, over  age 75, immunocompromised, have other health concerns, there is some  argument for a vaccine. But for a young, healthy person, there is no  logical argument. If you look and ask yourself will taking a booster  reduce transmission, the argument is no. Whether you are at risk or  not, it does not reduce transmission.   If you are at risk for hospitalization or death, it may well reduce  that. But the young pages we are talking about are not at risk for  that. In fact, when we look at it, throughout Europe, there was a study  of 23 million folks--young folks--and they found the death rate was  zero. Israel looked at this: Death rate zero for young, healthy people.  Germany looked at this, ages 5 to 17: Death rate for young, healthy  people, zero.   And people say, well, what is the big deal? The vaccine is not that  big a deal. You know, certainly, it is not going to hurt them. It has  to be better than having COVID. Well, it turns out when you weigh the  risks versus the benefits for a particular age group, it is actually  not true. If you look at the risks of side effects from the vaccine-- and the main worrisome side effect that we are concerned with is an  inflammation of the heart called myocarditis or pericarditis--a study  by Prasad and Knudsen looked at 29 different studies and found that the  incidents, averaged out, was a little over 2 per 15,000.   The Vaccine Safety Datalink looked at this again and found also it  was about 2, 2.5 out of 15,000. Even the CDC admits that the risk of  myocarditis for young people is about 1 in 15,000. Tracey Beth Hoeg  looked at a retrospective study of those who have been injured by  vaccines and found the incidence of adverse cardiac events was about  1.62 per 10,000. So it's not like every kid is going to get  myocarditis, but you have to weigh the incidence of 1 or 2 or 3 out of  15,000 getting a serious disease that could affect their health or even  debilitate them.   The risks and benefits are different for every individual. That is  why in a free society, the individual or the individual and their  parents make this decision with their doctor; sometimes they get more  than one opinion. But we don't mandate--in a free society, we don't  just tell them: Do what you are told or else. But that is what is  happening.   It is not just happening here in the Senate--although, the Senate is  setting a terrible example for the country. Many universities are still  doing this. It is actually medical malpractice to require these  vaccines for kids. It turns out when you look at the incidence of  myocarditis, over 90 percent of the heart inflammation that occurs in  young people occurs after the second dose.   You can get rid of 90 percent of--admittedly, not a real common  problem--but you can get rid of 90 percent of the risk of this vaccine  by not requiring more than one. But we are not talking about just the  second dose, where 90 percent of the inflammation comes from the second  dose. We are talking about Senate Democrats--because Republicans would  like to get rid of this--Senate Democrats are requiring three vaccines.  There is absolutely no scientific evidence. In fact, when this went to  the committee studying this, the first committee that looked at this  was the FDA Vaccine and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee,  and Dr. Paul Offit sits on this committee.   They voted not to advise giving the booster to anyone unless they are  over 65. They said: Let's look at the risks and the benefits. The  disease COVID appears to be affecting the older generation. They are  more at risk. We can put up with some risk for the vaccine; but for the  kids, it is not worth it. The committee voted.   So then it went from the FDA's committee to the CDC's vaccine  committee. Guess what? They voted against recommending the booster  also. They said, reserve the booster for those who are at risk, for at- risk populations.   So how did we get a booster mandate? How did we get a booster advice  from the CDC saying everybody from the age of 2 months should get a  booster? How did we get it? The CDC political appointee of the Biden  administration overrode the FDA vaccine committee and overrode the CDC  committee.   Dr. Paul Offit was and still is on the Vaccine Related Biological  Products Advisory Committee, and he voted to reserve the booster for  those at risk. He is the director of Vaccine Education Center and  professor of pediatrics in the Division of Infectious Diseases at  Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.   He is not someone who is opposed to vaccines. He spent his whole life  advocating for vaccines. He is on a committee that has approved the  COVID vaccine. He just simply said the vaccines should be targeted, and  it should be extended and advised--not even mandated but advised--for  people over 65 but not for kids. His committee voted no. The FDA  committee on vaccines voted no; don't give the vaccine to kids.    The CDC committee on vaccines voted no; don't give it to kids.   What do Senate Democrats want? Put their heads in the sand and make a  political decision because they love central authority to mandate that  these kids get three vaccines, even though the science goes against all  of it.   Paul Offit, when asked whether or not his son who was 24 would get  the vaccine, he said:         He shouldn't get the vaccine.    So we are stuck with a situation where there is no evidence and no  historical precedent for mandating this kind of treatment. There is no  historical precedent for mandating that the Senate and Senate Democrats  intervene between the doctor of these children and making their own  medical decisions. It is taking away the idea that risk and benefit are  debated and discussed based on your risks and benefits. So what we find  is that advice that actually probably is good, if you are over 65, to  consider getting a booster--although it still should be voluntary--we  are going against the best advice to actually promote that these kids  get a vaccine that may well be harmful to them.   The CDC has admitted it doesn't stop transmission. But then you want  to ask yourself, what are other countries--what are they doing around  the world? They looked at 23 million people, ages 12 and up, in  Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. What did they find? They found  that after two doses of the mRNA COVID vaccine, the risk of myocarditis  was higher than compared with those who were not vaccinated. This is  exactly why much of Europe is now limiting the vaccine and not giving  the vaccine to certain age groups.   What they found in these studies is that adolescent males,  particularly between the ages of 12 and 26, are at a heightened risk  for this. In fact, Tracy Beth Hoeg, in her study, looked at the  possibility of adverse cardiac events versus a possibility that someone  their age could go to the hospital over a 120-day period. They found  that the possibility of an adverse cardiac effect was about five times  greater than any of these kids even going to the hospital.   But what we did find is--and this is why several countries have  actually limited this--Germany, France, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and  Norway now restrict the mRNA vaccine and don't advise giving the  vaccine to this age group, particularly don't advise giving them three  vaccines.   A study in December in the Journal of Medical Ethics found about 14.7  [[Page S4371]]  cases of myocarditis--actually, 1.47 cases per 10,000 in ages 18 to 29.  They also found that those who had the heart inflammation, 3 months  later were still suffering from the inflammation of the heart.   Dr. Offit, who sits on the committee that voted against recommending  this for adolescents and for children, wrote in an op-ed that  ``[a]healthy young person with two mRNA vaccine doses is extremely  unlikely to be hospitalized with covid, so the case for risking any  side effects--such as myocarditis--diminishes substantially.'' That is  why they did recommend against the third vaccine, which is exactly the  opposite of what the Democrats are doing. They do and want to mandate  three vaccines on these kids.   As one editorial put it last year, if being boosted becomes a  prerequisite for participation in normal life, the vaccine's  diminishing efficacy means the boosting campaign will never end.   Dr. Marty Makary, professor of Johns Hopkins School of Medicine,  wrote in the Wall Street Journal:         The U.S. government is pushing Covid-19 vaccine boosters       for 16- and 17-year-olds without supporting clinical data. A       large Israeli population study, published in the New England       Journal of Medicine . . . found that the risk of Covid death       in people under 30 with two vaccine shots was zero.    Germany showed zero deaths among healthy kids ages 5 to 17.   There is no scientific rationale for mandating three COVID vaccines  for healthy kids. Even World Health Organization Chief Scientist Dr.  Soumya Swaminathan said last year that ``there's no evidence'' that  suggests healthy children and adolescents need booster shots--no  evidence. This is the head of the WHO. These are not opponents of  vaccines. These are people saying that there is no evidence and that it  might harm these kids to get vaccinated, and yet Democrats will vote  today, the lot of them, to say that basically we must force these kids  to get three vaccines or they can't be up here.   Now, you might say: Well, gosh, we are just so worried and we don't  know everything and so what do we do?   Well, how about all the other people who work up here? At any point  in time, the other 10 or 15 people in this room, are they required to  get vaccines? No. We are only requiring one group subset to do it.  These kids have to get three vaccines. They are the least likely to get  sick from COVID. They get COVID, and they don't even know it. The  vaccine doesn't stop them from getting COVID. They have naturally  acquired immunity as well. If you don't ask yourself what that means,  you are not paying attention to any science.   Wouldn't you want to know whether they have had it? Even if you  really thought a vaccine mandate was great, what if I have already had  COVID? Do I need three more vaccines? Because I have already had COVID,  I developed natural immunity.   Dr. Martin Kulldorff of Harvard Medical School says that mandating  people who have already had COVID that they still get vaccinated makes  zero sense from a scientific point of view, and it makes zero sense  from a public health point of view. A study in Lancet supported this  view, stating that current evidence does not appear to show a need for  boosting in the general population.   That is why the FDA committee and the CDC committee both voted  against advising it. It is not only bad advice; it is a horrific  mandate. It would be one thing if you want to give advice to tell  people that we think it is a good idea, but it is another to tell them  they have got no choice. Do you want to participate in the elite  program here in the Nation's Senate? You can't come unless you do what  Democrats want, submit to three vaccines, even though it may increase  your risk of heart inflammation. They don't care. Mandates are fine.   A study at Lancet looked at this and said that it was a bad idea. It  says: Currently available evidence does not show the need for  widespread use of booster vaccination in populations that have received  an effective primary vaccine or who have already been infected with the  disease.   When we consider the rules for the pages, we ought to ask: Will these  policies be expected to continue indefinitely? The virus mutates about  every 3 or 4 months. You have got a brandnew virus. You have got a  virus now you didn't have 3 or 4 months ago. The vaccines also lose  their potency. Are you going to mandate until the end of time? It is  also not the same.    Are you going to stick your head in the sand and say this is 2020?  No, the virus in 2020 actually was more lethal.   One of the good things about viral evolution is they typically evolve  to become less dangerous and more transmissible. You can catch COVID by  looking at somebody wrong, but fortunately it is not as deadly as it  once was.   Are there still some people dying from COVID? Yes, people who are at  high risk. If you go to a doctor and you have chest pain and you are 12  years old, he doesn't or she doesn't treat you the same way as if you  would go in and you are 60 years old.   If you walk into an emergency room and you are 15 years old with  chest pain, they usually might think of asthma or other problems but  typically not a heart attack. People are treated differently based on  their age. Doctors think of what is common in that age group.   If I go in with chest pain, they are going to do heart enzymes. They  are going look for a heart attack. That is the first thing they are  going to look for. But they don't treat everyone the same.   This is blindly what we are being told by the Democrats; that  everybody is the same, submit or else. But it is not just the pages  whom they are hurting here. It is not just the pages that they are  increasing their risk for this heart inflammation. They are setting an  example and other universities are doing it. Still, tens of thousands  of young American kids are being forced to take three vaccines.   You say: Well, they are not being forced. They can choose not to go  to Yale or Harvard. What if your dream had always been to go to one of  these schools? You have to give up your medical freedom and your good  judgment just simply so you can do exactly what Democrats tell you to  do?   Multiple scientific studies have shown a heightened risk of this  heart inflammation or myocarditis for children and teenagers after  taking the vaccine. Ninety percent of the myocarditis comes after the  second or the third vaccine. If you simply went to one vaccine, you  would get rid of 90 percent of the problem. And yet, they are still  insisting that we do something that is actually medical malpractice,  that these kids be forced to take three.   Multiple countries have begun restricting the vaccine for certain age  groups. Germany, France, Denmark, Finland, and Sweden all have  restricted Moderna's vaccine for young people. Norway, South America,  and the UK all chose to recommend only one dose of Pfizer due to the  risk of cardiovascular side effects for boosters in children. And yet  what we would get today is not a discussion, not we are open to  compromise, no maybe the science has changed and we will reevaluate it;  you will get from the Democrats: No, get three boosters or you can't  come to the Senate.   Why is the U.S. Senate choosing to ignore the risk other countries  have acknowledged when mandating these vaccines for young people who  are in peak physical condition? What happened to a belief in medical  choice? What happened to a belief in medical freedom?   Public health measures should be backed up with proof that the  benefits outweigh the burdens, and if you want to treat everyone the  same--you want to say that teenagers are the same as 75-year-olds--that  is not good medicine; that is not good science.   There is no evidence that when it comes to vaccination and booster  mandates, especially for teenagers who as a group are less vulnerable  to the virus than any Senator, that is why I am asking unanimous  consent today that we pass my resolution to get rid of this ridiculous  and unscientific mandate.   So, therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 336, which is at the desk;  further, that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to,  and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, in no way, shape, or form have I opposed  vaccines for those who are at risk. Back when my in-laws, who are 92  and 86, first became eligible for the vaccine, the first thing we did  was call the health department to see if we could get them a vaccine.  Unfortunately, the health department wouldn't answer the phone, but  they did have a useful message. They said, if we knew anybody who was  not wearing a mask, we could report them to the police, but they didn't  do anything about vaccines.   But I have never been opposed to vaccines. In fact, a lot of the  vaccine hesitancy that we have in our country comes from the  unscientific, unfounded, and half-baked ideas of the Democrats on this.  When Democrats tell you that we should force 15-year-olds to be  vaccinated--because that makes no sense and because their parents know  it makes no sense and they know it makes no sense--that leads to the  distrust of the government on other fronts.   So I mentioned earlier--and this, apparently, was lost and not  necessarily received by the other side--that the FDA committee, in  looking at boosters, advised not to give boosters to teenagers. Now,  they hide behind that by saying: Oh, there is no mandate. Ask these  kids if there is a mandate. Ask their parents. Ask the media. Call them  up. Ask them: Is there a mandate? No, they can't be here unless they  have three vaccines. There is a mandate. We have the chance to undo the  mandate, and that is what the vote would be about.   The FDA didn't even advise giving it. The FDA didn't even advise  giving it to them, but they definitely didn't advise mandating it. The  CDC said the same thing. The only reason we got any kind of approval  for this booster is that the political appointee of the Biden  administration overrode both of the vaccine committees in order to  approve it.   Normally, you would have to prove efficacy--a reduction in  hospitalization. Well, transmission would be one. The Senator came to  the floor and said this is a vaccine-preventable disease. Well, this  isn't a vaccine-preventable disease because it doesn't stop  transmission; it doesn't stop you from getting it.   But here is the thing: If you look at kids and boosters and you want  to prove whether they are good for kids--and this is all we are talking  about. We are not talking about the elderly or the infirm or people who  have risk factors. We are talking about these kids. If you look at  these kids and you ask, ``Do they have any risk factors or are any of  them dying?'' we will refer to some statistics here. Well, the  statistics aren't accurate. If you look at healthy kids--there was not  one healthy kid. The answer wasn't a few. It was zero. In Germany, zero  healthy kids died. In Israel, zero healthy kids died. A handful of  unfortunate cases of children in our country did die. I think it was a  little over 100 kids in a country of 330 million, and, sadly, every one  of those cases had a severe medical illness and a problem.   I think it is an abomination that they want to say, ``Oh, we are the  only ones who care about the million people who died,'' when we are the  only ones who have been trying to figure out where this virus came  from. For the last 3 years, I have been asking every day: Did this  virus escape from a lab?   And not one Democrat will stand up and say: I will help you find out.  We will look at it together.   Every Democrat has said: We don't care. We don't know, and we don't  want to know where the virus came from.   But if it came from a lab, maybe we should quit funding this  research. Should we quit sending our money to China, to a lab that  operates in an unsafe manner? That would be a way to show you care  about a million people.   But this is, make no mistake, a mandate on these young pages. It is  wrong. It is malpractice. It shouldn't happen. There is no scientific  evidence, and the government's own vaccine committees don't advise it.  Yet Democrats, today, have said they don't care about the pages. They  don't care about their parents. They don't care about their medical  privacy. They don't care about their ability to discern the risks and  benefits of having a medical procedure. So medical choice be damned.  Democrats are going to tell you what to do, and just remember that.  Just remember that they don't care at all about your own choice about  your own body.
