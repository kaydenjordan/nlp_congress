 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3210) to require the Director of the National Background  Investigations Bureau to submit a report on the backlog of personnel  security clearance investigations, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3210         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Securely Expediting       Clearances Through Reporting Transparency Act of 2017'' or       the ``SECRET Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. REPORT ON BACKLOG OF PERSONNEL SECURITY CLEARANCE                     INVESTIGATIONS.         Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this       Act, and quarterly thereafter for 5 years, the Director of       the National Background Investigations Bureau of the Office       of Personnel Management shall submit to Congress a report on       the backlog of security clearance investigations that       includes--        (1) the size of the personnel security clearance       investigation process backlog; and        (2) the average length of time, for each sensitivity level,       to carry out an initial investigation and a periodic       investigation.       SEC. 3. REPORT ON SECURITY CLEARANCE INVESTIGATIONS OF                     PERSONNEL OF THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE                     PRESIDENT.         Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Director of the National Background Investigations       Bureau of the Office of Personnel Management shall submit to       Congress a report that explains the process for conducting       and adjudicating security clearance investigations for       personnel of the Executive Office of the President, including       White House personnel.       SEC. 4. REPORT ON DUPLICATIVE COSTS.          Not later than 120 days after the date of enactment of       this Act, the Director of the National Background       Investigations Bureau of the Office of Personnel Management       shall submit to Congress a report on the cost of duplicating       resources under the control or direction of the National       Background Investigations Bureau for implementation of the       plan referenced in section 951(a)(1) of the National Defense       Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017 (10 U.S.C. 1564 note).    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Mitchell) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Michigan?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 3210, the SECRET Act of 2017,  introduced by my colleague, the gentleman from California (Mr. Knight).   Mr. Speaker, the backlog of security clearance investigations causes  tremendous waste for Federal employees and contractors and jeopardizes  our national security.   There are thousands of jobs waiting to be filled in important  national security positions and at least as many qualified Americans  eagerly ready to fill them, but they can't, because they are waiting on  their background investigation.   As of June 2017, the backlog stood at 650,000 clearances for  employees, new hires, and contractors waiting either for an  investigation or a reinvestigation. Many of those people are unable to  perform their jobs while waiting, leading to contract delays and a pure  waste of time.   Mr. Speaker, in order to fix the problem, you have to start by  understanding the problem. Fixing the background investigation backlog  requires information on the size, scope, and nature of the problem.   Currently, Congress receives information about the size of the  backlog through briefings--only through briefings. We receive no  regular data on the backlog and have no way to track progress over  time.   My colleagues from California and Virginia, Representative Knight and  Representative Gerald Connolly, authored this bipartisan bill to  provide Congress the information it needs to assess these backlog  investigations.   H.R. 3210, Securely Expediting Clearances Through Reporting  Transparency Act, requires a simple quarterly report from the National  Background Investigations Bureau known as NBIB.   The report will disclose the size of the backlog and the average  length of an investigation broken down by level of clearance.  Additionally, this bill requires two nonpartisan reports to help  Congress plan potential reforms to the background investigation  security clearance process.   NBIB will be required to issue a report describing the general  security clearance procedure in the Executive Office of the President.  The bill also requires NBIB to issue a report on the duplicative costs  that would likely arise from transferring responsibility for background  investigations to the Department of Defense.   Like the quarterly backlog report, this report will help Congress  determine whether proposed options to reduce the backlog would do so or  actually would increase it.   This bill is an important first step in addressing the security  clearance investigation backlog, thereby reducing waste and increasing  our Nation's security.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan good  government bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Knight), the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Knight), the sponsor of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this issue that Mr. Krishnamoorthi refers to is an issue  that spans administrations and requires attention not for partisan  matters, but for the safety and security of our country.   I am pleased with the amendment. I supported the amendment in  committee, and, as noted, it did pass unanimously.   The reason I support this bill is because it pursues some commonsense  goals. Think about it: 650,000 outstanding requests, and the only way  we get information on that is we get a briefing, no routine reporting.   I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of my time to  close.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, as I noted, I am new here in Congress, and I was  astonished to find that we had no routine reporting on security  clearances. I was astonished to find how much of a backlog we face and  the damage it is doing to national security inefficiency.   I support this bill because it pursues a commonsense goal:  transparency and efficient operation of the government. I support the  amendment on transparency on oversight of the clearances in the White  House because I think it is something that should have happened a long  time ago.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to adopt the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 3210, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my fiscally  responsible amendment that is one step in securing America's future.   My amendment is a simple 10 percent cut to administrative expenses of  the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Office of the Assistant Secretary for  Civil Works, Department of the Interior, and Department of Energy.  These savings would be used to reduce the deficit.   Our national debt stands at $20 trillion, and growing. Our unfunded  liabilities add another $100 trillion to $200 trillion to the Federal  debt, and that is only a guess. Our deficit last year was over $500  billion. That is not sustainable. It jeopardizes our future and must be  taken seriously. Paying lip service to the problem will not solve it.  Talk is cheap. We must now be responsible, before it is too late.   I come from the world of private business and know the importance of  having our fiscal house in order. I also know that being fiscally  responsible starts with small steps, which, when added together, make a  big impact.   Early in my career, I worked at Chrysler at the time when Lee Iacocca  was CEO and went through the first loan guarantee. His famous fiscal  savvy and focus helped save Chrysler, which was destined for  bankruptcy. If not for Iacocca taking strong but necessary measures, a  great Michigan company would have been lost.   Lee Iacocca understood that fiscal responsibility starts on a small  scale. He once said if he had a manager who couldn't cut administrative  costs by 10 percent, he needed a new manager.   Mr. Chair, that is what I propose today, a 10 percent cut to  administrative costs of government agencies, which is a small step  that, when combined with others like it, could yield back results and  big savings for taxpayers. Moreover, these cuts would restrain an  overactive government bureaucracy.   The Republican-led Congress has worked hard to undo years of copious  overregulation, but another solution is to have fewer regulators and  fewer bureaucrats passing on regulations that make it hard for  businesses to survive and taxpayers to live their lives.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to choose fiscal responsibility,  choose a secure American future, make a modest cut in the  administrations costs of  [[Page H6429]]  our government, and support my amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I certainly did not intend the adverse  impacts that are outlined by the chairman or the ranking member, nor do  I believe they will arise.   My experience in years of management is that, rather than detail  item-by-item the cuts to be made, allow the leadership of agencies to  determine where they can be more efficient. I honestly have to say, I  can't imagine that we cannot be more efficient than we are in the  Federal Government. I admit, my experience is somewhat more brief than  many, but I am, frankly, shocked some days.   I urge support of my amendment. I realize it may not be popular, but,  at some point in time, we need to start to cut the incredible costs of  this government.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell).   The amendment was rejected.                     Amendment No. 32 Offered by Mr. Mast    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to the order of the House of today, it is  now in order to consider amendment No. 32 printed in House Report 115- 259.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division D (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. ___.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to delay the release of the Great Lakes and       Mississippi River Interbasin Study (GLMRIS) Brandon Road       Study.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Mitchell) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today as an advocate of the Great  Lakes. It is with that spirit I propose my amendment to prevent funds  to be used to further delay the release of the Brandon Road Study.   Anyone who has spent time in my home State of Michigan or any of the  Great Lakes States knows the beauty and importance of the lakes. In  addition to their majesty, the Great Lakes supply 90 percent of the  United States freshwater supply. Thirty million people live at the  Great Lakes Basin, and they are all impacted by the quality of our  lakes, whether as a water source, source of business, recreational  opportunity, or the lakes' inherent value as a natural wonder. Any risk  to the Great Lakes is a significant problem, no matter how you measure  that risk.   One of the threats facing our lakes is the potential entry of  invasive species, the most pressing of which, at this time, is the  threat of Asian carp entering the Great Lakes.   Asian carp have no natural predators in the lakes, meaning once they  enter the Great Lakes, there is no way to stop their spread. Their  unrestrained growth would disrupt the entire ecosystem.   In addition to the damage to native wildlife in the lakes, the  introduction of Asian carp would damage several multibillion-dollar  industries, including the fishing and boating industries which support  countless jobs in my  [[Page H6462]]  home State of Michigan and the Great Lakes.   Given the threat imposed by invasive species, the Army Corps of  Engineers has been studying the best way to prevent introduction of the  Asian carp into the Great Lakes Basin. Their study, the Brandon Road  Study, was initially slated to be released on February 28 but has been  delayed until further notice.   Delaying this study impedes the ability of all interested parties to  develop a long-term strategy to thwart this threat. The continued  delays create a great risk, yet no reason for delaying that release has  been provided.   In late June, a live Asian carp was caught in the Illinois waterway  about 2 miles below the T.J. O'Brien Lock and Dam, 9 miles from Lake  Michigan. This is the first time an Asian carp has been discovered in  such close proximity to our lakes.   Though further study is necessary to determine how this carp entered  the area, it is an alarming warning that the window is quickly closing  to prevent large-scale devastation to the Great Lakes' ecosystem.   The best way to mitigate the damage of Asian carp in our lakes is to  stop it from happening altogether. For several months, members of the  Great Lakes Task Force have requested the release of the Brandon Road  Study, to no avail. I stand here today to again call on the Army Corps  to release the study, which we have already paid for and they have  conducted.   My amendment would prevent the Corps from using any more money--our  money--to delay the release of the study.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment for the  sake of the Great Lakes and for the well-being of our entire region.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, in deference to Mr. Simpson, I will work  with him and others in the Great Lakes Legislative Caucus to see if we  can't move forward on this issue.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time, and I withdraw my  amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.
