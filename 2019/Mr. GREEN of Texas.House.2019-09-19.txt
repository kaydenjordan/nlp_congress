 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairwoman, and I  thank the ranking member as well.   Madam Speaker, we are truly the land of the free because we are the  home of the brave. Unfortunately, not all of the brave have been  treated the same when they have returned home from war. Such is the  case with the Merchant Marines. These merchant mariners came home, but  they didn't come home to the parades that others came home to. Many of  them didn't return the same way they left, and many didn't return at  all.   I stand here today because I am so proud of the work that these  Members of Congress have done to celebrate and appreciate the lives of  the merchant mariners. Yes, it is true that they did not become actual  veterans until 1988. Yes, it is true that they didn't receive all of  the GI Bill benefits that some others received. But it is also true  that, though it may be late, they will be properly recognized.   I am so honored to announce that Congressman Garamendi, Congresswoman  Brooks, and Congressman Young have done a good thing, a just thing, and  a righteous thing.   I would add one additional thing. There is a bill that is currently  pending, H.R. 154. This bill would accord $25,000 to each of these  mariners who are alive. It is the right thing and the just thing, and  we ought to do it as well.   But today, let's celebrate what has been accomplished. Let's have  this Congressional Gold Medal presented, and let's make sure that if we  see a merchant mariner, we give them the love that they richly deserve  as well. They are truly persons who have made us the land of the free  because they are members of the home of the brave.
