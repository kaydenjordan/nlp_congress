 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to celebrate Korean American  Day marking the arrival of the first Korean immigrants to the United  States in 1903.   Those brave pioneers paved the way for generations of Korean  Americans to make countless contributions to our great country.   Like so many before me, I came to this country with my family from  [[Page H208]]  Korea. Now, I am living my American dream.   Today, we celebrate the strength of Korean-American communities like  those in southern California. We recognize the power and impact of our  achievements, and we honor the shared heritage of Korean Americans  across our Nation.   As one of the first Korean-American woman to serve in Congress, I am  proud to recognize this important day and to honor the millions of  Korean Americans who have contributed so much to the success of the  United States of America.                            ____________________
