 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (S. 2959) to provide that, due to the disruptions caused  by COVID-19, applications for impact aid funding for fiscal year 2023  may use certain data submitted in the fiscal year 2022 application.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2959         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Supplemental Impact Aid       Flexibility Act''.       SEC. 2. IMPACT AID PROGRAM.         Due to the public health emergency directly relating to       COVID-19 and notwithstanding sections 7002(j) and 7003(c) of       the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C.       7702(j), 7703(c)), a local educational agency desiring to       receive a payment under section 7002 or 7003 of such Act (20       U.S.C. 7702, 7703) for fiscal year 2023 that also submitted       an application for such payment for fiscal year 2022 shall,       in the application submitted under section 7005 of such Act       (20 U.S.C. 7705) for fiscal year 2023--        (1) with respect to a requested payment under section 7002       of such Act--        (A) use the data described in section 7002(j) of such Act       relating to calculating such payment that was submitted by       the local educational agency in the application for fiscal       year 2022; or        (B) use the data relating to calculating such payment for       the fiscal year required under section 7002(j) of such Act;       and        (2) with respect to a requested payment under section 7003       of such Act--        (A) use the student count data relating to calculating such       payment that was submitted by the local educational agency in       the application for fiscal year 2022, provided that payments       for fiscal year 2023 shall be calculated by the Secretary       using the expenditures and rates described in clauses (i),       (ii), (iii), and (iv) of section 7003(b)(1)(C) of such Act       that would otherwise apply for fiscal year 2023; or        (B) use the student count data relating to calculating such       payment for the fiscal year required under section 7003(c) of       such Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on S. 2959.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge Members to support the Supplemental  Impact Aid Flexibility Act introduced by Senator Smith from Minnesota  and Senator Thune from South Dakota. The companion bill was introduced  by the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney) and the gentleman from  South Dakota (Mr. Johnson).   It is difficult to overstate the importance of Impact Aid for our  Nation's children. For over 70 years, this program has been critical to  ensuring that schools that serve children connected to Federal lands  have the resources to help their students thrive.   Unlike most public schools in America, these schools do not receive  funding from property taxes from these Federal assets. This means that  without Impact Aid support, because they still have to educate the  children attached to those assets, this means that without Impact Aid  schools serving the children connected to military bases, affordable  housing units, or Native Americans on reservations and many other  institutions would be significantly shortchanged, and therefore, unable  to offer high-quality education.   The need for this program is now greater than ever as our school  communities grapple with a resurgence of COVID-19.   In response, Democrats and Republicans worked together in the last  Congress led by, again, the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney)  and the gentleman from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) to enact the Impact  Aid Coronavirus Relief Act. That bill ensured that during the pandemic  schools continued to have access to Impact Aid funding that accurately  reflected their student populations, whether or not those students  could accurately be counted as physically in those schools because of  the complications created by the coronavirus pandemic.   Today, we have the responsibility to, once again, join together in  providing schools the support and flexibility they need to serve their  students.   The Supplemental Impact Aid Flexibility Act will go a long way toward  ensuring that all students in this country, no matter where they go to  school, will have access to high-quality education.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), the sponsor  of the House version of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Speaker, over the last 2 years, Congress has taken historic steps  to help schools recover from the pandemic because we know that every  school and every student and every family has felt the tragic effects  of COVID-19.   However, we cannot fully achieve that goal if we fail to address the  unique challenges facing schools that serve students connected with  military bases, affordable housing, Native American reservations, and  other Federal properties.   Last Congress, Democrats and Republicans came together and, as a  Nation, tackled the first strain of COVID-19. We came together to  address these challenges and to provide urgent support for Impact Aid  schools.   Now, as we confront a new COVID threat, we must provide the support  that federally connected children need under the Federal Impact Aid  program. By providing the support and flexibility in this legislation,  we will help ensure that Impact Aid schools can keep their teachers and  staff on the payroll, purchase textbooks and learning supplies, and  keep the lights on in their classrooms. And this bill will help ensure  that hundreds of thousands of students have access to a quality  education.   Again, I thank the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Smith) and the Senator  from South Dakota (Mr. Thune), as well as, in the House, the gentleman  from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney) and  [[Page H205]]  the gentleman from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson) for sponsoring the  legislation; and the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Owens) and the committee  ranking member, Ms. Foxx, as well as the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Allen) and the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson), for their  help in advancing this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Supplemental Impact  Aid Flexibility Act, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.
