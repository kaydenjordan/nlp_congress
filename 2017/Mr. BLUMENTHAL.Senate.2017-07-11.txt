 Mr. President, I come to the floor today after a  fourth field hearing in Connecticut. Every one of those field hearings  has been packed. I spent time at a Planned Parenthood clinic in  Hartford, as well as having visited others over the past year. I have  spent time with numerous providers and at community health centers and  heard firsthand from the people of Connecticut as to why the Republican  health bill, which has been unveiled after having been concocted behind  closed doors, would devastate the health and finances of Connecticut's  families and their communities.   The bill that we expect to be disclosed later this week will almost  certainly be defective in the same ways as the bills that we have seen.  To call these proposals mean or heartless, as the President has, is a  gross understatement. The bill, very simply put, would cost both  dollars and lives, eroding not just our ability to save money by  investing in a healthier future but causing death and despair when  neither term is really necessary. This wound would be self-inflicted,  but it is a wound that is preventable and avoidable.   I pledge to the people of Connecticut that I will fight as long and  as hard as necessary to stop this grotesquely cruel and costly  proposal.   It is not, in fact, a healthcare bill. It is a wealth care bill. It  decimates Medicaid, saving, supposedly, close to $1 billion so that  those savings can be used for tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. As  Warren Buffett has said--and he is one of them--``I don't need it.'' He  would rather see it be used for better healthcare and coverage, and  that is what the majority of Americans want. That is why this proposal  is so deeply unpopular.   Now, after weeks of secrecy, followed by chaos, we are back to  secrecy again, with Republicans retreating away from their constituents  and going behind closed doors. Even over this past week, when we were  back in our home States, they were crafting another bill. We have not  seen it. We have not debated it. We cannot even say that we know  anything about what is in it, and my Republican colleagues know little  more than we do on this side of the aisle. We know for sure, despite  the secrecy, that the devastating effect would be overwhelming on  people across income strata, geographic boundaries, and cultural  backgrounds.   I am here not to talk in abstractions. I am here to talk about real  people in real life and to share the stories that I heard at these  field hearings--people's stories that they have entrusted me to bring  to you. Many of my colleagues have refused to hear these stories from  their constituents because they would hear how repugnant and repulsive  this bill is and how deeply angry the people of the country are. The  people of Connecticut and the country are outraged.   The reason is people like Ariella Botts, and here she is. Ariella is  4 years old. She came to my field hearing last week with her mom,  Rachel. Ariella, as her mom told me, has nemaline myopathy, which is a  rare form of muscular dystrophy. Their family relies on Medicaid for  her care. I want to tell you exactly what Rachel said about Ariella and  their family, because her words are far more eloquent and powerful than  mine.   Rachel said:         The fact of the matter is that my daughter's care would       cost over $20,000 a month out of pocket between her food, her       medication, her care, and the breathing machines that keep       her lungs clear. There is no average American family that can       pay $20,000 a month of medical costs. We do our part. We have       two jobs a piece. We do everything we can do. This is the       only thing we ask for help on.    Rachel went on to say:         Supporters of the Trumpcare bill want you to believe that       costs are high because there is this nameless and faceless       abuser of the system, but I have spent hours in the waiting       rooms of Yale New Haven Hospital and Connecticut Children's       Medical Center. I have spent hours in the neonatal intensive       care units and the emergency rooms, and I can tell you that       the people who are accessing care on my level--they're not       abusers.    I am going to continue quoting Rachel. I cannot really speak with the  same power and authenticity that she has, but we are not allowed to  show videos here on the floor.   She continued:         We're mothers and fathers who know that there's more for       our children to achieve. We're tax-paying, community-      investing, voting, involved warriors for our families.    I asked Rachel what would happen to her family if Ariella did not  have Medicaid, and Rachel said: ``It would bankrupt us in less than a  month.''   I want to tell you what it is like to spend just a little bit of time  with Ariella. She is the most vivacious, animated, beautiful girl, and  you would not know anything about her condition but for this apparatus,  which is there so she can lead a normal or a near normal life and be  the wonderful young lady that she is. I smile when I think of  [[Page S3927]]  her at this hearing because she brought smiles to all of our faces. I  understand the joy and pride that she brings to her family because she  is one courageous, strong child, and we are proud of her.   Rachel and Ariella were not the only people I heard from whose lives  have been made not just better but, truly, whose lives have been made  possible by Medicaid.   Jeff Pabon was also at a hearing that I held, and he told me about  his family when he was growing up. As a single mother, his mom raised  him and his four siblings. As a member of the working class, Jeff told  me ``she needed as much assistance from the system as the system could  provide.'' Years later, as an adult, Jeff proudly served our country in  the U.S. Navy during Operation Desert Storm. He now has a family of his  own, including a son with autism. He spoke out at my hearing because,  as he said, ``I've fought for this country before.''   What Jeff told me touches the core--the heart--of this debate, and I  want to read it here on the Senate floor because he said it so  powerfully:         The healthcare bill being crafted in secrecy by a minority       of Republican Senators now threatens Medicaid protections and       aims to provide tax breaks for the ultra wealthy, top 1       percent of America. I would like to see sensible, bipartisan       legislation which serves the majority of Americans, like the       other 99 percent. Let's repair the provisions of the       Affordable Care Act that need reparation. We need to be       moving forward, not backward.    Jeff is right, and so is Rachel. How absurd and reprehensible that  costs will rise astronomically while Medicaid funding and the number of  those with insurance coverage will go down, just so our Nation's  richest can see billions of dollars in tax cuts--laughable, if it were  not so deadly serious. ``Deadly'' is the word because this bill will  cost lives. We rarely deal in life and death issues in this Chamber.  This issue is one of them.   It will decimate the lives and livelihoods of so many and threaten  not only Ariella but many like her of all ages--the senior who goes  into a nursing home after exhausting her life savings and depends on  Medicaid, the woman who goes to a Planned Parenthood clinic to be  screened for cancer and finds that this pernicious disease has been  detected because of that preventive step and the availability of  healthcare at Planned Parenthood, the opioid addict who suffers from  that disorder or disease--it is a disease, not a moral failing--and  seeks recovery through the medicine that is made available by Medicaid.  Forty-four percent of all of the medication for opioid addiction  treatment comes from Medicaid in the State of Connecticut. All of them  are at risk. It is not just their convenience or their comfort. Their  lives are at risk.   I heard their stories, and I am haunted by them. I can hear their  voices, and I can see their faces. I want my colleagues to do the same.  I am ready to do what Jeff asked of me. I am ready to work with all of  my colleagues--Democrat and Republican--to move us forward, not  backward. Let's work together in a bipartisan way to fix the parts of  our healthcare insurance system that need repair. Let's go forward, not  backward.   I am eager for the call from my colleagues on the other side of the  aisle that offers solutions--not repeal but real solutions--as to what  the American people need, want, and deserve.   First, we must bury the efforts to decimate Medicaid, to defund  Planned Parenthood, and to repeal the Affordable Care Act. We have a  chance right now to improve healthcare--a moment, an historic  opportunity--and we must seize it. I feel that we are on the cusp of  that dramatic and historic moment, and I look forward to working with  my colleagues across the aisle.   I yield the floor.
