 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Long- Term Care Veterans Choice Act. The Department of Veterans Affairs has  been running its medical foster homes initiative since the year 2000,  and as of 2021, the Veterans Health Administration oversees about 600  medical foster home caregivers taking care of veterans in about 40  States.   Medical foster homes are private homes where a caregiver provides  services to a small group of individuals who are unable to live without  day-to-day assistance.   Currently, veterans enrolled in home-based primary care through the  VA may elect to receive their care at medical foster homes. However,  the VA does not cover the cost of medical foster homes for veterans  that would otherwise be eligible for nursing home care through the VA.  As has been noted by my colleagues, full nursing home traditional care  is far more expensive than medical foster homes.   Veterans must pay for medical foster homes out of their pocket or  through private insurance. This bill would fix that.   My bill would authorize the Secretary of the VA to enter into  contracts and agreements for placement of up to 900 veterans a day in  medical foster homes. These are veterans who are unable to live  independently.   In addition, medical foster home caregivers would be required to pass  a Federal background check and undergo VA screening. They would be  required to participate in annual training, and they would have to  permit the VA to make announced and unannounced home visits.   Finally, the VA would provide these veterans with full  interdisciplinary home care that includes, physicians, nurses,  rehabilitation therapists, medical healthcare providers, dietitians,  and pharmacists.   My bill is supported by the American Legion, the VFW, Disabled  American Veterans, and the Wounded Warrior Project.    In closing, I sincerely thank Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Bost  for bringing this bill to the floor, and I urge my colleagues to  support this bill.
