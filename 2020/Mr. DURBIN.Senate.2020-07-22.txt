 Madam President, I read this morning that more Americans  have died in the last 3 months than in any 3-month period in the  history of the United States. That is a stunning statistic. We are  searching the records to make sure that it is an accurate statement,  and I am afraid it is.   So far, we believe 140,000 Americans have died of this COVID-19  crisis that we are facing. This is not a moment of American greatness.  They have just done a review of the nations across the world and the  safety of living in those nations that face this pandemic. Where does  the United States rank among the nations of the world in terms of  safety in dealing with the coronavirus? It ranks 58th--two ranks ahead  of Russia.   How could we have reached this moment in time when this pandemic has  been so devastating in the United States, more so than in many other  countries around the world--countries that are supposedly not even  close to us in terms of economic development and strength? They have  handled this far better than the United States. Yet what are we doing  about it now? It is a valid question.   I know that the President has decided he doesn't want the likes of  Dr. Tony Fauci by his side any longer when it comes to talking about  this pandemic, but Dr. Fauci and Dr. Collins, of the National  Institutes of Health, were interviewed over the weekend and were asked  directly about the issue of testing.   Why does it take so long in the United States to get results, and  what kind of problems does that create?   Well, we know. If people suspect they are positive for this virus and  go in for a test, they are worried that they may be endangering their  own lives, not to mention the lives of others. Then, they have to wait  1 day, 2 days, 3 days, 6 days--more--for the test results. That is  unacceptable. We need to invest more money in testing and more money in  finding tests to provide quicker results.   You would think that it would be obvious to everyone, but it is not  obvious in this negotiation that is taking place now in the U.S.  Senate. There are Republican Senators who are resisting the idea of  putting more money into testing in the United States. What country do  they live in? Do they ever go home from Washington to see what is  happening in the rest of this country? We closed down the testing  facilities in my hometown of Springfield, IL, this last week. It was  disappointing, for we needed it, and we need more.   If we are serious about opening this economy, if we are serious about  stopping the spread of this pandemic, and if we are serious about  opening our schools and making certain that teachers and pupils are  safe, we need more testing. Yet here we are, tied in knots, as Senator  Schumer said earlier.   The Republicans can't agree among themselves about the issue of  putting money into testing in the midst of this pandemic. It is hard to  believe. It was more than 2 months ago that the House of  Representatives passed the Heroes Act. Senator McConnell has come to  the floor regularly to ridicule that effort because he doesn't like the  provisions in the act. It is his right to have a difference of opinion,  but the obvious questions to Senator McConnell are these: Where is your  alternative? What have you been doing for the last 2 months? You should  have been writing a bill that we should be voting on as soon as we  finish the one that is pending on the floor.   Apparently, the White House and the Senate Republicans can't come to  any agreement about how to move forward. There are some who are  basically saying: Enough. We are not going to spend another penny. We  are not going to waste any more money on any type of COVID-19.   I have seen their testimony. I have seen their statements before the  microphones. That is hard to imagine.   I wonder if some of the Senators from States like Kentucky and Texas  who have stepped up and said, ``We have spent enough money on this,''  have been home recently. Have they been there to meet people who are  unemployed, out of work, or who have been laid off who are receiving  the Federal unemployment benefits to keep bread on the table and to pay  for the their mortgages and their health insurance?   This $600 a week may sound like a pretty generous amount of money to  some. Try living on it. Try living on $600 a week when it costs you  $400 a week for health insurance. Yes, that is the average on COBRA  premiums--almost $1,700 a month. So, when you talk about $600 a week,  take out $1,600 or $1,700 off the top of that, and tell me what is left  to take care of your family.   As for the last Federal unemployment payment under the CARES Act,  Senator Schumer is right. It ends on July 31--a week from Saturday. We  have been told that the last checks will be mailed this Saturday, which  is just a few days from now.   Three days from now, the last check goes out. While that check is  making its way through the mail, is it even possible that the  Republican leadership, with the White House, will come up with a  proposal to deal with this? It has been 2 months. Senator McConnell  said, during those 2 months, that he didn't feel any sense of urgency-- no sense of urgency. Can you imagine the sense of urgency if you can't  make your mortgage payment? Can you imagine the sense of urgency if  that utility bill is so large you can't pay it? That is the reality  facing a lot of families who have been laid off and are unemployed. I  believe--and many agree--that one of our highest priorities is to make  sure that the resources are there for the families.   I also want to say that we are in the midst of this conversation  about public health while the President and his party are trying to  kill the Affordable Care Act in the Supreme Court. More  [[Page S4367]]  than 140,000 Americans have died from this pandemic, and President  Trump and the Republican Party are trying to kill the major source of  health insurance for millions of Americans. For 10 years, the  Affordable Care Act has been the law of the land, and before it was the  law of the land, there were some things going on when it came to health  insurance which we should not forget.   Routinely, health insurance companies discriminated against women  before we passed the Affordable Care Act and prohibited their  practices. There was a time when insurance companies were allowed to  charge women more than men for the same health insurance policies. It  was common for women to pay three or four times what men pay for on the  identical plans.   Important women's healthcare was often excluded from most insurance  plans. For instance, most individual policies refused to cover  maternity or newborn care.   Insurance companies were allowed to deny coverage and charge higher  premiums to Americans with preexisting conditions. That particular  discrimination hurt women much more than men. Approximately 24 million  American men have preexisting conditions; 30 million American women.   Insurance companies could consider a host of medical conditions to be  preexisting conditions: breast cancer, C-sections, victims of domestic  violence, asthma, acne, heart disease--all preexisting conditions.  Before the Affordable Care Act, that is what the health insurance  companies pointed to when they charged women and others more because of  it.   The Affordable Care Act put an end to that, and now the Republicans  want to put an end to the Affordable Care Act. Well, you must say, they  must have a much better idea. There must be a Republican proposal out  there far better than the Affordable Care Act. There isn't. We haven't  seen any. They have no alternative. They just want to kill anything  that might have the name ``Obama'' on it.   We have to do something about this to protect health insurance for  the future, and the notion that the Republicans and President Trump are  fighting the Supreme Court to eliminate the Affordable Care Act in this  moment in American history, when we are fighting this pandemic, is  impossible to explain.                              Amendment No. 1788    Madam President, I have been honored to work on the Defense  Appropriations Subcommittee since December of 2012, when Senator Dan  Inouye, the legendary Senator from Hawaii and recipient of a  Congressional Medal of Honor, passed away. Since I have taken that job,  I have been impressed many times over by the extraordinary Department  of Defense and the actions they have taken--the development of  technology like GPS, investing in critical medical research, and the  abiding commitment to women and men in uniform, who make so many great  sacrifices for our country. But I have also discovered at the same time  how poorly we manage the Department of Defense. Our procurement system  seems designed to generate redtape, delays, and cost overruns. Our top  adversaries around the world develop game-changing technologies at a  fraction of the cost that it takes us to develop them.   There is going to be an amendment on the floor today about future  spending in the Department of Defense offered by Senator Sanders. I  heard what Senator McConnell had to say about it earlier. He seems to  believe that any suggestion that there is misspending in the Department  of Defense is not patriotic. Somehow you are a chicken if you raise any  questions about waste in the Department of Defense. I couldn't disagree  more.   The Sanders amendment proposes a 10-percent budget cut in the  Department of Defense. Well, I have taken a look, as others have, at  the failed audits, the cost overruns, and the sclerotic bureaucracy at  the Department of Defense. I believe the American taxpayer deserves  more.   One of my early hearings in the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee  focused on the defense industrial base and the threat of sequestration.  The lives of our servicemembers often depend on the equipment and  training provided. When managed well, the defense industrial base  generates the best equipment, next-generation technology, good jobs,  and powerful weapons. However, I am concerned that holding defense  contractors accountable for poor performance has not been the priority  it should be today.   Listen to this: From 2016 to 2019, military spending rose by 18  percent. During the same period of time, the Department of Defense  accumulated $18 billion in cost overruns for weapons programs. What  about the contractors who generated those cost overruns? The top five  defense contractors in America saw their profits increase by 44 percent  in that same period. This doesn't add up.   Businesses have the right to earn a profit, but taxpayers have the  right to demand accountability. With defense spending on such a steep  rise, we should be driven by the motto ``pay for performance.'' I don't  believe that is the culture at the Department of Defense today.   Senator Sanders wants to direct $74 billion to communities across the  country--including many needy communities in my State of Illinois--for  housing, healthcare, childcare, education, and jobs. Senator McConnell  comes to the floor and calls that socialism. Socialism when it comes to  education and childcare? I don't agree with him.   There is considerable merit to what Senator Sanders has to say about  the run-up in cost at the Department of Defense, but I do not agree  with his basic approach of across-the-board cuts. When you start  exempting things like military pay and healthcare, it means the  remaining items take a deeper hit.   The 14-percent cut that has been proposed for the remaining items at  the Department of Defense would be a hard hit, no question about it. As  I have said many times, sequestration didn't work, and we ought to  learn a lesson from it.   The National Guard should not have a 14-percent cut. Special victims  counsels and sexual assault prevention programs should not be cut by 14  percent. Cleaning up PFAS contamination at military bases should not be  cut by 14 percent. Instead, we ought to look at the Department of  Defense budget more carefully, not with an across-the-board cut.    Let's start with the $16 billion OCO gimmick. OCO is the account  created to fight a war. We started this account years and years ago,  when we actually were engaged in a war. We have kept it alive to this  day because it is a way to escape budget rules.   The OCO gimmick funds were requested for routine Army, Navy, and Air  Force operations that have nothing to do with fighting a war in  Afghanistan or any other place. The administration requested these  funds for the sole purposes of evading the caps on the base defense  budget. Beyond that--listen to this--the President of the United  States, who is arguing for this budget, was the first to raid it and  take $8 billion or more out for his medieval wall on the southern  border of the United States.   The $18 billion in weapons systems overruns that I mentioned  earlier--what could we do with $18 billion in cost overruns? Well, you  could increase the budget for the National Institutes of Health medical  research by almost 50 percent. That is one thing. You could provide  student loan forgiveness for healthcare workers or hazard pay for these  same men and women who risk their lives for us every day.   I have to tell you, there is need for us to look to space in terms of  our future defense. I still haven't been sold on this concept of the  so-called Space Force. Putting millions of dollars into additional  bureaucratic costs is hard for me to understand or explain.   Ultimately, the Sanders amendment is going to be considered in this  authorization bill, but if it is going anywhere in concept, it will be  in the Appropriations Committee, where I serve. Our work as  appropriators is to examine the details of the budget and make the best  decisions for the taxpayers and for our national defense.   I believe Senator Sanders is on the right track to demand  accountability and to ask that we find cost overruns and expenditures  that can be changed without jeopardizing our national defense. His  exact approach is not one that I would endorse, but I have to say that  I stand behind his concept that we need to ask harder questions about  this massive spending.  [[Page S4368]]    I yield the floor.    Madam President, I am expecting the Senator from Utah to  come to the floor momentarily to resume debate over an issue which was  raised yesterday and suspended to move to a vote that had been  previously scheduled.   Since this item, this issue, we are discussing is of such importance  to so many individuals in our country  [[Page S4387]]  today--and many of them are following this carefully and closely--I  wanted to make sure we returned to it today to at least consider one  aspect of the debate.   Yesterday, when I made a unanimous consent request, Senator Lee said  he had not had time to look at my proposal. That is why I waited until  today to come back, so that he would have that opportunity.   Yesterday, I came to the floor to speak about the plight of immigrant  workers who are suffering because of a serious problem in our  immigration system known as the green card backlog. Many of these  immigrants are essential workers who are helping to lead the fight  against COVID-19, but the green card backlog puts them and their  families at risk of losing their immigration status and being subject  to deportation.   Under the current law, there are clearly not enough immigrant visas-- also known as green cards--available each year. The numbers that we  have established in 1990 are still applicable today, though our  national economy has doubled since then. We are still talking about  140,000 employment visas each year.   These so-called green cards have resulted in many people waiting for  long periods of times--literally for years--for the opportunity to  become legal permanent residents and securing one of the green cards.  While they are waiting, their families are at risk.   These backlogs are particularly difficult on children because as they  wait, the children, of course, advance in age, and when they reach age  21, they are subject to deportation. I have met with these families,  and I have talked with them. It is a heartbreaking situation.   The unanimous consent request, which I will make today, addresses the  plight of those children directly. Senator Lee objected to it  yesterday. He said he had not had a chance to look at it. I hope he  will reconsider when I make the same request today.   These children who face, what we call, aging out at age 21 would be  protected by this unanimous consent request, which I am making. In  addition to the green card backlog, it is clear there is a solution to  this issue, which I am afraid we are not going to be able to achieve.  It is to increase the number of green cards available each year in this  country.   These immigrant workers who are seeking green cards are already in  the United States working legally. This is not a question of increasing  the number of green cards, of bringing in new immigrants to compete  with American workers. These workers are already here. It is about  whether immigrant workers will continue to be able to work on temporary  visas, where they have to depend on their employer for their  immigration status and their future is uncertain.   I introduced legislation known as the RELIEF Act. My cosponsors are  Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii.  The RELIEF Act would increase the number of green cards to clear the  backlog for all immigrants waiting in line for green cards within 5  years--eliminate the backlog for green cards within 5 years.   This RELIEF Act would keep immigrant families together by treating  children and spouses of green card holders as immediate relatives, just  as the children and spouses of citizens are, so they don't count  against the green card caps. The RELIEF Act would protect the aging-out  children who qualify for a green card based on parents' immigrant  petition.   The RELIEF Act that I am describing is not novel or controversial; it  is based on a provision of the 2013 comprehensive immigration reform  bill, which I helped to write with the so-called Gang of 8. That  included Senator McCain, Senator Graham, Senator Flake, as well as  Senator Rubio on the Republican side; myself, Senator Schumer, Senator  Menendez, and Senator Bennet on the Democratic side. We worked hard and  passed that measure through the Senate Judiciary Committee and on the  floor by a vote of 68 to 32.   What I am proposing is something I have proposed in the past,  crafted, passed, and offered to the House of Representatives to help  start to solve the immigration crisis, which we currently have in this  country. Unfortunately, the Republicans, who controlled the House of  Representatives when this measure came before them several years ago,  refused to even take up this measure and debate it.   If they had, we wouldn't be here today. The green card backlog would  not exist based on the provision which I offered with others in the       comprehensive immigration reform bill. Unfortunately, some       of the Republicans on the other side of the aisle are       still unwilling to increase any number of immigrant visas.       They want to keep the immigrant workers on a temporary       basis, where they and their family are at risk of losing       their immigration status and being deported.   The senior Senator from Utah, Mr. Lee, has introduced S. 386, known  as the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act, to address the green  card backlog. I have a basic concern with that bill. It includes no  additional green cards. Without any additional green cards, S. 386 will  not reduce the green card backlog. Without additional green cards, S.  386 will not reduce the green card backlog.   Don't take it from me. There are those who will disagree and say: Oh,  Durbin is wrong. He is just mistaken in saying that.   Please go to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Here is  what they said about S. 386, Senator Lee's legislation. ``S. 386 would  not reduce future backlogs compared to current law.''   Despite my concerns about Senator Lee's bill, I agreed to sit down  and work in good faith with him to resolve our differences. Last  December, we reached an agreement--I believed we did--on an amendment  to the bill. The amendment doesn't address the core problem because it  doesn't increase the number of green cards. As a result, it would not  reduce the green card backlog, but there was an improvement in the  amendment which we put together. I talked about it yesterday.   Let me highlight two key provisions of our agreement. We protected  the families who are stuck in this backlog waiting for a green card.  Immigrant workers and immediate family members would be allowed to  ``early file'' for their green cards. That was a proposal that came to  me from Senator Lee, and I thought it was reasonable. These individuals  would not receive their green cards early, but they would be able,  while waiting, to switch jobs and travel without losing immigration  status. I think that is reasonable. Early filing adds a critical  protection that wasn't in S. 386.   Listen carefully. Our agreement prevents the children of immigrant  workers from aging out of green card eligibility so they will not face  deportation while they are waiting for a green card.   Our agreement also would crack down on the abuse of H-1B temporary  work visas. Really, I think this is at the heart of the problems we are  running into. There are corporate entities in India, which have  extraordinary power over the securing of these H-1B visas.   The amendment we put together would allow legitimate use of H-1B  visas, but here is what it would say. It would prohibit a company from  hiring additional H-1B workers in the future if the company's workforce  is more than 50 employees and more than 50 percent of those are  temporary workers.   The 50-50 rule is from a bipartisan H-1B reform bill that I authored  with Senator Grassley. This provision was included in the 2013  comprehensive immigration reform bill.   Senator Lee has said publicly: This is a commonsense reform to root  out abuse. I think he is right. I know these companies despise this  provision, and I think it is one of the reasons we find ourselves with  no common ground today. If this is included, they don't want anything  to pass, and they are doing their best to stop it.   The reality is that the top recipients of H-1B visas today are  outsourcing companies that use loopholes in the law to exploit  immigrant workers and offshore American jobs. In the most recent year  for which data is available, 8 of the top 10 recipients of new H-1B  visas were outsourcing companies.   Unfortunately, yesterday, Senator Lee objected to this proposal,  which we had put together. Instead, he offered a revised version that  included changes that were requested by the Trump administration. Let  me explain Senator Lee's changes because I think they are basic, and I  believe they are a problem.  [[Page S4388]]    First, he wants to remove a provision from our original agreement,  known as the hold harmless clause. What it says is very simple. It  assures immigrants already waiting in line for green cards that there  is nothing we will do that will, in any way, injure or delay their  pursuit of a green card; they can't fall further behind in line. We  hold them harmless from any change we make. Why wouldn't we? Some of  these people have waited for years. The hold harmless provision  basically says we are going to protect wherever you stand in line.   The second thing that Senator Lee wants to do is to delay for 3 years  the effective date of the 50-50 rule to crack down on outsourcing  companies. I don't know why we want to wait 3 years to do that. We  don't have to. We shouldn't. Why on Earth would we give these companies  that are outsourcing American jobs and exploiting immigrant workers a  free pass for an additional 3 years?   Third, Senator Lee wanted to delay for years early filing for people  who are stuck in the green card backlog. The object behind the early  filing, and the reason why it is so appealing to me, was that it would  protect the individuals applying as well as their families from the  start, and now the Senator suggested that we delay this. That just  means that many children will age out during that 1-to-3-year period of  time and be subject to deportation. We shouldn't do that to these  children and these families.    Yesterday, I made a simple proposal to Senator Lee, which he hadn't  seen personally, and that is why we had to come back today. While we  continue to debate the best way to fix the green card backlog, let's  make sure no children of the affected families are harmed or deported.  It is just that simple.   I offered a new bill--very simply stated--the Protect Children of  Immigrants Workers Act. This brief, three-page bill would ensure that  children do not age out while waiting for a green card.   Imagine if you brought your family to the United States, worked on an  H-1B visa, applied for a green card to stay in this country, and your  children are waiting with you for the green card. You are paying for  them to go to college because they don't qualify as American citizens  for any type of Federal financial aid. You are making great sacrifices  for them. Then the day comes when they reach the age of 21 and they can  be deported and the family divided. Why would we want to let that  happen?   This three-page bill, the Protect Children of Immigrant Workers Act,  protects those children. It would not increase the number of green  cards. It would not provide any special benefits. It would simply allow  children of immigrant workers to keep their place in line for a green  card and be protected from deportation until they can get that card.   Yesterday, Senator Lee said he had not had a chance to review it, so  I wanted to return to the floor today. I believe this is timely and  important, and now he has had a chance to look at it. Senator Lee's  original bill does not offer any protection for those children, which I  think is a major humanitarian problem caused by the green card backlog.   The early-filing provision in my agreement with Senator Lee will  immediately protect the kids in the backlog under the age of 21.  However, if early-filing is delayed, Senator Lee now proposes those  kids would age out and lose their green card eligibility.   I have met many of these young people. It breaks my heart to hear  their stories, that they may be reaching a point where they have aged  out and could be deported. That is why I want to offer this specific  single provision. There is no reason these children should be punished  for a broken immigration system. It is beyond their control, but it is  not beyond our control to help them.   I now am going to ask unanimous consent for the Protect Children of  Immigrant Workers Act.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee  be discharged of S. 4243, the Protect Children of Immigrant Workers  Act, and the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration; further,  that the bill be considered read a third time and passed and the motion  to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Madam President, there is no question that there is a  green card backlog for immigrant visas. We issue 140,000 employment- based visas a year and 226,000 family visas. There are some 5 million  seeking them. I want to increase the number of green cards. The Senator  from Utah opposes that. As a result, the bill that he introduced,  according to analysis by the Congressional Research Service--this is  not Durbin's language; this is the Congressional Research Service: S.  386, the lead legislation, would not reduce future backlogs compared to  current law.   When he talks about 195 years and John Quincy Adams or whatever his  historical analogy was, he doesn't address that at all in S. 386.   The problem, of course, is that he is bound to a position of his  party that will not allow one additional new immigrant--none. I don't  take that position. These men and women and their kids have been living  in the United States. Many of them have been here for years, some of  them for decades. Some of them are doctors in hospitals in my hometown.  I trust them, and I trust their kids. What I am asking him to do today  is simply join with me in protecting their children while we resolve  the other issues. He refuses. He refused yesterday. He refuses again  today.   He calls my approach sloppy. Let's see the Lee alternative to protect  the children. I would like to see what he would like to propose. Maybe  it is language that is better, and maybe I can embrace it. But let's  take care of that discrete part of this issue. Why would we leave these  children now aging into adults at risk? That is just the wrong way to  approach this. We can solve this problem, and we should. While we solve  it, we should protect these children. It is within the ken of both  Senator Lee and myself to sit down through staff and come up with that  language. I believe we can.   I want to say I will continue to offer this opportunity for Senator  Lee to protect these children until we can sit down in good faith and  resolve any differences we have between us. I have heard this case over  and over again about the plight of these children. I am trying to  address it. He continues to object.   I yield the floor.    Reserving the right to object.    Just do the math; 140,000 EB visas and 226,000 family  visas per year and 5 million people waiting. If you think you can solve  this without changing the number of green cards, you can't. You may  address it from one angle or another. You may help some who are waiting  as opposed to others. You only give assistance to some at the expense  of some other group.   I understand the Senator's position. I don't quarrel with the fact he  made it clear from the start that, from his perspective and perhaps  from his side of the aisle, there is just no appetite for increasing  the number of green cards, even for these people who have been living  and working here in the United States for years and sometimes decades,  even for physicians from India and other countries who are literally  risking their lives today on COVID-19 patients. The Senator told me  there is no appetite for giving them additional green cards so they can  stay here on a permanent basis. I think that is unfair, and that is my  position.   The Senator made it clear--and I am not saying otherwise--that he  disagrees with me. So what I tried to do is come in and say that at  least during the pendency, while they are waiting for green cards-- which could be decades unless the law is changed--let's at least  protect their families. That is all I basically said.   He has come back and said: I want to put in a provision that takes  out the hold-harmless protection. I want to protect these people who  are outsourcing companies in India that have captured the lion's share  of these H-1B visas. I want to make sure that those who are going to be  protected have to wait up to 3 years before there is any protection.   Why in the world would we do any of those things? I am willing to sit       down and talk to you, but I am not going to accept these       at this point unless we can find a starting point, which       is protection for the children of these families. If you       will agree to that, I will be more than happy to discuss       the other provisions again, but because the other       provisions are now what you are offering, I object.    Madam President, the Senator has addressed a question to  me, I believe.    Madam President, I know other Senators are waiting to  speak, so I will try to be as concise and brief as possible.   I understand the Senator's position. He doesn't want another green  card. He believes Members on his side of the aisle don't want an  increase in the number of green cards--period. I knew that going in. He  made that abundantly clear. We can't solve the underlying problem  without it, but we can make it better. That is why we continue to talk  and negotiate, and I hope we will continue to talk and negotiate. Yet,  for goodness' sake, the starting point ought to be the protection of  these children.   Can we not agree that we will protect the children and then proceed  to continue the negotiations on the premise that the Senator cannot  accept one more green card? I can, and the Senator can't, but we will  try to improve the system with that premise accepted. At the starting  point, for goodness' sake, let's protect the children while we  negotiate and debate. Hopefully, we can do it on a timely basis. That  is my response.   I am willing to continue to work. I understand the Senator cannot  issue another green card. The math never works with 5 million people  waiting and 140,000 employment green cards and 226,000 family visas a  year. It is never going to work, but I am willing to try to make the  system better, with the understanding that I will increase the number  of green cards and that the Senator will not.
