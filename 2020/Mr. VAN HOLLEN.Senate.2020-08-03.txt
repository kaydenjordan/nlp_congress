 Mr. President, I rise to speak on the National  Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2021.   The National Defense Authorization Act provides crucial resources for  our Armed Forces and our national defense, including a pay increase for  our men and women in uniform. I am glad that the Senate was able to  come together on a bipartisan basis to pass this legislation to support  our servicemembers, strengthen our national security, and invest in  critical projects in my home State of Maryland. While there are parts  of this legislation that I do not support and will seek to change in  conference, I believe that, on balance, this bill serves our national  interest.   In particular, I am pleased that this NDAA grants expanded  acquisition authority for U.S. Cyber Command,  [[Page S4664]]  headquartered at Fort Meade. I echo the comments of the Armed Services  Committee in its report, which finds that Cyber Command's expanded  mission and responsible use of its acquisition authority justify the  removal of the constraints imposed by the FY16 NDAA.   I appreciate that my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services  Committee adopted Senator Warren's amendment directing the Pentagon to  begin the process of renaming military bases named for Confederate  soldiers. No American military installations should be named in honor  of those who led the fight against the union to defend slavery.   I also want to note my gratitude to Chairman Inhofe and Ranking  Member Reed and their staffs for working with me to include relief for  the family of Lieutenant Richard W. Collins III. Lt. Collins' tragic  death was made even more painful for his family through the challenges  they faced in receiving the proper benefits and recognition for their  son. Nothing will ever fill the void of their loss, but I am hopeful  that this provision brings the Collins family some peace of mind.   Additionally, it is worth highlighting for the record that the House  NDAA included a provision extending the review period of the World War  I valor medals review authorized by section 584 of last year's NDAA.  The Valor Medals Review Task Force has worked tirelessly to identify  the service records of World War I veterans who may have been passed  over for the Medal of Honor on the basis of race or ethnicity.  Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has limited their access to  research materials and necessitated an extension for them to complete  their work. I encourage the conferees to retain the House's provision  granting this extension.   While I am pleased with many of the provisions included in this bill  and voted for its passage, I do have significant reservations.   I am deeply disappointed that this bill authorizes full funding for  the President's misguided and wasteful nuclear weapons programs while  taking no action to preserve the New START treaty, the last standing  agreement capping U.S. and Russian nuclear forces. For more than half a  century, successive administrations have linked arms control with  nuclear modernization efforts as a way of promoting stable deterrence  and heading off an unconstrained arms race. Failure to extend New START  will unravel this linkage, freeing Russia of limits on its nuclear  arsenal and sparking a costly, destabilizing arms buildup.   I also strongly oppose the authorization of funds to prepare for an  explosive underground nuclear test, an act that would prompt our  nuclear-armed adversaries to conduct their own tests and would  undermine longstanding arms control and nonproliferation objectives. I  applaud the House's passage of an amendment to bar nuclear testing in  its NDAA, and I urge my colleagues to uphold this prohibition in  conference negotiations.   I also believe that this bill fails to tackle the long-term budget  challenges facing our country, which is why I was disappointed that the  Senate rejected Senator Sanders' amendment to reduce defense spending  by 10 percent and invest that money into healthcare, education, and  poverty reduction in communities with a poverty rate of 25 percent or  more. In the midst of the worst economic downturn since the Great  Depression, a pandemic that has taken the lives of more than 150,000 of  our fellow Americans and shows no signs of slowing down, and the  impending crises of homelessness and joblessness that we face if the  Congress fails to provide relief, we simply cannot afford to continue  this level of investment in defense at the expense of other critical  national priorities.   I regret that the Senate was not given an opportunity to vote on my  amendment, cosponsored by 13 other Senators, prohibiting the use of  U.S. security assistance to support the unilateral annexation of all or  parts of the West Bank. The security assistance which the United States  provides to Israel is an important element of the relationship between  our two countries and one that I strongly support. As I explained in my  floor statement at the time of its introduction, the amendment would  not have reduced U.S. security assistance to Israel by a single penny.  It would simply have ensured that no U.S. security assistance could be  used for the purpose of unilaterally annexing territory in the West  Bank. Furthermore, nothing in this amendment would have prohibited  Israel from using U.S.-financed missile defense systems such as Iron  Dome to defend against attacks in any territories that could be  unilaterally annexed by the Israeli Government.   Likewise, I am troubled that the majority leader would not permit a  vote on Senators Wyden and Merkley's amendment to end the President's  unconstitutional attacks on Americans exercising their First Amendment  rights in Portland. Portland is not the first city to experience these  tactics; President Trump sent unidentified Federal police onto the  streets of our Nation's Capital to threaten peaceful protesters. Now,  he is threatening to send them to other American cities, including  Baltimore. We must require Federal agents to wear visible  identification and ban them from making arrests or detentions using  unmarked vehicles. The Senate's failure to act quickly to respond to  the President's unconstitutional behavior is shameful.   Finally, Majority Leader McConnell, at the behest of the Trump  administration, once again blocked the inclusion the bipartisan DETER  Act, which I introduced with Senator Rubio, to deter future Russian  interference in U.S. Federal elections. The DETER Act sends a clear  message to Russian President Putin or any other foreign adversary: If  you attack American elections, you will face severe consequences.  Leader McConnell blocked this measure from the last NDAA, even though  the Senate had unanimously passed a resolution instructing the  conferees to support its inclusion.   The decision of the Trump administration, working through Senator  McConnell, to continue to block the DETER Act effectively green-lights  Russian interference in future U.S. elections. It is a gift to Russian  President Vladimir Putin and a subversion of the clear desire expressed  by both Chambers of Congress to hold Russia accountable for future  interference. It reinforces Putin's belief that the costs of attacking  our democracy are low and the rewards are great. I will continue  fighting for the passage of the DETER Act. The Presidential election is  less than 4 months away, and we must make clear to Putin that Russia  will pay a steep price if they interfere in another election.   While I am opposed to some of the provisions in this bill and  disappointed by the omission of others, I believe that, on balance, the  NDAA will strengthen our national security and advance other important  national priorities. For that reason, I voted in support of final  passage.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I opposed the confirmation of Derek  Kan to be Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget. Mr.  Kan's tenure at OMB and his responses to questions from the Senate  Budget Committee raise serious concerns about a lack of transparency  and a failure of leadership in responding to the coronavirus pandemic.   While Mr. Kan was the Executive Associate Director at OMB, the agency  illegally withheld security assistance for Ukraine in furtherance of  President Trump's corrupt scheme to pressure Ukraine to interfere on  President Trump's behalf in the 2020 election. On August 12, 2019, OMB  General Counsel Mark Paoletta sent an email to Mr. Kan and other top  OMB officials regarding concerns from the Department of Defense about  this withholding, an email that made headlines when it was revealed  publicly. While I specifically asked Mr. Kan about this email in  written questions prior to the hearing, Mr. Kan claimed during the  hearing that he was not familiar with the email in question.  [[Page S4665]]    The Government Accountability Office found that OMB violated the  Impoundment Control Act by withholding security assistance from  Ukraine, and GAO also stated that OMB's stonewalling of their inquiry  had ``constitutional significance'' due to the undermining of  legislative branch oversight. Mr. Kan, like OMB Director Russell Vought  during his confirmation hearing, refused to even provide a reason for  why OMB did not turn over any documents in response to GAO's request  for documents to substantiate OMB's claim that a policy process was the  reason for withholding aid to Ukraine. In response to my questions  following the hearing, Mr. Kan referred the matter to the office of OMB  General Counsel Mark Paoletta, the same official whose response to  GAO's inquiry failed to turn over any such documents in the first  place.   I am also concerned about Mr. Kan's leadership as a member of the  President's Coronavirus Task Force. On February 5, 2020, Mr. Kan told  Senators that the Trump administration did not need additional  resources to address the coronavirus, which contributed to the deadly  lack of preparation as the pandemic spread in the United States. During  his confirmation hearing, Mr. Kan would not say whether he agreed with  President Trump about reducing testing for coronavirus or whether  President Trump was setting a good example by holding large indoor  rallies at which masks were not required.   For those reasons, I voted against Mr. Kan's confirmation to be  Deputy Director at OMB.                            ____________________
