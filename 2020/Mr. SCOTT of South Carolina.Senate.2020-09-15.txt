 Madam President, today I would like to  take a moment to recognize and honor SGM Thomas P. Payne of Batesburg- Leesville and Lugoff. Just last week, on September 11, the 19th  anniversary of the painful attacks on American soil, Sergeant Major  Payne received the Medal of Honor, the country's highest recognition of  military bravery for his outstanding efforts to liberate dozens of  hostages from ISIS captors during a rescue mission in Iraq.   In his 18-year career in the Army, Sergeant Major Payne has deployed  17 times in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi  Freedom, Operation New Dawn, and Operation Inherent Resolve and to the  U.S. Africa Command area of responsibility.   Thomas ``Patrick'' Payne enlisted in the U.S. Army shortly after  graduating from Batesburg-Leesville High School in 2002, and 13 years  later, his efforts have saved the lives of many. He holds several  awards and decorations including the Medal of Honor, Bronze Star Medal  with bronze ``V'' device, and three bronze oakleaf clusters, the Purple  Heart, and many, many more.   Sergeant Major Payne is currently serving as an instructor assigned  to the U.S. Army Special Operations Command and is stationed at Fort  Bragg, NC. I want to thank Sergeant Major Payne for his service; South  Carolina is very proud to have such a brave hero.                            ____________________
