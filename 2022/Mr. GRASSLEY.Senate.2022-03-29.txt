 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Yesterday, Senator Johnson and I discussed a joint  investigation into the Biden family's foreign financial entanglements.  We reviewed much of our earlier work and provided a brief preview of  the new material.   Today, we will give our second speech on our Biden investigation  series. Once again, we are going to make public and we are going to  describe new financial records relating to Hunter Biden and his  connections to the communist Chinese Government. Most of that focus  will be on his connections to the CEFC, a company that is effectively  an arm of the Chinese Government.   But first we must go back to 2015. At that time, Hunter Biden served  on the board of Burisma and was paid tens of thousands of dollars each  month. Its owner was a corrupt Russian-aligned Ukrainian oligarch. But  that is not all that Hunter Biden was up to.   In that year, CEFC International announced an agreement with Northern  International Capital Holdings. Northern International is incorporated  in China, and it is very much involved in the energy sector.   One of Ye Jianming's companies was a majority shareholder of CEFC  International. Northern International purchased 123 million dollars'  worth of CEFC's shares, binding the two companies together.   We must also mention Hudson West III and its financial connection to  CEFC. Hunter Biden was an investor and a manager of Hudson West III. He  was tasked with advancing its interests. Hudson West III also involved  Chinese nationals connected to the communist regime, such as Gongwen  Dong, whom I talked about yesterday.   Now let's look at this first poster.   I should note that Senator Johnson and I will make these documents  public in full. We are providing snapshots for our presentation here on  the floor of the U.S. Senate.   Here we have one portion of an LLC agreement from a bank. It shows  the companies that have bound themselves together: Hudson West V,  Hudson West III, and Owasco. Owasco is Hunter Biden's firm.   Now let's turn to the second poster.   The paragraph at the top shows the purpose for which the LLC  agreement exists.   So what this tells us is that Hunter Biden and James Biden linked up  with companies connected to the communist regime to assist them with  finding projects for global and domestic infrastructure and energy.   As we know from my and Senator Johnson's report from last August,  some energy project explorations between the Biden family and China  were here in the United States. One example is a multimillion-dollar  natural gas project in Louisiana.   Now let's move to the next paragraph at the bottom of this same  poster, which defines the word ``affiliate'' in the agreement.         For the avoidance of doubt, CEFC China Energy Company       Limited or any of its Affiliates shall be deemed as an       Affiliate of Hudson.    Accordingly, this agreement between Hunter Biden's firm and Hudson  West III and Hudson West V directly connects Hunter Biden to CEFC.   So was this agreement executed?   Let's look at this third poster, which contains a signature block  executing the agreement.   Here we see Hunter Biden's signature with Gongwen Dong. As previously  noted, Gongwen was an associate of Ye Jianming. Both men were connected  to the communist regime, including its military elements.   Notably, Hunter Biden worked for Ye Jianming to get him involved in  the natural gas project in Louisiana. That project eventually fell  through.   Now let's bring up a fourth poster labeled a ``Joinder Agreement''  relating to the LLC agreement.   Again, Hunter Biden is signing with Gongwen Dong with respect to the  LLC agreement. Accordingly, we can now conclude the following: Hunter  Biden was financially connected to CEFC, a company that was an arm of  the communist Chinese regime, for the purpose of advancing its energy  interests.   This agreement also shows two additional findings: first, Hunter  Biden's responsibility to advance Hudson West III's interests as of  August 2, 2017; second, Hunter Biden's close association with Hudson  West III, CEFC, and its affiliates as of August 2, 2017. That date is  important as I will show you soon.   Let's turn to a fifth poster. On this fifth poster, look at the top.   This is a bank record showing an August 8, 2017, wire transfer from  Northern International Capital to Hudson West III for $5 million. This  is $5 million from a company that is connected to Ye Jianming and CEFC  and its affiliates, which are essentially arms of the communist Chinese  regime, and that transfer took place after Hunter Biden became closely  associated with Hudson West III as the LLC agreement shows.   So what was the money for?   As noted, Hunter Biden was working with Chinese nationals linked to  the communist regime to help them explore energy projects.   Now look at the bottom of this poster.   This is a paragraph from the LLC agreement. It shows that Hunter  Biden was paid $100,000 per month; that James Biden was paid $65,000  per month; and that Hunter Biden will be paid a onetime retainer fee of  $500,000.   Again, this is money connected to Hudson West III, a company  connected to CEFC and Gongwen Dong. Both are connected, in turn, to the  communist Chinese regime.   We can now conclude this with respect to James Biden: James Biden was  financially connected to CEFC, a company that was an arm of the  communist Chinese regime, for the purpose of advancing energy  interests.   After the LLC agreement was signed, money flowed from CEFC and its  shareholders into the bank account of Hudson West III, including the $5  million from Northern International. This LLC agreement was the trigger  point for high-dollar financial transactions involving Hunter and James  Biden.   Now let's turn to poster six and view the top.   This is a Hudson West III bank record that shows a wire transfer on  August 31, 2017, for $165,000. Notably, this is the same month as the  $5 million wire from Northern International. It is also the same month  that Hunter Biden signed the August 2, 2017, LLC agreement. The wire is  to Wells Fargo Clearing Services.   Now look at the bottom of this poster.   Senator Johnson and I have acquired more than just the bank  statement; we have acquired underlying wire data.   So look at the fourth line at the bottom. It says:         Further credit to Owasco PC.    The underlying wire data shows that it went to Owasco, Hunter Biden's  firm.   Senator Johnson and I have years of bank records that show multiple  $165,000 wire transfers from Hudson West III to Owasco. There were also  wire transfers for other amounts--some for more, some for less. Most  likely, some of those payments were for expenses under the LLC  agreement.   So you have an August 2, 2017, LLC agreement with Hudson West III and  Owasco noting $100,000 a month to Hunter Biden and $65,000 to James  Biden. Then you have an August 8, 2017, wire transfer of $5 million  from Northern International to Hudson West III. After that August 8  wire, you see years of wire transfers from Hudson West III to Hunter  Biden's company. The majority of these is for $165,000--the exact  amount due under the LLC agreement.   Based on the timing of the transactions, Hunter Biden's and James  Biden's payments under the LLC agreement came from that $5 million  wire--a wire, mind you, that came from a company connected to Ye  Jianming and CEFC, which is an arm of the Chinese Government.   These years of records show that Hunter Biden and James Biden were  more connected to the communist regime's elements than had been  previously known. These records place them at the center of Hudson West  III, Gongwen Dong, and CEFC.   This is a finding that Senator Johnson and I made public in our Biden  reports last Congress. These are the same reports that Members of the  other political party in this body and the liberal press found fault  with; that, somehow, it was Russian disinformation.   So I say this to the liberal media and our Democratic colleagues who  tried to smear our work all of these years and accuse us of peddling  Russian disinformation: You have seen all of  [[Page S1822]]  these documents that we have presented. Are these official bank records  Russian disinformation?   To our Democratic colleagues and the liberal media, we deserve an  answer because you made several efforts to smear our reputations as we  were starting this investigation 2 or 3 years ago.   Now I am going to turn it over to Senator Johnson to discuss a name  that I gave you yesterday, Patrick Ho, and related records to Patrick  Ho that we have acquired.
