 Mr. Speaker, I rise today  to honor Mrs. Jennifer Riordan, who tragically lost her life on  Southwest Airlines flight 1380 on April 17.   Mrs. Riordan was an incredible leader and an advocate in our  community who loved out loud. I join her family and loved ones in  celebrating her life and her commitment to building strong and loving  communities.   Through her work at Wells Fargo and her philanthropic efforts, she  was able to reflect the positivity of her beaming smile onto every  community she touched. Her devotion to serving others made our city a  better place and is both her lasting legacy and an example to all of  us.   Our hearts break for her family and for everyone who had the good  fortune of being in her presence.   I want to extend my heartfelt condolences to Mrs. Riordan's husband,  Michael, and her two children, Averie and Joshua.   I hope that we can all honor Mrs. Riordan's memory by embodying her  personal philosophy: be kind, loving, caring, and sharing.                            ____________________
