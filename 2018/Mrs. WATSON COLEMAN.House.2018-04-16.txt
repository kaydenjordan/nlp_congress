 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the hard  work of the students and coaches from two schools in New Jersey's 12th  District, West Windsor-Plainsboro High School North and Princeton  Charter School, as they advance to compete in the 2018 National Science  Bowl.   Sponsored by the Department of Energy, the National Science Bowl is a  nationwide academic competition that tests students' knowledge in all  areas of science and mathematics. Since its inception in 1991, it has  hosted more than 275,000 competitors. These talented young minds from  my district will join those ranks, competing for a chance to win  funding for their respective schools' science departments.   I wish the coaches and the teams the best of luck as they show off  their knowledge, their talent, and their preparation against the  country's future science stars.                            ____________________
