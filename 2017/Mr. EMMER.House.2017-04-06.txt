 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Supporting  America's Innovators Act of 2017.   Far too often, during my travels throughout Minnesota's Sixth  District, I hear frustrations from small-business owners and  entrepreneurs about the difficulties they face gaining access to  working capital.   With Dodd-Frank's one-size-fits-all regulation being imposed on the  banks and credit unions that drive America, our Nation's job creators  struggle to grow existing businesses and to even start new ones.   Today's small business is tomorrow's big business, and if our  entrepreneurs and job creators are to succeed, we must remove the  roadblocks currently standing in their way.   Companies that started in a garage are now Fortune 500 companies and  global giants that provide goods and services across the globe. These  include many brands and companies we all use each and every day such as  Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and even Minnesota's own, Medtronic. They all  started with a dream, a lot of hope, and necessary access to tools,  resources, and, most importantly, working capital.   Not only does the limited access to working capital affect our State  and local economies, it impacts opportunities and jobs for hardworking  Americans. Small businesses are responsible for nearly 70 percent of  new jobs in this country. This legislation will help put Americans to  work.   The Supporting America's Innovators Act updates current law to  increase the number of individuals who are able to invest in and  support startups and small businesses across the country. This bill  will help jump-start capital formation for local businesses and  entrepreneurs, enabling Main Street America to not just survive but to,  once again, thrive.   I want to thank Congressman McHenry for introducing this bill that  received, again, near unanimous support in the committee, and I  encourage all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this  important legislation.
