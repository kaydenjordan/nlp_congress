 Madam Speaker, I thank Dr. Dunn for hosting this  very important discussion. As we have visited on several different  occasions, I want to publicly commend the gentleman for his dedication  for fighting for the right thing to do, for his deep compassion for the  people he represents and the tireless effort that he is making to  explain the consequences of Hurricane Michael as it hit him, the floods  that have hit us, and the wildfires that have hit others. I thank the  gentleman so much for the time and for his leadership.   Madam Speaker, when spring approaches in Nebraska, we expect our  rivers and streams to peacefully rise as snow from the nearby Rockies  gently melts. We are the Cornhusker State, but we actually could be  called the River State. Here is why: We have more miles of rivers than  any other State in the Union. The Missouri, the Platte, the Republican,  the Elkhorn, and the Niobrara are our most famous rivers, but we really  don't think of them as threatening--until they are.   So as General Bacon just said, this was the most destructive storm in  most Nebraskans' lifetimes. A perfect storm of factors caused the pain  and destruction now all around us. Lands that were soaked from earlier  autumn rains were frozen solid and then covered in snow. When the bomb  cyclone's lethal mix of blizzard and rain did hit our State, an  enormous quantity of water, ice, and collected topsoil sped down the  hard land like a furious slurry, into rivers, creeks, and reservoirs  bursting through dams, levees, and other structures that normally would  hold this back.   Madam Speaker, it is pretty hard to get the mind around what a 500- year event actually means. But as I was standing at the ridge on Offutt  Air Force Base, which is located right south of Omaha near the  confluence of the Platte and Missouri Rivers, I could see how the  unprecedented force of water covered one-third of that entire base and  many communities in eastern Nebraska. As the rushing water hit the bank  on the other side of the river, on the Iowa side, it blew it out and  created a 62-foot deep hole.   As a member of the Appropriations Committee here in Congress, I  turned to the commander of the Corps of Engineers who was with me.   I looked at him, and I said: What is the number?   He immediately shot back without hesitation and said: It is going to  be a lot.   Now, a little bit down the road to the west is the town of Fremont.  Mayor Scotty Getzschman is a dedicated local public servant who is in  the heating and air-conditioning business as his main job. He brought  out a 1940 map of the old river channel of the Platte River. The  problem for this town of Fremont began when the river got a bit  nostalgic and sought to go back to its old ways. In a place now named  ground zero near the Rod and Gun Club west of town, massive chunks of  ice and the pressure of the Platte blew the levee. Water began to find  its own channels in multiple breaches, and the southern part of the  town of Fremont endured serious flooding.   We surveyed the damage from a freshly patched hole made from remnants  of an old hog confinement lot and riprap from the old Scribner Air  Base.   An initial call for help in the community brought 250 people out.  Shortly thereafter, 1,000 people showed up to sandbag. One man moved  his car to higher ground because he could see what was coming, but then  it was later swept away by the raging river, and he spent the next few  days at the intersection directing traffic as a volunteer.   Madam Speaker, a bit west of the town of Fremont is the small town of  North Bend, and that is where a ditch dike could not contain itself and  made its own channel, creating fingers of water flowing throughout the  city, and the vast majority of homes in this small community were hit.  The paved streets looked like mud streets by the time I got there, but  even with 6 inches of water inside of it, the North Bend Eagle, the  local newspaper, figured out a way to get that edition out.   Realizing that he was in a critical spot, the North Bend school  superintendent transformed the entire school, really one of the newer  buildings, into a center of gravity for emergency operations. Though  school was canceled, it didn't mean the kids weren't busy. Initially  they sandbagged, then they began to volunteer for days on end with the  cleanup effort.   The people of North Bend organized themselves, and word spread. Goods  poured in from all over the country. And as the superintendent told me,  he said that what was happening there could make a good country song,  they would have so much more appreciation for Nebraska.   Areas south of the town of Columbus, a little bit further to the west  also were particularly hard hit with very large and mounting ag losses,  the most visible sign of which were dead cattle. In fact, this past  Saturday I went to a high school fundraiser in Columbus, and along  Highway 81 the speed signs were still bent over with grass attached to  them showing the magnitude and the volume of water that rushed over  that area.  [[Page H3189]]    There is a truck stop there named T-Bone, Madam Speaker. It greets  passersby with two enormous cowboy boots on poles embedded in concrete.  One was found 300 yards away at Matulka's garage. The other one was  across the highway about a half mile away. They will probably be put  back up to greet passersby once again. By the time I got there, the 4  feet of mud and water had receded, and a lot had been cleaned up.   I looked at Fred, and I said: How did this happen?   He said:         At T-Bone's, we don't mess around. We are Nebraskans. We       get it done.    On a more positive note, Madam Speaker, a Federal project initiated  after the last flood of 2011 saved the little town of Schuyler,  Nebraska, and a couple of other things positively have happened.  Nebraska's congressional delegation asked for expedited federal  disaster assistance, and the President granted it.                                time  1745    Even in the midst of this trauma, Nebraskans found a way to get a few  laughs. Along the fence across from that truck stop of T-Bone's, there  was a hand-painted sign that said, ``Mud Wrestling Tomorrow.''   Back at Offutt Air Force Base, it is a pretty jarring scene when you  see a large fuel tank lifted up and turned on its side. It shows you  the powerful force of this water.   As many of the Members of Congress who have experienced this have had  the same outpouring of support from family and friends around the  country, I want to tell you just a quick few things that happened to  me.   A nun from Rome wrote to me and offered her prayers. A Congressman  from another area of the country texted me and said: ``I'll send my  staff. Whatever you need.'' The Jordanian Ambassador to the United  States contacted me with her concerns.   Madam Speaker, as you and I have seen firsthand, a natural disaster  can create certain blessings in disguise. It is a time when we can come  together and put aside any political differences and lend a helping  hand to our fellow citizens.   I think that is exactly what America wants Congress to do right now:  put our differences aside, find consensus, quickly pass a supplemental  to simply help my constituents and the others who have been so  devastated by these unpredictable, unforeseen events. Many have waited  and waited, and I think this is the time.
