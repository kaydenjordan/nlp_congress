 Mr. President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today I am pleased to honor Trinity at City Beach in Sandpoint as the  Idaho Small Business of the Month for September 2020 and recognize them  for their efforts to reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus.   Established by Justin Dick, Trinity moved to its City Beach location  in 2009 and has been an integral part of the Sandpoint community for  more than a decade. Named after the holy trinity of peppers, onions,  and celery found in traditional Creole cooking,  [[Page S5648]]  Trinity attracts tourists and locals alike and has developed a  reputation for its quality food, service, and views of Lake Pend  Oreille. In addition to serving quality southern cuisine, the  restaurant also provides dozens of local jobs and enhances the cultural  richness of Northern Idaho through their day-to-day service and steady  participation in community events.   In recent months, Trinity at City Beach has done their part to reduce  the spread of COVID-19, offering carryout and dine-in eating to the  Sandpoint community while safely maintaining CDC social distancing and  face covering guidelines. Additionally, Dick and his team have raised  money and collected food to be donated to nonprofit organizations and  healthcare centers in the Sandpoint area to help ease the burden on  frontline workers.   Congratulations to Justin Dick and all of the employees of Trinity at  City Beach on being selected as the Idaho Small Business of the Month  for September 2020. You make our great State proud, and I look forward  to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
