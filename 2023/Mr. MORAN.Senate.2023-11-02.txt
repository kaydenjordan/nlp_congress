 Mr. President, today I want to recognize a Kansan  who will be celebrating his 100th birthday this month, a man who has  served others throughout his entire lifetime: Robert Watson of Overland  Park, KS.   Robert came of age during the Great Depression and went to work at a  young age. His work ethic and dedication were evident early on, and at  the age of 12, he earned the nickname ``Rapid Robert.'' During World  War II, Robert was deployed to Germany and served as a second  lieutenant in the Army. As an officer in the Army, he attended the  Nuremburg Trials, but his experiences in Europe didn't end there.  Robert was conveniently just the right height and weight for the  Italian Olympic bobsled team, and while visiting Switzerland after the  war, he trained with the team.   When he was finally back in the U.S., Robert was recruited from the  Army by Southwestern Bell to help write the first manual for the home  telephone in New York City. After working for Southwestern Bell, he  moved back to Kansas to start a printing press company. Like so many  World War II veterans, Robert's service didn't end after his time in  the military. His service to others only deepened during his time in  Kansas, serving as a pastor at Community Covenant Church in Lenexa for  35 years and as a church organist for 60 years. Even amidst his busy  life, Robert found time to compete in the Senior Olympics in Kansas,  earning a gold and silver medal in tennis and another gold in golf. In  between his achievements and accomplishments, of which there are  plenty, Robert also takes time to travel to nursing homes in Kansas,  playing his piano to brighten the day for many seniors. His selfless  service to others continues still and has blessed many people.   Members of the Greatest Generation likely didn't realize the full  magnitude of their sacrifices or the history they were witnessing  firsthand. They simply went about life with a work ethic second to  none. This describes Robert; he went where he was needed, made an  impact in the lives of others, and set a remarkable example for many.   Mr. Watson, our country is grateful for you and your service to  others. You have made our Nation, the State of Kansas, and your  community proud. You are a dedicated father, grandfather and great- grandfather; and your family loves you dearly. Your grandson Tom, who  shares your work ethic when serving Kansans daily through my office, is  proud of you too. May your special day be filled with joy as you are  surrounded by family and friends. Congratulations on this incredible  milestone. Happy birthday.                            ____________________
