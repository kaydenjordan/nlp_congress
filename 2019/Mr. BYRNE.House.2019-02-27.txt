 Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this bill. Let's  be very clear on this: H.R. 8 will not prevent criminals from getting  their hands on firearms. What H.R. 8 will do is violate the  constitutional rights of millions of Americans.   Under this bill, almost every time a lawful gun owner wants to  transfer or sell a gun, he or she will have to go through a government- sanctioned intermediary. Under this bill, no longer could I let my  cousin or my neighbor borrow my gun. If this bill becomes law,  overnight, millions of law-abiding gun owners could suddenly be subject  to Federal prosecution. Of course, we all know that criminals are going  to do what they already do: make illegal transfers of firearms.   We have heard a lot about how this is going to be the most open  Congress in history. Well, Mr. Chair, I filed an amendment that would  strip out the text of H.R. 8 and replace it with a nationwide concealed  carry reciprocity. Mr. Chair, the Democratic leadership blocked a vote  on my amendment. What are they so afraid of? I guess they think they  can shield their Members from votes to protect the Second Amendment and  benefit our Nation's law-abiding gun owners.   Mr. Chair, I have news for the majority. Gun owners of America are  watching this debate. They know what H.R. 8 is all about, and they know  that this is just a sham to chip away at the Second Amendment and our  Constitution.   I will oppose this bill and any bill that goes against the Second  Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans. I urge my colleagues to join  me in voting ``no'' and fighting against this assault on the Second  Amendment.
