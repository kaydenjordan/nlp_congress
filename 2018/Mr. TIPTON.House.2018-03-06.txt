 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for this time to be  able to speak to an important piece of legislation.   In my home State of Colorado, we have a tale of two economies. The  urban areas have realized economic recovery since 2008, while the more  rural communities have been slower to find sustained economic growth.  Essential to these areas and their ability to be able to recover, a  topic that I speak frequently on, is access to credit.   As Treasury's report to the President in June of 2017 notes:  Regulations on capital, liquidity, and leverage requirements, as well  as regulatory parameters that guide loan underwriting, have undermined  the ability of financial institutions to deliver attractively priced  credit in sufficient quantity to meet the needs of the economy.                                time  1300    In other words, our community financial institutions have lost access  to the tools that they need to be able to help their communities  recover as they have struggled to comply with regulations intended for  the largest institutions. Mr. Speaker, it is our local communities, our  small businesses, our first-time home buyers, and our working families  who suffer the consequences from these regulations.   Mr. Speaker, let me give you one example of what unbridled regulation  does and how it impacts families trying to be able to live that  American Dream.   I have an example of a credit union in my home State of Colorado that  had to stop offering home equity lines of credit to its members because  the cost of keeping the forms in compliance with Federal regulation  exceeded the income generated by the program. In other words,  regulation priced this credit union out of a critical market and at a  time when the rural environment the credit union serves needed access  to credit most.   Fortunately, Mr. Loudermilk's legislation being considered here today  will take important steps to require regulators to consider the  institution's size and risk profile as they evaluate the necessity and  effectiveness of regulatory rulemaking under the self-review mandated  to them by the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act.  Importantly, Mr. Loudermilk's legislation will also expand the EGRPRA  process to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the National  Credit Union Administration, encouraging the tailoring of regulations  across the regulatory spectrum.   This legislation takes steps to encourage regulators to allow small  institutions adequate leeway to exercise reasonably constructed  consumer lending regimes to make sure consumers have the broadest array  of choices and that institutions can appropriately navigate the  compliance landscape.   Mr. Speaker, by requiring regulators to more frequently review and  tailor regulations, this bill will help put Main Street back on the  path to prosperity and help to end the tale of two economies in  Colorado and throughout the Nation. Making these adjustments will help  community banks and credit unions once again be able to meet the needs  of their neighbors and encourage our businesses to be able to grow.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
