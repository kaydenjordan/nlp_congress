 Mr. Speaker, I know the damage that guns can cause  firsthand. When I was 16, an accidental gunshot severed my spinal cord  and left me paralyzed.   And yet, the damage caused by that gun pales in comparison to the  destruction caused by assault weapons, whose sole purpose is to inflict  maximum damage on their targets.   No one needs an assault weapon to go deer hunting.   No one needs an assault weapon to defend their home.   These weapons of war simply have no place on our streets.   After all, it is no coincidence that assault weapons were the firearm  of choice for the killers in Uvalde, Buffalo, Pittsburgh, Parkland,  Orlando, Sandy Hook, and the list goes on.   I ask my colleagues, does this body have the courage to stop the next  massacre from taking place?   Or will we shirk from our responsibilities and our duty to act,  content to simply offer thoughts and prayers while Americans, and even  small children, are mowed down in our schools, grocery stores, and  places of worship?   I know which side I am on. I hope my colleagues will join me.   I thank Congressman Cicilline for his steadfast work on bringing this  legislation to the floor.
