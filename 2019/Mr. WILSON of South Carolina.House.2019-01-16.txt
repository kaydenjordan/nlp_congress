 Madam Speaker, South Carolinians are  celebrating the life and achievements of Moffatt Burriss, Sr., who  passed away last week at the age of 99.   He should always be remembered for his valiant service in the Army,  liberating Europe during World War II. This was chronicled in his  autobiography, ``Strike and Hold.'' His heroism led to the capture of  the Nijmegen bridge in the Netherlands. It is the basis of the movie,  ``A Bridge Too Far.''   Upon his return, he established an extraordinary family, business  success, and, as the first State house caucus leader, was a pioneer in  developing the modern Republican majority in South Carolina.   My wife, Roxanne, and I offer our deepest sympathy to the Burriss  family.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
