 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lee). She has been such a champion on progressive issues for so  long. Barbara Lee still speaks for me across the country.    Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor to yield to the  distinguished gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), who has also  been a leader in the Progressive Caucus on so many issues, from the  death penalty to immigration to healthcare.    Again, I am very pleased as the Congressional  Progressive Caucus to be able host a Special Order every week. We pick  a different topic every week, for those of you that are just beginning  to listen. This week we want to focus attention on what we believe are  some of the most serious and pressing issues facing our country today  around the Trump administration's ties to Russia, around the firing of  James Comey, and the many, many issues that have come forward over the  last several months, but certainly in the last week.   Since last Tuesday, we have borne witness to a slew of alarming  events within the White House and the Department of Justice. Last  Tuesday afternoon, we received word that the President had fired FBI  Director James Comey from his position.   That position, by the way, is a 10-year term. Congress designated it  as a 10-year term specifically to ensure that we could protect any  administration and the entire country against any conflict of interest  that may come up. Obviously, that did not convince the President that  he should keep Director Comey.   So we heard that he fired him. It seems as if each morning we wake up  to a barrage of firings, tweets, or untruths that continue to erode the  public's confidence in our democracy.   So what do we know today? Certainly, we don't know enough, but we do  know that the President fired Director Comey under the guise of being  unsatisfied with how he handled Secretary Hillary Clinton's email  investigation.                                time  1745    But if that were the case, then why didn't he fire him months ago?  Why now? Why did he choose to meet with Russian officials the day after  firing Mr. Comey?   Mr. Trump's attempts to use Clinton's emails to divert attention from  Comey's investigation into the campaign's ties to Russia are,  unfortunately, very disingenuous, and I think that they are proving to  be unsuccessful.   Despite his claims that Mr. Comey was not investigating him, the  President must have been concerned about what Director Comey would find  because the firing, interestingly, came just days after Director Comey  had requested additional resources for the investigation.   White House officials attempted at first to say that the blame for  the firing was Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's fault. They  said it was at his recommendation. Attorney General Jeff Sessions  weighed in on that decision as well. But, in fact, shortly after, the  President went on television and said that, no, this was his decision  regardless of what had been proposed, this is where he was going to be.   On Wednesday, just 1 day after firing then-Director Comey, the  President welcomed the Russian foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov; and the  Russian Ambassador, Sergey Kislyak, into the Oval Office for a closed  press meeting. Let's not forget that Kislyak met with former National  Security Advisor Michael Flynn during the campaign, a meeting that  Flynn then lied about. I think this is very important because there  were a number of Trump administration or Trump campaign officials that  met with Russian officials over the course of many months before the  election.   Those meetings in and of themselves are not a problem. The problem,  however, is that these individuals continued to lie about those  meetings, and that makes you wonder: What fire is there where the smoke  is? Why would they lie about these things?   We certainly don't know that. We have been unable to get the  transcripts of that conversation because the President has not been  willing to release them.   Russian President Vladimir Putin is more willing to make that  information public than our own President, but I find it outrageous  that President Putin would actually propose to be sort of the backup of  this information for the President. We are not looking to President  Putin to provide corroboration of these meetings. We actually need an  independent ability to look at the facts of this case.   On Monday, the news exploded with reports that the President released  highly classified information to Lavrov and Kislyak during their  discussion at the White House. This is extremely alarming. It is true  that the President has the right to declassify any information, but the  information that was shared was so sensitive that the United States had  not even shared it with our allies. The President's decision to divulge  that information to foreign officials--particularly Russian officials  with whom our relationship is contentious at best--is dangerous and  reckless.   There is no doubt in my mind that this will hinder our ability to  build international coalitions to actually be able to share information  with allies who provide that classified information to us with the  understanding that we are going to protect that and guard that. Should  any classified information then be declassified for some reason, it is  done in consultation with the country that provided that information  and with national security advisors. None of that happened in this  situation.   President Trump also tweeted during the campaign that Hillary Clinton  and her team were extremely careless in their handling of very  sensitive and highly classified information. So this seems like a  particular irony. The President claimed that Hillary Clinton's lack of  ability to handle classified information actually made her unfit to be  President.   Speaker Paul Ryan said this: ``It is simple: Individuals who are  `extremely careless' with classified information should be denied  further access to it.''   Reince Priebus, Trump's Chief of Staff, took it one step further,  saying: ``Those who mishandled classified info have had their sec  clearances revoked, lost their jobs, faced fines, and even been sent to  prison.''   So this is a situation that we have to take extremely seriously.   Before we could even fully engage and vet that news, however, reports  then came out that President Trump had actually asked FBI Director  James  [[Page H4351]]  Comey to drop the investigation into Michael Flynn. According to  sources close to Comey, this request came just 1 day after Michael  Flynn was fired. This is truly a new low. If this is true--and we are  trying to get to the bottom of this--it would absolutely constitute an  obstruction of justice. The President has put obstacle after obstacle  in the way of any real investigation that gives us the information that  we need to protect our national security and the American people.   In the 118 days since the Trump Presidency began, it has been scandal  after scandal. The latest events have escalated this crisis to an even  higher level. As I mentioned, the FBI Director serves a 10-year term  specifically in order to be able to carry out these independent  investigations free of partisanship or political pressure. The firing  of James Comey and the fact that he was asked by the President for  loyalty--again, this is apparently in Director Comey's memo, which we  hope to be able to see--and to abandon the investigation against  Michael Flynn are extremely serious offenses. They hurt our democracy  and they hurt our country.   The President has tried to distract us time and time again, but we  actually know that the American people deserve better. History smiles  kindly on those who stand up and put country over party and on those  who ensure that in the darkest of times and the most difficult of  times, the times when we face a constitutional crisis, where our Nation  wonders what direction we are going in, the times when we know that the  need to preserve the institutions of democracy and justice are most  necessary, those are the times when we need people to speak out on both  sides of the aisle for the facts, for the truth, and for democracy.    This should not be a partisan issue. We are seeing that starting to  emerge from our colleagues across the aisle. I commend those  Republicans who have begun to ask for information, documents, and  hearings; and I hope that more of my colleagues will join us in the  pursuit of truth and in the pursuit of justice.   Last night we received news that Robert Mueller, who is the former  FBI Director, has been appointed as special counsel for the  investigation into the Trump campaign's ties with Russia. This is an  extremely distinguished man. He has served the country with tremendous  success and loyalty, and we are hopeful that Mr. Mueller will  diligently investigate the allegations against Michael Flynn and other  members of the Trump campaign with veracity and free from political  influence. However, we still maintain that an independent commission is  necessary because a special counsel answers to the Attorney General,  who can then overrule decisions that they make or even fire them at any  time. So the appointment of Robert Mueller is a good first step, but it  cannot be the last.   Director Mueller will still be in the chain of command under the  Trump-appointed leadership of the Justice Department. He cannot take  the place of a truly independent outside commission that is free from  Trump's meddling.   I think that is why it is so important that we all join in signing  the discharge petition that was introduced yesterday by my colleagues,  Representative Swalwell and Representative Cummings, who is the ranking  member on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. This discharge  petition would essentially allow for a bill to move forward that would  establish an independent commission that we could truly trust to seek  justice. The commission would interview witnesses, would obtain  documents, would issue subpoenas, and would receive public testimony in  order to examine whether or not the Russian Government did, in fact,  interfere with U.S. elections and how they carried that out.   This is a really crucial step to take because it is not only about  the short term and the immediacy of what is in front of us--extremely  important, the commission would deal with that as well--but it is also  about how do we ensure that these things don't happen again? What did  happen, first of all, and how do we make sure that we continue to  protect our democracy in the face of what 17 independent intelligence  agencies said, which is that the Russians hacked our election in the  United States?   There is a lot we need to understand. We need the special counsel,  but we also need this independent citizen commission not made up of  Members of Congress, but appointed by the House and the Senate leaders  of both parties in equal numbers so that we could actually have people  who look at this from the perspective of all of America and not tainted  by even the vestiges or the appearance of party.   Apparently when President Trump heard that special counsel had been  named, he laughed out loud, saying that this is ``the greatest witch  hunt of a politician in American history.''   No, Mr. President, we are seeking the truth. As the American people  have shown us, they are not backing down, and we will continue to fight  for this truth.   Now, in that vein, I also wanted to mention that my colleague,  Representative Raskin, and I actually introduced a package of bills  that we are calling the Trump transparency package. It is because we  really believe that the American people deserve better. We believe that  the American people deserve from us transparency. So what this package  will do is, first, it will clearly forbid government officials from  accepting anything of value from foreign governments in exchange for an  official act. It would prohibit government employees from using their  positions to further the financial interests of the President. It would  ensure that the President's press pool continues to exist so that the  American people receive honest answers, and it would require the  President and his family to publicly report any foreign business deals  that exceed $10,000.   These are simple steps. They are not egregious and they are not  outrageous. They would apply to anyone. They are not partisan. They are  about transparency and accountability so that we know that the  President of the United States and that others in government are  actually accountable to the American people--not to their financial  interests, not to their bank accounts, not to their stock portfolios,  not to their hotels and golf courses, but to the American people. We  have to hold every administration--and certainly this one--accountable.  So now, more than ever, it is our moral duty to defend the  Constitution, and this bill package goes a step in the right direction.   So I hope that all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle would  actually cosponsor the Trump transparency package with us so that we  can continue to fight for the American people, for democracy, and for  the notion that America is willing to question itself and for the  notion that America is willing to always put our hands on that moral  arc of the universe to push it more quickly towards justice.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
