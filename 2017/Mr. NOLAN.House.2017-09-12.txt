 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Congressional Lung  Cancer Caucus, I want to first express my appreciation for allowing my  amendment to be made here in order and for the work of the committee.   Make no mistake, these extra funds that are in my measure, the $3.8  million for cancer research at the National Cancer Institute, are  urging that it be spent on lung cancer, in particular. Those extra  funds will make an enormous difference in battling lung cancer, which  is, as you all know, the most deadly of all the cancers.                                time  1815    As many of you know, my daughter, Katherine, was diagnosed with stage  IV nonsmoking small cell lung cancer almost 2 years ago. Thanks to  medical research and the daily prayers of so many of my colleagues here  in the House, Katherine is still with us.   But like so many thousands of others, she is still courageously and  desperately fighting for her future. We can provide those people with  some real hope and support for their determination through additional  research dollars that are so desperately needed.   As you know--or may not know--we have made little or no progress in  the last 20 years in combating lung cancer. There is still a survival  rate of something less than 1 or 2 percent.   But make no mistake, the money that this committee and this Congress  and this House has provided for research not just in cancer, but many  of the other fields, has played a critically important role in  increasing our life expectancies--played the lead role in increasing  our life expectancies in this country. In my grandfather's time it was  47, and now it is almost 80.   But one of the areas where we just haven't been able to make any  progress at all is in lung cancer research. Mr. Chairman, I urge my  colleagues to support this modest request for a modest amount of money  to be added to helping us make some progress in lung cancer research in  the way that we have done for so many other forms of the disease.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I express my thanks and gratitude, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
