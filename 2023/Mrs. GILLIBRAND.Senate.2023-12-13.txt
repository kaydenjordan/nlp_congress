 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to display  photos of Ranae Butler's family.    Mr. President, as Jewish families across the country  celebrate the last night of Hanukkah tomorrow, too many of their loved  ones will not be there to join them. Dozens of American citizens were  murdered by Hamas during the brutal October 7 massacre, and several  remain hostages in Gaza.   It is critical that we continue to tell their stories.   I recently met with Ranae Butler, who lost six family members,  including at least five U.S. citizens on October 7. She told me how her  mother, Carol Siman Tov, and her mother's dog Charlie were both shot in  the head execution-style.   Ranae's brother, Johnny Siman Tov, began texting with his sister when  the attack began. As the terrorists set fire to the family's house,  Johnny's final message read:         They're here. They're burning us. We're suffocating.    Johnny and his wife Tamar were both shot through the window of their  safe room. Their three young children--Arbel, Shachar, and Omer--were  all killed. They were found with black foam in their mouths.   I have also worked with the family of 70-year-old Judih Weinstein and  her husband, Gad Haggai. On October 7, the couple were walking in their  kibbutz when the terrorists attacked. The family says they know both of  them were shot, and that their phones were geolocated in Gaza. Based on  a subsequent video of Gad's body, they worry he was killed. But as his  death has not yet announced in Israel, they are still holding out hope  that he might be alive.   Judih is believed to be the last older woman still held hostage by  Hamas, but her family has heard nothing about her whereabouts ever  since she disappeared. They don't know if she is alive or dead. They  don't know what became of Gad. They don't know if they are suffering or  if they will ever see them again.   The uncertainty is agonizing and nearly impossible to bear, but it is  a feeling that is shared by many American families whose loved ones are  still hostages.   They include: Omer Neutra, a 22-year-old from Long Island; Itay Chen,  a 19-year-old who was born in New York City; Edan Alexander, a 19-year- old from New Jersey; Sagui Dekel-Chen, a 35-year-old father and son to  a former Brooklyn resident; Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a 23-year-old who was  born in Berkeley, CA; Keith Siegel, a 64-year-old North Carolina  native.   All of these people are American citizens. They were born in our  communities, educated in our schools. They are teens, parents, and  grandparents; husbands, sons, and mothers.   We owe it to our families--we owe it to all their families--to never  give up hope. We must do everything we can do to bring them home.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
