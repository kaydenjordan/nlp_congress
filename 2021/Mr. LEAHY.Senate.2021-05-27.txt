 Mr. President, today, in a bipartisan vote, the Senate  advanced important legislation to increase our Nation's competitiveness  with China. The United States Innovation and Competition Act, USICA, of  2021 is significant legislation and an example of what process and  debate can yield in the U.S. Senate.   This legislative package is the end result of the bipartisan work of  from  [[Page S3877]]  multiple Senate committees and reflects the urgency of addressing the  challenges faced by domestic manufacturers and American researchers in  our global competition with China. This includes an emergency  appropriation of $54 billion in funding for grants to make  semiconductor chips here in America and for the continuation of chip  production in Essex, VT. The package also allocates $1.5 billion in  funding for implementation and domestic research and development, R&D  of 5G technology to ensure that the United States drives the  modernization of its own communications infrastructure.   The bill significantly raises authorization levels by almost $120  billion over 5 years for the National Science Foundation, NSF, the  National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, the Department of  Commerce, and the Department of Energy, DOE. These historic investments  in American ingenuity will help strengthen our country's R&D  capabilities, regional economic development opportunities,  manufacturing capacity, and supply chain resiliency.   Through the creation of a new Directorate of Technology and  Innovation at the NSF, the Federal Government will be able to better  support research and technology development in key focus areas, such as  the growing artificial intelligence space and quantum science. Among  other activities, the Directorate will help fund R&D at collaborative  institutes, establish technology testbeds, and award scholarships and  fellowships to build a workforce equipped to lead us through the 21st  century and beyond.   Throughout the process, I was encouraged to see a strong focus on the  need to continue to increase education, research, and workforce  opportunities in rural and underserved areas throughout the country.  The regional technology hub program at the Commerce Department  established in this bill will benefit rural communities in Vermont and  across the country. These hubs, of which there will be three per EDA  region, will carry out workforce development activities and business  and entrepreneur development activities, among other important  activities. I appreciate the work done by fellow Members in the Senate  to ensure that these hubs truly and accurately represent the  significant economic needs of rural areas in this country.   The inclusion of increased supplementary funding for research at  universities that participate in the Established Program to Stimulate  Competitive Research, EPSCoR, takes important steps to build our  Nation's capacity in the science, technology, engineering, and  mathematics, STEM, field. This funding will also help reduce the  geographic concentration of research and development and education  opportunities across the country. For far too long, Americans have had  to leave their hometowns and even their home States to get an education  and find work. This bill will give rural residents more reasons to stay  close to home and help their communities grow from the ground up. I  have seen the incredible work that has already been done by the  University of Vermont's participation in EPSCoR and am excited to see  what is to come from this substantial investment.   This serious legislative package shows what can be done when we all  work together in the Senate. Thanks to these efforts, we will be able  to secure America's role as a global leader in technology, R&D, and  manufacturing. I hope the House of Representatives will soon consider  this legislation so President Biden can sign this historic initiative  into law.    Mr. President, as the Senate prepares to vote on the U.S.  Innovation and Competition Act, I wanted to take moment to highlight  the support this bill provides to the U.S. semiconductor industry. I  want to commend the leadership that Senators Warner, Cornyn, and  Schumer have shown in highlighting the need for our country to ensure  that we maintain leading edge manufacture capabilities in the United  States. I strongly support the over $50 billion provided in this bill  for the Department of Commerce to join in partnerships with U.S.  semiconductor companies.   My history with microelectronics spans my career in the Senate, and I  can remember when Tom Watson selected Essex Junction as the location  for an IBM fab to produce some of the first generations of mass  produced integrated circuit memory and processing chips. Of course, it  revolutionized computing. Over the years, Vermonters working out of  Essex led the way in inventing new kinds of chips and new ways to make  chips, at the same time making Vermont the State with the most patents  per capita.   Over that time, I heard again and again from national security  leaders from both political parties that one of the biggest threats  facing the United States was that our revolutionary technology was  threatened by the production of chips increasingly moving to foreign  countries. While some of those countries closely cooperate with the  United States, being offshore provides an inherent risk of the chips  being compromised by malicious actors or even facilities themselves  being rendered inoperable, one way or another.   I helped create a program called Trusted Foundry within the  Department of Defense to provide critical chips for national security  needs that we knew were untampered with from start to finish and were  made right in the United States. Because the national security needs  alone could never be produced at an economically practical scale, we  located Trusted Foundry in commercial fabs, including the one in Essex.  Today that factory still produces both commercial and national security  chips, particularly chips used for radio frequency or RF functions.   With this bill, we continue the endeavor to produce chips in the  United States at a commercially viable level. We hope that the  production can supply our national security needs, by geographically  keeping production domestic, thereby increasing our confidence that the  chips have not been tampered with.   Through the Appropriations Committee, I will continue oversight of  this important area. We will ensure that these grants are administered  well and build toward a better future. And we will ensure they are part  of a whole-of-government effort, including contributions from the  Department of Defense and other Agencies from their own authorizations  and budgets. Thanks to this bill, I look forward to a brighter, and  more technologically capable future.                              AMENDMENT no. 1813     Mr. President, the Budget Control Act of 2011 expires this  year, and that is a good thing.   This law led to a decade of underfunding our domestic priorities,  from which it will take years to recover. Right now, in communities  across the country, our infrastructure is crumbling, millions of  Americans cannot access Federal programs for which they qualify, and we  are falling behind in investing in science, research, and development  on the global economic stage--all of this because the Budget Control  Act set artificial and unrealistically low caps on discretionary  spending, and it inflicted arbitrary, across-the-board spending cuts  known as sequestration.   President Biden understands the real consequences of this decade-old  decision. That is why tomorrow, President Biden will propose a 16- percent increase for nondefense investments in his budget. We cannot  build back better until we recover the ground we have already lost.   I want to give a few examples of what I mean. For many low-income  families with young children, the beginning of summer means the end of  school breakfast and lunch programs and waking up every morning  dreading how you will be able to put food on the table for your  children. Basic nutrition is a basic requirement for child health,  development, and education.   The Summer EBT program is meant to help these families bridge to this  gap, with an extra $30 or $60 per child every month. This is a program  that has proven itself successful, reducing the number of households  with food-insecure children from 43 percent to just under 35 percent.  But because of the Budget Control Act, this program has been flat- funded. We could not expand upon its success. And today, only 16  percent of children who need access to USDA food programs have that  access.   This problem of underinvestment in successful, worthwhile programs is  true across our appropriations bills.   Our country, which has led in some of the greatest scientific  discoveries of the last century, ranks 24th out of 36 developed nations  for investments in university research and development as a share of  GDP.   We once accounted for 69 percent of global research and development  expenditures but have fallen to just under 30 percent. China now  accounts for 23.9 percent of global research and development spending,  and growing.   How did this happen? One analysis by the American Association for the  Advancement of Science directly attributes $200 billion in lost Federal  research and development investments to the Budget Control Act. The  National Science Foundation alone has lost $2 billion a year, which  could support more than 5,500 grants and 65,000 scientists,  technicians, and students.   We cannot lead in a rapidly evolving technological landscape unless  we are investing in science and our scientists.   Failing to do so only cedes the next great discovery to China at the  cost of innovation here in the United States. As chair of the  Appropriations Committee, I am committed to fighting for the  investments in American science, research, medical progress, and  technological development that our great Nation needs and deserves.   There has been a lot of talk in this Chamber about the need for a  major infrastructure package to repair our Nation's crumbling bridges  and roads, and I support addressing that need. But there is a reason  why our roads are in disrepair, forcing the American people to spend  nearly $130 billion each year on vehicle repairs and operating costs.  There is a reason why our drinking water systems lose the equivalent of  9,000 Olympic-size swimming pools of water every day. And there is a  reason why one in five children lacks the high-speed internet  connections they need to learn and participate in school.   That reason is a decade of budget caps that artificially constrained  our ability to address these issues before they became the national  limitation and embarrassment that they are today.   Now there is a $44 billion backlog in airport improvement projects,  $35 billion in deferred maintenance for public housing, and $472.6  billion in urgently needed funds to maintain and improve the Nation's  drinking water infrastructure.   Over the last decade, we have lost ground in education, childcare,  environmental protections, and affordable housing. The Budget Control  Act did not constrain our national debt; it left us as a nation in  disrepair.   Joe Biden understands this, and I commend him for taking the bold  action to address this in the budget he will release tomorrow. As  chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I look forward to  working with the President, his administration, and my dear friend Vice  Chairman Shelby on passing responsible appropriations bills that  address the damage caused by the Budget Control Act.   The end of the Budget Control Act gives us the opportunity to invest  in our communities. Tomorrow, Congress will receive the President's  budget. The full Appropriations Committee has already held hearings on  the need to invest in our infrastructure and on the threat of domestic  violent extremism, and in June, we will hold hearings on global  leadership and national security. In June, our subcommittees will hold  numerous hearings to scrutinize the President's budget.   When Congress returns in early June, it is essential that Congress,  on a bipartisan and bicameral basis, work with the President to  negotiate budget toplines so that we can commence the appropriations  process for the fiscal year that begins October 1. As President Biden  has said, we can, should, and need to build back better.                            ____________________     Mr. President, there is no State in America more  beautiful than Vermont, but along with its jaw-dropping beauty, Vermont  is home to some of the finest, most active and engaged citizens who  make it such a special place.   Theresa Alberghini DiPalma is one of those people. Theresa recently  let it be known that she will be leaving her senior position at the  University of Vermont Health Network.   I have known Theresa and her late parents for more than 30 years.  Theresa's parents were both public school teachers. They raised five  children in Burlington, including Theresa. Her father Roy saw Active  Duty as a lead navigator on bombers in the European theater in World  War II. Her mother Connie was also a pillar of the community. She  taught Spanish, and she was an accomplished musician and extraordinary  cook.   Theresa grew up in Burlington, the youngest of those five kids and  the only girl. After college, she started in my Washington office  answering phones. She steadily climbed the professional ladder to be  both my top healthcare adviser and then my legislative director.   For as long as I have been in the Senate, I have talked about the  challenge of keeping, maintaining, and attracting young Vermonters to  our State. More than 20 years ago, Theresa did just that. In the mid- nineties, Theresa returned to Vermont to be closer to family and to  serve as Vermont's chief healthcare regulator.   After leaving government service, Theresa joined the University of  Vermont College of Medicine in 2000, serving as assistant dean for  external relations. In 2002, she was called to serve--first on a  temporary basis and then permanently--at then-Fletcher Allen Health  Care during a time of great challenge.   Theresa joined a dedicated team, led by Ed Colodny, which worked  tirelessly to restore public trust in our State's academic medical  center.   Theresa is a now a senior vice president for external relations at  the University of Vermont Health Network, where she and her colleagues  support and lead an integrated healthcare delivery system in Vermont  and New York, dedicated to ensuring that the more than 1 million people  in the region have access to the care they need, close to home.   Theresa's commitment to the well-being of our communities is  boundless. She has served on several boards, including Mercy  Connections, the United Way of Northwest Vermont, the Lake Champlain  Chamber, the Vermont Chamber of Commerce, VELCO, VGS, Vermont Business  Roundtable, the  [[Page S3879]]  Governor's Council of Economic Advisors, and Governor Scott's  Government Modernization and Efficiency Team, among others.   She is deeply committed to the professional advancement of women in  our area and routinely mentors young professionals.   She and her husband Robert reside in Burlington. Marcelle and I think  of their home on Maple Street as our second home. While I know one  incredible chapter is closing for Theresa, I also know that she hasn't  lost her passion for making Vermont a better place. I so look forward  to seeing what is ahead.                            ____________________
