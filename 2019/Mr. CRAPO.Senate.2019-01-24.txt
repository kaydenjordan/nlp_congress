 Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator  James E. Risch, Representative Mike Simpson, and Representative Russ  Fulcher, I congratulate Edmund O. Schweitzer III, Ph.D., on his  induction into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.   The National Inventors Hall of Fame selected Dr. Schweitzer for this  honor in recognition of him bringing ``the first microprocessor-based  digital protective relay to market, revolutionizing the performance of  electric power systems with computer-based protection and control  equipment, and making a major impact in the electric power utility  industry.'' Dr. Schweitzer has received many recognitions for his  contributions to the development of digital protection and electric  power systems worldwide. He is an Institute of Electrical and  Electronics Engineers, IEEE, Fellow, who was honored with IEEE's Medal  in Power Engineering in 2012. In 1982, he founded Schweitzer  Engineering Laboratories, Inc., SEL, to develop and manufacture digital  protective relays and related products and services.   Characterizing Dr. Schweitzer as creative and inventive is an  understatement. This month, he will receive his 200th patent pertaining  to electric power system protection, metering, monitoring, and control.  He turns his ideas into practical tools that meet the demands of our  ever-changing and modernizing society. By protecting power grids, the  technology he has developed and disseminated is helping to ensure that  Americans and people around the world can access needed safe, more  reliable, and more economical electric power to live and fuel growth.   Congratulations, Dr. Schweitzer, on this recognition, and thank you  for lending your talents, ideas and know-how to furthering our  communities and Nation.                            ____________________
