 Madam Speaker, I rise today to highlight the success of  Governor Jim Pillen in Nebraska to help reduce property and income  taxes while expanding educational opportunities across our State.   Less than a year ago, Governor Pillen took office as Nebraska  experienced historic levels of tax revenue. His first budget poured  billions of dollars into property tax relief, helping alleviate  Nebraska's high property taxes.   He cut income taxes and sped up the total repeal of Social Security  taxes. He also increased the amount of funding the State provides for  special education and created an education future fund which committed  $1 billion to help Nebraska's schools.   Along the way, he made history by bringing school choice to Nebraska  by establishing a scholarship tax credit to help families access more  educational opportunities.   This is really just a snapshot of what Governor Pillen had  accomplished in less than 12 months, and there is more to come.   Madam Speaker, I congratulate Governor Pillen on his great work.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S.J. Res. 32 providing  congressional disapproval of the CFPB's Small Business Collection Rule.   I am a businessman myself, and I am proud to say that I have made a  payroll every 2 weeks since I was 24 years old.   I will tell you what happens in a situation like this. I am also a  borrower. I am a borrower of small community banks across the State of  Nebraska.   If you pass something like this, if you go from 7 statutory data  points to 81 data points, I am going to have to pay an accountant to  sit down and sift through all of our business data to put this together  for my bank, my lender, and hope that I get it right so that on the  next bank exam, they are not calling me wanting a whole bunch more  information.   That is the real cost to small business. That is the real cost to  businesses in this Nation. That is what people in this town forget. It  is small businesses. It is small-town employers that make this country  run, that make the money work, so that people can wake up and have cash  in their pocket.    I will say this: If you go from 7 points to 81 points, this is just  another example where the CFPB has expanded the scope of the rule as  far as possible.
