 Madam Speaker, I come to the well of the House  today to call on my colleagues to support the PFAS Action Act. This  bill, like so many that have come to the floor under Democratic  leadership, is about taking action for the people; in this case,  ensuring access to clean and safe water.   PFAS, so-called forever chemicals that have leached into water  supplies for decades, are hazardous to human health. Their presence is  linked with reduced kidney function, reduced immune system function,  and increased risk for diseases like diabetes and cancer.   These chemicals are in our water because of corporate negligence, and  like in many other cases, our working families trying to make ends meet  are hit the hardest. That is why it is critical that Congress step up  and take action, and that is why this legislation is so important and  what it is about.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stand up for the people and  vote for the PFAS Action Act.                            ____________________
