 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  extraordinary life and legacy of the late Coach Otis Washington.   A native of Selma, Alabama, Coach Washington was a legendary  Louisiana Football Hall of Famer who instilled in his players his  winning spirit, strong character, and quest for excellence.                                time  1015    Sadly, Coach Washington passed away on Friday, May 24, 2019, at the  age of 80.   Coach Washington was born on February 12, 1939, in Selma, Alabama, to  Sadie and Otis Washington, Sr. He graduated from R.B. Hudson High  School in 1957, where he was class president and a star athlete. He  then graduated from Xavier University in New Orleans, where he was  captain of the football team and an all-conference guard and  linebacker.   Coach Washington's resume speaks for itself. As the head football  coach, he led St. Augustine High School in New Orleans, Louisiana, to  three State championships and, in his 11 seasons there, he guided the  Purple Knights to 11 consecutive winning seasons and seven district  titles.   In 1979, Coach Washington became the first African American football  coach at LSU when he joined the staff as offensive line coach. Later,  Coach Washington was hired as the head football coach at Southern  University, where he led the Jaguars for six seasons.   Because of his many outstanding football achievements, Coach  Washington was inducted into the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame in 2015  and the St. Augustine Hall of Fame in 2017, among many, many other  honors.   His success on the football field was matched by his many efforts in  the community to promote fairness, equity, and justice. Coach  Washington was a key figure in integrating the Louisiana High School  Athletic Association.   While Coach Washington was often quick to downplay his role in  integrating the league, he did so as a humble man who knew his place,  but, more importantly, knew that his place was rising above the stars  and making sure that his players knew that they were just as good, if  not better, than any other player on the field.   Coach Washington was a devout Catholic and a devoted member of the  Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. His  devotion to his faith began as a young boy in Selma, Alabama, where he  was a member of the Don Bosco Catholic Boys Club, founded by Father  Nelson Ziter in 1947.   He was also a devout husband to his wife of 52 years, Linda Patterson  Washington of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, whom he met while coaching at St.  Augustine. He is also survived by his siblings, Carol, Olivia,  Charlene, Theopolis, Sharon, and Irma; and many godchildren, special  grandchildren, as well as nieces, nephews, relatives, and friends. They  will all miss him dearly.   On a personal note, I knew this amazing man as my ``Uncle Otis.'' He  was one of my father's childhood best friends growing up in Selma,  Alabama. Uncle Otis, my dad, Charles Williams, and Ted Washington  referred to themselves as the ``Four Amigos'' in grammar school, a name  that stuck with them throughout their lives. These men never forgot the  lessons that they learned from Father Ziter at the Don Bosco Boys Club  in Selma. Their love for their hometown of Selma and their commitment  to service through sports will always be remembered.   Uncle Otis and Auntie Linda were a constant presence in the lives of  my twin brothers and myself. I could always count on them for words of  encouragement and boasts of pride on my many accomplishments. I know  that I stand today as Alabama's first Black congresswoman because of  the love, support, nurturing, and prayers of the mentors, family, and  friends like Uncle Otis and Auntie Linda.   Like my dad, Uncle Otis will be missed but never forgotten. The  legacy that Uncle Otis leaves behind will live on in the many lives  that he impacted. May we find comfort in knowing that his legend lives  in us, and we are stronger and better because Uncle Otis' light shines  bright within us.   On behalf of Alabama's Seventh Congressional District, I ask my  colleagues to join me in honoring the extraordinary life and legacy of  Selma's own Coach Otis Washington, a football coaching legend and  Louisiana hall-of-famer. May we celebrate the totality of his life  today and honor always his great accomplishments in sports and  contributions in shaping the hearts, minds, and character of many men.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the  extraordinary life and legacy of Theresa Burroughs, a champion for  voting rights and a foot soldier of the civil rights movement.   Sadly, Mrs. Burroughs passed away on May 22, 2019, at the age of 89.   Mrs. Burroughs dedicated her life to advancing equality and justice  and making sure that future generations would learn about the  sacrifices and the bravery of foot soldiers who marched, bled, and died  for the right to vote and for civil rights in this country.   She is best known for her stewardship in founding the Safe House  Black History Museum in Greensboro, Alabama. The museum is located in  the same house in Hale County where Dr. Martin Luther King hid out from  the KKK on a visit to west Alabama in 1968. The museum houses materials  to educate future generations of the local struggle that happened in  the Black Belt of Alabama on behalf of all of us.   I am deeply honored to have known Mrs. Burroughs, and, in fact, I had  the opportunity to present Mrs. Burroughs with a Congressional Gold  Medal for her participation in the 1965 march from Selma to Montgomery.  I am deeply honored because I know I stand on the shoulders of Mrs.  Burroughs. So many of us do. Her bright light will always glow through  the many lives that  [[Page H4402]]  she impacted. May my colleagues join me in celebrating the exemplary  life of Mrs. Burroughs today and honor her great contributions to this  Nation, the State of Alabama, and to the civil rights and voting rights  movements.                            ____________________
