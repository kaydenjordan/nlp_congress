 Mr. Speaker, if you want to understand successful law  enforcement, the first place to look is the career of El Dorado County  Sheriff John D'Agostini.   It is not hard. It was under his leadership--in fact, it was because  of his leadership--that the day-to-day operations of his department  became the subject of the popular TV series ``Sheriffs: El Dorado  County'' that ran from 2014 to 2019.   It is the very definition of successful policing, pioneered by Sir  Robert Peel and perfected and practiced by Sheriff D'Agostini. Ideal  police departments are run as extensions of the communities they serve.  They work in partnership with local citizens, and this was the heart of  Sheriff D'Agostini's success.   I have seen it over and over in action. During the devastating King  fire, I watched him at his post even when his own ranch was imminently  threatened. During the Caldor fire, he opened that same ranch to the  stream of evacuees who had fled the devastation with only the clothes  on their backs. I can't tell you the number of times I watched him  during these terrifying disasters--always calm, always focused, always  reassuring, and omnipresent.   He is loved by his community and his department because he loves  them, and that caring is what binds the community to the sheriff's  department and exemplified and, indeed, defined his successful record  of modern policing.   He was first elected in 2010 by a razor-thin margin of 1,300 votes,  but as he proved himself, he became a beloved institution in the  community and won reelection overwhelmingly in 2014 and 2018 and would  have won by acclimation in 2022, but for the fact that he chose to  retire back into the community he has so faithfully served and  protected.   They were not all easy years. He lost a deputy to an illegal alien in  a marijuana grow in 2019 and became a national figure warning of the  dangers that our porous border and sanctuary policies present to  communities across America and to those who risk their lives to protect  us.   When State bureaucrats ordered businesses to shut down during the  COVID hysteria, Sheriff D'Agostini stood up for the constitutional  rights of his constituents and refused to destroy their livelihoods.  His courageous stand has since been affirmed by the mounting evidence  that the lockdowns cost lives, destroyed livelihoods, and did nothing  to slow the spread of the disease.    Sheriff D'Agostini worked his way up through the ranks, first  graduating from the Sacramento County Sheriff's Academy in 1993.  Throughout his career, Sheriff D'Agostini served in numerous positions,  including patrol deputy, detective, SWAT team member, narcotics  investigator, rangemaster and firearms instructor, and investigator for  the Amador County District Attorney's Office.   Sheriff D'Agostini is well known for his many accomplishments and  contributions to the community, including his leadership in  constructing a new public safety headquarters located in Placerville.  This building now provides local law enforcement with emergency  operations services, a 911 dispatch center, a morgue, an evidence  building, and a special operations and training building, as well as an  indoor shooting range and armory.   Mr. Speaker, without law enforcement, there is no law, and without  law, there is no civilization, which is why it is impossible to  overstate the necessity of our local police departments and the law and  order they uphold within our communities.   I am proud today to congratulate John on his numerous accomplishments  and his exemplary leadership, and, on behalf of the grateful citizens  across El Dorado County, thank him for his extraordinary service.   El Dorado County has been extremely fortunate to have had his  leadership for these past 12 years. Although he isn't going anywhere-- he is retiring right back into the community that raised him--and  although his successor is well prepared under his tutelage to carry on  his successful policies, that won't stop us from missing him anyway in  the role that he defined and the responsibilities that he discharged so  well.                            ____________________
