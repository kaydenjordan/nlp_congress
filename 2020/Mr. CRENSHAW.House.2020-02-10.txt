 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 1494, the Historically Black Colleges and  Universities (HBCUs) Homeland Security Partnerships Act.   H.R. 1494 seeks to increase partnerships and opportunities between  historically Black colleges and universities, or HBCUs, and the  Department of Homeland Security.   The bill requires DHS to develop a departmentwide strategy to enhance  partnerships with HBCUs and minority-serving institutions and seeks to  further such partnerships, specifically in relation to the research and  development activities of DHS.   I applaud my colleague, the chairman of the Homeland Security  Committee, for his efforts to bring this bill forward. I think this is  an important undertaking that will improve the work of DHS.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of S. 2107, the Protecting America's Food and  Agriculture Act of 2019.   As we know, much of the food and agricultural goods we consume come  from all over the world, whether it be fruit, vegetables, herbs, or cut  flowers.   As food and other agricultural goods arrive at our ports of entry,  U.S. Customs and Border Protection agricultural specialists have a  tremendous responsibility. They inspect those products to safeguard the  U.S. food supply, the economy, and agriculture from potentially harmful  or dangerous pests, pathogens, invasive plants, and agroterrorism.   CBP has advised Congress that there are hundreds of agriculture- related position vacancies at the agency on top of thousands of Border  Patrol, customs officer, and other law enforcement vacancies. S. 2107  encourages CBP to hire, train, and assign agriculture specialists and  associated support staff, technicians, and K-9 teams, and authorizes  appropriations to do so.   The bill requires CBP to consider quantifiable inspection data,  seasonal surge volumes, and projected changes in commercial forecasts  at each port of entry when determining staffing needs.   The bill also directs the Comptroller General to conduct a review of  Federal efforts to address risks to the agricultural supply that  analyzes interagency coordination, effectiveness of inspections, and  training and working conditions.   While I support this bill, I also encourage my colleagues to work  across the aisle to provide CBP with the resources necessary to fill  all of their sensitive position vacancies, including those at Border  Patrol.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support S. 2107, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Bost).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Hagedorn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Minnesota.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 5273, the Securing America's Ports  Act. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this legislation, and I  thank my colleague from New Mexico for her work on this legislation.   Our ports of entry continue to be a preferred avenue for  transnational criminal organizations and drug smugglers to transport  narcotics and contraband into the United States.   In fact, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized more than 455,000  pounds of narcotics at our ports in fiscal year 2019 alone.   The amount of fentanyl seized in 2019 was enough for more than 577  million lethal doses. That is more than the entire population of the  United States.   H.R. 5273 forces the Department to act on securing the ports of entry  by requiring the Secretary to develop a plan to scan all commercial and  passenger vehicles entering the United States through land ports using  nonintrusive inspection systems or similar systems within 180 days.   This bill encourages continued research and development, including  consideration of emerging technology, to meet the inspection system  plan requirements.   H.R. 5273 also requires the Secretary to establish benchmarks to  evaluate progress toward 100 percent scanning, estimated costs,  anticipated impacts on commerce, and anticipated impacts on border  security operations, including staffing considerations.   Last year, Congress made a significant investment in funding  nonintrusive inspection equipment for implementation across the land  borders over a 5-year period, and this bill would ensure an appropriate  plan is in place so that rollout runs smoothly, and taxpayer dollars  are well spent.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 504, the DHS Field Engagement  Accountability Act.   This legislation was introduced by my friend and colleague from  Nebraska, Representative   Don Bacon. I applaud Congressman Bacon's  initiative in sponsoring H.R. 504, which requires the Department of  Homeland Security to:   Develop an engagement strategy for the national network of fusion  centers;   Performance metrics for DHS personnel deployed to support State and  local fusion centers; and,   Training for fusion center personnel in the use of available DHS  information-sharing systems.   Additionally, the bill ensures that DHS component agencies are  sharing appropriate information, through secure channels, with fusion  center personnel.   Representing a border State, I want to ensure that DHS agencies,  including Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs  Enforcement, have relevant criminal or terrorism information that is  accessible to appropriate fusion center personnel. This will enhance  coordination and situational awareness throughout the homeland.   This bill has already passed the House of Representatives and was  passed in the Senate with minor amendments. Passage of the bill today  will send H.R. 504 to the President's desk.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to again support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Bacon).    Mr. Speaker, I, again, want to thank Representative  Bacon for his work on this legislation, as well as Chairman Thompson,  Ranking Member Rogers, Senator Johnson, and Senator Peters for moving  this bill through the House and Senate committees.   The sharing of counterterrorism and other homeland security  information with State and local officials is vital in our efforts to  protect the homeland. I am proud that we are able to support further  enhancing these efforts in a bipartisan manner today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2932, the Homeland Security  for Children Act. This legislation seeks to ensure that the needs of  children, one of our most vulnerable populations, are considered in  Department of Homeland Security planning.   H.R. 2932 directs the Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans  to incorporate feedback from children's organizations into  departmentwide activities.   Furthermore, this bill authorizes the technical expert position  within the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, to identify  and integrate the needs of children when preparing for, protecting  against, responding to, and recovering from natural and manmade  disasters.   It is imperative that we ensure that those who are unable to advocate  for themselves are being represented when disaster strikes.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4737, the Department of  Homeland Security Climate Change Research Act.   Numerous Federal studies have been conducted that summarize the  impacts of climate change on the United States and discuss the nexus  between climate change and terrorism.   This bill directs DHS' Science and Technology Directorate to evaluate  the current Federal research regarding the connection between climate  change and homeland security to identify any research gaps and, to the  extent practical, conduct additional research to fill those gaps.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage Members to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4432, the Protecting Critical  Infrastructure Against Drones and Emerging Threats Act.   In the wrong hands, unmanned aerial systems can pose a threat to the  American people. At our borders, criminals are using drones to smuggle  drugs and surveil law enforcement. Terrorists like ISIS have used them  in the past to carry out attacks overseas.   We must do more to address this threat, and with this bill we do just  that. H.R. 4432 protects the American people from the threat posed by  these criminal drone operators.                                time  1630    This legislation requires the Under Secretary for Intelligence and  Analysis at DHS to prepare an assessment of the threat from drones with  information gathered from Federal, State, local, and private-sector  partners.   This bill also requires DHS to establish a secure communications  network to receive and analyze information on the threat and a  voluntary mechanism for reporting threat information from owners and  operators of critical infrastructure.   During committee consideration of this bill, I proposed an amendment  to allow DHS to produce this information in a classified form, as  appropriate. I am pleased that language was included in this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Department of Homeland Security is charged with  protecting Americans here at home, and it is critical that the  technologies used to carry out this mission are secure. The risk posed  by certain foreign drone manufacturers is well documented and presents  a national security threat.   Chinese-manufactured drones could provide a backdoor for the Chinese  Government to access sensitive flight data from drones used by DHS. My  bill, H.R. 4753, seeks to address this vulnerability.   The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency has stated that  these unmanned aircraft systems are a potential risk to an  organization's information and that drones could contain components  that could compromise your data.   The potential for comprised data to fall into the hands of a foreign  government should concern everyone. It threatens to disrupt the law  enforcement and national security objectives of DHS.   My bill, the Drone Origin Security Enhancement Act, addresses the  threat by prohibiting DHS from acquiring unmanned aircraft systems  manufactured in a foreign country labeled a strategic competitor by the  Department of Defense. This is similar to a prohibition included in the  National Defense Authorization Act of 2019 for the military.   Simply put, my bill will ensure that DHS is not using drone equipment  from a foreign government that our military already views as a threat.   Much like the Department of Defense, DHS and its components have a  critical mission. The risk introduced into these missions by foreign- manufactured drones is not something that can be ignored. This  legislation addresses this very real threat and will keep our  adversaries from compromising the technology we use to keep Americans  safe.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from New Mexico for her  leadership on this bill. I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 4753, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Department of Homeland Security is tasked with some  of the most critical national security functions in the Federal  Government. The Department is responsible for securing our borders,  defending our cyber networks, safeguarding air travel, and protecting  our ports. To carry out these important missions, it is imperative that  DHS acquire the proper tools and equipment and maintain proper  oversight of such acquisitions.   Both the Government Accountability Office and the DHS Office of  Inspector General have reported on the persistent challenges that DHS  has faced for years in managing its major acquisition programs. The  Department's shortcomings in the management of these programs come with  a hefty price tag for American taxpayers, to the tune of billions of  dollars annually.   GAO reviewed acquisitions at DHS in 2016 and found that 8 of 25 major  acquisition programs experienced cost overruns, schedule slips, or  both. On average, these programs' cost estimates ballooned by $1.7  billion, and the key deadlines were missed by almost a year. Only 3 out  of 25 major acquisition programs were on track to meet their original  schedule and cost goals.   GAO has also found that DHS components have not implemented  acquisition policy consistently. In 2012, GAO determined that only 4  out of 66 programs had all the required documents approved in  accordance with DHS policy, and in 2015, GAO determined that DHS did  not conduct needed operational testing on all acquisition programs.   Although DHS has taken steps in recent years to improve acquisition  management, this process remains ripe for waste, fraud, and abuse. The  Department continues to struggle to ensure that major acquisition  programs adhere to their budgets, timelines, and capability goals.   To be clear, it is taxpayers who are on the hook for all of this. We  must remember that every inefficiency in government spending results in  an additional financial burden that must be covered by the citizens of  this country.   As egregious as the cost overruns may be, the consequences of not  providing the proper tools on time are even more dire. If DHS cannot  provide proper oversight of its major acquisition programs, then the  Department cannot provide the tools they need to execute their missions  to keep Americans safe.   This bill goes a long way to correct some of the current shortfalls  in the acquisition process, which will help ensure we are being  responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars and protecting the integrity  of these programs. It gives new authority over these billion-dollar  programs to the Under Secretary for Management as the Chief Acquisition  Officer. It fosters more thoughtful management of major acquisition  programs using private-sector best practices and bolsters oversight and  accountability measures.   These changes will help move the necessary tools into the hands of  those protecting our homeland in a timely and efficient manner without  foisting a financial burden on Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of my bill, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
