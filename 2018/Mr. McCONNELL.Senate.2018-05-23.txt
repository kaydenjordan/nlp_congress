 First, Mr. President, on an important piece of  internal business, workplace harassment is unacceptable anywhere--end  of story. The U.S. Congress is certainly no exception. Here, as  everywhere, employees must be free to work without fearing that they  will be the victims of harassment.   So a consensus emerged among Members in both the House and the Senate  that we should do more to hold people accountable, protect staff, and  help to prevent harassment in the first place. That is exactly what  will happen under the proposal that our colleagues Senator Blunt and  Senator Klobuchar have developed.   These colleagues of ours deserve big thanks. Their thorough,  bipartisan collaboration has produced an impressive and comprehensive  proposal to reform how Congress handles claims of violations of Federal  workplace laws, particularly, instances of harassment. It will help  this institution take an important step forward.   Their proposed reform achieves many of the important goals that  Members of both parties have put forward in recent months. There was  widespread consensus that Members of Congress should reimburse  taxpayers for the cost of claims or settlements. This reform achieves  that and more. It requires Members to pay for any harassment claims,  for any protected class, where the Member has personally engaged in  misconduct.   We sought to eliminate obstacles that made it more difficult for  employees to file claims. This reform achieves that. It eliminates the  mandatory counseling, the mandatory mediation, and the mandatory  cooling-off period that current law requires employees to go through  before filing a claim of a workplace violation.   We wanted to ensure disclosure when there are settlements or awards  for instances of sexual harassment. This reform achieves that and more.  It mandates that every instance where a Member is found to have  personally committed any type of harassment be publicly reported.   This is an entirely appropriate package of reforms that every Member  of this body should be able to support. It builds on the foundation  laid by Senator Grassley's landmark Congressional Accountability Act  back in 1995.   Our friend from Iowa led the way in making sure that Congress had to  live by the workplace laws that it required of others, and it builds on  other important steps this institution has recently taken, such as  updating and strengthening the anti-harassment training that all Senate  employees must complete.   Here is what all this adds up to: a clearer, easier, and more timely  process for those who seek to file harassment claims and greater  personal accountability and transparency in the event that misconduct  occurs.   The Democratic leader and I are grateful to Senator Blunt and Senator  Klobuchar for their hard work in assembling this proposal. It has our  enthusiastic support.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on an unrelated matter, today the  Senate will take action to fulfill an important promise. Our Nation's  all-volunteer Armed Forces consist of brave men and women who answer  the call to serve, often at personal risk. In gratitude for their  selfless sacrifice, we promise them the accessible and quality care  they have earned when they return home. Veterans of all eras rely on  this promise as they carry home the physical and mental reminders of  their service, but all too often the VA has fallen short of meeting  their needs with facilities that were too far away, lines and waiting  lists that were too long, and options for treatment that were too  limited.   The shortcomings of the Federal bureaucracy were apparent. Veterans  waiting months to see a physician under their VA benefits--let alone  dying before receiving treatment--meant that we were clearly falling  short of our commitment to them.   Congress had to act. So in 2014 a bipartisan coalition of 91 Senators  and 420 Members of the House took a critical first step by passing the  Veterans  [[Page S2844]]  Choice Act. For the past 3 years, the Veterans Choice Program has  connected millions of American heroes with the care and resources they  need and so richly deserve. It removed arbitrary barriers that blocked  veterans from convenient care, and it sent a clear message to those who  have suffered because of a dysfunctional system: We have your back.   But much more work remained. The Veterans Choice Program has allowed  over 23,000 Kentucky veterans to seek care in their own communities  just last year, but some veterans are still left out. I recently heard  from one Kentucky Navy veteran who lives 36 miles from the nearest VA  provider. He served aboard an aircraft carrier, the USS Forrestal, and  sustained a hand injury that still requires regular care.   Under current law, because he lives 36 miles and not 41 miles from  that facility, he can't receive covered treatment from a nearby  provider who is right in his home community. He has to make a round  trip several times a year to receive care. I know virtually all my  colleagues have heard stories just like that one, which made it clear  that Congress's work was far from finished.   So Chairman Isakson and his colleagues took the lead to develop this  new legislation, which borrows from 15 different Senate-introduced  bills. The victories it contains are numerous. The VA MISSION Act  removes those arbitrary time and distance requirements that limit  eligibility for outside care. It replaces those one-size-fits-all  policies with a conversation between veterans and their own doctors  about what works best. This will empower more veterans to access the  care they need, when and where they need it.   It also allows VA professionals to offer telemedicine and partner  with community care providers, creating a more comprehensive network to  keep veterans from falling through the cracks.   It consolidates seven separate community care programs into one  streamlined path, and it expands support for military families by  broadening the VA comprehensive assistance for family caregivers to  include veterans of all generations.   These are just some of the reasons why this bipartisan, bicameral  bill has earned the support of 38 veterans advocacy organizations. In a  joint letter they call it a ``historic opportunity to improve the lives  of veterans, their families, and caregivers.''   President Trump agrees. So does a large bipartisan majority in the  House. After we vote this afternoon, I hope we can say the Senate does  as well. Let's pass this worthy legislation and give our veterans more  of the support they have earned.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, later today we will  vote on two more qualified nominees for important positions in the  Trump administration.   First comes Brian Montgomery, the President's nominee to serve as  Assistant Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and head of the  Federal Housing Administration. His formidable background includes  previous service as Federal Housing Commissioner from 2005 to 2009 and  as the Acting Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. It is no  wonder that our colleagues on the Banking Committee reported his  nomination favorably with a bipartisan voice vote. I am glad we can  vote to confirm him today without any further delay.   After Mr. Montgomery, we will vote to advance the nomination of  Jelena McWilliams, whom the President has chosen to chair the FDIC  Board of Directors. Ms. McWilliams' resume spans the government and the  private sector. As a lawyer, policy expert, and executive, she has  studied financial regulations from all angles. She understands the  FDIC's role in safeguarding Americans' holdings, overseeing the banking  sector, and reforming inefficient policies that create obstacles for  families and job creators.   Ms. McWilliams is especially attentive to the difficulties facing  smaller community banks. In her testimony before the Banking Committee,  she explained how government regulations inflict outsized compliance  costs that can be too much for Main Street lenders to bear.   She was also examined by our colleagues on the Banking Committee and  was also reported out by a bipartisan voice vote. I encourage all my  colleagues to join me in voting to advance her nomination later today.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, speaking of community banks,  yesterday marked a big step forward for local lenders across the Nation  that have been crushed by the regulatory burden of Dodd-Frank.  Yesterday afternoon, our colleagues in the House passed the Economic  Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, which the  Senate had passed earlier this year. Now it will head to President  Trump's desk for his signature.   This is the culmination of extensive bipartisan work, led by Senator  Crapo and his colleagues on the Banking Committee, to give smaller  community lenders relief from Obama-era overregulation.   I frequently discuss how our Democratic colleagues' top-down policy  agenda worked well for a select few but left much of the rest of the  Nation behind. This issue is a perfect illustration of that. Our  Democratic colleagues produced a hastily written rule book for Wall  Street and then forced it on the rest of America, including community  banks and credit unions in my State of Kentucky and across the Nation.   These local institutions are vital economic contributors. Their  unique ability to build relationships and local connections are why  community banks handle a majority of all U.S. small business loans and  almost 80 percent of agricultural loans. That is why research suggests  that closure of a single physical bank in a low-income neighborhood can  reduce lending to nearby businesses by almost 40 percent.   Community banks and communities that depend on them needed relief  from Dodd-Frank. They needed sensible reform that streamlined that  inefficient, imprecise, one-size-fits-all regulatory approach. Thanks  to Chairman Crapo, our Banking Committee colleagues, Chairman  Hensarling, and our colleagues in the House, that is exactly what this  Congress and this President are poised to deliver.   This legislation is a major bipartisan achievement. I am pleased that  we are adding it to last year's historic tax reform, our record use of  the Congressional Review Act to roll back overregulation, and all the  other policy accomplishments that are helping to reignite American  prosperity.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, all postcloture time on the McWilliams  nominations be considered expired at 12 noon on Thursday, May 24;  further, that if cloture is invoked on the Evans nomination, the time  until 1:45 p.m. be equally divided in the usual form, and at 1:45 p.m.,  the Senate vote on the nomination; finally, that if any of the  nominations are confirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table and the President be immediately notified of  the Senate's action.
