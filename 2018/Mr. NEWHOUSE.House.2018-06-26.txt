 Mr. Chair, I am proud to be able to rise and speak on  this bill. I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 2083, the Endangered Salmon  and Fisheries Predation Prevention Act, and I encourage all of my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation.   This bill was introduced on a bipartisan basis by members of the  Pacific Northwest delegation to address the matter of predatory sea  lions that are consuming alarming numbers of endangered salmon,  steelhead, and other fish species in the Columbia River and its  tributaries.                                time  1500    Over the past few decades, sea lion populations have increased  tenfold, causing sea lions to expand their search for food. There is  just too many of them for their traditional food sources.   Well, Mr. Chairman, they have found that source. Sea lions swimming  up to the Bonneville Dam are gorging themselves on endangered salmon  not only for food, but, Mr. Chairman, there are so many of them, they  are also doing it for sport. I have seen this myself while visiting a  dam, where I saw what scientists and river managers regularly see: fish  passing by--through those windows that you can watch the migrating  salmon--with massive bite marks through their bodies. Most of the time,  that leads to fatality for these fish.   A recent NOAA study found that sea lions consumed up to 45 percent of  several stocks of returning adult salmon last year. The Oregon  Department of Fish and Wildlife found that winter steelhead will go  extinct if sea lion populations are not managed, placing the likelihood  of extinction at 90 percent.   This bill would stop this severe problem by amending the Marine  Mammal Protection Act to allow NOAA to issue permits allowing State  agencies and regional Tribes to use lethal take of sea lions in certain  portions of the Columbia River and its tributaries. This legislation  will help protect fish from sea lion predation and is desperately  needed in order to save an endangered fish species.   Unfortunately, Ranking Member Grijalva and the minority of the House  Natural Resources Committee have once again reverted to fear-mongering,  just as they have done on other issues facing the Pacific Northwest. I  have heard this legislation called the ``Slaughter Seals and Sea Lions  Act,'' and it claimed the legislation will authorize a ``massive  increase in annual permits to kill sea lions and seals.'' Nothing could  be further from the truth.   This legislation demonstrates a targeted approach and a bipartisan,  concerted effort over many years to come  [[Page H5701]]  to a consensus on this serious issue. In fact, the bill places strict  limits on sea lion removal that are one-tenth the amount NOAA states  would have no impact on sea lion population.   I am disappointed in these outlandish and false claims that the  minority has propagated. The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the  Yakama Nation state: ``We are saddened to see such an inaccurate,  emotional, and nonscientific attack on legislation our region is  desperate to see enacted.'' And, Mr. Chairman, I could not agree more.   Fortunately, the wide-ranging coalition and bipartisan support behind  this legislation speaks for itself: from the three respective Governors  of the three States of Washington, Oregon, and Idaho; to the Yakama,  Nez Perce, Warm Springs, and Umatilla Tribes; to groups like the  Pacific Power Council, Northwest River Partners, Trout Unlimited, and  Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Associations, this legislation  is supported by environmental organizations, the fishing industry,  power and utility interests, State and Tribal governments, and both  Democrats and Republicans alike right here in the House and in the  Senate.   The ranking member earlier stated that this bill is not a silver  bullet, and, Mr. Chairman, I don't disagree. I certainly acknowledge  that this is just one tool to continue the tremendous efforts and  significant resources our region has devoted to fish protection and  mitigation, but it is an important one.   I continue to advocate for sound science approaches to managing our  Columbia River system, including speaking out against the recklessly  mandated spill order currently placed upon the Federal river system.  That is why I supported H.R. 3144 earlier this year to stop this spill  and to provide the experts who manage our river system with the ability  to do so in a manner that is best for our fish species.   For the record, the minority of the House Natural Resources Committee  called the bill the ``Salmon Extinction Act''--more disappointing  hyperbole. I would encourage the ranking member and his staff to focus  more on the science and less on the radical rhetoric.   Mr. Chairman, just as my bipartisan colleagues support this  legislation we consider today, I continue to plead for my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle and in the Senate to recognize the science  showing how dangerous spilling to the gas caps is.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R.  2083.
