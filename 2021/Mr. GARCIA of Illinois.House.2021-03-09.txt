 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in strong support  of the Protecting the Right to Organize Act.   Workers sacrifice so much to keep our country going during this  pandemic. They risk their safety, and many have lost their lives.   But workers everywhere are also organizing to improve their working  conditions and keep our communities safe.   This bill simply guarantees the right to fight for safety and dignity  on the job.   It is for Amazon workers in my neighborhood in Chicago fighting for  their safety on the warehouse floor; for nurses demanding safe staffing  levels in hospitals and nursing homes; for rideshare drivers and  delivery workers who don't even have basic rights at work.   I urge this body to pass the PRO Act for them and for all of us.
