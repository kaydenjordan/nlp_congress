 Mr. Speaker, the foundation of  our democracy is built upon the strength of grassroots movements and  our ability to organize. It is the will of the people--and not the will  of a select few--that shapes our values as a nation. While leaders and  institutions play an important role in our society, ultimately it is  the people themselves who create the momentum to bring about the change  that they would like to see throughout our society.   The Civil Rights Movement is a definitive example of the importance  of grassroots movement. The Civil Rights Movement reshaped our society  into one that affords equal rights and protection under the law for all  Americans. But it was also a movement that began at the local level.  From protests in Virginia over Brown vs. Board of Education to civil  acts of disobedience in Montgomery, Alabama, the success and momentum  of the movement was driven by grassroots movements all across the  United States. Without it, it is difficult to say what kind of country  the United States would be today.   The importance of grassroots movements remains clear as day,  particularly in the 21st Century. The election of President Trump  sparked countless protests across the country, while uniting millions  of people globally as individuals came together in opposition to his  hateful rhetoric targeting minorities, women, and other vulnerable  segments of the population. It is this momentum that has manifested  into the Women's March on Washington, which brought millions of people  in cities around the world to march in support of human rights, racial  equality, immigration reform, and other progressive ideals. It was a  dramatic statement of opposition against the perceived wrongs and  violations in our society, and it will help shape the nature of  discourse for many years to come.   These social movements are crucial to our democracy. Grassroots  movements serve as a counterpoint to injustice and help provide a  medium through which we as a people can communicate our ideals. As we  honor Black History Month, we must look to the struggles of our  ancestors in order to inform our decisions of today, or else we are  doomed to repeat the same mistakes that already tarnish our history.                            ____________________
