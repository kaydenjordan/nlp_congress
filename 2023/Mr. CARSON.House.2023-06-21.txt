 Mr. Speaker, what I do know is that Adam Schiff defended  the U.S. Constitution. He led an impartial investigation which followed  the facts and led to the first of two impeachments of a former  President.   As a senior member of the Intelligence Committee, I have had the  honor of working closely with Mr. Schiff for years.   He is a man of integrity, and he deeply loves this country like we  all do. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this dangerous and  purely vindictive attempt to silence someone because of his work to  hold Donald Trump accountable.   I urge my colleagues not to be fooled by these distractions. Don't  ignore the facts. This resolution is a fig leaf to hide the very clear  facts about a twice-impeached President, a twice-indicted ex-President  who has put our national security at risk.   I urge my colleagues to stop these political games and get back to  the business of the American people.
