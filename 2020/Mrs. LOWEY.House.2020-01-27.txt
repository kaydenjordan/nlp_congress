 Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of International  Holocaust Remembrance Day.   Last week, I was honored to join the Speaker's congressional  delegation to Poland and Israel, where we visited Auschwitz and  participated in the Fifth World Holocaust Forum.   We cannot fight the scourge of anti-Semitism without remembering the  horrors that can occur when hate is allowed to flourish. As we  commemorate this important day, we remember those lost, and let the  lessons from the Holocaust guide our work today.   As a co-chair of the House Bipartisan Task Force for Combating Anti- Semitism, I will continue to work with my  [[Page H559]]  colleagues from both sides of the aisle to identify long-term solutions  to this age-old problem.
