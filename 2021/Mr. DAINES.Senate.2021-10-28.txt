 Mr. President, this month marks the first anniversary of  the Geneva Consensus Declaration on Promoting Women's Health and  Strengthening the Family. The historic coalition that issued this  declaration was formed by a diverse group of countries committed to  advancing women's health, protecting life at every stage while  affirming that there is no international right to abortion, upholding  the importance of the family as foundational to society, and defending  the sovereign right of Nations to make their own laws to advance these  core values, without external pressure. The Geneva Consensus  Declaration was signed on October 22, 2020, by 32 countries from every  region of the world, representing more than 1,600,000,000 people, which  committed to working together on the core pillars enshrined in the  declaration, and five countries have subsequently signed. Although  President Biden removed the United States as a signatory to the Geneva  Consensus Declaration earlier this year, at least temporarily, the  coalition is alive and growing, currently consisting of 36 countries.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the text of  this landmark document and the names of the 36 signatory countries.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       Geneva Consensus Declaration on Promoting Women's Health and                          Strengthening the Family         We, ministers and high representatives of Governments,        Having intended to gather on the margins of the 2020 World       Health Assembly in Geneva, Switzerland to review progress       made and challenges to uphold the right to the highest       attainable standards of health for women; to promote women's       essential contribution to health, and strength of the family       and of a successful and flourishing society; and to express       the essential priority of protecting the right to life,       committing to coordinated efforts in multilateral fora;       despite our inability to meet in Geneva due to the global       COVID-19 pandemic, in solidarity, we        1. Reaffirm ``all are equal before the law,'' and ``human       rights of women are an inalienable, integral, and indivisible       part of all human rights and fundamental freedoms'';        2. Emphasize ``the equal right of men and women to the       enjoyment of all civil and political rights,'' as well as       economic, social, and cultural rights; and the ``equal       rights, opportunities and access to resources and equal       sharing of responsibilities for the family by men and women       and a harmonious partnership between them are critical to       their wellbeing and that of their families''; and that       ``women and girls must enjoy equal access to quality       education, economic resources, and political participation as       well as equal opportunities with men and boys for employment,       leadership and decision-making at all levels;''        3. Reaffirm the inherent ``dignity and worth of the human       person,'' that ``every human being has the inherent right to       life,'' and the commitment ``to enable women to go safely       through pregnancy and childbirth and provide couples with the       best chance of having a healthy infant'';        4. Emphasize that ``in no case should abortion be promoted       as a method of family planning'' and that ``any measures or       changes related to abortion within the health system can only       be determined at the national or local level according to the       national legislative process'';        5. Reaffirm that ``the child . . . needs special safeguards       and care . . . before as well as after birth'' and ``special       measures of protection and assistance should be taken on       behalf of all children,'' based on the principle of the best       interest of the child; Reaffirm that ``the family is the       natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled       to protection by society and the State''; that ``motherhood       and childhood are entitled to  [[Page S7458]]       special care and assistance,'' that ``women play a critical       role in the family'' and women's ``contribution to the       welfare of the family and to the development of society'';        6. Recognize that ``universal health coverage is       fundamental for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals       related not only to health and well-being,'' with further       recognition that ``health is a state of complete physical,       mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of       disease or infirmity'' that ``the predominant focus of       healthcare systems on treating illness rather than       maintaining optimal health also prevents a holistic       approach''; and that there are ``needs that exist at       different stages in an individual's lifespan,'' which       together support optimal health across the life course,       entailing the provision of the necessary information, skills,       and care for achieving the best possible health outcomes and       reaching full human potential; and        7. ``Reaffirm the importance of national ownership and the       primary role and responsibility of governments at all levels       to determine their own path towards achieving universal       health coverage, in accordance with national contexts and       priorities'', preserving human dignity and all the rights and       freedoms set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human       Rights.        Furthermore, we, the representatives of our sovereign       nations do hereby declare in mutual friendship and respect,       our commitment to work together to:        Ensure the full enjoyment of all human rights and equal       opportunity for women at all levels of political, economic,       and public life;        Improve and secure access to health and development gains       for women, including sexual and reproductive health, which       must always promote optimal health, the highest attainable       standard of health, without including abortion;        Reaffirm that there is no international right to abortion,       nor any international obligation on the part of States to       finance or facilitate abortion, consistent with the long-      standing international consensus that each nation has the       sovereign right to implement programs and activities       consistent with their laws and policies;        Build our health system capacity and mobilize resources to       implement health and development programs that address the       needs of women and children in situations of vulnerability       and advance universal health coverage;        Advance supportive public health policies for women and       girls as well as families, including building our healthcare       capacity and mobilizing resources within our own countries,       bilaterally, and in multilateral fora;        Support the role of the family as foundational to society       and as a source of health, support, and care; and        Engage across the UN system to realize these universal       values, recognizing that, individually we are strong, but       together we are stronger.
