 And still I rise, Mr. Speaker.   You used God to enslave my foreparents. You used God to segregate me  in schools. You used God to put me in the back of the bus.   Have you no shame? God created every person in this room. Are you  saying that God made a mistake?   This is not about God; it is about men who choose to discriminate  against other people because they have the power to do so.   My record will not show that I voted against Mr. Cicilline having his  rights. My record will show that when I had the opportunity to deliver  liberty and justice for all, I voted for rights for all.
