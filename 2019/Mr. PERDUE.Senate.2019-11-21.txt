 I am reserving the right to object.   Mr. President, just yesterday, Secretary Pompeo joined the foreign  ministers at NATO headquarters in Brussels, including Foreign Minister  Cavusoglu from Turkey. Secretary Pompeo had quite a lot to discuss with  him, as this administration continues its engagement with  Turkey's leadership on the heels of President Trump's meeting with  President Erdogan last week. In light of these diplomatic efforts, I  respectfully object to this resolution at this time.    While the content of the legislation before us merits undivided  consideration, its passage would undermine the administration's  overcoming real challenges in our bilateral relationship with Turkey. I  look forward to working with the administration and Senator Cruz and  Senator Menendez in holding our NATO ally responsible for its  commitment made when it joined the NATO community of like-minded  nations founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty, and  the rule of law.   For those reasons, I object.
