 Mr. President and colleagues, as today's debate begins to  wind down, I want to rise to join those who have called for the passage  of the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement  Act.   Years ago, when the United States was in the early stages of conflict  in Vietnam, I was fortunate to win a Navy ROTC scholarship to attend  Ohio State.   During my freshman year there, as spring break approached, our  commanding officer urged a bunch of us freshman midshipmen to--he said:  I got a deal for you. How would you like an all-expenses-paid trip to  Quantico, VA, over spring break?   That is where the marine officers trained after going to college.   We all raised our hands and said: Count us in.   On our way--1 day off--we had 5 days in Quantico and 1 day off. We  took a train to Union Station in Washington, DC, just three or four  blocks from here, and from there, most of my fellow midshipmen found  their way to watering holes in Georgetown. I chose to visit Capitol  Hill. It is a place I had never been.   That day, I walked up Delaware Avenue and passed this building,  somehow finding my way into the Rayburn House Office Building just a  short distance from where we are gathered today. I walked up to a  security officer there and asked if there were any hearings underway  that I might try to sit in on. He said yep, and he directed me to a  long line leading to the House Judiciary Committee room.   After a long wait, I finally had the chance to find a seat and watch  in person the debate over what would later become the Voting Rights Act  of 1965. I was glued to that seat for hours, mesmerized by what I saw  and what I heard.   Later, back on the train to Quantico that evening, my friends asked  me what I had found on Capitol Hill on that day, and I told them I  thought I may have found my future. As it turned out, I did.   That day and in the days to come, those hearings inspired by the  civil rights movement forced a spotlight on the discriminatory State  laws that had made it nearly impossible for many Black Americans to  vote 100 years after the end of the Civil War.   Years earlier, my sister and I had grown up in Danville, VA, the last  capital of the Confederacy. There, we saw racial discrimination up  close and personal. Even as children, we knew it was wrong, and we knew  it had to change.   Sitting in Rayburn years later, I found the place where I thought  just maybe--just maybe--I might be able to help do something to right  that wrong.   Nearly 18 years later, since sitting in that hearing room, after I  had finished my studies and completed my third deployment to Southeast  Asia as a naval flight officer during the Vietnam war, I found myself  back on Capitol Hill in these halls, this time serving alongside John  Lewis in the House of Representatives.   After years of blatant discrimination and voter suppression  specifically targeted at Black Americans, we began to witness change.  It came slowly at first and then more quickly.   Thanks to the tireless efforts of people like our friend John Lewis,  the Voting Rights Act of 1965 gained increasingly popular bipartisan  support over the years. In fact, as we heard earlier, by 2006, the vote  to extend the Voting Rights Act was unanimous. Imagine that--98 to 0.  Think about it--98 to 0. Today, 16 of the Republican colleagues who  voted for it among those 98 are still here--are still here.   Given that history, however, it is almost unbelievable to think that  the right to vote is under attack once again in many parts of our  country. Today, in States across America, State legislators and some  Governors are seeking to enact a wave of voter restrictions, many of  them with the sole purpose of making it harder to vote, often  specifically targeting Black Americans.   In 2021 alone, 19 States passed some 34 laws restricting the right to  vote. How? Well, by allowing partisan observers to intimidate  independent poll workers in Texas and by pulling drop boxes and ballot  applications out of the hands of voters and imposing penalties for poll  workers in Florida who were just trying to do their jobs. In Georgia,  it is OK to make the poll lines longer and longer, but you can't bring  food or water to the voters who wait in them, sometimes for hours, to  vote--hours.   We know that in many parts of America, Black voters have to wait in  line for twice as long as White voters to cast their ballots--twice as  long--and in some places, for up to 6 hours. That is not just morally  wrong, it is an assault on who we are as a people. How can we look at  what is happening and not ask, for God's sake, can't we do better than  this? Indeed, we must.   Let me leave you with one idea that worked in 1965 and just might  work again in 2022. You know, every day across our country, Americans  gather in places of worship. Every major religion in the world relies  on one common principle that bolsters our connection to each other: the  Golden Rule; the idea that we should love our neighbor as ourselves;  the idea that we ought to treat people the way we want to be treated.   Most Americans would be surprised to learn that that admonition is  repeated almost weekly in multiple Bible studies and prayer breakfasts  that are regularly held here on Capitol Hill throughout the year. It is  a shared belief across religious, ethnic, and party lines that the  person across from us is just as valuable as us, just as deserving of  love and dedication as we are and our loved ones are.   In 1965, the Golden Rule was a foundational principle for equality in  the Voting Rights Act. Congress was guided by it. In fact, every major  religion on this planet embraces it. I don't care if you are a  Protestant, Catholic, Jew, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, and it goes on, the  Golden Rule is in your teachings, in your beliefs.   You hear it here in this body, in this building, week in and week  out. Maybe, just maybe, it is about time for us to rely on it once  again in this land of the free as we seek to connect our values and our  faith to our actions.   Most of us will recall that both Dr. King and the preamble of our  Constitution called on us to work to make this a more perfect Union and  fulfill the promise of our Founders that all men and women are created  equal.   While across our country today, we are seeing a growing wave of voter  restrictions, I am reminded of what Martin Luther King said many years  ago. He said this:         Only when it is dark enough can we see the stars.    Think about it. Only when it is dark enough can we see the stars. And  sometimes it is only when we are tested as a nation that our true  spirit shows itself. I pray--I pray--that this is just one such time.   So while none of us hoped we would ever face these challenges in our  democracy to our democracy in the year 2022, perhaps we can take some  comfort in knowing that someone else has walked this path before us.   All these years later, we feel that ``fierce urgency of now,'' that  ``fierce urgency of now'' that Dr. King spoke of five decades before,  providing us with both a moral blueprint and the encouragement to do  something with it.   As I close, let me just say, having said all that, let me reiterate  that this  [[Page S329]]  is not a time to wait and dawdle. Congress needs to regroup when we  leave this building this day, this week, and then act with the same  sense of urgency as an earlier Congress did in 1965 and pass the  Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act in  order to better protect the sacred right to vote and uphold the  sanctity of our electoral processes. The legislation before us today  seeks to make clear what we as a nation aspire to be. It makes clear  that no one who is eligible should be denied the sacred right to vote.   Let me close, colleagues, by observing that in the end, we can quote  Dr. King and praise my friend John Lewis until the cows come home, but  when Americans' sacred right to vote is on the line, it is our  responsibility to uphold our oath to the Constitution and get on with  it.   I never knew Dr. King. I knew John Lewis, knew him well, and loved  him. But I don't know if Dr. King or John Lewis were fans of Mark  Twain. I am. I want to close by paraphrasing the words of Mark Twain,  and this is that paraphrase: When in doubt, do what is right. You will  amaze your friends and confound your enemies.   Well, friends, time has come to do just that, to do both of those  things, and that is why no barrier should stand in the way of our  sacred obligation to protect this democracy.   I yield the floor.   (The PRESIDENT pro tempore assumed the Chair.)
