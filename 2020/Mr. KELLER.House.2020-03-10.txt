 Madam Speaker, with Saudi Arabia and Russia going through  absurd measures to drive the United States out of the energy market,  this is a prime opportunity to ensure we have demand for American  energy made right here at home.   That is why I am saddened to see Pennsylvania's Governor publicly  oppose legislation that will incentivize the potential creation of two  new petrochemical facilities in Pennsylvania.   The United States, generally, and Pennsylvania, in particular, have  benefited from homegrown energy production. The natural gas industry in  Pennsylvania has invested in local communities, improved educational  opportunities, lowered energy costs, and boosted our national security  through energy independence.   But we cannot allow foreign countries, especially those who do not  share our values, to drive us out of the energy market.   By supporting an energy and fertilizer manufacturing tax credit, and  bringing jobs, investment, and local demand for local gas, Pennsylvania  could invest in our country's future and our national security by  ensuring a local market for local energy resources.                            ____________________
