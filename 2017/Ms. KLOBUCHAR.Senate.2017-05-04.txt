 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 48, H.R. 534.    Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that  the committee-reported amendment be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be  read a third time and passed; and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.
