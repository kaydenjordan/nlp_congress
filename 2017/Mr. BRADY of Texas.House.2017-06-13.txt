The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady) and the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Sanchez) each will control 30 minutes.

The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Last month House Republicans took a significant step to return  patient-centered healthcare to the American people. We passed the  American Health Care Act. The American Health Care Act begins our step- by-step process to repeal ObamaCare and replace this collapsing law  with a 21st century healthcare system that truly works for American  families, job creators, our States, and our taxpayers.   Now, as work on the American Health Care Act moves forward in the  Senate, we are moving forward on a parallel track to deliver more  solutions for the American people. One of those is the Verify First  Act, sponsored by Congressman Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania.   This legislation takes important action to protect taxpayer dollars  from waste, fraud, and abuse. It prevents the American Health Care  Act's monthly tax credits and ObamaCare's current subsidies from being  dispensed until the legal status of an eligible recipient can be  verified.   Under ObamaCare, people who are in the United States illegally are  prohibited from receiving taxpayer-funded subsidies to help purchase  health insurance; but like so many aspects of ObamaCare, there is a  major defect. ObamaCare starts by assuming a person is a legal resident  and sends the money right away even if the verification process is  still incomplete.   As we have seen with so many Federal programs, it is all but  impossible to get fraudulently claimed money back after it is already  out the door. This flaw of ObamaCare is no different. It has resulted  in taxpayer-funded subsidies being spent on people who are not in the  United States legally and, therefore, not eligible to receive them.   My constituents in Texas and yours around the country work too hard  to see their tax dollars wasted by Washington's carelessness. The best  solution to protect taxpayer dollars from waste, fraud, and abuse is to  stop it before it occurs, and that is what the Verify First Act by Mr.  Barletta will do.   This bill strengthens existing verification tools by making a  commonsense change. Rather than sending the money first and confirming  legal status later, it verifies legal status up  [[Page H4876]]  front. So if you want to receive financial support for health  insurance, this bill simply requires that you first provide a Social  Security number or another form of acceptable information to validate  citizenship or immigration status.   This commonsense change will apply to ObamaCare beginning with next  year's open enrollment period, and after ObamaCare is repealed, it will  apply to the tax credits offered in the American Health Care Act when  they take effect. This helps ensure that taxpayer-funded assistance for  the purchase of health insurance is only distributed to people who are  eligible, not to those who are in our country illegally.   I want to thank Congressman Barletta for his leadership on this  important legislation. The Verify First Act is a much-needed solution  to safeguard taxpayer dollars from waste, fraud, and abuse both now and  in the future, and that is crucial as we continue our efforts to repeal  and replace the failing ObamaCare law. It is vital to improving  America's health system for the long term.   I urge all my colleagues to join me in supporting the passage of the  Verify First Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta), the author of the Verify First Act,  and as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, I am proud to  advance this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), a key member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional  1 minute.

Mr. Speaker, the rules of the House are very  clear about imputing the character of lawmakers, and I would warn the  gentlewoman, she is treading on the rules.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman attempting to raise a  parliamentary inquiry?    I am considering.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California has the  time.    I am considering.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California has the  time.    I will monitor the remainder of the remarks.    I will monitor the remainder of the remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Let's make sure we fact-check some things here. Nothing in this bill  changes the eligibility of the Affordable Care Act and who is eligible  for it. In fact, the Republican healthcare bill that passed the House,  according to the American Action Network, there will be roughly 5.3  million more Americans that will be eligible for help for their  healthcare under the Republican plan than under the Affordable Care  Act.   Let's fact-check a couple of other issues. We are told that this has  all come about because the IRS has not funded properly, but I would  remind our Democrat colleagues that the majority of our Democrat  colleagues supported the spending levels, which President Obama signed  into law regarding the Internal Revenue Service.   Secondly, they have raised the issue that there are no Social  Security numbers available. But in truth, nearly 96 percent of children  born in America receive their Social Security numbers within 2 weeks.  There is an expedited process going forward to achieve the others as  well.   We are told, listening today: there is no fraud in ObamaCare; there  is no fraud to worry about; there is no need for this bill by Mr.  Barletta.   But I remind our colleagues that twice the Government Accountability  Office looked at eligibility within the Affordable Care Act. In 2014,  they used fake identities to see if they could obtain ObamaCare  coverage on the exchange, and in 11 out of 12 applications--some with  no data at all--the GAO was granted subsidies for people who don't even  exist.   So you say: Well, that is 2014. Certainly, things got better.   Well, last year, they ran it again in the special enrollment period,  and in this test, the GAO was able to obtain coverage for imaginary  people in 9 out of 12 cases.   We are told today that our taxpayer dollars aren't being wasted.  Well, the American public knows better, and they know this because we  have worked for 7 years to oppose what we knew would be a failing law.  We held more than 200 congressional hearings. We had 65-plus hours of  open debate on the American Health Care Act, and 37 bills passed the  House that were ultimately, in one form or another, included in the  Republican bill.   The bottom line is this, Mr. Speaker: Our Democrat friends are in  denial. ObamaCare is collapsing. Prices have more than doubled. They  haven't gone down. They have more than doubled for most Americans; in  some States more than tripled, and those rates aren't going down. They  are skyrocketing. People aren't getting more choices of healthcare  plans. They are disappearing.   Texas has seen nine insurers abandon our State--I think more than any  other State--and it is getting fewer and fewer. It is occurring across  the country.   You are not able to see more local doctors and go to more local  hospitals; just the opposite. It is fewer, and that is hurting everyone  in America. ObamaCare is a sinking ship, and it is taking some very  good Americans down with it.   The question is: Do we begin to give people a lifeline to truly  affordable care?   With this bill, Mr. Barletta insists in a commonsense way that your  tax dollars go to those we are trying to help: those who can't get  healthcare at work; those who don't get it through government programs  like Medicare or the VA; those small-business people; those folks  coming out of college; those entrepreneurs who are at home starting a  new business or raising their families; even those early retirees.  Those are the people we are trying to help, and every dollar counts.   Mr. Barletta's bill, which I am proud as chairman of the Ways and  Means Committee to bring to you, makes a commonsense requirement: that  you be verified to get those subsidies before you receive them; to make  sure those precious dollars actually go to the Americans we are trying  to help.   I strongly support the Verify First Act. If you stand for stopping  waste, and fraud, and abuse in protection of your tax dollars, I would  urge your support for this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion  to recommit.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion  to recommit.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Speaker, this isn't about verifying for  infants. Ninety-six percent of children receive their Social Security  numbers within 2 weeks after they are born in a hospital, and many of  them have parents who are eligible for these credits as well, so it is  immediate care. Even without all that, they can achieve and receive  healthcare immediately as they process the premium support.   In the American Health Care Act that passed the House, there are more  than $1 billion set aside to help further the verification process to  make sure that we are providing timely credits--but for those who are  eligible. In truth, our friends across the aisle want to detract from  the challenge today, which is that ObamaCare is a sinking ship.   Today's bill is about the taxpayers. Congress has to do all in its  power to ensure the money taken from hardworking taxpayers is actually  used for programs that improve their lives in this country and are not  frittered away on fraud and abuse.   That is why this bill is so critical. It doesn't change eligibility.  It simply says that we are not going to pay first and chase later,  which always is a losing approach for taxpayers. Not a dollar of  taxpayer money should go out the door until citizenship or legal status  is verified, period.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to defeat the Democrats' motion to  recommit and stand on behalf of taxpayers who want those dollars to go  to Americans we are truly trying to help for the first time get truly  affordable healthcare.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Walker. And  first let me thank him for not just hosting this evening, People's  Night, but his leadership of the Republican Study Committee and how he  is leading our efforts to truly move this country back in the right  direction.   As a friend, and from someone who admires him so much, I thank him  for his leadership. It has already made a huge difference in issues  like repealing ObamaCare.   So how many of you are pleased with the way you are taxed in America?  Not many Americans are because the code we have got, it is so complex  and so costly, it is just unfair.   So House Republicans are working with this President and the Senate  to deliver the first pro-growth tax reform in a generation. We know  this is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and the goals we set out  from the House is, first, we want a Tax Code not designed merely to  wring money from you. We have that Tax Code. We want a Tax Code built  for growth, designed to grow jobs, your wages, and the U.S. economy.   In doing that, we want to leapfrog America from nearly dead last  among our global competitors back into the lead pack as the best place  on this Earth for that next new job, that next new investment.   What we propose is a Tax Code with three big reforms: The lowest  rates for our local businesses in modern history, and redesigned so our  local companies can compete and win anywhere in the world, especially  here at home.   Secondly, we are proposing for families and individuals a code so  fair and simple that 9 out of 10 Americans will be able to file using a  simple postcard system, and it works.   And the final reform is because we propose a much fairer and simpler  Tax Code; we propose a fairer and simpler tax collector.                                time  1745    So we proposed to bust up the IRS and redesign it into a 21st century  agency focused on you, the taxpayer. These are the reforms included in  the House Republican blueprint. We are excited to work with President  Trump and the Senate to deliver on pro-grow tax reform, bold, that  leapfrogs America back to the front and returns jobs back to the United  States--manufacturing, research and headquarters jobs.   It is a tough challenge. We will need your input. I encourage you to  come to the Ways and Means Committee website, learn more, speak out, be  part of changing and reforming this horrible Tax Code.   Mr. Walker, thank you again for your leadership of this Special Order  and our efforts.
