Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas, pending which I yield  myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this  resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 758, providing for the consideration  of H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act; H.R. 5038,  the Farm Workforce Modernization Act; and the conference report to  accompany S. 1790, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2020.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 3 under a structured rule  and makes in order 12 amendments, including the Republican substitute.   The rule provides 4 hours of general debate, with 3 hours equally  divided among and controlled by the chairs and the ranking minority  members of the Committees on Education and Labor, Energy and Commerce,  and Ways and Means, and 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the  majority leader and minority leader. The rule also provides a motion to  recommit.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 5038 under a closed rule,  with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and  the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. It also provides for a  motion to recommit.   The rule further provides for consideration of the conference report  to accompany S. 1790 with 1 hour of debate and a motion to recommit, if  applicable.   The rule also authorizes the chair of the Intelligence Committee to  insert in the Congressional Record explanatory statements as he deems  necessary.   Finally, the rule provides housekeeping items to close out the first  session of this Congress, such as same-day authority, suspension  authority, district work period instructions, and language to convene  the Second Session of the 116th Congress on January 7.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the bills in this  rule.   Mr. Speaker, only a few times in our history has Congress come  together to pass legislation to dramatically improve the life of every  American--Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, the Children's Health  Insurance Program, the Americans with Disabilities Act, Medicare's drug  benefit, and, of course, the Affordable Care Act. We change lives. We  save lives.   Now, we continue that work with H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower  Drug Costs Now Act. The passage of this bill will take this legislation  forward to join those momentous commitments to the health and security  of all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, we pay more for our prescription drugs than any other  country on Earth. We have made incredible advances in medical science  and developed cures not only for our own people but also for the rest  of the world. Yet, even when our own researchers and scientists have  dedicated their lives to creating lifesaving drugs, too many of our  fellow Americans can't afford to benefit from their brilliance.   In the United States today, a disease or a chronic condition can  force you into bankruptcy or require you to choose between paying for  medicine or paying for food or rent.  [[Page H10035]]    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3 makes fundamental reforms to reduce drug prices  to keep the cost hikes to no more than inflation and to limit out-of- pocket costs for those on Medicare, employer plans, and private health  insurance.   To help secure these patient protections, we will require our  government to negotiate prices directly with drug companies.   Mr. Speaker, I served as Secretary of Health and Human Services for 8  years in the Clinton administration. I repeatedly asked for the ability  to negotiate with drug companies.   Only drug companies get to come to Medicare and set their own prices.                                time  1245    Hospitals don't get to do that; doctors don't get to do that; home  healthcare agencies don't get to do that; and medical equipment  providers don't get to do that.   Negotiation is the hallmark of good governance and a standard feature  of government policy.   Mr. Speaker, we negotiate for everything, including military  equipment and work with contractors. If we can negotiate for big ships,  then we can negotiate for little pills. It is only drug companies that  are able to write themselves a blank check from our taxpayers. Our  legislation ends that practice.   Now is the time to join every other country on Earth in allowing our  government to bargain for better prices and to put a cap on our out-of- pocket costs.   As citizens, we have always been willing to subsidize poorer  countries. But subsidizing England, France, Canada, Germany, Australia,  Japan, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark is not our responsibility. We are  not their deep pockets.   Mr. Speaker, we should not pay substantially more for the same  medicines than people in those countries. The current broken system is  costing our families and businesses hundreds of billions of dollars. We  must not accept this waste or this unfairness any longer.   Our bill is a solid plan to reduce out-of-pocket healthcare costs for  every American, and it will create a huge savings for taxpayers.   These savings will allow us to make significant investments in the  extraordinary biomedical science institutions that foster innovation,  such as the National Institutes of Health and our great research  universities.   These savings will allow us to modernize Medicare hearing and vision  benefits and dental coverage.   This bill will expand our capacity for innovation and make drug  companies more efficient. H.R. 3 is a historic step forward, and it  will make all of our lives better.   Mr. Speaker, this rule also contains the Farm Workforce Modernization  Act of 2019. This bill empowers families to build lives in the United  States without the constant fear of being uprooted. It prioritizes the  well-being of immigrant families, many of whom provide essential  support for our Nation's agricultural sector. This bill is an important  step forward in improving our immigration system, in helping to make  sure that we treat everyone with compassion and dignity.   Finally, this rule also allows for consideration of the National  Defense Authorization Act conference report. The first NDAA under our  new Democratic majority fulfills one of Congress' crucial  constitutional duties: providing for the common defense of our Nation.   The final conference report delivers a wide-ranging list of  priorities the American people strongly support, such as paid parental  leave, the end of the widow's tax, better services for our men and  women in uniform, and protections for Dreamers.   This report is the product of months of hard work by Chairman Smith  and members of the committee and will undoubtedly keep our country  safe.   Mr. Speaker, I proudly support these historic steps forward. Let's  pass this rule and these bills.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Burgess).   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Lofgren), the distinguished chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on  Immigration and Citizenship.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Diaz-Balart), my colleague for representing Florida in the negotiations  so well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Hampshire  (Mr. Pappas).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Mrs. Trahan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we have heard doomsday predictions from my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle that our Nation's drug innovation will be  decimated by this bill. Mr. Speaker, if I thought this bill would slow  down or eliminate our brilliant biomedical research and development  enterprise, I would not support it.   Nothing could be further from the truth. The truth is that much of  our drug innovation starts with our own government-funded research paid  for by the taxpayers either at the National Institutes of Health or at  our great research universities, two of which I have led.   This bill provides critical additional investments in NIH. $10  billion will extend research investments in projects like Cancer  Moonshot to accelerate cancer research and make more therapies  available to more patients. It will also help fund innovation and  research for rare diseases and fighting antimicrobial resistance, which  currently kills 35,000 Americans per year.   This bill also makes explicit that pharmaceutical companies should be  able to recoup the costs of research and development and still make a  profit. Nine out of 10 Big Pharma companies spend more on marketing,  sales, and overhead than research. Maybe they won't be making as big of  a profit as they currently do because they will no longer be able to  take the American people to the cleaners, but they will make a  substantial profit.   Medicare will continue to cover all the drugs they cover today so  that patients' choices will not be limited. Rather, patients' choices  will be expanded. Patients will no longer be leaving drugs behind at  the pharmacy counter because they can't afford them.   It is time to end sky-high drug prices. It is also time to reform  Medicare benefits for the 21st century. This bill does exactly that by  finally adding vision, dental, and hearing benefits to the Medicare  program.   Seniors have been asking for this for a long time, and the quality of  life of millions of Medicare beneficiaries will improve with access to  these benefits.   I also look forward to the passage of the Farm Workforce  Modernization Act and the conference report for the NDAA. These are  bipartisan pieces of legislation that will improve our national  security and the lives of families and workers across this Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 758         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 13. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 2207) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986       to repeal the excise tax on medical devices. All points of       order against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any       amendment  [[Page H10042]]       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways       and Means; and (2) one motion to recommit.        Sec. 14. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 2207.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
