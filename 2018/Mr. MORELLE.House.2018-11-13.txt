 I thank the Speaker and his staff for the courtesies  they have extended to me.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank, first of all, my wife, Mary Beth; my  entire family; and many dear friends who have traveled to be with us  today and those at home watching for their unwavering love and support.  I would also like to thank my long-time friend, Congressman Eliot  Engel, for that  [[Page H9500]]  kind introduction and the warm welcome all my colleagues in the New  York delegation have extended to me.   I am humbled to take the oath of office. It is truly the honor of a  lifetime to serve New York's 25th District as a Member of the House of  Representatives.   Indeed, I have very big shoes to fill. Congresswoman Slaughter was  truly a remarkable individual who shattered ceilings and blazed trails.  More than that, she was a dear friend to me for over 30 years, and I  will be forever grateful for her guidance, devotion, and friendship. It  is a special privilege to be able to carry on her vital and important  work.   I look forward to the days ahead and our work together to support our  neighbors in need, to advance society for future generations, and to  build a stronger, more vibrant America.   Thank you, Mr. Speaker.                            ____________________
