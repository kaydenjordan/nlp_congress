 Mr. Speaker, I will start out by saying ISIS has been  destroyed. A few hundred troops will not stop the next terrorist dot- com, and that is never going to end. I am, frankly, tired of hearing  the sentiment on both sides that if we do not fight them there, they  will come here. There are way too many countries to apply that logic.   If we are so concerned, then why is the majority of the U.S.  Government stagnant on the southern border where it matters. Terrorists  are literally walking in.   Better yet, if that is a true concern, then why did we leave billions  of dollars in equipment during a botched withdrawal in Afghanistan? Do  you really think terrorist dot-coms aren't going to use that equipment  like ISIS did?   Peace is accomplished through superior firepower, strong leadership,  and a plan, not blunders of failed foreign policy literally repeating  itself.   We have zero strategic advantage and zero reason to be in Syria. In  fact, they don't even want us there.   Al-Assad and Putin are tight. If you check out some of Russia's naval  warships, they are actually hanging out in the western port of Syria.  What we need to be focusing on is a bigger issue like China.   Syria is a very dangerous place for us to be leaving a few hundred  Americans. We are better off sending those troops to places like South  America, where we can build stronger and useful allies who will  actually work with us.   Make no mistake, if we take China at their word, a near-peer fight is  coming. It will require 100 percent of our military and more than the  American people are going to pay for it. That is why I support this  resolution.   Mr. Speaker, if I can also add, to those of my colleagues that had  mentioned the Kurds, our NATO ally Turkiye, who is not the best NATO  ally, might I add, has deemed them a terrorist organization. After the  take-back of Mosul, we actually turned our back on them after promising  to recognize them as a nation at the United Nations.
