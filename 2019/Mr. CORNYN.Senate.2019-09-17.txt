 Mr. President, let me begin my remarks by thanking my  friend for, No. 1, visiting Texas this past weekend. We are next-door  neighbors. We share a lot in common. But, particularly, I want to thank  him for highlighting this injustice. It is shocking to me that a U.S.  Senator would have to introduce legislation to pass both Houses and get  the President's signature for people to get their money back from the  Federal Government. It is shocking, and I didn't know anything about it  until the Senator from Louisiana highlighted it, so I thank him for  that.   I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill and would encourage all of  our colleagues to join. I can't imagine why it couldn't pass by  unanimous consent. I don't even know why we need to process this  through the normal regular order, as we call it around here, but I wish  him good luck and certainly my constituents would like to see that $2.1  billion back in their pockets instead of the Federal Treasury. So I  thank him.    Mr. President, I have 5 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
