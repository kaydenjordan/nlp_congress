 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment is straightforward. It  directs the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to use its existing authority  to dredge Hampton Harbor in southern New Hampshire.   Hampton Harbor is New Hampshire's largest commercial fishing port,  and it is a lifeline to the ocean for New Hampshire fishermen. Severe  shoaling has made the water so shallow that it will soon become  unnavigable. Some vessels must wait for the tides to be at their  highest simply to enter the harbor. Over 1,500 recreational vessels,  emergency response and patrol boats, and numerous commercial lobster  and fishing boats could be cut off from the ocean.   The narrowing and shallowing of the harbor not only places  unnecessary costs on local businesses, it is also a safety hazard. As  access points to the harbor become tighter and the window for entering  the harbor safely narrows, more boats must enter and exit the harbor at  the same time. This greatly increases the risk of a collision.   A Hampton fisherman has warned in a letter to his local paper that:  ``Only a matter of time before there is a boat-to-boat or boat-to-wall  collision, which will result in major property damage and possible  human injury or death.''   This project must move forward as soon as possible. Mr. Chairman, I  urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment simply directs the Army  Corps of Engineers to expedite its existing Portsmouth Harbor  Navigation Improvement Project.   Portsmouth Harbor is vital to both New Hampshire's economy and our  national security. It is the only deep draft harbor located in the  State of New Hampshire and is the port of entry for fuels that generate  20 percent of New Hampshire's energy.                                time  1745    The harbor is also home to the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, where  Granite Staters work on our Nation's advanced nuclear submarines. It is  a challenging harbor to navigate--home to some of the fastest tidal  currents on Earth. That is why it is so important that the Portsmouth  Harbor project moves forward quickly. The harbor must remain safe and  navigable.   The skilled sailors of the United States Navy can navigate this  difficult waterway. It is vital that commercial traffic can also use  the harbor safely and that commercial vessels do not delay the  submarines' entry to the shipyard. In addition, a maritime incident  triggered by this difficult waterway could cause a devastating oil  spill that would negatively impact the shipyard.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
