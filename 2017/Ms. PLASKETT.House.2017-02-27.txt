 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include any extraneous material in the Record.    Mr. Speaker, the CBC chair, Mr. Cedric Richmond, and  myself have a great honor that I rise today as one of the anchors of  the CBC, the Congressional Black Caucus' Special Order hour.   For the next 60 minutes I have a chance to speak directly to the  American people on issues of great importance to the Congressional  Black Caucus, Congress, the constituents we represent, and all  Americans.   During this hour, as Black History Month ends in the next day, we  believe it is important for this Congress and  [[Page H1345]]  for the people of America to hear about the great importance of  grassroots movements, which have been the fortifying effect of the  civil rights movements and other movements here in this country, and  have made this country very great.   At this time I would yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Richmond), the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, who will speak  on this subject matter here on the floor.    Mr. Speaker, I really was moved by the portion that Mr.  Richmond talked about concerning outsiders coming to organizations and  coming to protests, and saying possibly that they are outsiders.   No. We are all American, and we will join with other individuals in  other areas that need our support and feel oppressed, and feel that  justice has not been on our side. That has been the Black American  experience. That is the American experience of civil protests and  working for a more perfect union.   Mr. Speaker, I yield time to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey),  who also wants to speak about, as we close Black History Month, some of  the accomplishments of Black Americans, of the Black movement here in  the United States as we move to becoming a more perfect union, and how  grassroots organizations have played a part in that role.                                time  2030     Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey)  knows that people like he and I would never be here, never have been  able to be educated without people who worked in laundry rooms, who  were blue-collar workers, policemen, others. Those gains from Dr. King  have afforded education and support and home ownership to the first  group of Black Americans who moved into the middle class and are here  in Congress now.   I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Evans) to speak on the issue of grassroots organizations.   I thank the gentleman for his leadership, all the work that he has  done for the people of Philadelphia in his tenure. We welcome him here  to the CBC hour and the information that he is going to share with us,  as well as all Americans, on this topic.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs.  Beatty), who is also a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, who  formerly led this Special Order hour and has been really a great mentor  and support for us here in this time. She will also speak about some of  the grassroots work that has been going on in the present time as well  as in the past during this Special Order hour.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the assistant leader of the Democratic Caucus,  for him to speak on the matter that is before the House at this time,  that being, grassroots movements in Black history and  [[Page H1348]]  its importance and relevance for us here today.    I thank you so much, Mr. James Clyburn. There can never  be enough time for you to tell these stories and to educate and  highlight to all of us the experiences that you have had personally, as  well as the importance of Black History Month, and particularly  Historically Black Colleges and Universities to the fabric of the  United States. Thank you so much, sir.   Mr. Speaker, as we have been discussing, often grassroots  organizations are actually born out of necessity, not only because the  system has not worked for them oftentimes, but sometimes because the  system has been created, has been reorganized, or is actively fighting  against them. Virgin Islanders understand the importance and the value  of grassroots organizations. It is our nature and our lifeblood. We are  a small people on a small island who have a history that was born out  of oppression. So the very need for grassroots organizations and people  who are resilient and willing to resist and fight in a passionate  manner has been our very nature.   Our first experience with grassroots organizations was in 1733, on  the island of St. John in the Virgin Islands, which is probably the  first slave uprising in the Western Hemisphere where a group of 150  slaves decided that they had had enough, and those Akwamu slaves of  Ghana decided that they were going to throw off the shackles and rebel  and organize themselves. They were so effective at it, Mr. Speaker,  that they were able to hold the island of St. John for 6 months against  the Danish Government. The Danes had to organize in such a manner that  they brought the French and the Swiss Government to provide assistance  to them. The slaves of St. John were quelled after that rebellion, but  it took a grassroots group of organized individuals to be able to do  that.   Again, on July 3 of 1848, many people don't know that the Virgin  Islands became the second place in the Western Hemisphere to receive  emancipation after Haiti. We did that on July 3, 1848, through the work  of General Buddhoe. But what people do not know is that John Buddhoe  had an enormous organizational group that plotted and planned for  months before the actual staging of that uprising, which was so  effective and so organized that when they went to storm the fort  against an armed militia, the militia didn't realize that all of the  gun powder had been taken out of the cannons and had been replaced with  molasses. The slaves were so organized and so quiet and kept to  themselves so much that they didn't even realize that it had been done.   The Governor of Denmark who was assigned to the Virgin Islands had to  sign the emancipation on that date because he knew that this group of  people were so organized that that rebellion could take the entire  island out. So we received our emancipation earlier than the African  Americans received theirs through that organization of grassroots.   Again, in October of 1878, the slaves had been moved not from slavery  to slavery but to an organized serfdom where there were labor contracts  that had to be signed. People were oppressed and living in what many  here would understand as the sharecropping system but was really a serf  system. Four women organized the labor rebellion at that time which we  in the Virgin Islands call the Fireburn. They were willing to burn the  islands down for just wages for themselves and laborers throughout the  islands. They forced the signed contracts to have much better wage laws  in them, much better terms in them for individuals. Those women were  imprisoned and sent to Denmark--many of them burned at the stake for  that rebellion. But it was grassroots organizations that were able to  do that.   More recently, in the 1950s, there was the creation of the Virgin  Islands Labor Union, the organizing of cane workers and field workers.  I am proud to say that my own uncle, Raymond Plaskett, was one of the  organizers of that. They were able to force the sugar plantation  owners, the sugar industry, to sit down and create unionized,  collective bargaining labels. But we would be remiss as a people if we  kept those organizational skills to ourselves, and we brought that to  the United States as well.   Many people know about Denmark Vesey who organized slave rebellions  in  [[Page H1350]]  South Carolina. He did that as a freeman, coming from the Virgin  Islands and understanding that oppression anywhere of anyone was an  oppression of himself, and gladly laid down his life and gave up his  freedom to help organize the people of Charleston, South Carolina, that  my great colleague, James Clyburn, represents to bring freedom to those  individuals.   Hubert Harrison from the island of St. Croix was a civil rights  activist. He was the mind of Pan-Africanism, along with Edward Blyden  of St. Thomas, who gave form and shape to Marcus Garvey and his  organizing of his Back-to-Africa movement.                                time  2115    More recently, Roy Innis, another relative of mine, was one of the  leaders of CORE, the Congress of Racial Equality. Stokely Carmichael  and Malcolm X are people of the Caribbean who have come to the United  States and recognized that grassroots organizations must be formed to  push for equal rights.   The accomplishments of the civil rights movement have given us much.  It created the momentum of the Civil Rights Act, Brown v. Board of  Education, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, ended housing discrimination,  the desegregation of schools. We saw Democratic political gains and the  March on Washington.   But we have organized groups still growing today, because equality  has not come to its full fruition in America. There is still income  equality, achievement gaps, poverty, unemployment, and an increase in  the use of for-profit prisons that have incarcerated Black men  disproportionately. Because of that, we have seen other movements now  today: Black Lives Matter, founded in 2012 after the death of Trayvon  Martin; Moral Mondays, which began in April 2013 by the Reverend  William Barber II of Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, North  Carolina, after the Governor's mansion and the State legislature was  taken over related to voting rights.   These are injustices that are continuing today, which African  Americans and others are standing up for, whether it be Standing Rock  or the Muslim ban. We had the March on Washington and the grassroots  group Indivisible, which has grown with African Americans and others  who stood with their constituents at recent townhalls to make sure that  their Congressmen and -women hear their voices on all issues of  importance.   Mr. Speaker, we understand that the people of the United States need  to understand the importance of grassroots organizations as we end  Black History Month. This has been an outstanding time for Congress, as  well as the people of America, to hear about the grassroots  organizations and how they may close.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
