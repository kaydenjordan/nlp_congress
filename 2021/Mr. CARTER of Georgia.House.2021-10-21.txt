 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers' Peace Officers Memorial Day  Ceremony.   Each year, the Federal Law Enforcement Training Centers engrave the  names of graduates who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty  during the previous year.   This ceremony commemorates another year that has been distinguished  by extraordinary law enforcement achievements but, unfortunately, has  been marred by tragedy and personal loss.   We must always remember those who have made the ultimate sacrifice  while protecting and serving our community.   Sadly, a total of 263 FLETC graduates have paid the ultimate  sacrifice since 1970. Tragically, we have had to add another 22 names  for last year alone.   Behind each and every one of these names there is a son, a daughter,  a husband, a mother, or a relative who misses their loved one.   To all of our police officers and Federal law enforcement officials,  thank you for your service to our communities and God bless you.   I hope that my colleagues will take some time to thank these  courageous individuals who work to keep us all safe.                      Remembering and Honoring Ann Ernst     Madam Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart  to remember and honor Ann Ernst of Savannah, Georgia, who sadly passed  away on October 5 at the age of 93.   Ann attended Chatham County public schools and Armstrong Junior  College and graduated from Valdosta State University with a degree in  biology. Following graduation, she worked at a research lab studying  malaria transmission and control.   Throughout her life, she was involved in teaching and inspiring the  Savannah community. She served as curriculum director at Hancock Day  School and taught children with learning disabilities at the Royce  Learning Center.   Cherished by the Savannah community for her contagious laughter and  love of life, Ann's immense impact was felt by everyone she knew.   I am thankful for Ann's lifetime of service, and I know her legacy  will be forever treasured.   My thoughts and prayers are with her family, friends, and all who  knew her during this most difficult time.                      Recognizing National Pharmacy Week     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize this  week as National Pharmacy Week.   Today we honor pharmacists and technicians across the Nation. During  [[Page H5732]]  this week, I would like to recognize all pharmacists across the United  States who ensure that Americans have access to important and often  lifesaving medications.   Every day pharmacists are directly involved in patient care, and  pharmacists are the most accessible healthcare professionals in the  country. Ninety-five percent of Americans live within five miles of a  pharmacy.   From administering flu shots to COVID-19 vaccines, pharmacists are a  vital resource in our communities, and they will continue to play an  active role in combating the virus. Because of their hard work, lives  will be saved.   Madam Speaker, I encourage everyone to get to know their pharmacists  and to thank them for the work that they do.   As a pharmacist currently serving in Congress, I thank all  pharmacists around the world. We can look forward to a brighter future  because of them.         Remembering and Honoring Dr. James Polk ``Jay'' Brinson, III     Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor former Wayne County superintendent, principal, and coach, Dr. Jay  Brinson, who sadly passed away at the age of 51.   Jay was proud to be a graduate of the Wayne County School System and  was a devoted Yellow Jacket throughout his life.   After graduating from Wayne County High School in 1988, he would  return to the school for a 29-year career. During this time, he was a  coach, a teacher, and an administrator with a personal mission to give  back to a community that he believed invested so much in him.   He retired as superintendent of Wayne County schools in March,  leaving a lasting impact on his students.   Above all, Jay was a man of dignity who led by example.   I am thankful for Jay's service to Georgia's First Congressional  District, and I know his legacy will remain.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and all who  knew him during this most difficult time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, the massive reconciliation  package that the House has been considering aims to fundamentally  change our country. Normally, an effort this huge is considered over  months and years instead of the expedited timeline we are on now.   That is why I am so glad my colleagues and I are taking this time to  highlight how they intend to dramatically change our country and the  consequences it will have.   Today, we focus on perhaps the most immediate problem we are facing:  illegal immigration. This is happening as we speak.   There were over 208,000 border apprehensions in August, a 317 percent  increase from the previous year. August was the second straight month  with over 200,000 apprehensions. What is worse, this is not a new  thing.   To quote The Washington Post, of all places, ``Illegal crossings  began rising last year but skyrocketed in the months after President  Biden took office.''   There have been over 1.3 million illegal border crossings under  President Biden. The Department of Homeland Security warns us to be  prepared for, next month, the possibility of 350,000 to 400,000 illegal  border apprehensions in October.   The United States has never--never--recorded that number of illegal  border apprehensions in a single month.                                time  1730    So we now know that this has been a problem in the past. It is still  a problem now. And it will even be worse in the future.   And what are Democrats doing about it since they are in control?   The Democrats have included a plan to grant amnesty for around eight  million illegal immigrants at a cost of $100 billion over the next 10  years. All of that money to granting amnesty instead of securing our  border.   I am a pharmacist by trade, so believe me when I say that the phrase  ``an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure'' is an  understatement here.   We are already paying the price for illegal immigration that is  harming our citizens. Over 6,000 pounds of deadly fentanyl has been  seized at the southern border since February, enough to kill every  American four times over.   That is dangerous. That is ludicrous. It is ridiculous.   At least 160,000 illegal immigrants have been released in the U.S.,  often with little supervision by the Biden administration since March.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle truly do not recognize  what is happening in our country and the world.   We need leadership to navigate these serious issues we face.   Folks, I have been to the border several times, and I can tell you it  is a disaster and a tragedy. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris simply do not  understand the problem or how to fix it.   However, I know that if Joe Biden and Kamala Harris wanted to  understand the cause of the crisis at the border, they need look no  further than the nearest mirror.   Every State has become a border State, and rather than support our  Border Patrol agents, the Biden administration has neglected them and  left our communities in danger. These people face threats in their  lives, abuse and manipulation from cartels and worse. These people have  been inundated with illegal aliens who have come across this border.   It is irresponsible to not only neglect the safety of Americans, but  this is a tragedy for those being misled that it is okay to come to  America illegally.   We cannot in good conscience continue policies that cause this much  harm and damage to everyone involved. Let's stop this insanity.
