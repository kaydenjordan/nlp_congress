 Mr. Speaker, last week in Columbus, Ohio, thousands of  American retirees gathered to demand Congress act.   Pension plans for more than 1 million retirees and union workers are  in danger of collapse if something is not done soon. More than 60,000  Ohio workers alone could be impacted, and millions across our Nation  face cuts in their earned retirement benefits.   Retirees traveled from as far as Utah to Columbus as the Select  Committee  [[Page H6274]]  on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans held a field hearing to hear  from retirees and employers. Their jobs ranged from coal miners to  truck drivers to candymakers.   As Perry Rapier from Pennsylvania said at the rally: ``We've worked  and sweat and toiled into this position, and we've earned that pension;  and now to know that somebody that's sitting behind a desk is willing  to take that from us, we're going to stand up and fight for that.''   Retirement security is an American value. Workers' pensions must be  protected. Congress must find a solution to their earned pensions and  give security to the retirement years of millions of hardworking  Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge this Congress to act before this Congress ends.                            ____________________     Madam Chairwoman, I thank Ranking Member Lowey for  yielding me this time.   Unfortunately, I must rise in strong opposition to this bill and its  litany of hollow choices and some dangerous choices.   First, on election security, a day after President Trump told the  whole world he believes Russian President Putin over our intelligence  community, while claiming Russia didn't hack our 2016 election, this  Republican bill provides zero election security grants to help our  States prepare against likely cyber interference.   Congress, as the first branch of government, must live up to our  constitutional obligation. Just months away from our 2018 elections,  President Trump essentially green-lit Putin's ongoing attacks.   Does this body wish to be complicit as we head toward 2018 and 2020?  This bill surely suggests so.   Further, this bill attacks clean water access by repealing the waters  of the United States rule without any public input regarding a  replacement. It puts America's waters and the health and well-being of  the American people at even greater risk, and it is a disservice to our  constituents.    I strongly oppose the rider that would block the Environmental  Protection Agency from addressing waste from animal feeding operations  under the Solid Waste Disposal Act. In my watershed, which drains the  tristate, binational region of North America into the western end of  Lake Erie, the equivalent of 42,500 boxcar loads of animal manure are  locally generated every year. That is trainloads of feces over 400  miles long every year seeping into the tributaries to the lake system  every year.   Additionally, the majority is far too eager to authorize massive  corporate giveaways in this appropriations bill.    Madam Chairwoman, their so-called CHOICE Act guts  essential safeguards that require banks to plan and prevent the kind of  financial catastrophe we saw in 2008. The only people who haven't been  brought to justice are the scoundrels on Wall Street who created the  mess.   I hope our colleagues will join me in opposing this bill. And let me  thank Chairmen Frelinghuysen, Graves, and Calvert, as well as Ranking  Members Lowey, McCollum, and Quigley for their efforts on this bill. I  know how hard it is to bring an appropriations bill to the floor, and I  am sorry I cannot support this one.
