 Mr. Speaker, I am so glad that my colleague invoked  God's name on the floor of the House. As I stand here, I can read the  words ``In God We Trust.''   We are blessed by a Nation that has the right and the protections to  express our faith, our love of the God we love. And so I thought this  morning I was compelled to come to the floor because I believe in a God  of love, and my Christian faith believes in the sacrifice He made so  that we might live and, as well, to recognize that He protects us all.   As we go through this road of trepidation with COVID-19, as I mourn  for more than 200,000 Americans, many of whom lost their lives because  of ill-fated policies by the administration, I thought it was  imperative that I speak to the souls of America because, as my  predecessor, the Honorable Barbara Jordan, I have faith in this Nation.  She was a good mentor for me and many others. She was a patriot, and I  have tried to be every day of my life.   I honor the men and women who put on the uniform, young boys and  girls almost, young men and women throughout the ages. I acknowledge  the fact that, even with bondage in their DNA, slaves volunteered, ex- slaves, to fight in the Civil War, but they fought in wars before,  including the Revolutionary War.   The heritage of African Americans and Black Americans in this country  is wrapped in the love of the Nation. The times that we have stepped  out to be able to demand justice for our Nation and for everyone, it  has not been against the flag; it has been to empower the flag to  symbolize the right thing.   How many people realize the number of African Americans who died  during the civil rights movement? I didn't say the Civil War. We lost  many in the civil rights movement.                                time  1000    Yes, we know, tragically, brave men and women who were not Black who  came to help lost their lives. The three Mississippi boys, Viola  Liuzzo, and others lost their lives because they believed in a better  America.   Then I am reminded of the beginnings of the takeover of a beautiful  country called Germany by Nazism. The words that I remember in a  historical perspective is: It was the silence that killed us.   Dr. King said that it is not the good people who fail, but it is  those who  [[Page H5117]]  stand by silently and say nothing--so, too, the head of this Nation.   It might have been a lot of bickering on Tuesday night in your mind,  Mr. Speaker, but I can say to you that it was a painful experience for  so many when we could not hear the simple words of condemnation of  white supremacy, even when, as the senior member of the Homeland  Security Committee, I have heard over and over again, a member of the  Judiciary Committee, Director Wray of the FBI that the most dangerous  domestic terrorist threat in the United States--not my words, his  words--is white supremacy, or those words coming, as well, from the  head of the Homeland Security Department, the Secretary.   I offered an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that  was adopted that directs the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress  the extent, if any, of the threat to national security posed by  domestic terrorist groups and organizations motivated by a belief  system of white supremacy such as boogaloo boys and proud boys  extremists. I am proud of the House. Obviously, it was adopted in a  bipartisan commitment. I am proud that Members joined in by their  acquiescence and affirmation that this is not America.   But over these last couple of days, social media is raging. When that  question was posed to the existing and sitting President of the United  States, we heard these words when they asked would you condemn the  proud boys' violence, ``stand back and stand by.''   Mr. Speaker, as I close, let me say that white supremacy is going to  strangle us and our values. I beg of this leadership and I beg of all  of us to stand against it, to fight against it, and to save lives,  because those lives are precious American lives, and we are not that  way. We are better than this, Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to efforts to legitimize violent  White Nationalists groups.   Over the last several months, I have raised concerns over the role  that Boogaloo and Proud Boys have played in bringing an element of  violence into the otherwise peaceful protests following the death of  George Floyd.   During the House Consideration of the NOAA, I offered an amendment  that was adopted to directs the Secretary of Defense to report to  Congress the extent, if any, of the threat to national security posed  by domestic terrorist groups and organizations motivated by a belief  system of white supremacy, such as the Boogaloo and Proud Boys  extremists.   During the first Presidential debate the President had the  opportunity to condemn Proud Boys, which he could not or would not do.   In the light of day, he claims ignorance of who or what Proud Boys  is--which sounds like the same words he used about not knowing David  Duke--a former Grand Wizard of the KKK who endorsed him during his  first Presidential Election.   The President in the interviews with Robert Woodward has proven  himself to be anything but ignorant or uninformed.   He has shown his willingness to use his knowledge for his benefit  while keeping his knowledge hidden from others at their expense.   What I know is that Congress has been briefed on the national  security threat posed by Proud Boys and Boogaloo Boys, which means the  President has also been briefed.   On May 30, 2019, the FBI issued an Intelligence Bulletin on Anti- Government, Identity Based, and Fringe Political Conspiracy Theories  Very Likely Motivate Some Domestic Extremists to Commit Criminal,  Sometimes Violent Activity, which includes the activities associated  with Proud Boys and Boogaloo Boys.   Proud Boys is described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate  group.   The ADL describes Proud Boys as:         Ideology: Primarily alt lite: Misogynistic, Islamophobic,       transphobic and anti-immigration. Some members espouse white       supremacist and anti-Semitic ideologies and/or engage with       white supremacist groups.    In sum, the Proud Boys is a far-right neo-fascist organization that  admits only men as members and promotes political violence.   The group believes men--especially white men--and Western culture are  under siege; their views have elements of white genocide conspiracy  theory.   While the group claims it does not support white supremacist views,  its members often participate in racist rallies, events, and  organizations.   The organization glorifies violence, and members engage in violence  at events they attend; the Southern Poverty Law Center has called it an  ``altright fight club''.   The President's message when asked about condemning the White  Supremist Group--Proud Boys, was to say to them ``Stand Back and Stand  By.''   It surprises absolutely no one that ``Stand Back and Stand By,''  means to be ready .   Ready for what?   The intelligence community has been sending warnings to the White  House and Congress that groups like Proud Boys are a threat to our  national security and have been waiting for someone like the President  to incite others to join them in order to grow their numbers to spread  violence.   As I speak, the Internet is ablaze with activity from the Proud Boys  in celebration and elation of their favorable recognition of the  President.   Proud Boys created a new image to signify the President's message to  them, ``Stand Back and Stand By.''   We know from experience how people like members of Proud Boys react  when they believe they have legitimacy from the President; they take it  as a license to continue their violent activities as we said four years  ago, culminating in Charlottesville, Virginia.   Proud Boys may use the phrase ``Stand Back and Stand By'' to describe  the overwhelming majority of white Americans who are not aware of or  interested in the activities of the group or any white supremist group,  but may intend to support this President in November despite his  obvious flaws.   The unfortunate truth for voters who think their vote this November  is not at risk of sending an affirming nod to Proud Boys or groups like  them--then they should think again.   President's own acts makes this election no longer about Red or Blue  States, Democrats and Republicans, but about whether you condone  racism, misogyny, or political and election violence.   White Nationalists will interpret every white voter's vote for Trump  as a vindication of their hate, misogyny, and rage against non-whites  and independent women.   Let us not be fooled, these groups hate a lot of things--and the  color of a person's skin is just one of those things--they also hate  women who are educated, who are leaders, who dare to think for  themselves; they hate white men who form families with persons of other  races, and they hate white men who will hire, promote, and support  persons of color and women in employment; they hate education, public  order, peace and justice that adhere to equality for all.   They do love one thing--violence.   Our role as Members of Congress is to defend and protect the American  people, no matter their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, or  country of origin.   White Nationalists have been busy looking for fights and igniting  violence at peaceful street protests.   We saw them in Charlottesville, Virginia and have seen them trying to  end state and local measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 and  carrying out violence at George Floyd protests.   Now the President is inviting Proud Boys to polling locations during  ballot casting.   COVID-19 is presenting a heightened barrier and challenge to voting  in the November 3rd election.   The validity of the American vote and the ability for Americans to  exercise their vote is in jeopardy from a President who seems to be at  war with the free and fair election process.   Over the years, it has become increasingly hard for citizens to  realize their voting rights--particularly for African Americans and  other minorities, as well as for students, the elderly, and individuals  with disabilities.   Voter suppression measures across the country in the past included:  new voter ID laws, reductions and cuts to polling places and early  voting, and purging of voter rolls, but today there are challenges  being made to mail-in voting during a time of COVID-19 when in-person  voting would pose health risks to many voters.   The doubts the President is seeking to create around mail-in voting  are resulting in significant burdens for individuals seeking to  exercise their most fundamental constitutional right.   With varied systems of election administration and technology,  polling place practices, and inexperienced poll workers, there is a  real and dangerous threat that White Nationalists may take this opening  provided by the President to compromise our nation's electoral process.   During a time when the voting rights of minorities and all Americans  are under the greatest attack since the passage of the Voting Rights  Act, it is imperative that the federal government take all necessary  steps to ensure that the right to vote and the entire electoral process  is fully protected and upheld.   It is important to know and understand that the Voting Rights Act and  the Civil Rights Act never mention color, ethnicity, or race.   Both of these laws are to preserve and protect basic human rights and  dignity owed to each person.  [[Page H5118]]    This may be the election year when the voting rights of a majority of  Americans may need both of these laws.   That is why I am asking the Department of Justice, pursuant to its  statutory authority and consistent with its historic role as a guardian  of civil rights and liberties, to take immediate action and investigate  the full scope of vulnerabilities, security threats and breaches to our  electoral and voting process posed by groups like Proud Boys.   This President finds it too difficult to call out those among us who  are the truly abhorrent and objectionable because they are at the heart  of his political base.   The violence seen during the recent national movement to end the  deaths of unarmed black men while in police custody is not the start of  the events that have led to the Boogaloo movement or Proud Boys  activity.   Groups like these have been around for over a century, most notable  is the KKK, which is why they should not be invited to visit polling  locations during a public election.   According to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), in the immediate  aftermath of Election Day, a wave of hate crimes and lesser hate  incidents swept the country with 1,094 bias incidents recorded in the  first 34 days following Trump's Election on November 8, 2016.   Of these incidents, the SPLC reports that anti-immigrant incidents  (315) remain the most reported, followed by antiblack (221), anti- Muslim (112), and anti-LGBT (109).   Anti-Trump incidents numbered 26 (6 of which were also anti-white in  nature, with 2 non-Trump related anti-white incidents reported).   The threats from White Nationalist groups range from decentralized  and leaderless accelerationist networks using social media platforms,  such as the Boogaloo movement, to more structured, far-right militia  extremist groups.   The ideologies undergirding these movements or groups have some  similarities to other anti-government and white supremacist beliefs but  are often not tied to a single, monolithic ideology.   In addition, in many cases, their adherents' decentralized, and coded  use of digital tools poses unique challenges for law enforcement and  government officials to identify and track their activity.   These developments in domestic terrorism, as reported in the media  and government intelligence reports--coupled with recent arrests and  successful violent attacks carried out by ``Boogaloo boys'' and militia  extremists--are troubling.   My concern is that as the nation moves towards a historic national  election, the activity of violence instigators like Boogaloo Boys or  Proud Boys will increase and lead to attacks becoming more frequent.   This view is heightened given the President's instructions to Proud  Boys to ``Stand Back'' and ``Stand By.''   The domestic terrorism issues of greatest concern to me are:   The number of incidents, although small in number, that have involved  government employees, contractors or military personnel;   The targeting of places of worship;   Politically motivated attacks or attempted attacks; and   Use of Social media for domestic and international hate groups to  collaborate and stoke hate.   Icreasingly everyday the President confirms his candidacy as  candidate of white supremacy.   A quote from Lincoln's address to Congress in December 1862 come to  mind, when he said to this body:   ``Fellow-citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this Congress and  this administration, will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No  personal significance, or insignificance, can spare one or another of  us. The fiery trial through which we pass, will light us down, in honor  or dishonor, to the latest generation. We say we are for the Union. The  world will not forget that we say this. We know how to save the Union.  The world knows we do know how to save it. We--even we here--hold the  power and bear the responsibility.''   Due to the rise in online activity of these groups spurred by the  President's comments many law enforcement jurisdictions around the  nation must prepare for the violence that may come as these groups seek  to act out in advance of the election.   This will put additional strain on the budgets of local and state law  enforcement agencies already burdened with COVID-19 emergency measures  and tight budgets caused by the economic collapse due to this  Administration's mismanagement of COVID-19.   Congress must send a unified message that there is no place in the  body politic for these groups or these views.   I invite my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to do what the  President did not do by joining me and Vice President Biden and  millions of Americans in condemning the White Supremist Groups.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania and thank my colleagues for this vigorous discussion and  the unanimous consent.   I want to give them comfort. Tomorrow, we will be able to vote on the  Heroes bill that we ask each and every one of them to support to  provide moneys not only for small businesses but nonprofits and faith  institutions because we believe in the American people, and we are  going to keep them working.   I look forward to them joining this bipartisan effort, supporting the  Heroes bill that we have offered under the leadership of Speaker  Pelosi.                                time  1245    I rise today to support both H. Res. 1153 and H. Res. 1154.   I traveled to Irwin County this past weekend, but my exposure to this  tragedy was not just that day; just last week, with butterflies in my  stomach, if you will, and concern for a young woman, 29 years old,  about to enter onto a plane that she obviously was directed to go to a  place that she had never been, or had not been since she was 2 years  old, a young woman from Cameroon who did have, who admits that her  fallopian tube was removed without her consent.   So people of color are not unused to having medical procedures  without our consent. Women are not unused to and unfamiliar with having  medical procedures without their consent.   Think about these women, speaking mostly a different language,  detained for civil matters, and that is, not being statused. Young  women, women intimidated in the midst of COVID-19 in a facility where  there is one physician who is supposed to be an OB/GYN, and you are  carted off like cattle in a bus with one diagnosis: Oh, you need a  fallopian tube removed.   Let my friends on the other side of the aisle be reminded that they  have been throwing the word ``uterus'' and other words around the floor  of the House.    Madam Speaker, this is not a condemnation of ICE.  Read the language. It just says that they should engage in more  vigorous oversight, and they are doing that with an inspector general's  investigation.   Look at this. This is from one of the women:   Liberty, we are daughters and we are mothers, but you are stopping us  from doing that.   And H. Res. 1154 that I join in supporting, as well, condemning  QAnon, talks about a better America, that we are not the way it is  described in this resolution.   I ask my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying bills  because we are daughters and we are mothers, and what is going on there  is an atrocious condition that should not exist.   I ask my colleagues to join me, and I thank my good friend from  Pennsylvania for yielding.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committee on  the Judiciary and Co-Chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I  rise in strong support of H.R. 7718, the ``Protecting the Health and  Wellness of Babies and Pregnant Women in Custody Act,'' introduced by  our colleague Congresswoman Bass of California.   This legislation requires the Bureau of Justice Statistics to collect  and report data relating to the demographics and physical and mental  health needs of incarcerated women who are pregnant, in labor, or in  post-partum recovery, at the Federal, State, tribal, and local levels.   In addition, the bill will help ensure that appropriate medical  services and programs related to pregnancy and childbirth are provided  in the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) and made available to women in custody.   The bill also prohibits the use of restraints or restrictive housing,  while in BOP or U.S. Marshals Service custody, during the period of  pregnancy, labor, and postpartum recovery, unless these measures are  necessary.   Over the past four decades, the total U.S. prison population has  skyrocketed.   There are almost 2.3 million people currently in our nation's prisons  and jails, 36 which represents a more than 500 percent increase over  the last 40 years.   During the period from 1980 to the present, the federal prison  population has grown from approximately 25,000 to 180,000--an increase  of over 600 percent.   A topic that is not as widely discussed is the fact that women are  the fastest-growing segment of the incarcerated population.   In the same time period, the number of women in the state prison  population has grown by 834 percent, at more than double the pace of  men.   Today, the overall incarcerated population has begun to decrease  slightly, although almost all of the reduction has been among men, and  the proportion of incarcerated women remains on the rise.   Since 2000, the jail incarceration rate for women has risen 26  percent while the rate for men has fallen by 5 percent.   In addition, at the present time, there are more women in prison than  at any point in U.S. history.   Nationally, 64 out of every 100,000 women were in prison in 2016.   Since 2013, the percentage of women prosecuted federally has  consistently hovered around 13 percent.   At the state level, the rate at which women are incarcerated varies  greatly; the state with the highest rate of female imprisonment is  Oklahoma and the states with the lowest incarceration rates for women  are Rhode Island and Massachusetts.  [[Page H5149]]    In 35 states, women's incarceration numbers have been higher than  men's, and in a few states, the growth of women's prison populations  have counteracted any reductions in men's incarceration numbers.   Further, women in jail are the fastest growing correctional  population in the country, increasing 14-fold between 1970 and 2014.   This trend is even greater in small counties, where there has been a  31-fold increase between 1970 and 2014.   Significantly, nearly half of all incarcerated women are held in  jails.   Mr. Speaker, somewhere between 3 percent and 6 percent of women  entering the prison system are pregnant, with the highest rates of  pregnancies being in local jails.   Statistics from the Bureau of Prisons show that there were 171  pregnancies in federal prison in 2018.   While the prison health care system is barely adequate for men, it  fails to meet incarcerated women's basic needs.   The situation is even more dire for pregnant women in prison who have  additional and unique health needs.   A significant portion of women come into the prison system with a  history of poverty, substance abuse, and trauma and abuse.   Women who enter prison are also less likely to have had access to  regular health care before their incarceration, especially appropriate  prenatal care.   Moreover, women in prison are more likely to suffer from undiagnosed  chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, that can  cause a high-risk pregnancy.   Another salutary aspect of H.R. 7718 is that provides education and  technical assistance by the National Institute of Corrections to state  and local corrections facilities on appropriate medical care for  pregnant women and to ensure training of BOP correctional officers at  facilities housing women and of deputy U.S. Marshals, on the  requirements of the bill.   Finally, the legislation directs GAO to study and report to Congress  the services and protections provided for pregnant incarcerated women  in local and State correctional settings and in Federal pretrial  detention facilities and authorizes the Attorney General to make grants  to State, tribal, and local governments, to promote and support the  health needs of incarcerated pregnant women.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 7718 complements and expands on the SIMARRA Act I  introduced in the 114th and 115th Congress (i.e., H.R. 5130, H.R. 3410)  and incorporated in the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act,  legislation which directs the Bureau of Prisons to establish a pilot  program to allow incarcerated women who give birth and children born  during such incarceration to reside together in a separate prison  housing unit.   I strongly support this legislation and urge all Members to join me  in voting to pass H.R. 7718, the ``Protecting the Health and Wellness  of Babies and Pregnant Women in Custody Act.''    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committee on  the Judiciary, I rise in strong support of H.R. 8225, the ``Fight  Notario Fraud Act,'' introduced by the gentlelady from Florida,  Congresswoman Murcasel-Powell.   I support this legislation because it protects persons who are the  most vulnerable in society against unconscionable predatory conduct  from fraudulent ``notarios publicos'' who use the ``notary public''  title to hold themselves out as authorized to provide immigration legal  advice and services.   Specifically, H.R. 8225 would criminalize the provision of fraudulent  legal services, certain misrepresentations by individuals who claim to  be authorized to practice immigration law, and threats and retaliation  associated with the provision of fraudulent legal services.   Additionally, the bill would require the Attorney General to create  no fewer than 15 Special United States Attorney positions to prosecute  notario fraud crimes.   Mr. Speaker, the roots of modern ``notario fraud'' in the United  States stem from a practice in parts of Latin America where ``notarios  publicos,'' (which could be literally translated to ``notaries  public'') are lawyers and, as such, are authorized to provide legal  services.   Unlike in the United States, because ``notario pblicos'' in Latin  America have a law license and can represent others in court, many  Spanish-speaking immigrants in the United States turn to notaries  thinking they are attorneys able to represent them in legal  proceedings, especially cases involving immigration claims.   On account of linguistic and cultural differences in meaning, notario  fraud disproportionately targets immigrants from Latin America who are  not fluent English speakers or familiar with the difference between the  Latin American and American legal systems.   Notarios often gain the trust of the immigrant families they defraud,  making extravagant promises and preying on the desperation of families.   The effect of the breach of trust can often be dire and multifaceted.  Notarios often make mistakes in these filings and proceedings, which  can result in irreversibly negative immigration consequences for their  clients.   A notario's legal errors can lead to an unfavorable review in  immigration courts and may prejudice the immigrant-appellant on appeal.   Fly-by-night notarios may skip town with important documentation  immigrants need to file for immigration relief or they may apply for  relief without the immigrant-applicant's knowledge.   A notario's advice to a parent may impact the separate and  independent relief a child applicant may have.   Currently, equitable relief for this malfeasance is not available in  the immigration proceedings and, even worse, defrauded immigrants can  be charged with filing false claims.   Immigrants have been defrauded of hundreds or even thousands of  dollars by unscrupulous notarios only to find out they will not receive  the services they were promised and, in some cases, these individuals  find themselves in worse conditions than when they originally sought  help with their immigration matters.   After they discover that they have been bilked, many immigrants are  afraid to report notaries; by some estimates, only one in every hundred  cases are reported.   In one civil action initiated by the Federal Trade Commission in  2011, investigators recovered evidence of 2,785 defrauded immigrants,  but only 99 consumer complaints associated with the notario grifter--a  reporting rate of 3.55 percent.   Because many of the victims of notarios also do not have legal  immigration status, they fear negative immigration outcomes if they  attempt to bring a complaint.   Courts across the country have recognized the widespread prevalence  of notario fraud.   The proposed explicit criminalization of notario fraud is necessary  to focus criminal fraud prosecution on widespread scams that target  some of the least sophisticated and most vulnerable individuals in our  society.   I strongly support this legislation and urge all Members to join me  in voting for its passage.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Bass) for yielding me the time.   I hope my time has not started running. We are trying to be COVID-19  safe.   Mr. Speaker, let me thank the sponsor of this bill, Mr. Deutch, and  his bipartisan cosponsors, and indicate my strong support for H.R.  6813, Promoting Alzheimer's Awareness to Prevent Elder Abuse, and to  let him know that this is something that I think is enormously  important and is seen throughout our districts.   As I talk about this legislation, however, let me say what a pleasure  it was for me to do a video to celebrate our virtual walk right in  Houston, Texas, 2020 Walk to End Alzheimer's, where thousands will be  walking in their front yards, they will be walking in backyards, they  will be walking on trails, they will be walking in parks. They will be  committed to ending Alzheimer's through the Houston Alzheimer's  Association and the region.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank them for their great leadership. I have  joined them every year at the University of Houston. These are  committed and dedicated caretakers and others who want to make sure  that they keep seniors safe.   This bipartisan legislation strengthens the Elder Abuse Prevention  and Prosecution Act passed by Congress in 2017 by providing for better  collection and use of data on elder abuse and requiring the Department  of Justice's Elder Justice coordinator to develop best practices and  training materials for professionals treating, protecting, and caring  for people living with Alzheimer's and related dementia.   This is an important initiative with a companion bill.   According to the National Council on Aging, seniors who have been  abused have a 300 percent higher risk of death when compared to those  who have not been mistreated. Combine that with COVID-19 and caretakers  getting COVID-19 and sometimes strange persons coming in to take care  of your loved one. This is an important initiative.   During the current pandemic, the health and safety of people living  with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia are at an even greater  risk. Approximately 7 out of 10 residents in long-term facilities have  some form of cognitive impairment, with 29 percent having mild  impairment, 23 percent moderate impairment, and 19 percent severe  impairment.   We know when the misguided recommendations came from the Federal  Government that it was only elders that got COVID-19, we understood  that, of course, that was not true, but we know COVID-19 was in nursing  homes.    Mr. Speaker, so this is, of course, a very important  initiative for helping to safeguard our elder population.   But more importantly, I want to say that we need to end Alzheimer's,  or dementia, as we know it, and I join my colleagues in supporting this  very important legislation.   I know Mr. Deutch's commitment to fighting Alzheimer's, ending it in  our lifetime, providing a cure, and also to end elder abuse.   Mr. Speaker, I ask everyone to support H.R. 6813.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committee on the Judiciary and  as a cosponsor, I rise in strong support of H.R. 6813, the ``Promoting  Alzheimer's Awareness to Prevent Elder Abuse Act,'' introduced by  Congressman Deutch of Florida.   This bipartisan legislation strengthens the Elder Abuse Prevention  and Prosecution Act passed by Congress in 2017, by providing for better  collection and use of data on elder abuse and requiring the Department  of Justice's Elder Justice Coordinator to develop best practices and  training materials for professionals treating, protecting, and caring  for people living with Alzheimer's and related dementias.   Companion legislation (S. 3703) passed the Senate on August 6, 2020.   Mr. Speaker, according to the National Council on Aging, seniors who  have been abused have a 300 percent higher risk of death when compared  to those who have not been mistreated.   During the current pandemic, the health and safety of people living  with Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia are at even greater risk.   Approximately seven out of ten residents in long-term care facilities  have some form of cognitive impairment, with 29 percent having mild  impairment, 23 percent moderate impairment, and 19 percent severe  impairment.   According to one study, over 50 percent of nursing home staff  admitted to mistreating (e.g. physical violence, mental abuse, neglect)  older patients within the prior year.   With current social isolation measures limiting contact with family  members and other visitors, these individuals are at even greater risk  of abuse and exploitation.   Several federal agencies currently collect elder abuse data on an  ongoing basis. Two distinct data sets include the National Adult  Mistreatment Report System (NAMRS) (which collects state-level adult  protective services data) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network  (FinCEN) (which collects data on suspected elder financial exploitation  submitted by financial institutions).   Although many cases may go unreported, the National Adult  Mistreatment Report System (NAMRS) (which collects state-level adult  protective services data) reflects data on elder abuse cases reported  to state and local authorities.   Based on the most currently reported data, neglect comprised the  highest percentage across types of elder abuse, followed by financial  exploitation.   Financial exploitation causes large economic losses for elders,  families, businesses, and government programs, and one of the key  factors that makes the elderly more susceptible to financial  exploitation is cognitive decline.   According to data collected by the Financial Crimes Enforcement  Network (FinCEN), financial exploitation lasts longer than average in  cases where the targeted person has a diminished cognitive capacity.   Such person are particularly vulnerable to scams as their condition  makes it more difficult for them to communicate the crimes to law  enforcement or to seek critical assistance from first responders or  other social services personnel.   People living with Alzheimer's or dementia often have difficulty  understanding or explaining situations; and their behaviors may be  misunderstood as uncooperative, disruptive or combative.   The Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act required the Justice  Department to create training materials to help criminal justice,  health care, and social services personnel assess and respond to elder  abuse cases.   Under the Act, the Elder Justice Coordinator is responsible for  evaluating training models to determine best practices and creating or  compiling and making publicly available replication guides and training  materials for law enforcement officers, first responders, social  workers,  [[Page H5163]]  prosecutors, judges, individuals working in victim services, adult  protective services, medical personnel, mental health personnel,  financial services personnel, and any other individuals that encounter  and support people living with Alzheimer's and other types of dementia.   The legislation before us builds upon existing requirements for  training materials by requiring the Elder Justice Coordinator to engage  in greater consultation with relevant entities and stakeholders.   H.R. 6813 would also require further training materials relating to  victims and witnesses who have Alzheimer's disease and related  dementias.   One study determined that a significant subset of individuals with  dementia illnesses could reliably report on emotional events and were  even able to report details of the event accurately and to recall the  same event with the same accuracy after a short time delay.   Crime victims with dementia should be evaluated for their ability to  remember emotional events in order to determine whether they can  provide testimony about the criminal events.   This legislation would require the Elder Justice Coordinator to  develop specific training materials for these types of cases.   The bill also aligns with the latest recommendations from the  National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, which includes  disseminating information on abuse of this vulnerable population and  educating law enforcement about interacting with these individuals.   Mr. Speaker, dementia-specific training materials will improve the  quality of professionals' interactions with individuals living with  Alzheimer's and other dementia, and will also help protect them from  elder abuse and exploitation.   Mr. Speaker, in this time when the nation is being ravaged by the  coronavirus pandemic, greater dissemination of best practices and  improved training materials will help first responders, law  enforcement, medical professionals and other individuals effectively  interact with people living with Alzheimer's and other dementia who are  targeted by fraud and in need.   I strongly support this legislation and urge all Members to join me  in voting for its passage.    Mr. Speaker, as a cosponsor and a senior member of  the House of Representatives, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5068,  the ``Women Who Worked on the Home Front World War II Memorial Act,''  which would authorize the establishment of a memorial on federal land  in the District of Columbia, commemorating the efforts of the 18  million American women who kept the home front running during World War  II.   I would like to thank Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton for  introducing this important piece of legislation.   It is no secret that women are dramatically underrepresented when it  comes to our memorials.   Despite being instrumental in maintaining the stability of the  country during World War II, the women of World War II have not  received much recognition for their contributions.   This bill would change that by authorizing the Women Who Worked on  the Home Front Foundation to establish a memorial to honor these women.   The memorial is designed to be interactive and to educate visitors on  the crucial roles women played during World War II.   For instance, millions of American women took jobs to support their  families and the country at large during World War II, forever  redefining what ``women's work'' looked like.   In fact, more than 10,000 women served behind the scenes of World War  II as codebreakers.   Women were also trained to fly military aircraft so that male pilots  could leave for combat duty overseas.   More than 1,100 female civilian volunteers flew nearly every type of  military aircraft as part of the Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP)  program.   WASPs flew planes from factories to bases, transported cargo and  participated in simulation strafing and target missions.   Between 1940 and 1945, the percentage of women in the workforce  increased from 27 percent to nearly 37 percent, and, by 1945, one in  four married women worked outside of the home.   The work done by women on the home front had a profound effect on the  job market going forward.   As the nation continues to mourn the loss of the `Notorious RBG', an  unmatched constitutional scholar and Supreme Court Justice who  irrevocably advanced the women's movement, I can think of no better way  to honor her legacy than by voting for this bill to commemorate the  women whose sacrifices and decisions to enter the workforce during  World War II also helped to change perceptions about gender roles in  society.   We, as Members of Congress, have a duty to recognize and celebrate  these revolutionary patriots for their service to this country.   As a proud leader of this bill, I encourage my fellow colleagues to  vote in favor of H.R. 5068.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House  Judiciary Committee, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5139, the ``Stop  Sexual Assault and Harassment in Transportation Act,'' which  establishes formal sexual assault and harassment policies for the  transportation industry.   I would like to thank Congressman DeFazio for his leadership on this  vital piece of legislation.   While the United States prides itself for being an innovator and  leader in transportation, we are severely lacking in our protections of  personnel and travelers from sexual assault and harassment.   There have been too many accounts of women and children being  sexually assaulted on airplanes and groped on crowded trains, as well  as flight attendants being sexually harassed daily in their workplaces.   According to a survey of students at San Jose State University  conducted by Metro Magazine, almost two-thirds (63 percent) of  respondents had experienced some form of harassment while using  transit.   Verbal harassment was the most common form of harassment, with 41  percent experiencing ``obscene/harassing language'' and 26 percent  being subjected to sexual comments.   Among non-verbal types of harassment, 22 percent had been stalked and  18 percent had been victims of indecent exposure.   With respect to physical harassment, 11 percent of students had  experienced groping or inappropriate touching.   These facts and figures are representative of a larger issue of  sexual assault and harassment in the public transportation industry  across the country.   Things must change.   H.R. 5139 seeks to help prevent sexual assaults and sexual harassment  on airplanes, buses, passenger vessels, commuter and intercity  passenger railroads, and ridesharing vehicles by establishing formal  policies to which transportation providers must adhere.   For example, passenger transportation providers are required to  facilitate the reporting of sexual harassment and assault incidents,  develop procedures that limit or prohibit future travel for individuals  who perpetuate these incidents, as well as train personnel to recognize  and respond to such incidents.   The bill also establishes a maximum civil penalty of $35,000 for  individuals who physically or sexually assault transportation  personnel.   Furthermore, H.R. 5139 not only establishes a data collection program  within the Department of Transportation regarding the number of  incidents of sexual assault or harassment reported by transportation  personnel and passengers each year, but it also streamlines the  reporting process for individuals involved in an incident.   By doing so, individuals will be able to report allegations to law  enforcement in a confidential and separate manner from the reporting  processes offered by the transportation provider.   It is simply not enough to condemn sexual harassment and assault.   It is time for actionable solutions that stop these incidents from  occurring altogether, and this bill is a great step in that direction.   I encourage my fellow colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 5139.    Mr. Speaker, the American people cannot wait. Help  is on the way, and the only thing I can ask from my Republican friends  is to  [[Page H5425]]  take a walk in neighborhoods in their districts around the Nation where  mothers and fathers are waiting on a disbursement needed to put food on  their table.   This $2.2 trillion bill is going to help businesses, nonprofits, and  faith institutions with the PPP. It is going to give us protective  equipment. Yes, the engine of our communities, small independent  restaurants, are getting close to $120 billion; more funds to bolster  education and childcare; schools that cannot open because they do not  have the resources; money for testing--I have opened 33 testing sites  in our neighborhoods; contact tracing, of course; making sure the  cities' and counties' essential workers and hazard pay is paid.   Is anyone asking the American people if they are suffering and need  this resource to help them? To fight COVID-19, we have to stop the  evictions; stop the foreclosures; give healthcare, clothes, food, and  security; make sure we take care of small businesses, education; and  give our people a lifeline.   The American people can't wait. Now is the time to help them. Vote on  the Heroes Act for this money and this relief.    Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committees on  the Judiciary and on Homeland Security, I rise in strong support of  Senate amendments to H.R. 925--America's Conservation Enhancement Act  (an update of The Heroes Act), a much needed installment of the  necessary assistance and relief provided by Congress to address the  adverse health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.   To date, there are more than 7,213,419 confirmed cases, over 206,402  dead, including 748,967 cases and 15,711 deaths in my home state of  Texas.   I want to thank our frontline healthcare workers and essential  workers for their sacrifice and commitment during this crisis.   I have worked along side medical professionals and public health  experts in my city of Houston to open 33 remote testing sites.   This update of the HEROES Act provides an additional $2.2 trillion  for protects lives, livelihoods and the life of our democracy.   This update to the HEROES Act is needed in order to have the economic  vitality to reopen that allows a science-based path to safely reopen  our country and helping ensure that every American can access free  coronavirus treatment.   In support this legislation also because it provides strong support  for our heroes fighting the pandemic on the front lines with nearly $1  trillion for state, local, territorial and tribal governments who  desperately need funds to pay the health care workers, police, fire,  transportation, and EMS personnel, along with teachers and other vital  workers who keep us safe and are in danger of losing their jobs.   The Heroes Act update provides for: small businesses, by improving  the Paycheck Protection Program to serve the smallest businesses and  struggling nonprofits, hard-hit businesses with second loans, and  targeted assistance for the struggling restaurant industry and  independent live venue operators.   The bill also provides additional assistance for airline industry  workers, extending the highly successful Payroll Support Program to  keep airline industry workers paid.   There are more funds to bolster education and childcare, with $225  billion for education--including $182 billion for K-12 schools and  nearly $39 billion for postsecondary education--and $57 billion to  support child care for families.   Another reason to support this bill is that it puts money in the  pockets of workers with a second round of direct payments to families  of $1,200 for adults and $500 for each child, new payroll protection  measures to keep 60 million workers connected with their jobs, and  restores the weekly $600 federal unemployment payments through January  2021.   On top of that, by taking the necessary measures to slow the pandemic  and `flatten the curve' so as not to overwhelm the nation's health care  system, economic activity in the United States has experienced a severe  shock to the system.   There have been more than 36 million initial unemployment claims in  the past month alone.   In addition, on March 23, 2020, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  (DJIA) dipped to 18,321.62, which is even lower than it was on Election  Night 2016, and far below the 19,827 mark where it stood on January 20,  2017.  [[Page H5433]]    In other words, Mr. Speaker, all the gains that were made to the  stock market and heralded by this Administration as evidence of its  genius have been wiped out, depleting the retirement savings and 401(k)  fund of millions of ordinary Americans.   The situation is so dire that Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell,  appointed by the current President, stressed the importance of Congress  providing further fiscal relief, stating this week:   ``While the economic response has been both timely and appropriately  large, it may not be the final chapter, given that the path ahead is  both highly uncertain and subject to significant downside risks.  Additional fiscal support could be costly, but worth it if it helps  avoid long-term economic damage and leaves us with a stronger  recovery.''   The U.S. economy lost over 20 million jobs in April with the  unemployment rate spiking to 14.7 percent, the worst since the Great  Depression, but actual job losses were near 20 percent according to  some estimates.   And in addition to the highly inequitable gender and racial impacts,  this economic downturn reveals a strong class dimension to the  unemployment wave, with 18.1 million of the 19.5 million jobs lost in  the private sector last month classified as production and  nonsupervisory workers as opposed to managers.   So, we have simultaneously a public health emergency and an economic  calamity, both of which are addressed in the legislation before us.   But before we can get back on our feet economically and restore the  booming economy inherited by the current Administration, Americans must  be assured and confident that there is a plan and strategy to combat  COVID-19; and the resources and commitment needed to implement the plan  and execute the strategy.   And that means testing, testing, and more testing, along with contact  tracing.   Mr. Speaker, the occasion demands that we rise, and I urge all  Members to join me in voting to pass H.R. 925--America's Conservation  Enhancement Act (an update of The Heroes Act).    Mr. Speaker, I take this time to not only speak to  the American people about voting, but also just take a brief moment to  pay a beginning tribute to Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. She deserves a  much longer period of acknowledgment, and I am going to do so as we  return back to Washington in the coming days and weeks. In fact, I  believe that we should dedicate weeks and days of honoring Justice  Ginsburg, even in the midst of this potential nomination to replace  her.   I want to speak to the American people as we begin our journey toward  November 3 and let them know of the precious right to vote, that  citizenship gives them that very precious right to make their own  decision. I have no right to tell them that, but as a Member of the  United States Congress, I have an obligation to ensure that their vote  is protected, however they vote.   I must ensure that there is a truthful understanding of mail ballots.  Some States have been voting with mail ballots for decades. I must  ensure that the mail ballots are protected, the early vote is  protected, and, as well, it is protected on November 3.   I just want to indicate, Justice Ginsburg said in the Shelby case  that the majority's logic was akin to ``throwing away your umbrella in  a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.''   Justice Ginsburg believed in voting and voting protection. Let's pay  tribute to her and vote.   Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader  Ginsburg, who died on Friday, September 18, 2020 at the age of 87 years  old.   As a direct beneficiary of her advancement of women's rights and a  long-time admirer of her vigorous defense of the Constitution, I am  honored but heartbroken to pay tribute to Justice Ginsburg, an American  hero, feminist icon, and role model to millions.   Today, tomorrow, and forever, the American people mourn the loss of a  true titan, an American legend, and an inspiration.   Our thoughts and prayers are with Ruth's family, friends, and loved  ones.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg dedicated her life to defending the Constitution  and protecting the sanctity of America's democratic ideals, and we will  forever be indebted to her service to this country.   Joan Ruth Bader, fondly nicknamed Kiki, was born on March 15, 1933 to  an immigrant family and grew up in Brooklyn's Flatbush neighborhood.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg often spoke of her mother's large ambitions for  her, and how the devastating loss of her mother's death at an early age  instilled in her the determination to live a life that her mother would  have been proud of.   And so, she did.   Ruth Bader attended Cornell University where she met Martin D.  Ginsburg, her future husband and love of her life to whom she was  married for 54 years.   At the age of 21, Ruth Bader graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Cornell  with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Government on June 23, 1954, and was  the highest-ranking female student in her graduating class.   A month after graduating from Cornell, Ruth and Martin were married  and moved to Fort Sill, Oklahoma, where Martin was stationed as a  Reserve Officers' Training Corps officer in the U.S. Army Reserve after  his call-up to active duty.   To help support the family, Ruth Bader Ginsburg worked for the Social  Security Administration office in Oklahoma, where she was demoted after  becoming pregnant with her first child, Jane, who was born in 1955.   In the fall of 1956, Ruth Bader Ginsburg enrolled at Harvard Law  School, where she was one of only 9 women in a class of about 500 men.   Harvard Law Dean Erwin Griswold reportedly invited all the female law  students to dinner at his family home and asked the female law  students, including Ginsburg, ``Why are you at Harvard Law School,  taking the place of a man?''   When her husband took a job in New York City, Ruth Bader Ginsburg  transferred to Columbia Law School and became the first woman to be on  two major law reviews: Harvard Law Review and Columbia Law Review.   In 1959, she earned her law degree at Columbia and tied for first in  her class but despite these enviable credentials and distinguished  record of excellence, no law firm in New York City would hire her as a  lawyer because she was a woman.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg became a crusader for women's rights and an  unstoppable force who transformed the law and defied social convention.   Ruth Bader Ginsburg, later affectionately known as the `Notorious  RBG,' was as instrumental and historically significant to the cause of  women's rights as was Thurgood Marshall  [[Page H5439]]  to the cause of civil rights for African Americans.   As a young lawyer and Director of the Women's Rights Project of the  American Civil Liberties Union, Ruth Bader Ginsburg litigated six  landmark cases before the Supreme Court, winning five out of the six  cases.   Like Justice Marshall, Ruth Bader Ginsburg's uncanny strategic  instincts and careful selection of cases were vital in her persuasion  of the all-male Supreme Court to start dismantling the legal  institution of sex discrimination one case at a time.   In 1975, Ruth Bader Ginsburg litigated and won Weinberger v.  Wiesenfeld, which would become a landmark case in antidiscrimination  jurisprudence.   In this case, the widower had been denied survivor benefits, which  would allow him to stay at home and raise his son, based on a Social  Security provision that assumed only women were secondary providers  with unimportant incomes.   While some questioned Ginsburg's choice to challenge instances of sex  discrimination by representing a male plaintiff, Ruth Bader Ginsburg  saw it as an opportunity to show the court that childcare was not a  sex-determined role to be performed only by women.   As with many of her cases, her goal was to free both sexes, men as  well as women, from the roles that society had assigned them and to  harness the Constitution to break down the structures by which the  state maintained and enforced those separate spheres.   As Ruth Bader Ginsburg continued to challenge the stereotypical  assumptions of what was considered to be women's work and men's work,  she was able to persuade the Court and the nation that discriminating  on the basis of sex was not only wrong but also a violation of the 14th  Amendment of the Constitution, which guarantees equal protection to all  citizens under the law.   As the courts began to recognize the changing roles of men and women,  Ruth Bader Ginsburg was able to advance gender equality with the  understanding that women are capable of being heads of households or  sole providers for their family.    In 1993, President Bill Clinton appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the  Supreme Court, making her the second woman to fill this position.   This historic appointment further symbolized the principle that women  were equal to men in every respect, that they could have successful  careers and also could, if they chose, be devoted wives or mothers,  thereby breaking barriers for generations of women to follow in her  footsteps.   In fact, many of Ginsburg's opinions helped solidify the  constitutional protections she had fought so hard to establish decades  earlier.   While we commemorate Justice Ginsburg's work for advancing the  women's movement both as a Justice and as a lawyer, all are in her debt  who cherish the progress made in the areas of LGBTQ+ equality,  immigration reform, environmental justice, voting rights, protections  for people with disabilities, and so much more.   Throughout her life, Ruth Bader Ginsburg worked to make the law work  so that America would be more just, equitable, fairer, and better for  all.   Whether it be in her legendary dissenting opinions or as leader when  in the majority, Justice Ginsburg continued to advocate for the  marginalized and most vulnerable.   In recent years, she may not have been able to control the outcome of  the rulings, but she grew bolder in her dissents, often stating what  should have been the outcome.   Throughout her tenure on the bench, Ruth Bader Ginsburg displayed her  rigorous and incisive legal mind and employed her formidable skills as  a consensus builder, but she could be tough and forceful when the  moment demanded.   Nothing illustrates this better than her famous dissent in Shelby  County v. Holder, in which the 5-to-4 majority negated the Voting  Rights Act of 1965 by invalidating section 4 of the law, which  neutralized section 5, the provision of the act that required  jurisdictions with a history of racial and ethnic discrimination in  voting to obtain preclearance from the federal government before any  changes in voting procedures, from polling stations to voter photo IDs  could go into effect.   It was in her scathing dissent Justice Ginsburg stated, ``Hubris is a  fit word for today's demolition of the VRA'' and that the majority's  logic was akin to ``throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because  you are not getting wet.''   Unlike the others, Justice Ginsburg was able to see the ramifications  of the ruling and its allowances for reinvigorated efforts of voter  suppression.   Today, I join millions of individuals who are mourning the loss of  this legal giant, feminist, and trailblazer.   Justice Ginsburg loved this country, so much so that she served the  nation while enduring illnesses and undergoing treatments that would  have incapacitated lesser mortals.   She inspired generations of women then and now to shatter glass  ceilings, and her legacy will inspire new generations of women in the  years to come.   As the news of her passing continues to reverberate across the  country and around the world, it is important that we remember and  honor what she stood for and continue fighting to realize the goal of  equal justice under law.   I am honored to be able to pay tribute to the memory of Supreme Court  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the `Notorious RBG,' one of the greatest  jurists in our nation's history, a tireless and unyielding champion for  equal justice, and a fierce defender of the Constitution.                            ____________________
