 Mr. Speaker, there is one person in the United  States that can stop the mean-spirited separation of children at the  border of my State. The vileness of separating babies as young as 6  months, babies who are breastfeeding, is at the feet, the hands, mind,  and heart of President Trump.   This is not a Democratic policy. We have never utilized this kind of  deterrence, and we have never stopped an asylum possibility because of  domestic violence or gang violence, as this administration is doing.   Secondarily, the IG report, which I commend to the American people to  read, has nothing to do with the Mueller investigation and Mr. Mueller,  with his integrity intact, must continue that investigation and do it  well and answer the questions of the Russian collusion in the election  of 2016.   On another note, Happy Father's Day. In the memory of my late father,  Ezra C. Jackson, we miss you. But all of the fathers who have fallen,  and those who live, we wish you a wonderful day.   As well, Happy Juneteenth to those who celebrate Juneteenth, who  recognize that it was 2 years after the Emancipation Proclamation that  African Americans in the South and, particularly, Texas knew that they  were free. Freedom is precious.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Marino, and I want to make it very clear  that we have spent a lot of time in the Judiciary Committee, in this  Congress, in the Energy and Commerce Committee, on almost every other  bill in stemming the tide, the rage, the horror of opioid addiction.   Mr. Chairman, I have lived through crack cocaine addiction and heroin  addiction, and now heroin has returned, itself. I have watched my  constituents in these low-drug offenses wind up not getting treatment  and wind up getting the devastation of mass incarceration.   Frankly, if this bill had listed the synthetic analogues on schedule  A and provided the science to determine what they were, this would be a  bill that the whole House could support, but that is not the case.   And so I raise concerns that I hope this House will listen to and  recognize that opportunities to fix this legislation as we move to the  Senate would make this the kind of response that has been consistent  with the view that the incarceration of an opioid-addicted person and/ or those who are limited sellers does not bring us to where we need to  be.   Mr. Chair, I rise to discuss the Stop the Importation and Trafficking  of Synthetic Analogues Act of 2017, which establishes a mechanism by  which synthetic drugs can be temporarily and permanently controlled to  curtail illicit manufacturing, importation, and distribution. H.R. 2851  would also establish new Federal crimes related to the misuse of  controlled substances identified in the bill.   I am acutely concerned about the dangers presented by drugs like  fentanyl and its synthetic analogues that have contributed to a  disturbing number of overdose deaths, even in my home district of  Houston.   This bill, while well-intended, is flawed for several reasons. First,  it eliminates the use of scientific evidence by which synthetic  analogues are currently analyzed.   Under current law, the Attorney General must work in collaboration  with drugs experts at the Department of Health and Human Services as  part of the permanent scheduling process. Absent collaboration of the  scientific community, the AG, under this bill, will have sole  discretion to unilaterally determine which drugs are a schedule A  substance.   This is alarming because arbitrary scheduling of substances without  verifiable data will undoubtedly create disproportionate incarcerations  of low-level drug offenders.   Second, this bill overcriminalizes drug offenders, many of whom are  in dire need of support in their battles with addiction, substance  abuse, and mental illness. We recognize this is an alarming epidemic  and the need for medical treatment is very important.   Third, although we know that synthetic analogues are often  manufactured and mixed with heroin outside the country--namely, China-- and where users and sellers here may lack knowledge, this bill  heightens the penalties, nonetheless.   In June 2016, the head of the DEA, Chuck Rosenberg, testified before  the Senate Judiciary Committee that: ``Illicit fentanyl, fentanyl  derivatives and their immediate precursors are often produced in  China.'' By the time the drugs enter the United States, where they are  sold, he said, buyers and sellers are often unaware of the composition  and potency of the drugs.   Fourth, this bill amends the Federal sentencing guidelines without  the input of the United States Sentencing Commission, which recently  underwent a robust examination of synthetic drugs and penalties.   The bill disregards the jurisdictional authority granted by Congress  to the Commission back in 1984. The Commission is a nonpartisan,  independent body which sets sentencing guidelines for Federal judges.   Since the introduction of this bill, the Commission approved a  multipart synthetic drugs amendment in April 2018, which included  extensive public comment, expert testimony, and a multiyear data  analysis.   The Commission's recent amendment reflects the evolving nature of  these synthetic drugs, creates a class-based approach, establishes a  new drug ratio and a new guideline penalty for fentanyl analogues that  will promote uniformity in Federal sentencing. We should, therefore,  allow this more thorough and data-driven process to come to completion,  absent interruption by the Attorney General, as provided in the bill.   And lastly, this bill imposes mandatory minimum terms of supervised  release of not less than 3 years in addition to imprisonment, and not  less than 6 years if there was a prior conviction.   Furthermore, the bill also appears to impose mandatory minimum  sentencing. Current law requires that if a controlled substance  analogue is intended for human consumption, it shall be treated as a  schedule I substance, 21  [[Page H5206]]  U.S.C. 813. Because the analogue would be treated as a schedule I drug,  the penalty of such drugs is not less than 20 years mandatory minimum  if death or serious bodily injury occurs.    Under 21 U.S.C. 802(32) a controlled substance analogue is:         A substance (i) the chemical structure of which is       substantially similar to the chemical structure of a       controlled substance in schedule I and II;        (ii) which has a stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic       effect on the central nervous system.    Under this bill, a schedule A drug is a substance that has a chemical  structure that is substantially similar to the chemical structure of  the controlled substance in schedules I, II, III, IV, and V, an actual  or predicted stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on the  central nervous system.   The penalty for such drugs under this bill is not more than 10 years,  no mandatory minimum, and if serious bodily injury occurs, not more  than 15.   Therefore, if the composition of a schedule A drug is substantially  similar to the chemical structure of a substance in schedule I or II,  then we have a mandatory minimum problem, unless the bill explicitly  says in its penalty provision that a schedule I penalty is not  triggered by placement of a substance in schedule A.   This creates great ambiguity with respect to sentencing because the  vague language leaves an endless number of individuals exposed to  mandatory minimum and, of course, mass incarceration.   Given the number of new drugs out there and the constant evolving  nature of these synthetic drugs, it is unknown at this point and unfair  in this bill's framework the number of drugs that will trigger a  mandatory minimum sentence.   If we are committed to giving treatment, if we are committed to  stopping the mass incarceration and steering people away from the use  of opioid drugs, that will be the preferable approach: to take note of  the fact that they are on schedule A, to provide the scientific  background, and to then allow the existing sentencing structure to  proceed.   Mandatory minimum sentencing for drug offenses gave birth to an  explosion in our prison population. It is responsible for many of our  criminal justice deficiencies. It is really the reason why we are  fighting for sentencing reduction.   Congress acknowledged this as a devastating policy approach and, as a  result, passed the Fair Sentencing Act. Inclusion of new mandatory  minimum sentencing is particularly egregious because these inflexible  one-size sentencing laws undermine justice by preventing judges from  fitting the punishment to the individual and the circumstances of their  offenses, like the 19-year-old seller who, as the DEA Administrator  said, may not have even known that it was laced.   Mandatory sentencing laws have caused Federal prison populations to  soar, destroying families and communities, and led to overcrowding and  exorbitant costs to taxpayers.   And so I ask my colleagues, let us work together to work on the bill  before us and focus it on ways that get to the dastardliness of  synthetic analogues but, as well, responds mercifully to the increasing  incarceration of persons through mandatory minimums and the lack of  using the United States Sentencing Commission's guidelines.   Mr. Chair. H.R. 2851, ``Stop the Importation and Trafficking of  Synthetic Analogues Act of 2017,'' establishes a mechanism by which  synthetic drugs can be temporarily and permanently controlled to  curtail illicit manufacturing, importation and distribution.   H.R. 2851 would also establish new federal crimes related to the  misuse of controlled substances identified in the bill.   I am acutely concerned about the dangers presented by drugs like  fentanyl and its synthetic analogues that have contributed to a  disturbing number of overdose deaths, even in my home district of  Houston.   This bill while well-intended, is flawed for several reasons: First,  it eliminates the use of scientific evidence by which synthetic  analogues are currently analyzed.   Under current law, the Attorney General must work in collaboration  with drug experts at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  as part of the permanent scheduling process.   Absent collaboration of the scientific community, the AG, under this  bill, would have sole discretion, to unilaterally determine which drugs  are Schedule A substance.   This is alarming because arbitrary scheduling of substances without  verifiable data, will undoubtedly create disproportionate incarceration  of low-level drug offenders.   Second, this bill over criminalizes drug offenders, many of whom are  in dire need of support in their battles with addiction, substance  abuse and mental illness.   We recognize this as an alarming epidemic, and the need for medical  treatment, which is why we appropriated an exuberant amount of money  towards the opioid crisis in our recent omnibus bill which passed in  the House.   Third, although we know that synthetic analogues are often  manufactured and mixed with heroin outside the country, namely China,  and where users and sellers here may lack knowledge, this bill  heightens the penalties nonetheless.   In June 2016, the head of the DEA Chuck Rosenberg testified before  the Senate Judiciary Committee that, ``Illicit fentanyl, fentanyl  derivatives, and their immediate precursors are often produced in  China.''   By the time the drugs enter the United States, where they are sold,  he said, buyers and sellers are often unaware of the composition and  potency of the drugs.   Fourth, this bill amends the federal sentencing guidelines without  the input of the U.S. Sentencing Commission (Commission), which  recently underwent a robust examination of synthetic drugs and  penalties.   The bill disregards the jurisdictional authority granted by Congress  to the Commission back in 1984.   The Commission is a non-partisan, independent body, which sets  sentencing guidelines for federal judges.   Since the introduction of this bill, the Commission approved a multi- part synthetic drugs amendment in April 2018, which included extensive  public comment, expert testimony and a multi-year, data analysis.   The Commission's recent amendment reflects the evolving nature of  these new synthetic drugs, creates a class-based approach, establishes  new drug ratios and a new guideline penalty for fentanyl analogues that  will promote uniformity in federal sentencing.   We should therefore, allow this more thorough and data-driven process  to come to completion, absent interruption by the Attorney General as  provided in this bill.   And lastly, this bill imposes mandatory minimum terms of supervised  release of not less than 3 years in addition to imprisonment, and not  less than 6 years if there was a prior conviction.   Furthermore, the bill also appears to impose mandatory minimum  sentencing.   Current law requires that if a controlled substance analogue is  intended for human consumption, it shall be treated as a schedule I  substance. (21 USC 813).   Because the analogue would be treated as a schedule I drug, the  penalty for such drugs is not less than 20 years (mandatory minimum) if  death or serious bodily injury occurs.   Under 21 USC 802(32), a ``controlled substance analogue'' is: A  substance (i) the chemical structure of which is substantially similar  to the chemical structure of a controlled substance in schedule I or  II; (ii) Which has a stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic effect on  the central nervous system. . . .   Under this bill, a Schedule A drug is a substance that has a Chemical  structure that is substantially similar to the chemical structure of a  controlled substance in schedule I, II, III, IV or V; and   An actual or predicted stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic  effect on the central nervous system. . . .   The penalty for such drugs under this bill is not more than 10 years  (no mandatory minimum), and if serious bodily injury occur, not more  than 15 years.   Therefore, if the composition of a schedule A drug is substantially  similar to the chemical structure of a substance in schedule I or II,  then we have a mandatory minimum problem, unless the bill explicitly  says in its penalty provision, that a schedule I penalty is not  triggered by placement of a substance on schedule A.   This creates great ambiguity with respect to sentencing, because the  vague language leaves endless number of individuals exposed to  mandatory minimum sentencing.   Given the number of new drugs out there, and the constant evolving  nature of these synthetic drugs, it is unknown at this point and under  this bill's framework, the number of drugs that will trigger a  mandatory minimum sentence.   Mandatory minimum sentencing for drug offenses gave birth to the  explosion in our prison population, and is responsible for many of our  criminal justice system's deficiencies. Thus, we cannot return there  again.   Congress acknowledged this as a devastating policy approach, and as a  result, passed of the Fair Sentencing Act.   Inclusion of a new mandatory minimum sentence, is particularly  egregious because these inflexible, one-size sentencing laws undermine  [[Page H5207]]  justice by preventing judges from fitting the punishment to the  individual and the circumstances of their offenses.   Mandatory sentencing laws have caused federal prison populations to  soar, destroyed families and communities, and led to overcrowding and  exorbitant costs to taxpayers.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), who is the ranking member of the  Education and the Workforce Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Schneider). Congressman Bradley Scott Schneider is a  member of the House Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), who is the ranking member of  the Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, does the gentleman have further  speakers?    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   We all want to do good, and all of us have had our tragedies as it  relates to the use of drugs by the innocent. As I listened to my  colleagues, they are right: The heinous persons are those who are the  major exporters and the hardened drug dealers.   We want to save lives. I think we found over the last couple of  months and past years that enhancing the research and providing  treatment for those very individuals who have succumbed will provide us  with that pathway.   In the instance of the underlying bill, I would hope that we would  have the opportunity to get the bad guys. But in the instance of the  way it is constructed, SITSA will worsen the mass incarceration of drug  offenders; it will expand the use of harsh maximum sentences for drug  offenses; and the bill creates new penalties for thousands of synthetic  drugs, calling for maximum sentences of 10, 20, 30 years, or life  imprisonment.   The carve-out for possession does not define quantities that would  constitute possession and will not prevent many people who possess  small quantities or sell drugs to support their own addiction from  getting slammed by draconian new penalties in SITSA.   So we have addicted persons who sell on the streets of our  neighborhoods. They need treatment. That is what we should be focusing  on. SITSA will punish people who lack criminal culpability. This bill  will disproportionately increase low-level drug offenders who did not  import or package the drug and often are unaware of the chemical  composition of the drugs, as the DEA Administrator indicated in his  testimony before the Senate that most of the sellers would not know  that there had been traces of other drugs in that particular drug they  were selling.                                time  1000    SITSA is unnecessary because the Attorney General can already ban  synthetic drugs. This was demonstrated earlier this year when the  Attorney General used powers already granted by the Congress to place  illicit fentanyl analogues not already regulated by the Controlled  Substances Act into schedule I for 3 years, allowing time to pursue  permanent scheduling.   Through rulemaking, at a congressional hearing last month, Acting  Administrator Patterson indicated: This mass scheduling action  addressed concern that prosecutors can't convict people for trafficking  synthetic drugs.   Finally, SITSA has devastating impacts on scientific research. Many  synthetic drugs share chemical properties with drugs that have been  known to have therapeutic uses, such as opioids. Under SITSA, once a  drug has been added to schedule A, many of the same hurdles that apply  to conducting research with schedule I drugs will apply to substances  added to proposed schedule A.   These burdens will be costly and time consuming. Some of them are  research dealing with how do you stop this addiction, how do you stop  people's proclivity for addiction. So this burden is costly and time  consuming to the research and host institutions and will have a  chilling effect on promising research towards the development of opioid  addiction therapies and safer medications to treat pain that are  desperately needed to help end the ongoing opioid overdose crisis.   While SITSA provides some relief for researchers who already have a  schedule I or II, there are many difficulties that we are facing.   Mr. Chair, how much time is remaining on both sides.    Mr. Chair, while SITSA provides some relief for  researchers who already have a schedule I or II registration to proceed  with schedule A research, SITSA does not provide accommodations  necessary to ensure researchers can obtain drug  [[Page H5211]]  samples for research. Commercial manufacturers are not likely to  produce schedule A drugs.   Provisions in SITSA intended to ease registration requirements will  help little when researchers access the drug material they need to  study the therapeutic potential.   Here is the main point. The main point is that researchers are  researching how to cease the addiction that is killing so many. Low- level sellers are caught up under this bill; and, as indicated by the  DEA, they, too, are victims. It is well known that the idea of mass  incarceration does not solve the problem of addiction or cause the  ending of the tragic loss of life.   I hurt for those suffering from addiction, and it is important to be  able to utilize our government knowledge to help that end, and the  Sentencing Commission has done that.   The difficulty we have is whether or not this bill, even though from  Judiciary, really bears down on saving lives. What we want to do is  raise the treatment, deal with those already structured to handle the  listing of analogues, and work with communities to ensure that the laws  we have are enforced and that we don't create a whole new population of  those who will be victims of mass incarceration and, at the same time,  do nothing to treat those who desperately need our help, our support,  and our resources to move them away from addiction, to save their  lives, and to allow them to live fruitful and productive lives.   That is what I hope that we will be able to do as we move forward on  the right approach to dealing with drug addiction and the new surge of  synthetic drugs.   Mr. Chair, may I inquire if the gentleman from Pennsylvania has any  further speakers.    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler), the distinguished ranking  member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Chair, we hope that we will be able to work  together to save lives and to fix the issues that we are addressing  here today.   Mr. Chair, we all want to solve the escalating problems of synthetic  drugs, which permeate throughout our districts.   Therefore, our initial reaction would be to naturally support this  endeavor.   However, while well-intended, this bill highlights many problems and  does not fulfill the overall goal of stemming the tide of drugs on our  streets.   We must exercise prudence, as to not further exacerbate the crisis of  mass incarceration and punish those that need help with substance abuse  and whom this bill purports to help.   Because this bill would concentrate an overwhelming amount of  unchecked power within DOJ, eliminate scientific and medical analysis  and interagency collaboration from the process of scheduling synthetic  analogues, and expand penalties for drug offenses, I have serious  concerns about H.R. 2851.   The bill is strongly opposed by a broad spectrum of stakeholders,  including Freedom Works, Drug Policy Alliance, Families Against  Mandatory Minimum, ACLU, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human  Rights, National Council of Churches, Human Rights Watch, The  Sentencing Project and many others.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, let me just very quickly thank the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin) and Mr. Griffith. I am delighted  to join them, and I will simply say it is equally essential that  science has a role in this very complex process to ensure the  appropriate penalties are being applied based on compositions of the  synthetic drugs involved.   I congratulate both of them for the excellent work that has been  done, and I am delighted to be a cosponsor of the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the Griffith/Raskin/Jackson Lee  Amendment. The amendment will reflect the current process under  existing law.   Under current law, the Attorney General must work collaboratively  with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and its experts  in the scientific community, in order to determine best practices for  the permanent scheduling process.   Given the variation in toxicity levels in many of these synthetic  drugs, it is imperative that the research community be involved in the  process to ensure accuracy of defining the chemical structure of these  drugs or substances.   It is equally essential that science have a role in this very complex  process to ensure the appropriate penalties are being applied based on  compositions of the synthetic drugs involved.   At markup I made it clear that we should not proceed with this bill  absent involvement from the scientific community.   Today, I am pleased to be a co-sponsor of this amendment with my  colleagues Griffith and Raskin.   In addition to restoring collaboration with the research community,  this amendment also provides that permanent scheduling cannot occur  earlier than 3 years after the Attorney General issues a temporary  scheduling order.   This allows the scientific community time to address any pending  issues that pertain to the drugs temporarily scheduled and prior to  placing them on schedule A permanently.   If the research finds that these temporarily scheduled drugs lack  sufficient potential for abuse that would qualify such drugs under  schedule A, then this amendment provides that the Attorney General has  30 days in which he must terminate the temporary scheduling order for  that drug or substance.   This is a sensible amendment that will provide oversight of the  scheduling process. And for these reasons, I support this amendment and  urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple. It restores  the commission's jurisdiction over the  [[Page H5217]]  Federal sentencing guidelines as originally granted by Congress in  1984.   The United States Sentencing Commission has been working to address  the seriousness and complexity of synthetic drugs for several years. If  I might refer my colleagues to the April 12 meeting of the Sentencing  Commission where the chairman began his remarks and indicated that the  commission was going to move forward on a multipart amendment regarding  synthetic drugs, which will include but be not limited to K2 or spice,  fentanyl and fentanyl analogues.   This amendment draws upon public comment, expert testimony, and data  analysis gathered during a multiyear study of synthetic drugs. That is  what the Sentencing Commission does, and my amendment asks to remove  the section in this underlying legislation that directs this  responsibility to the Attorney General.   The process that was created by the Sentencing Commission created a  new guideline definition of the term fentanyl analogue. The change  effectively raises the guideline penalties for fentanyl analogues to a  level more consistent with the current statutory penalty structure to  address the severe dangerousness of fentanyl.   The amendment also creates a four-level sentencing enhancement for  knowingly misrepresenting or knowingly marketing fentanyl or fentanyl  analogues as another substance which equates to an approximate 50  percent increase in sentence length.   What I am saying to my colleagues is that we have a structure. The  report was issued on April 2018. The Sentencing Commission has done its  job, and I think that we would do well to embrace the work that has  been done here. The commission's recent amendment creates a class-based  approach for synthetic drugs, establishes new drug ratios, and a new  guideline for fentanyl analogues, so it is unnecessary to have section  9 in the present legislation.   Mr. Chairman, I would ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from  Pennsylvania, and, as well, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and  the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. We worked on this, and I  am glad that our staff was able to communicate.   I think it is important to emphasize that, going forward, the  Sentencing Commission will continue its multiyear study to ensure that  the Federal sentencing guidelines are updated to reflect any new  challenges resulting from these serious drugs and that they be  addressed in the Federal sentencing guidelines.   Consistent with its mission established by Congress in the Sentencing  Reform Act of 1984, the commission will also work to update guidelines  on an annual basis to reflect any new needs that we may have with  respect to these new and growing synthetic analogues and other drugs  that are continually coming, tragically, into the marketplace.                                time  1030    Mr. Chairman, I have here a public data presentation for synthetic  drugs, dated January 2018; also the April 2018 report; and, as well,  the opening statement of the chairman of the Sentencing Commission  dated April 12, 2018.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the Jackson Lee amendment, which  restores the Commission's jurisdiction over the federal sentencing  guidelines, as originally granted by Congress.   The United States Sentencing Commission has been working to address  the seriousness and complexity of synthetic drugs for several years.   Since this legislation was introduced, the Sentencing Commission  approved a multi-part synthetic drugs amendment in April 2018.   The Commission conducted extensive research of past cases and current  data, held multiple hearings and engaged in extensive collaboration  with DOJ, DEA and experts to determine the best manner to address these  drugs within the context of the federal sentencing guidelines.   The Commission's recent amendment creates a class-based approach for  synthetic drugs, establishes new drug ratios and a new guideline  penalty for fentanyl analogues.   Consistent with the established process, the recent amendment  reflected a deliberative, data-driven process which included extensive  public comment, expert testimony and data analysis gathered during a  multi-year study of synthetic drugs.   Section 9 of H.R. 2851 should be struck from the pending legislation  because: It is unnecessary, overly broad and duplicative of the  Commission's existing action. Section 9 will result in greater  litigation and delays for the federal courts. This section would also  undermine the certainty in federal sentencing for synthetic drugs that  would otherwise be avoided based on the Commission's new amendment.  Congress delegated the authority to amend the federal sentencing  guidelines two decades ago in order to ensure fair, data-driven  outcomes in federal sentencing. This provision is an unprecedented and  unnecessary departure from the process that has worked well since  established by Congress in 1984.   Going forward, the Commission will continue its multi-year study to  ensure that the federal sentencing guidelines are updated to reflect  any new challenges resulting from these serious drugs are addressed in  the federal sentencing guidelines.   Consistent with its mission established by Congress in the Sentencing  Reform Act of 1984, the Commission will also work to update the  guidelines on an annual basis to reflect any new laws enacted by  Congress.   For all these reasons, I support this amendment and ask my colleagues  to do the same.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from New York  for capturing the scourge of the epidemic of online drug sales that  reach into the living rooms of so many innocent persons, and my  sympathy for the loss of one of our heroes who wore the uniform.   Mr. Chairman, I rise to support this amendment as contributing to the  important information knowledge chain that is so necessary to families  to help stop this scourge of going after innocent persons in their  homes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to amendment No.  4 proposed by the gentleman from Texas.   The amendment adds a list of factors that may be considered when  proving whether a particular substance was intended for human  consumption.   I oppose this amendment for two reasons.   First, because criminal liability could result from one of the  factors being proven merely under a negligent standard. Only whether  the defendant should have known the substance was intended to be  consumed by injection, inhaling, ingestion, or any other immediate  means, it is not an appropriate standard to which we should attach  criminal liability, particularly severe consequences such as mandatory  minimums.   Now, I have indicated that we have an action by the U.S. Sentencing  Commission that took place on April 2018. We have a detailed analysis  of the range of analogues, synthetic analogues, including K2, spice,  and other fentanyl analogues, but not limited to. Therefore, we have a  marker. We have a standard to save lives. And what we should be  emphasizing, again, is treatment.   Second, this amendment actually makes it easier to trigger mandatory  minimums. For instance, a defendant could be subjected to a 20-year  mandatory minimum in instances where serious bodily harm injury  results. I am opposed to amendment 4 because defendants could be  subjected to such mandatory minimums relying, in part, on proof that  they should have known a substance was intended for human consumption.   Now, let me be very clear. Some of these individuals who are  defendants are, themselves, addicted, and, therefore, they are acting  as an addicted person. It is not an excuse, but it emphasizes that we  should steer ourselves more toward a maximizing of treatment and  education to stop the scourge of the utilization of these drugs.   That is clearly, as well, taken care of under the U.S. Sentencing  Commission, meaning that these concerns of the gentleman, which I  respect his concerns, are taken care of by a long list of responses and  sentencing for the different drugs that are noted as synthetic  analogues. Again, we do have a basis going forward. The gentleman's  concerns can be taken care of in already established law and policies  by the U.S. Sentencing Commission.   I have long opposed any laws that will trigger mandatory minimums  because we have seen the results of that. We have also heard over time  from the U.S. judicial commission, if you will, because this takes away  a judge's discretion and interferes with their sound judgment in  sentencing the individual defendants that appear before them.  Therefore, I oppose amendment No. 4.   Mr. Chairman, I thank the Rules Committee for allowing my amendment  to be placed in order. I also believe that, at this point, we would do  well to follow regular order to save lives and to continue to allow the  Sentencing Commission to move forward as they made their commitment in  the chairman's letter. The chairman of the commission said that they  will not stop working on synthetic analogues and that they will  continue to structure the right kind of criminal justice that works as  it relates to sentencing to ensure that the concerns of my colleague  are taken.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Chair, again, let me indicate that I appreciate  the gentleman's concern. I am concerned that simply a negligence  standard would be the standard for judging a defendant under this  particular amendment: should have known the substance was intended to  be consumed by injection, inhaling, injection, or any other immediate  means. That is not an appropriate standard that would attach criminal  liability and particularly severe consequences such as a mandatory  minimum.   Again, I am holding up one of the reports from the Sentencing  Commission, and I would make the argument that it is thorough in its  review, and our colleagues can be comforted by the fact that, again,  the Sentencing Commission will continue its work and it will continue  to address some of the concerns of my friend from Texas. I would hope  that we would allow that process to proceed.   I think it would be very concerning to all of us if we had a  negligence standard. I believe the courts will address the fact based  upon the defendant and the facts that we have in place.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to oppose the amendment and oppose the  underlying bill   Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to Amendment 13, proposed by Mr.  Thornberry. The amendment adds a list of factors that may be considered  when proving whether a particular substance was intended for human  consumption. I oppose this amendment for two reasons:   First, because criminal liability could result from one of the  factors being proven merely under a negligence standard--only whether  the defendant should have known the substance was intended to be  consumed by injection, inhalation, ingestion or any other immediate  means. It is not an appropriate standard  [[Page H5220]]  to which we should attach criminal liability, particularly, severe  consequences, such as mandatory minimums.   Second, this amendment actually makes it easier to trigger mandatory  minimums. For instance, a defendant could be subjected to a 20-year  mandatory minimum in instances where serious bodily injury results. I  am opposed to Amendment 13 because defendants could be subjected to  such mandatory minimums relying in part on proof that they should have  known a substance was intended for ``human consumption''.   I have long been opposed to any laws that trigger mandatory minimums  because they take away judges' discretion and interfere with their  sound judgment in sentencing the individual defendants that appear  before them. Therefore, I oppose Amendment 13.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 223,  noes 158, not voting 46, as follows:                               [Roll No. 267]                                 AYES--223       Abraham      Aderholt      Aguilar      Allen      Amodei      Arrington      Babin      Bacon      Banks (IN)      Barletta      Barr      Barton      Bergman      Bilirakis      Bishop (MI)      Bishop (UT)      Blackburn      Blum      Bost      Brady (TX)      Brat      Brooks (AL)      Brooks (IN)      Buchanan      Buck      Bucshon      Budd      Burgess      Byrne      Calvert      Carter (GA)      Chabot      Cheney      Coffman      Cole      Collins (GA)      Collins (NY)      Comer      Comstock      Conaway      Cook      Cooper      Costa      Costello (PA)      Cramer      Crawford      Crist      Cuellar      Curtis      Davidson      Davis, Rodney      Denham      DeSantis      DesJarlais      Diaz-Balart      Donovan      Duffy      Duncan (SC)      Duncan (TN)      Dunn      Emmer      Faso      Ferguson      Fitzpatrick      Fleischmann      Flores      Fortenberry      Foxx      Frelinghuysen      Gaetz      Gallagher      Garamendi      Garrett      Gianforte      Gibbs      Goodlatte      Gottheimer      Gowdy      Granger      Graves (GA)      Graves (LA)      Graves (MO)      Griffith      Grothman      Guthrie      Handel      Harper      Harris      Hartzler      Hensarling      Herrera Beutler      Hice, Jody B.
