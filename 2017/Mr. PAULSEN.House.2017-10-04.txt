 Mr. Chairman, the budget that is being considered here  today sets in motion the process of the first major tax reform that we  will have been able to see in 3 decades. We are on the cusp of a really  exciting opportunity to give Americans what they deserve: a Tax Code  that works for them, not against them.   Now, on the House Ways and Means Committee, we spent many months  meeting, holding hearings, discussing, working on almost a daily basis  ways to craft a tax plan that is simpler and fairer for all Americans.  The framework that was just rolled out last week takes that into  account and lays out a plan that will lead to more jobs and, most  importantly, bigger paychecks.   You know, the economic ``recovery'' since the Great Recession hasn't  worked for a lot of Americans. It certainly hasn't worked for a lot of  Minnesotans that I represent. Economic growth has been anemic, and we  remain uncompetitive in far too many areas. Many are living paycheck to  paycheck, and either have or now are at risk of having a lower standard  of living than their parents.   Young people, like my daughter's generation, will go backwards if  this country is not fundamentally more competitive economically. They  feel like they just can't get ahead.   Meanwhile, seniors, and baby boomers who will soon become seniors,  are also at great risk. Their savings, as well as the government's  ability to fulfill its commitment to Social Security and Medicare,  could be undermined if we don't grow our economy at a higher rate.   So both Republicans and Democrats agree that it is time to fix our  broken Tax Code. No one is defending the status quo, Mr. Chair. Our  current Tax Code punishes American workers and manufacturers. It is a  maze of special-interest loopholes that are unfair to hardworking  Americans. It burdens families and small businesses with excessive  paperwork and compliance costs, creating unnecessary frustration each  and every tax season throughout the year. That is why 9 out of 10  Americans either pay someone to do their taxes or have to buy the  financial software to do their taxes.    Mr. Chair, our Tax Code is holding our country back. It is holding  our economy back. So we have a stark choice. We can either truly grow  the economy and put ourselves back on a path to real prosperity, or we  can continue with weak economic growth, which only benefits ``the few''  and will do nothing for the rest of us when the next economic downturn  happens.   Tax reform, for me, is about one thing and one thing only. It is  about restoring the hope for a prosperous future for ourselves, for our  parents, and, most importantly, for our children.   It is about Paula in my district, in Plymouth, Minnesota, who said  that the Tax Code is hurting her small business and preventing her from  hiring more employees and giving them a raise.   It is about an owner of an extrusion company in Chaska, Minnesota,  that I just spoke to. He said he would invest in new equipment and  machines if this tax plan passes.   And it is about lowering rates across the board for all Americans, as  well as small businesses, so that they can keep more of their first  dollars earned.   Tax reform means increasing the personal income for average Americans  and reducing the cost of living so that day-to-day expenses are more  affordable. This will lead to families being able to save for their  future and their retirement. It will allow people to take more control  of their lives and their finances so that they can save and spend and  invest their hard-earned money as they see fit.   Mr. Chairman, this is a really important opportunity we cannot let  slip away to help middle-income families and small businesses. Passing  this budget puts us on a path for tax reform that has so much potential  to unleash and grow our economy to the benefit of middle-income  families in Minnesota and across the country.                                time  1645    Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, in 2001, some of  our colleagues across the aisle said many of the same things we are  hearing today about the miracle of tax cuts: that huge tax cuts for the  most fortunate would pay for themselves, and that they would help grow  our economy by trickling down through the miracle of so-called dynamic  scoring.   But as we know from history, that was not the case. One year after  the Bush tax cuts in 2002, here is what Brookings Institute said was  happening in real life:         Our findings suggest that Bush tax cuts will reduce the       size of the future economy, raise interest rates, make taxes       more aggressive, increase tax complexity, and prove fiscally       unsustainable.    A year after that, in 2003, the Brookings Institute said: ``Over the  past 2 years our country has experienced a dramatic deterioration in  the Federal budget outlook.''   In January 2001, when President George Bush took office, the  Congressional Budget Office projected surpluses of $5.6 trillion--as in  ``T,'' trillion--from 2000 to 2011.   But in 2011, nearly a decade after the GOP promised their budget  would unleash the economy through tax cuts for the wealthy and budgets  that cut services to the vulnerable, this is what we found, from  National Public Radio: ``Conservatives often promote tax cuts as a way  to stimulate economic growth, but the years after 2001 were marked by  the slowest growth since World War II.''   All of us remember when President Obama came to office that this  country was shedding 800,000 jobs a month and it was a long time to dig  ourselves out of that big Republican hole and get us moving in the  right direction with job growth.   So let's not go down that road again. I call upon my colleagues to  remember history.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
