 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Mr.  Lloyd Kenneth Rogers of Alexandria, Kentucky, who passed away on  December 8, 2022, at 90 years of age.   Lloyd Rogers rose from adversity to live a life of notable  achievement and civil service. Lloyd was raised in an orphanage in  Kentucky, the same orphanage where he met his wife Blanche whom he was  married to for 65 years.   Lloyd served 9 years in the U.S. Navy during the Korean war. Then he  came back to Kentucky, and he ran and won a seat as judge-executive of  Campbell County where he served in a civilian capacity. Then later, he  worked as my director of Veterans Affairs in my congressional office  where he was committed to helping other former servicemembers.   Lloyd also aided in crafting legislation that most of my House  colleagues are familiar with. That is right. Lloyd Rogers wrote the  first draft of the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny  Act, otherwise known as the REINS Act.   I saw the first draft of this bill in his basement on his personal  computer. He wrote it himself because he was concerned about overreach  of the executive--having served his country in the military and having  served as an executive himself. He gave it to the Congressman before me  who introduced the bill.   I pay tribute today to a mentor and a friend, and I send his family,  especially his son, Dennis, my deepest condolences. I commend Lloyd for  his unwavering commitment to his country and to his community.                            ____________________
