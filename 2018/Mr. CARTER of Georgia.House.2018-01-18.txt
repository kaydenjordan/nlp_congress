 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the  decision to attach a 6-year extension of the Children's Health  Insurance Program, as this is much overdue.   CHIP, which is known as PeachCare for Kids in Georgia, has been a  very successful program in covering the medical needs in our State.   However, this isn't the first time we have tried to extend this  program that is so vital to children all across our country.   We passed legislation out of the Energy and Commerce Committee  addressing a long-term fix in October. We then passed it in the House  in November. We funded a short-term fix in December.    It is time our colleagues across the aisle quit holding children's  healthcare hostage. Now is the time to pass this and continue  discussions on community health centers, graduate medical education  programs, and other extenders.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Walden, Chairman Burgess, and  my colleagues from the Energy and Commerce Committee for their work. I  urge my colleagues to pass this and help our Nation's children.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  immediate benefits that H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, is already  delivering for American families.   On January 11, the Treasury Department released its updated  withholding tables for 2018. These tables work to implement the Tax  Cuts and Jobs Act, the tax reform package passed by Congress and signed  into law by President Trump just before Christmas.  [[Page H540]]    With the implementation of these new withholding tables, the Treasury  Department has estimated that 90 percent of wage earners will  experience an increase in their take-home pay. A married couple with  two children, making $75,000 a year, would see a $1,350 wage increase  per year.   I am thrilled to see what closing unfair loopholes, simplifying the  Tax Code, and getting the Federal Government out of the way does to  boost the financial stability of American families.                            ____________________
