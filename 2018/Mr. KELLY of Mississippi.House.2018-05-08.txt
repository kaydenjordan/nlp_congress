 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for  yielding. In my district, the Small Business Administration has made  tremendous and direct impact with the 7(a) Loan Program by helping  small businesses that are not able to find or obtain capital through  traditional or conventional markets.   To acquire a 7(a) loan, participating lenders must determine that a  small business cannot receive credit elsewhere. In practice, this is  called the credit elsewhere test. The test became the focus of my  subcommittee hearing in March of 2017, when the Committee reviewed the  7(a) Loan Program.   As conservatives, we must safeguard American taxpayer dollars. A  government guarantee program needs strong oversight to make sure  adequate safeguards are in place. That is why 7(a) oversight must begin  with the credit elsewhere test.   This is exactly what H.R. 4743 proposes. It strengthens the credit  elsewhere test and provides transparency to factors most commonly used  by lenders as they move small businesses through the 7(a) loan process.  Additionally, H.R. 4743 increases the oversight capabilities of the  Office of Credit Risk Management and the Lender Oversight Committee.  These reforms will support the program while protecting American  taxpayer dollars.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member for  taking up this issue and working with all Members to ensure oversight  is paramount, and I urge my colleagues to support this much-needed  legislation.
