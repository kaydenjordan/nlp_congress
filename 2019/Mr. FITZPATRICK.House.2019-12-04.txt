 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the well- earned retirement of Northampton Township Chief of Police Mike Clark.  Chief Clark has served the people of Northampton Township for 47 years  and as our chief of police since 2013.   For the first 26 years of his service, Chief Clark served on the  patrol division, on SWAT, and the detective department, giving him a  wide range of experiences within the police force.   Earlier this year, under the leadership of Chief Clark, the  department earned an accreditation from the Pennsylvania Law  Enforcement Accreditation Commission, an achievement realized by just  10 percent of the State's 1,200 police departments.   Chief Clark works to make the department more active in the  community, to increase his office's interaction with the people they  work to protect. His Coffee with the Cops initiative created personal  connections between the police officers and the public. And under his  leadership, the department created a Facebook page to keep the public  informed.   Mr. Speaker, we want to thank Chief Clark for his hard work and  dedication to the people of Northampton Township. Because of the  actions of Chief Clark and his officers, Northampton is safer and  happier for everybody who resides there.   Chief Clark, we thank you for your service, and we hope you enjoy  your well-earned retirement.                            Honoring Thomas Hecker     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  Thomas Hecker of Langhorne, Pennsylvania. Mr. Hecker passed away  surrounded by his family at the age of 72.   Tom was born in Philadelphia and raised in Langhorne. He graduated  from Bishop Egan High School and received his undergraduate degree from  La Salle University, both my alma maters. After receiving his law  degree from Villanova University, he joined the law firm of Begley,  Carlin & Mandio, where he faithfully worked as a partner until his  passing.   Tom was a man of devout faith. Tom volunteered at his church as a  lector and a Eucharistic minister visiting the homebound.   Tom had a zest for life, which was often expressed through the  twinkle in his eyes that we all saw every time we saw him. Tom  cherished his family and friends, and he loved to socialize and connect  with them over a meal and a good bottle of wine.   Tom was notorious for his Eagles Sunday football parties and even  created bleachers in his house for game days. Tom was also a golf  enthusiast.   You could often find Tom in the summer at his beach house. He lived  by the motto, ``Smile, you are in Sea Isle City.''   Mr. Speaker, our deepest condolences go out to his entire family and  friends. Tom is now enjoying his eternal reward for a life he spent  serving others.                            Honoring Bob Godshall     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of  former Pennsylvania State Representative Bob Godshall who passed away  before the Thanksgiving holiday. Bob represented the 53rd District  honorably for 36 years and retired in 2018.   Bob Godshall was born in Franconia, Pennsylvania, on the family farm  where he lived until his passing. He was a proud graduate of Souderton  High School and Juniata College in Huntingdon. As an adult, he helped  run the family farm's poultry operation, served on the Souderton area  school board, and was a former Montgomery County controller.   In the State House, Bob served as the chairman of the Consumer  Affairs Committee, following his tenure as chairman of the Tourism and  Recreational Development Committee. He frequently worked across the  aisle to push legislation that protected consumers, boosted tourism  across the State, and benefited the people of Montgomery County.   Mr. Speaker, no matter the politics, Bob put his community first. Bob  worked tirelessly to bring better jobs, safety, and improved  infrastructure to our community. Bob was great man and a dedicated  public servant, and as long as good, honest individuals like him work  to serve the people, we can look forward to the future.                            ____________________
