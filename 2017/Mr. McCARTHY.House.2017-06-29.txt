 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  the continuing work he does as the chairman of the Rules Committee. It  is very important work for this Nation and the House.   Mr. Speaker, there are some debates on this floor that are very  complicated. They hinge on technicalities and complex judgment calls.  You need to properly weigh all the data, all the studies, and all the  nuances.   But I will tell you, Mr. Speaker, that today's debate is not  complicated. This is not about nuance. The subject is not complex. This  is about answering a simple question: Is the purpose of our government  to protect the American people first, or is the purpose of our  government to protect felons who have entered our country illegally,  broken our laws, and threatened our people?   I wish this were an exaggeration, but American citizens have died  because some local governments have refused to uphold our laws. These  so-called sanctuary cities offer safety for illegal felons, but they do  so by putting our families, neighbors, and fellow Americans in danger.   The American people now look to their government and they are  uncertain. They elected people to represent them, but would those  Representatives rather protect felons here illegally or their fellow  citizens?   As far as this House is concerned, let us end the uncertainty today.  Our government should, and always will, put the safety of American  people first. Cities offering sanctuary for criminals will no longer be  ignored. Criminals who threaten our citizens and reenter our country  with no respect for our laws will be punished.                                time  1300    Kate Steinle, an American citizen, a daughter, and a promising young  woman would be alive today if local governments did not act as a safe  haven for lawbreakers. Juan Lopez-Sanchez shot Kate after being  deported five times. He had seven felony convictions before he murdered  her.   After this crime, we asked the same questions the rest of America  did: How could this man be let free? Why was he in America in the first  place? How can cities across our Nation continue to shield such people  from the law?   In America, the Federal Government has little right to tell States  and localities how to conduct affairs properly left to them. But our  Federal Government has every right to demand that these governments  follow our just laws written in accordance with our Constitution. And  if they do not, if those cities protect criminals at the expense of  law-abiding Americans, they should not expect their fellow citizens to  help them through the Federal Government.   For those cities with laws designed to harbor immigrants who have  entered this country illegally, our legislation will prohibit those  laws, cut off Federal grant money, and allow the families who suffer as  a result of their foolishness the right to have their day in court.   And to the criminals: If you break our laws and ever return, justice  will come for you, and the penalty will be severe.   Mr. Speaker, being an American means something. We should never  forget that. If America is your home, you are a citizen. If you are  part of this national community, rest assured, the government is here  for you. The American people come first.
