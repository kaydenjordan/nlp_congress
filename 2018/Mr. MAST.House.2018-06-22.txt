 Mr. Speaker, today is day 22 of water exactly like this  being discharged into my community in Lake Okeechobee. You can see  exactly how disgusting it is.   What you cannot see is the disgusting smell that emanates from it.  You cannot see the toxins that are inside of it. You cannot see the  airborne pathogens that come off of it.   What you see behind me is a satellite image of the hundreds of square  miles of algae bloom that are in this lake that are being discharged  miles and miles away into my community.   My community did not put the algae bloom on the lake; they did not  put the nutrients into the lake that caused this algae bloom; but my  community pays the price, all under the umbrella of flood control for  other communities.   I believe my community is owed, at a minimum, one answer: How much  pollution is too much? How much danger to our community is too much?  How much before this will stop?                            ____________________
