 Mr. President, I rise today to honor and  recognize Mr. Ralph Hipp of Topeka, KS.   Mr. Ralph Hipp announced this week that he will be retiring September  2  [[Page S3608]]  after a 48-year career in broadcasting. He first joined the WIBW-TV  team in April 1990 as an anchor for 13 NEWS at 10. He briefly left  WIBW-TV in the fall of 1998 for his wife's job in Tennessee, but  returned to his anchor desk in Topeka exactly 2 years later, and has  remained a constant at 13 NEWS ever since.   Ralph first thought of retirement more than 2 years ago, but when the  pandemic began, he gladly remained part of the 13 NEWS teams to help  get everyone through the tough times. The last 2 years were the most  challenging and rewarding of Ralph's entire career with WIBW-TV.   Throughout his career, Ralph has hosted various programs and segments  loved by many in Northeast Kansas. He was a longtime host for the  Sunday night scholastic quiz bowl program ``High Q,'' recognized  exceptional students of all ages in the ``Good Kids'' Tuesday night  segment, and has hosted hundreds of viewers from the famous red couch  set since 2006. Hosting this program from the red couch has been a  blessing and joy for him, especially throughout the pandemic. Helping  people in their time of need is what the business is all about to  Ralph, and the Red Couch Program provided him the opportunity to be  able to help others.   I now ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the wonderful  impact Mr. Ralph Hipp has had on the WIBW-TV team and to honor him for  his 30 years of serving the families of Northeast Kansas in what he  calls ``the best job in the world.''                            ____________________
