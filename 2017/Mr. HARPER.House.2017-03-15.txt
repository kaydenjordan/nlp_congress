 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on House Administration be discharged from further consideration of the  bill (H.R. 1228) to provide for the appointment of members of the Board  of Directors of the Office of Compliance to replace members whose terms  expire during 2017, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate  consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.
