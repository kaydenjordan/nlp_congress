 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.R.  2434, the College Transparency Act. I want to thank my good friend from  Michigan, Congressman Mitchell, for his leadership and bipartisan work  on this very important bill.   This time of year, parents and students are beginning to make  important decisions about higher education for the next school year.                                time  1930    Unfortunately, there is little information available about what can  be expected from the large investment in a college or a university.  This legislation will enable students and families to make informed  choices about their education after high school.   The College Transparency Act will provide actionable, customizable  information for students and families as they consider college and  universities by accurately reporting on student outcomes, such as  enrollment, completion, and postcollege success across colleges and  majors.   Most importantly, this information will tell students how other  prospective students have succeeded at an institution and help point  them toward schools best suited for their unique needs and desired  outcomes.   The current college reporting system is overly burdensome on  institutions, yet it provides little practical information for students  and families due to significant gaps in college data reporting.   Additionally, the data collected only reports graduation rates for  students who begin as full-time students and finish at the same  institution, leaving out successes of part-time students and  [[Page H8372]]  any student who transfers and completes a degree at an institution  other than where they started. With more than half of bachelor's degree  recipients attending more than one school and nearly two-thirds of  community college students starting part-time, we have to ensure that  these students count.   One example of this impact from my alma mater, The Ohio State  University, is a veteran named Tami. Tami returned to school to  complete her social work degree after her military service. She  completed an associate of arts degree at Columbus State, a community  college, and transferred and eventually graduated with a social work  degree from The Ohio State University. She had a 3.9 grade point  average in the classroom and excelled in her two-semester field  placement at the university's Office of Military and Veterans Services.   Under this system, Tami's success story would not count toward Ohio  State success. Under the new system, it will. Today, the system would  not count Tami because she started at one school and transferred to  another school. Under the legislation that Mr. Mitchell is working on  and that I am talking about today, Tami would count again.   We need to make people count again. Tami served our country. Tami got  out of the military, came back, went to school part-time, then  transferred schools, went to school full-time, and completed her  practical experience. Under the current reporting system, Tami doesn't  count.   Let's fix that. That is what this bill would do. Under the updated  system, institutions would securely report privacy-protected student  level data to the National Center for Education Statistics, or NCES.  NCES would be responsible for presenting summary information on a user- friendly website for students and families, while securely storing  student information.   This legislation will help countless students and families make  better decisions about where to go for higher education, where they  should attend.   I want to thank Congressman Mitchell and Congressman Polis for  introducing this important, bipartisan legislation that will help so  many students and families, students like Tami.   I hope we can roll up our sleeves, work together, and get this bill  passed. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
