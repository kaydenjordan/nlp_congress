 Madam President, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Burton ``Burt'' Albert, a Connecticut native and remarkable man. Sadly,  Mr. Albert passed away in 2019, at the age of 86. He will be remembered  for his tireless commitment to community service and his deep devotion  to his wonderful family.   Born in Waterbury, Burt spent much of his life in Connecticut,  attending Cheshire Academy and Amherst College, where he graduated with  a bachelor of arts in 1954. A member of the ROTC program, Mr. Albert  went on to serve for 2 years as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Air  Force. Burt remained proud of his time in the military, and I applaud  his strong sense of patriotism and record of military service.   It was also in the Air Force where Mr. Albert met the love of his  life, Sylvia Meisel, who would become his wife of 61 years. They would  go on to build a wonderful family together, having three children-- Eric, Jonathan, and Debbie--and many grandchildren they adored. Mr.  Albert was a remarkable family man and cherished time with his loved  ones above all else.   Mr. Albert returned to Connecticut to work in his family's scrap  metal recycling business. Burt became the third generation of Alberts  to lead Albert Bros. Inc., a company that recently celebrated 125 years  of outstanding industry in the State of Connecticut. I have visited  Albert Bros. and seen firsthand the amazing new methods for turning  waste material into a useful new resource. The company is an integral  part of Waterbury commerce.   Under Mr. Albert's leadership, Albert Bros. grew substantially, and  he was respected by employees and customers alike. Amid all his  success, working with his sons and grandson in the family business was  one of the highlights of Mr. Albert's professional career.   Mr. Albert devoted much of his time to serving the Waterbury  community, bringing his tremendous leadership skills to many  organizations including St. Mary's Hospital, the Jewish Federation of  Western Connecticut, the Harold Leever Cancer Center, and the  Connecticut Community Foundation. Mr. Albert was also very active in  the United Way of Greater Waterbury and B'nai Israel Synagogue. In  these endeavors, Burt generously gave so much of his time and resources  to helping others.   Burton Albert leaves behind a remarkable legacy of service--to our  country, the State of Connecticut, and his community. But he will be  remembered most by his loving family as an extraordinary husband,  father, and grandfather. Burt's sense of humor, passion for learning,  and conviction in his beliefs are models for all of us. I hope my  colleagues will join me in celebrating the life of Mr. Burton  Albert.                            ____________________
