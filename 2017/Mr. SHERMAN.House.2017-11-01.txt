The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is  ordered.   Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment  reported from the Committee of the Whole?   If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a  substitute, as amended.   The amendment was agreed to.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third  reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.

I am opposed in its current form.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to  recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:         Mr. O'Halleran moves to recommit the bill H.R. 2936 to the       Committee on Natural Resources with instructions to report       the same back to the House forthwith, with the following       amendments:        Page 41 of the Rules Committee Print 115-36, after line 21,       insert the following new section:       SEC. 406. EXTENSION OF SECURE RURAL SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY                     SELF-DETERMINATION ACT OF 2000.         (a) Payments Extended.--Section 101 of the Secure Rural       Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 (16       U.S.C. 7111) is amended by striking ``2015'' both places it       appears and inserting ``2020''.        (b) Source of Payment Amounts.--Section 102(b)(3) of the       Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of       2000 (16 U.S.C. 7112(b)(3)) is amended to read as follows:        ``(3) Source of payment amounts.--The payment to an       eligible State or eligible county under this section for a       fiscal year shall be derived from any amounts that are       hereafter appropriated to carry out this Act.''.        Page 21 of the Rules Committee Print 115-36, line 17,       insert ``Any such plan shall include strategies for climate       change mitigation and adaptation and any forest management       activity must be carried out in a manner that is consistent       with such strategies.'' after the period.    Mr. BISHOP of Utah (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent to dispense with the reading of the motion.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Utah?   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for  5 minutes in support of his motion.                                time  1800    Mr. O'HALLERAN. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill,  which will not kill it or send it back to committee. If adopted, the  bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, schools and counties across rural America are facing a  funding and economic crisis. It has now been over 2 years since  Congress has failed to reauthorize the Secure Rural Schools program.  This is beyond unacceptable.   Schools and counties across rural America are facing a funding and  economic crisis, and the reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools  and Community Self-Determination Act will go a long way to helping  ensure children get the education they need to achieve success in  today's economy.   Across my district, I have heard families, teachers, and school  administrators in forest counties tell me about the dire straits  schools will be in if SRS is not reauthorized.   In Greenlee County, in eastern Arizona, the school superintendent  shared with me that if the county doesn't see SRS dollars, they will  have to close the school that provides special education services. This  is after the school has already gone through major changes to save  money.   Across rural Arizona, schools face issues with access to technology  and the educational opportunities that came with them. Reauthorizing  Secure Rural Schools will allow more schools to develop innovative  educational opportunities.   In Yavapai County, where they are using distance learning, schools  can share teachers. Making sure that students don't miss opportunities  because they live in rural America is the right thing to do, and  reauthorizing SRS will better enable coordination and support for  students.   Mr. Speaker, the people of rural Arizona and America are tough and  innovative, but the simple fact is that they need resources to keep  schools open and educate children. It is past time that we reauthorize  SRS, and I call on my colleagues to do so today.   Across rural America and rural Arizona, the need for infrastructure  is only growing. In Gila County, a bridge is needed to make it safer  for residents to cross a creek. SRS funding would make it possible for  the county to make a greater contribution to get the project completed.   If we are serious about passing a bipartisan infrastructure plan, it  is critical that we make sure that local communities can begin  planning. Reauthorizing SRS would allow that to happen.   Nationally, there are 720 counties and 4,400 school districts that  depend on Secure Rural Schools for education, as well as other critical  services and programs, like law enforcement and infrastructure.   Rural America is ready for a renaissance, but for it to happen, we  need to make sure that folks have equal access to opportunities in  school and in the workforce. That means that we need to guarantee that  schools have the resources that they need to educate our children and  achieve their potential. That means we need to make sure that  communities have infrastructure that supports local economies and keeps  people safe. That means we need to make sure that rural Americans have  a fair shot.  [[Page H8360]]    Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to support my commonsense  amendment on behalf of kids across rural America.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
