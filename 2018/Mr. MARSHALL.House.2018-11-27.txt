 Mr. Speaker, November is Prematurity Awareness Month,  and as the number of preterm births continues to rise in the United  States, it is important to acknowledge this serious issue.   In my own experience as an obstetrician having delivered over 5,000  babies, I have seen firsthand the seriousness of early birth. Premature  birth is still the number one cause of infant mortality in the United  States and around the world. Advancements in detection and care for  infants born early have not made the same strides that other areas of  the medical field have.   The premature birth rate in Kansas is right below the national  average of 9.93, meaning that approximately 1 in every 10 babies is  born premature. In the coming weeks, Congress has the opportunity to  act and pass the PREEMIE Reauthorization Act of 2018 and help those who  cannot yet help themselves.                    Recognizing Kansas Guardsmen Overseas     Mr. Speaker, this past holiday weekend, I had the  pleasure, the opportunity, to travel to the Middle East and to the Horn  of Africa. Specifically, I got to visit with some 700 Kansas National  Guardsmen from the 2nd 137th Combined Arms Battalion and Battery C,  161st Field Artillery. These guardsmen have been deployed since April  in support of Operation Enduring Freedom Spartan Shield.   I am often asked what was the purpose of my trip. Why do Congressmen  do these trips?   First of all, I think it is important that, as a Congressman, I bring  these troops a message of hope and thanks and let them know personally  that we do care and are grateful for their service and the sacrifices  they are making for this country.   Next, my goal was to check on the mental and physical well-being of  our troops. Despite talking to hundreds of our soldiers, I cannot get  one of them to register one complaint. Specifically, I thought their  mental health was outstanding, that they were all in good spirits and,  indeed, had great hope. Physically, their nutrition appeared to be well  attended to. Their medical and dental needs were well attended to as  well.   My one concern, perhaps, would be the housing. And though no soldier  complained about housing, when you are there for a year at a time, I do  think we could supply our soldiers with better housing.   Today, we are reminded of the dangers of serving in our military as  we lost three soldiers to a roadside bomb in Afghanistan. Certainly, my  sympathy goes out to the families. I know the words that I can express  will never be enough, but I would say this: Today we are also reminded  once again that freedom is not free.                            ____________________
