 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, in December, Republicans rushed, and I do mean rushed,  sped to pass with little thought, debate, or consideration for the  long-term impact, a tax overhaul that has since been exposed over and  over again for its structural and fiscal flaws.   Contrary to the false bill of goods that they are still marketing to  the American people, this scam would shower wealthy households and big  corporations with the dollars shaved off of the incomes of working  Americans nationwide. It further widens the already gaping divide  between the ultra rich and the middle class.   In New Jersey, my constituents will be among those hardest hit as it  guts the Federal deduction for State and local taxes, the exact  opposite of the cuts and breaks Republicans have given so much lip  service to.                                time  1345    Now, months after patting themselves on the back, Republicans are  backtracking. It seems that, on second thought, lining the pockets of  millionaires and corporations to the tune of $1.5 trillion isn't a  sound fiscal decision, and to fix it, they decided to revive the so- called balanced budget amendment.   To be very clear, this isn't about fiscal responsibility. This is  just another scam, hoodwinking working Americans as they cut, slash,  and burn away the programs and services that keep families going, that  help keep food on the table during rough spells, and that maintain  basic living standards and help people find jobs.   To save the cuts they made for millionaires, they will use this  amendment to slash healthcare access and the retirement security of our  seniors through cuts to Social Security and Medicare.   To save the cuts they made for millionaires, they will use this  amendment to cut employment insurance, early childhood education, and  nutrition programs.   To save the cuts they made for millionaires, they will use this  amendment to wreak havoc for working families.   Instead of more cuts, we should be focused on investments that will  produce jobs and economic growth, building new roads and bridges,  ensuring workers make decent wages, and giving our young people the  best chance at a good education and a bright future.   I urge my colleagues to vote against this so-called balanced budget  amendment and the harm it represents.
