As part of its vicious  crusade promoting a failed ideology, the Soviet Union perpetrated a  forced starvation campaign against ethnic Ukrainians, hoping to erase  their place in history and their cries for freedom and independence. We  must never forget these crimes against humanity. Ukraine today faces a  different kind of threat from its neighbor Russia's ongoing occupation  of its land and aggression towards its people. We must recall the  lessons from history and remain united in solidarity with our  democratic friends and allies and all those who pursue freedom and  justice. I am proud to represent a strong, engaged, and vibrant  Ukrainian community in New Jersey, and I commend your efforts to  continue to bring to light injustices of the past and efforts to  promote a brighter future.                            ____________________
