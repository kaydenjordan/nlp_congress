 Mr. Chairman, in my home State of Minnesota, agriculture  is one of the primary drivers of our economy. Right now, farmers,  ranchers, and agricultural workers across the country are looking to  Congress for a strong farm bill that improves the farm safety net and  brings certainty to producers in uncertain times because life on the  farm isn't what it used to be.   Today, farmers are suffering some of the worst rates of suicide in  the country. General social isolation, downturn of the markets, low  farm income, regulatory strains, and a lack of treatment options all  make it hard for farmers to get the help they need.   That is why I introduced the STRESS Act to boost resources  specifically for farmers' mental health. With the support of Chairman  Conaway and the House Agriculture Committee, I am proud to see it  included in this year's farm bill.   Our farmers who feed the world are feeling the weight of the world on  their shoulders. It is time we get them the help and care they deserve.
