 Madam Speaker, I rise today in solemn observance of  National Gun Violence Survivors Week.   Colorado is home, and I am proud to represent the communities of  Colorado's Sixth Congressional District, communities that have seen the  horrors of gun violence firsthand.   Too many of my constituents bear the scars of gun violence long after  their wounds have healed. Some never heal. In honor of their pain,  their courage, and their advocacy, we must call on the Senate to pass  the commonsense reforms that have already been approved in the House.   We must act now for Julie from Highlands Ranch, Colorado, who was  shot when she was 13. Julie was left paralyzed from the chest down,  requiring her to walk with canes and braces for the rest of her life.  My heart is with Julie for having the courage to speak out in support  of commonsense reforms.  [[Page H931]]    We must act now for all survivors like Julie and we must act now for  those who no longer have a voice.                            ____________________
