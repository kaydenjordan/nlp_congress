 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of S.  4524, the Speak Out Act. I am proud to support this bill and thank my  good friends and colleagues Senator Gillibrand and Congresswoman  Frankel for their leadership, and Chairman Nadler and the Speaker for  bringing it to the floor.   This bill is a step toward ending a culture of silence and coercion  that further deprives survivors of sexual assault from achieving  justice.   We must put an end to the enablement of perpetrators in the workforce  by eliminating the use of NDAs in sexual misconduct cases.   While this bill is progress toward eradicating institutional  protections for perpetrators, we cannot stop here. As a champion of  sexual and reproductive health and rights, I hope that we continue  joining efforts to fix this toxic system and empower survivors of  sexual assault to be the authors of their own stories.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill.
