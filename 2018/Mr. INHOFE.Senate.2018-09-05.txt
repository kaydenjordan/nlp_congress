 Madam President, reserving the right to object.   Right now, there is a court case being heard in Texas on the  constitutionality of ObamaCare. We are all aware of that.   In their decision upholding the constitutionality of ObamaCare, the  Supreme Court said that under the commerce clause alone, ObamaCare  would be unconstitutional. It was only because of the individual  mandate, which they saw as a tax, that ObamaCare was upheld.   Last year, we eliminated the individual mandate in our tax cut, so  the constitutionality needs to be revisited, which is what these States  are doing. It would be inappropriate for the Senate to intervene in  this case.   Further, this resolution instructs all provisions of ObamaCare to be  defended, including the medical device tax, the Cadillac tax, the  health insurance tax, and other provisions that have proven extremely  unpopular on both sides of the aisle. For that reason, I object.    I have already objected.    Madam President, while I have the floor, I want to make  one comment about the statement that was made by my good friend from  West Virginia. The States are looking at it now. In some of these  areas, preexisting conditions, the Senator is correct; there is a broad  support for this. For that reason, various States are now looking at  it.   I want to share something, since I have the floor. We have had an  exciting day with the addition of a new Member, Jon Kyl. I want to  mention one thing about Senator Kyl. Many years ago, Senator Kyl and I  were actually elected to the House of Representatives on the same day,  and we were elected to the Senate on the same day.   I remember so well, many years ago, when I was first elected to the  House, it happened that my father--I lived in Iowa at that time, and  Jon's father was a Member of Congress. So the first thing he said to me  was, when you get elected, go over and meet a guy named Jon Kyl. Never  did I dream we would go through all of this, and we would be meeting  again for the third time in another election.   He will be a great addition. Everyone knows that no one can fill the  shoes of  [[Page S6040]]  our good Senator, John McCain, but certainly there is no one who comes  closer than Jon Kyl, having served with Senator McCain for 20 years.   I had an experience that I want to share this afternoon, something  that happened in church on Sunday. On Sunday, I was at a church. It is  a little rural church in Oklahoma called Church On The Lake. A guy  named Mark Deckard is the pastor there. This is not my church. In fact,  my wife and I, our church is the First Presbyterian Church in Tulsa.  That is the church she and I were married in a number of years ago,  where all of our kids were married, and where all of our kids were  baptized. My wife was baptized there over 80 years ago. So no one is  closer to that church than we are, but occasionally I will go to  another church.   Nobody actually knew I was going to be at this church last Sunday. I  want to share an experience I had. A lady whom I didn't know came up to  me. Her name is Lois Keene. She asked: Would you give this letter to  President Trump? I don't think there is a Member of the Senate or the  House who doesn't get this request quite often. It sounds quite easy to  do, but it is not easy to do. After I read the letter, I decided this  is something I really want to do.   She asked: Would you give this letter to President Trump?   I said: Is it OK if I read it?   And I read it. It was a letter supporting him, recognizing--and this  is someone from Afton, OK. It is so obvious to her what the press has  done unmercifully to this President. I have never seen anything like  it. She has never seen anything like it, and so she had something she  wanted to give to me defending the President.   I read it, and I said: You know, I have to say that these are not the  words I would use. If I were defending the President, I would say-- because to get people's attention, when you have an unfriendly media,  you have to simplify it so everyone understands it. So I said I would  normally just talk about three issues.   No. 1, the economy. Our economy right now at this time, we have not  seen anything like it in 40 years. There are two indicators that you  look at, one is economic growth. The economic growth during the last  quarter actually exceeded 4 percent. It has been averaging over 3  percent. During the Obama years, for 8 years, it averaged 1.5 percent-- 1.5 percent growth--as opposed to at least doubling that or maybe three  times that.   Now, why is this important? It is important because for every 1  percent increase in economic activity, what that does is bring in new  revenue equaling about $2.9 trillion over 10 years. What does that tell  you? It tells you that when we are now going through and rebuilding the  military and all of these things, the infrastructure, these are things  we need to do, and they are going to cost money. That indicator is  there. Then, also, there is the indicator in terms of employment. Our  unemployment right now has actually dipped below 4 percent. Economists  always say 4 percent is full of employment, and so we have that.   The economy just couldn't be better than it is. It is undeniable, and  yet nobody talks about it. The media doesn't talk about it.   The second thing I would say is that everyone knows now what happened  during the 8 years. I don't criticize former President Obama. He is  what I call a real honest liberal. He is not a closet liberal. He comes  out and says it. He believes we need to have more of a socialist  society. We have lived through that. Someone with that belief is not  going to be real strong in terms of building the military. We have gone  through this military thing for about 8 years, and now we are  defending--we passed the Defense bill, which we named after John  McCain. That Defense bill is putting us back on the road for a strong  national defense.   People think erroneously that America has the best of everything, and  they don't. Right now, we have gotten to the point where our--a lot of  our systems--our triad system, for example, which is the modernization  system, both China and Russia have one now that is better than ours.   Our artillery systems--you measure our artillery by the range and by  rapid fire, and we are outgunned by both Russia and China in those  areas. We know what has happened.   Right now, we are at the point where we have actually confirmed 26  appellate judges just in the short term that this President has been  in. So I would be talking about that, but that is not what she said.   It is true, and her observation is true, that it doesn't go unnoticed  by people when you have the media that is really not treating the  President right.   By the way, I was a victim of this too. In fact, during the McCain  discussion, after McCain's life was lost, several times on the floor I  talked about the fact that way back in 1994, when I ran for U.S.  Senate, there were only three Senators who came out to Oklahoma to  help, and one of them was John McCain. He came out twice. We flew all  over in my little airplane in about 100 degrees, and he campaigned for  me. So he has been a good friend. Yet, by responding to one of the  major medias in a way that I made some comment about the fact that we  have two individuals, Senator McCain and President Trump, who just  don't have a good relationship--everybody knows that--they tried to  turn that into something that was negative that they wanted people to  believe that I said. In fact, I was in St. Louis between flights, at  about 10 o'clock at night, and shortly after that, someone jumped all  over me and was convinced that I had said something negative, and it  just flat was not true.    So, anyway, I would like to read the letter before I tell you that I  am going to try to pass this on to the President.   So I read it. As I read the letter, there was a group, as can happen  after a sermon takes place and people are all sitting around talking,  and every head nodded with approval of this letter that this lady gave  me. Here it is right here. That is her handwriting there. The letter  says:         Dear President Trump,        I am writing this letter to encourage you. All across       America God's people are praying for you. With all my heart I       know God put you in office for such a time as this. He has       given America a window of time. At this time there is a       spiritual war going on for the soul of America. Good versus       evil. That is why there is so much opposition against you and       the Christian people.        You have so many, many people praying for you. Stand       strong. I know you are a warrior or God would not have placed       you in office. You will continue to come against opposition       because the enemy (Satan) will continue to fight you as he       will God's people. The stakes are high!        As God's warrior, continue to fight. We are fighting the       battle with you on our knees. Many battles are won on our       knees. Thank you for being our leader and our President! Our       love is with you.        Yours in Christ,        Lois Keene        Afton, OK    So I would just say to the President: You are being butchered by the  media. Everybody knows that. But keep in mind that America is full of  Lois Keenes and they love you.   With that, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
