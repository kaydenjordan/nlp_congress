 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 842, the  Protecting the Right to Organize Act.   Workers, especially people of color, built this country, and they  have kept it afloat. Never has that truth been more evident than now,  as we grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic.   Despite their essential roles in our society, though, we have seen  workers' rights systematically suppressed for decades, including the  fundamental right to ban together to organize and to advocate for fair  treatment, for fair pay, and benefits for safe and healthy work  environments, and for the respect and dignity they are due as working  people, let alone the backbone of our economy.   But, Mr. Speaker and colleagues, let's be clear. This is not just  about fairness. It is about justice, economic justice. Workers,  especially women and people of color, have driven economic growth in  this country, but have seen the fruit of their labor concentrating and  accumulating in the hands of the wealthiest. In other words, their  work, their sacrifice has not trickled down.   Enough is enough. Workers deserve their share. They deserve justice.  I strongly support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the Laborers'  International Union of North America.                                                          LiUNA!,                                      Washington, DC, March 8, 2021.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 500,000 members of       the Laborers' International Union of North America (LIUNA), I       write to ask you to support H.R. 842, the Protecting the       Right to Organize (PRO) Act, when it comes to the House floor       for a vote. The right to join a union is critical to ensure       that workers receive fair pay and benefits and safe jobsites.       The PRO Act will expand the National Labor Relations Act       (NLRA) to ensure that workers and unions have real,       enforceable protections under the law.        One of the most significant problems with the NLRA is the       absence of effective remedies for workers against employers       who break the law. Often, employers fire union supporters to       defeat union organizing efforts, knowing that the penalty is       low, only lost wages, and even that is reduced by the amount       the worker earns on any other work that he or she finds after       getting fired. H.R. 842 will address this serious problem by       authorizing the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) to       impose penalties of up to $50,000 for unfair labor practices.        The PRO Act strengthens enforcement of the NLRA in other       important ways. For example, the PRO Act allows workers to       exercise First Amendment rights to free speech against so-      called secondary employers. It strengthens workers' and       unions' representational rights and protects immigrants'       labor rights. Significantly, it adopts the so-called ABC test       for distinguishing employees from independent contractors.       Under the Bill, a person is an independent contractor only if       the individual is free from the employer's control and       direction, the service is outside the normal course of the       employer's business, and the individual is customarily       engaged in an independently established trade or business.       H.R. 842 will also prevent employers from misclassifying       workers as supervisors and will establish that employers with       control over employees are held responsible for their actions       in the workplace, including users of temp agencies. This       addresses an important circumstance, since three million       people are employed daily by temp agencies. The PRO Act would       also ban captive audience meetings, giving workers the power       and freedom to decide for themselves if union representation       is right for them. Importantly, the PRO Act would push back       on the recent so-called right to work laws, which harm unions       and our members, by allowing unions to recover fair share       fees covering the costs of collective bargaining and       representation.        For these reasons, and for the many other improvements to       labor law in the Bill, LIUNA supports the PRO Act and asks       you to vote yes when it comes to the House floor.        With kind regards, I am            Sincerely yours,                                                  Terry O'Sullivan,                                                 General President.
