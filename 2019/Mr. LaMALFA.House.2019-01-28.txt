 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend President Trump for  coming together with this 3-week deal that will allow us to open the  government, as it has, and continue the discussion on the border  security issue we so desperately need.   It is time to put up or shut up. This has been a bipartisan effort in  the past with previous legislation to build the border fence and a lot  of rhetoric and a lot of talk by the other side of the aisle supporting  a controlled border and legal immigration.   It is time to go ahead and do it--no more talk, no more obfuscation,  and no more pointing fingers in the other direction. We need to have  border security in a bipartisan way, as it has been done in the past.   Who cares that it is President Trump or someone else in the White  House only because it is a political fight? This is something our  Nation needs.   So, again, 3 weeks to get it done, 3 weeks to come together and  acknowledge that a barrier system on our border is one important  component of many to have a secure border and allow legal immigration  in this country.                            ____________________
