 Madam Speaker, I rise today and ask this body to keep in  mind four numbers: 6 million, 9, 15 trillion, and 4. Moody's predicts  that if Congress fails to address the debt ceiling, we will lose 6  million jobs, reach a 9 percent unemployment rate, wipe out $15  trillion in household wealth, and see a decline in real GDP of 4  percent.   That would trigger a global market panic not seen since the 2008  financial crisis. The brinkmanship that has been displayed by my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle is really incomprehensible,  but also dangerous.   The debt limit has long been a bipartisan issue. Each of the last  seven times the debt limit has been addressed, it was on a bipartisan  basis. Putting politics ahead of the country is the exact kind of  cynicism that makes American people sick. And as a former business  leader, these are the games that keep our business community from being  able to invest, to innovate, and grow.   So I say to my colleagues, it is your duty to extend the debt ceiling  and protect the American people from an economic crash. The Joint  Economic Committee, which we all depend on for advice and guidance,  predicts a default will result in a lasting downgrade of America's  credit, drastically increasing costs for car loans, mortgages, student  loans, and credit.   Six million jobs, a 9 percent unemployment rate, $15 trillions in  household wealth, and a decline in real GDP of 4 percent is what is at  stake. We must vote ``yes.''                                time  1500
