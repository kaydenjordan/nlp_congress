 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Johnson for yielding.   For the past year, we have heard dangerous calls to disband, defund,  and dismantle the police.   Guess what?   Since then, dangerous crimes have skyrocketed.   Is it any wonder?   We have also seen a rising number of police officers killed or  wounded in the line of duty. This is totally unacceptable, and the  effort to vilify the police is to blame.   Our Nation's police officers are brave and hardworking men and women  who put themselves on the front line each and every day to protect us  and my constituents. These officers deserve to go home to their  families at the end of the day.   I am grateful for the sacrifices of our law enforcement officers in  Arizona and throughout the entire Nation. Both, during the National  Police Week and every single day, I will support our law enforcement  and defend the police.   The vilification of our police officers is having a terrible effect  in our communities. I have talked to police chiefs who are having a  difficult time even hiring police officers, and this push in some of  the legislation that we passed here in this very own House to take away  qualified immunity from the police so that anybody can sue them  personally is wrong.   I will continue to stand up for the police, I will continue to stand  up for the public, and I will continue to stand up for public safety.
