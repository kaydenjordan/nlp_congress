 Mr. Speaker, my district and communities across our  Nation are being ravaged by the heroin and opioid epidemic. This crisis  touches our homes, our friends, and our families in ways that have  grave effects on everyday people and everyday lives.   Over the last 15 years, heroin-related deaths have quadrupled across  our country. In 2016, over 3,600 New Yorkers died of an opioid  overdose, with fatalities in some counties in my district doubling and  tripling.   This is why, since arriving in Congress, I have worked with my  colleagues on the Bipartisan Heroin Task Force to pass the  Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, the 21st Century Cures Act,  and to provide over $4 billion in funding to fight this epidemic. But  we must continue to attack this epidemic head-on, which is why we are  passing a package of bills this week to prevent addiction, encourage  treatment and recovery, and improve law enforcement to keep our  communities safe.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to continue this incredibly  important bipartisan work so that the families we represent can get the  relief they need.                            ____________________
