 Mr. President, I want the same 30 seconds.   I implore you all to understand the difference between fighting a  crime and a war. The Senator's amendment, as drafted, applies outside  the United States.   Remember Anwar al-Awlaki, the American citizen who hid with al-Qaida  in Yemen? We killed the guy. If we had captured him, the last thing I  would have wanted him to hear is, ``You have a right to a lawyer,''  because he is now part of the enemy force.   The case law is very clear here. You had saboteurs from Germany marry  up with American citizens in Long Island to commit sabotage in America.  In re Quirin, the Court held that an American citizen who joins the  enemy force can be an enemy combatant under law of war and tried by the  military.   We have a case where a man was held at Charleston for 5 years--Mr.  Padilla, who sided with al-Qaida. The court said it doesn't matter if  you are captured in the United States. Your activity matters.   Here is what I want. I don't want to read these guys their Miranda  rights because they are recruiting in our own backyard. American  citizens are high on the list of al-Qaida and ISIS to use against us.  When we capture them, I don't want to read them the Miranda rights.   We don't have to hold them indefinitely. If an American citizen is  suspected to join the enemy, let's have a hearing about whether or not  they have given up their citizenship. That way, we don't have to read  them their Miranda rights and lose the ability to interrogate a person  who has joined the enemy.   What you are doing is incentivizing ISIS and al-Qaida to find an  American because they have protections other people would not have in  their own backyard. It is insane to say America is not part of the  battlefield. Ask people in New York if America is part of the  battlefield. Ask people in the Pentagon if America is part of the  battlefield. If you think America is not part of the battlefield, vote  with him. If it is, table this amendment.
