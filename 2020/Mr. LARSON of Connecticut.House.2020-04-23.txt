 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act.   Our nation's health and economic recovery are inextricably linked  during this pandemic. Today's vote is another win in the fight against  the coronavirus. This legislation strengthens the Paycheck Protection  Program by allocating an additional $310 billion in funding, with money  reserved for community-based lenders, small and medium-sized banks, and  credit unions to reach more small businesses. It also includes vital  funding for our hospitals and health care workers and money for much  needed testing.   While today's additional funding is a win, much more needs to be  done. Without additional measures for testing, tracking, treatment, and  ultimately a vaccine, we won't overcome this crisis. We must also do  more to help individuals suffering from the impact on the economy, as  well as non-profits not covered under the CARES Act, and state and  local governments who have been devastated by lost revenues and protect  essential workers.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that my name be removed as a cosponsor of H.R. 6494.
