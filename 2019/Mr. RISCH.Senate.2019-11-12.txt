 Madam President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each month  I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  However, in honor of Veterans Day on November 11, this month I will  honor a veteran-owned small business for each of the 10 days the Senate  is in legislative session. The personal sacrifices made by America's  veterans have protected the very freedoms and values that give each of  us and our children the ability to achieve the American dream. The  skills veterans learn as members of the military are invaluable and  undoubtedly contribute to Idaho's flourishing veteran business  community. I am proud of the sacrifices veterans have made to protect  our country and that they are choosing Idaho to call home when they  complete their service in the military.   As your U.S. Senator from the great State of Idaho, it is my pleasure  to recognize Mac's Vacs in Lewiston as the Idaho Small Business of the  Day for November 12, 2019. Mac's Vacs was founded in 1950 and is owned  and operated by U.S. Air Force veteran Dennis Prine. The company first  opened in a garage and has since moved into a local storefront in the  same neighborhood. After serving in the Air Force, Prine acquired Mac's  Vacs in the 1980s and has expanded and improved its services since.   Mac's Vacs offers a variety of appliance services for customers,  including vacuum sales and service, central vacuum systems, commercial  chemicals, and more. Prine even offers technical assistance through a  YouTube channel. The company's mission to provide quality products,  knowledge, and service to customers has proven fundamental to the  success of the business.   Congratulations to Dennis Prine and all of the employees at Mac's  Vacs for being selected as the Veteran-owned Idaho Small Business of  the Day for November 12, 2019. You make our great State proud, and I  look forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
