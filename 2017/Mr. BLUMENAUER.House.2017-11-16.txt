 Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from 17  environmental organizations opposing this legislation.                                                   November 8, 2017.        Dear Representative, on behalf of our millions of members       and activists, we write to urge you to oppose the Republican       leadership's tax legislation, the misnamed Tax Cuts and Jobs       Act (H.R. 1). This plan would lavish huge and permanent tax       cuts to the richest 1% and corporate polluters that are       destined to be paid for by the health and environmental well-      being of communities across the country. The bill's debt-      busting tax cuts for the wealthiest are sure to mean deep       cuts to federal and state programs and safeguards that       protect our air, water, lands, and wildlife that benefit       people across this country every day. The plan puts at risk       our clean energy future by preserving tax breaks for dirty       energy sources while slashing them for cleaner forms of       energy. And if the tax plan itself weren't harmful enough, it       is also being packaged in the Senate with unrelated,       controversial legislation that hands over the pristine and       sacred Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to exploitation by Big       Oil.        This plan steers most of its tax breaks to the wealthiest       people in this country and corporations and adds at least       $1.5 trillion to the deficit. Americans across the country       will suffer because those tax cuts are likely to be paid for       by slashing services and safeguards that our government       provides, from healthcare to education to environmental       protection. The health of communities across the nation will       suffer if the Environmental Protection Agency is further       hampered in its mission to protect public health and hold       polluters accountable for violating laws like the Clean Air       Act and Safe Drinking Water Act. The people who work in and       benefit from America's thriving outdoor recreational economy       will take a hit if the national parks and other lands       stewarded by the Department of the Interior are forced to       suffer further cuts because of this reckless tax plan.        This tax plan also steers our nation's energy policy in the       wrong direction by leaving in place the vast majority of       existing tax preferences for polluting industries like oil,       gas, coal and nuclear and reducing, phasing-out, and       eliminating incentives for cleaner sources of energy.       Permanent tax breaks for fossil fuels dwarf those for       renewables by a margin of 7:1, yet this bill would suddenly       eliminate the tax credit for purchasing an electric vehicle,       disrupt the wind industry by reducing the credit for future       projects by a third and placing into jeopardy the eligibility       of existing projects, and eliminate the commercial solar       investment credit. While some clean energy technology credits       are reintroduced, they, too, are set to phase out. Meanwhile,       oil companies will receive a new billion dollar hand out       while only the smallest of existing preferences for fossil       fuels are eliminated--leaving more than $14 billion in       permanent annual federal subsidies untouched. Despite       rhetoric from GOP leaders that the tax code shouldn't pick       winners and losers, this bill very clearly picks polluting       energy sectors as winners yet again, putting at risk the       impressive growth of clean energy and robbing us and our       children of a cleaner future.        The GOP leadership's plan is to package this tax       legislation in the Senate with unrelated, controversial       legislation that would open up the iconic Arctic National       Wildlife Refuge to drilling. This legislation would       irreversibly damage one of America's greatest wild places and       is only being included in a desperate attempt to secure       enough votes in the Senate for tax cuts for corporations and       the wealthiest Americans. The Arctic Refuge's spectacular       landscape of rugged mountains, boreal forests, and wild       rivers supports more than 250 species including polar and       brown bears, musk oxen, and birds that migrate from all 50       states and 6 continents each year. The indigenous Gwich'in       people call the refuge's coastal plain ``The Sacred Place       Where Life Begins,'' an area that serves as the calving       grounds for the Porcupine Caribou Herd which they rely on as       a primary source of food, and for cultural and spiritual       needs. This provision is being included in an attempt to       generate $1 billion in government revenue to pay for the       package's tax cuts for the wealthy, but multiple analyses       show that it is unlikely to raise anywhere close to that       amount. In short, including drilling in the Arctic Refuge in       the tax legislation is both environmentally and fiscally       irresponsible.        For these reasons, we urge you to oppose H.R. 1 and instead       work together on legislation that will truly benefit our       communities, power our economy with clean, renewable energy,       and protect the environment that we all depend upon for our       health and well-being.

Mr. Speaker, Donald Trump is going to be on Capitol  Hill rallying Republicans to vote for his tax bill perfectly designed  for his benefit: eliminating the alternative minimum tax, one of the  few ways he pays any tax at all; abolishing the inheritance tax,  allowing him to pass on tax-free hundreds of millions of dollars to his  family; and expanding access to the lower passthrough tax rates for  many large and profitable businesses. Donald Trump lists hundreds of  passthrough entities on his financial forms.   Donald Trump is the king of debt, and this monstrosity of a tax bill  is fueled by increasing the national debt $2.3 trillion and cutting  taxes for the wealthy financed by increased debt burden on our children  and grandchildren.   Of course, details are starting to leak out, such as special deals  for baseball teams. Breaking a bipartisan commitment to the wind energy  industry is already causing their stock prices to fall, jeopardizing  billions of dollars of projects and putting tens of thousands of jobs  at risk with the only retroactive provision in the bill breaking a  bipartisan commitment that many of us worked on with the energy  industry.   The Republican proposal showers riches on the wealthiest Americans  and most profitable corporations who are not going to create jobs and  raise wages. What they are going to do is buy things and make more  money. What is going to happen is that, in the years ahead, taxes are  going to rise for millions of Americans and even more in the future.  [[Page H9387]]    Now, this tax perhaps has the most cruel element--what I call the  Alzheimer's tax--repealing the medical expense deduction used by over 9  million middle class Americans who saved almost $90 billion in 2015-- gone.   This stunning action places additional burdens on many elderly and  vulnerable middle-income Americans trying to plan ahead for the  crushing financial burden dealing with Alzheimer's. We never had a  hearing on anything like this. It wouldn't stand the light of day. The  American public will be cranky about this.
