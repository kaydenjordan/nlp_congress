 Madam Chair, I am disappointed that this bill, H.R. 2824,  injects needless controversy into reauthorizing the Maternal, Infant,  and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program.   Home visiting is an evidence-based approach that connects pregnant  women and families with young children to nurses, social workers, and  other professionals. Through these programs, parents learn skills that  help reduce abuse and neglect and improve child development during the  crucial early years of life.   Most importantly, home visiting is backed by strong evidence that  shows these programs are an effective way to improve outcomes for at- risk families. Unfortunately, H.R. 2824 ignores the proven successes of  home visiting in favor of harmful, partisan changes to the law. In  particular, I am troubled by language in this bill that would cut off  funding to States and Tribal organizations that are unable to match  Federal spending on home visiting. The bipartisan bill in the Senate  does not do that; you do.   Advocates are concerned that this could cause States to scale back or  even end their programs altogether. In addition, this bill makes a  number of ill-advised changes that have little or no apparent  justification. Research shows that home visiting programs are working  well, yet only 6 percent of eligible individuals currently participate.  We should be looking at expanding, not undermining, access to home  visiting.   We need, at the very least, a clean bill that reauthorizes the home  visiting program in a bipartisan way. Unfortunately, H.R. 2824 is not  that bill, and, for that reason, I urge that we vote ``no.''
