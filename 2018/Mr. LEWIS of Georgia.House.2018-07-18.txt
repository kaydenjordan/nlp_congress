 Mr. Speaker, I come to the House floor because  today is the birthday of my friend, my partner in the fight for justice  and equality, Nelson Mandela.   During the height of the civil rights movement and the early days of  the labor movement, you had to make a decision: Which side are you on?   So, Mr. Speaker, on this day, of all days, I cannot, I will not stay  silent when our Nation, our democracy, and the American people are  under attack. We fought too hard and too long to stand on the sidelines  when so much is at stake.   When you see something that is not right, that is not just, you have  to find a way to get in the way. You have to get in good trouble-- necessary trouble.   Now is the time to wake up. It is time to be brave, bold, and  courageous. During the American Revolution, people suffered and died  for the dream of democracy, for the sacred right to vote, and for the  ability to choose their representatives. Hundreds and thousands of men  and women lost their lives to preserve our union and to defend our  values.   What I saw on Monday was a shame, an embarrassment, and a disgrace to  their legacy, their memory, and what they sacrificed. During times like  these, I encourage every person to take some time and have what I call  an executive session with themselves and their very souls. Because  today, Mr. Speaker, each of us faces the question of what it means to  be patriotic.   Ask yourself, do you stand with the American people or do you stand  with a dictator? Do you stand with democracy or do you stand with a  czar? Do you stand with friends and allies or do you stand with someone  who approves violent attacks on the media, human rights advocates, and  struggling democracies?   Mr. Speaker, the American House is on fire, it is burning, and if we  are not mindful, if we are not watchful, this fire will consume us all.   The United States Constitution began with the words: ``We, the  People.'' You see, the Founding Fathers' very first priority, the very  first article was to outline the role and the responsibilities of the  United States Congress in our system of checks and balances.                                time  1045    The people who elected us are sounding the alarms. Never before has  our constitutional mandate been more important. Never before have the  pillars of our democracy been under attack.   Mr. Speaker, each and every one of us swore an oath of office.  Whether Democrat or Republican, we all have an equal mission, an  obligation, and a mandate to uphold this promise.   Mr. Speaker, the time has come, and the question is simple: Will you  show up for duty?   Congress must speak up, we must speak out, and, Mr. Speaker, we must  act. If we fail to do so, history and the American voters will not be  kind.   The threat is occurring in realtime on our watch, and the ball is in  our court. The clock is ticking, and there is no time to waste.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman  from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose this rule and to support the  previous question.   In a democracy, the right to vote is the most powerful nonviolent  tool we have. Many people marched and protested for the right to vote.  Some gave a little blood, and others lost their lives.   Some of you have heard me say that the right to vote is precious,  almost sacred. In my heart of hearts, I believe that we should make it  simple and convenient for all of our citizens to be part of the  democratic process. It should not matter whether you are Black or  White, Latino, Asian-American, or Native American. We should be able to  participate in the democratic process.   On March 7, 1965, I gave a little blood on the Edmund Pettus Bridge  for the right to vote. Before the Voting Rights Act in 1965 was passed,  some people had to count the number of bubbles in a bar of soap or the  number of jelly beans in a jar.   All across America today, when people go out to attempt to vote, they  stand in long, immovable lines. That is not right, that is not fair,  and it is not just. We can do better, and we must do better.   We have a moral obligation, a mission, and a mandate to empower all  of the American people, not just a select few. We must do what is  right, what is fair, and what is just.   Today, our democracy is under attack, by forces within and forces  abroad. We need to fix it and fix it now.   For these reasons, I am proud to sponsor H.R. 12, the Voter  Empowerment Act, with my friends and my colleagues. It is a good bill,  a necessary bill, and a patriotic bill to protect and to preserve our  voting system.   Mr. Speaker, I urge each and every one of my colleagues to support  the previous question.
