 Mr. Speaker, this week is National Police Week, a time  to thank our brave men and women in law enforcement and honor those who  have lost their lives in the line of duty.   Police departments in small communities, like many in the Central  Valley, struggle to have enough funding to recruit, train, and provide  resources for their officers. As I meet with law enforcement across my  district, I hear firsthand just how much stress is being placed on  these officers, who are consistently being asked to do more with less  resources.   Despite all of this, our police officers still wake up each morning,  put their uniforms on, and go into our communities to uphold their oath  to protect and serve, knowing very well that they may not come home  that night.   It is critical that we continue to fully fund our law enforcement and  ensure they have the resources they need to keep themselves and our  communities safe.   I thank all of our police officers and law enforcement both in the  Central Valley and across the country for their selfless dedication to  service and for keeping our communities safe.                            ____________________
