 Mr. Speaker, I agree with Ranking Member Thornberry in  opposing this irresponsibly unbalanced amendment.   This text one-sidedly declares it to be the policy of the United  States to complete the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan by  April.   It directs what ``the President shall'' do, but makes no mention of  the Taliban's obligations that would render any withdrawal more  advisable or feasible.   By focusing only on U.S. withdrawal, it re-casts the conditions-based  U.S.-Taliban agreement as a retreat declaration, rather than a roadmap  toward peace.   The reality is that the President has been drawing down U.S. troops  in Afghanistan.   But contrary to the aim of this amendment, the President also has and  needs the authority to maintain a residual force to address potential  counterterrorism needs and the shifting situation on the ground.   More importantly, the Taliban must uphold their commitments--starting  the intra-Afghan dialogue, cutting ties with al Qaeda, securing a  permanent cease-fire, and preempting threats to U.S. security--or face  the consequences.   Those are the real steps needed for securing both a responsible U.S.  withdrawal and a lasting, inclusive peace for the people of  Afghanistan.   Instead of acknowledging that, this political amendment sends the  wrong message to the Taliban at the wrong time just to provide veto  bait against a bill critical for U.S. national security.   U.S. policy should be to urge the Taliban to uphold their  commitments, not to rashly abandon our Afghan partners to fend for  themselves against the Taliban and its deplorable record on human  rights.   The people of Afghanistan deserve better and as such, I urge a ``no''  vote.
