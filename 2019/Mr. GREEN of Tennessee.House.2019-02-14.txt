 Mr. Speaker, I ask one question today: What  happened to the Democrat party?   Democrats, up until just recently, were a lot closer to the middle.  Take John F. Kennedy, for example, who argued in favor of supply-side  economics and fought for tax cuts and personal responsibility.   Bill Clinton and Dianne Feinstein are recorded decrying rampant  illegal immigration. Bill Clinton described Democrat policies on  abortion as safe, legal, and rare. Even as recent as last decade,  Barack Obama attacked companies for hiring illegal aliens.   But something new is emerging from their ranks. Dangerous extremist  ideas are becoming the new normal on the left side of the aisle.   Let's begin with infanticide. Are Democrats truly accepting killing  babies outside the womb now?   A Democrat head of State, last month, casually defended it on a radio  station broadcasting in the Nation's Capital. He explained to listeners  that an infant already delivered would be kept comfortable while a  mother and a doctor discussed letting the child die.                                time  1045    When pressed for clarification, he explained that the scenario he  envisioned involved a baby with deformities. Assuming he meant  something like Down syndrome or something similar, this is an  outrageous claim. If you go and ask people with Down syndrome, they  think their life is worth living, and I couldn't agree more.   If all of that is not sitting well with you right now, well, we are  just getting started, or I should say, they are just getting started.   How about the newly unveiled Green New Deal? This massive overhaul of  the entire U.S. economy was reportedly drafted over a single weekend by  a bunch of staffers and environmental activists. The visionaries behind  this massive bill are hoping to eliminate air travel, gut and rebuild  every building in America, eliminate 99 percent of cars, eliminate  nuclear energy, and ban affordable energies like natural gas.   One of the authors of the Green New Deal laments that we aren't sure  we will be able to fully get rid of flatulating cows fast enough to get  down to zero carbon emissions. Of course, that has been pulled off  their website, following the appropriate national response.   But don't worry, the authors tell us, if passed into law, the  government will guarantee each and every one of us a high-paying job,  free education for life, a house, free money, and healthy food for all  Americans.   How about the various proposals to get free healthcare for everyone?  The most popular one of these, Medicare for All, was introduced by a  self-described socialist and has received enthusiastic endorsement of  2020 Democratic Presidential candidates. Cautious estimates of the cost  of Sanders' plan start at around $32.6 trillion over the next 10 years.   Even if we implement the most aggressive tax plan to seize and  redistribute wealth, the hard-earned work of some Americans, we only  raise $720 billion over 10 years, or 2 percent of what Medicare for All  will cost.   Keep in mind, our revenue for the entire United States over that same  period will only be approximately $40 trillion, unless, of course, this  bill passed and we tailspin toward a second Great Depression.   Democrats have abandoned all reason in the immigration debate as  well. We are witnessing Democrat officials offering homes, voting  rights, welfare, and taxpayer-funded education to anyone and everyone  who is able to sneak into the interior of the United States. It has  been estimated that each illegal border-crosser is a net fiscal burden  of $74,722 to the United States, and that is before all the goodies I  mentioned previously are added.   Moreover, we have one primary agency in charge of identifying and  apprehending illegal aliens who go on to commit other crimes,  Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Democratic officials are  demanding we eliminate them. Instead, they tell us to give everyone  amnesty, something estimated to cost taxpayers another $2 trillion.   With all the free programs available to illegal aliens in the United  States, it is no wonder they are flooding over the southern border.  According to the White House, 400,000 migrants were apprehended  attempting to illegally enter the United States in FY18 alone.   Along the way, reports from nonpartisan organizations state that one  in three women are sexually assaulted on the trip north. They also have  to pass through something called the route of death. Do we really want  to incentivize people to make this trek?  [[Page H2003]]    A wall and a crackdown on illegal immigration would surely  disincentivize migrants and save lives.                            ____________________
