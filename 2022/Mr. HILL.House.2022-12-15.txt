 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Koontz Electric  signing day for students committing to the Koontz Promise.   The Koontz Promise provides Arkansas River Valley High School  students with an immediate career following graduation from a Koontz- operated skilled trade program.   Trade programs available for students include construction  technology, industrial mechanics, maintenance technology, and welding.   The Koontz Electric Company of Morrilton, Arkansas, is a diversified  heavy industrial electrical contractor that has noticed a skills gap  between the generations. Immediately, they saw an opportunity to set up  and train the next generation of young leaders to lessen the skills gap  and highlight the opportunities of skilled trades immediately upon high  school graduation.   On top of guaranteeing prospective students a career, the Koontz  Promise also guarantees coverage of all expenses not covered by another  funding source.   To celebrate and welcome the students who committed to the Koontz  Promise, a signing day was held this past September.    I applaud Koontz Electric for their initiative in educating the next  generation of leaders in the skilled trades, and I look forward to  seeing these students achieve great careers in the future.                            ____________________
