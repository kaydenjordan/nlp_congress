 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Knob  Noster High School Lady Panthers track team on winning the 2018 Class 2  Missouri State Track Championship.   The Lady Panthers' win marks the first women's team State  championship in their school's history. The Lady Panthers took home the  title with 50 team points after rain delayed the final track events for  nearly 2 hours.   In addition to winning the State championship, the Lady Panthers'  Jessica Sader recorded the second furthest javelin throw in Missouri  history to claim the Class 2 title. Sader won her third straight title,  throwing 143 feet, breaking her own Class 2 State record of 134.6 feet.   The team's outstanding accomplishments mark a great milestone for the  girls track team and its coaches and creates a legacy that will be  cherished and heralded for years to come.   Mr. Speaker, please join me in congratulating the Knob Noster High  School Lady Panthers on this momentous achievement.                            ____________________
