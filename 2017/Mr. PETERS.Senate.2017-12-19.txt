 Mr. President, tonight the Senate will vote on a tax bill  that will provide large corporations and wealthy individuals with a  massive tax cut. The bill will result in well over $1 trillion in debt  that will be passed on to our children and our grandchildren.   The bill will result in dramatically lower taxes for people who earn  their living off of stocks and investments, for people who inherit  millions of dollars from their parents, and for the CEOs of  multinational companies. By the time the bill is fully implemented, it  will lead to higher taxes and higher healthcare costs for millions of  hard-working Americans who show up each and every day to do their job  and to earn a living.   This bill we are voting on today was written in secret in an entirely  partisan fashion, without input from nearly half of the Senate.   But it didn't have to be this way. If we wanted to give middle-class  families a real tax cut, we could have. Instead, we are voting on a  bill that has benefits for middle-class families that will expire just  to pay for permanent tax cuts given to multinational corporations.   If we wanted to reform the Tax Code, to take away loopholes for  offshoring our jobs, and to help create good-paying jobs here in the  United States, we could have. Instead, we are voting on a bill that  does nothing to target offshoring or job creation.   What will it do? Well, CEOs have told us directly that they are going  to buy back stock, which mostly benefits the wealthiest shareholders  and the CEOs with stock options.   When we know that over a third of the stocks that trade on the market  are held by foreign investors--foreign investors are holding half of  the value of the stock market--it is just impossible to argue that this  bill is focused on Michigan families.   If we wanted to make the Tax Code simpler for small businesses, we  could have. Instead, we are voting on a bill that includes some of the  most complicated provisions you could possibly imagine for a small  business owner.   If we really wanted to tackle our fiscal challenges in a responsible  way, we could have. Instead, we are voting on the most fiscally  irresponsible bill that I have ever voted on, adding $1.5 trillion to  the debt that our children and grandchildren will be responsible for,  all while doing next to nothing for middle-class families.   This is not the way we are supposed to make policy in this country.  The bill that is on the floor tonight is here without any hearings. We  didn't hear from a single expert on the specifics of the bill--not a  single economist, not a single small business owner, not a single  middle-class family. It is simply wrong.   I urge my colleagues to vote no and to defeat this bill.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.   Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. President, we need bipartisan tax reform. We  should simplify our Tax Code. It has been filled over many years with  all sorts of junk that was put there by high-powered lobbyists, rather  than because of the public interests.   Unfortunately, this bill has nothing to do with tax reform. In fact,  it is hard to believe you could take a tax code that is already stacked  in favor of the very wealthy and the very powerful and make it even  more favorable to the very wealthy and very powerful, but that is  exactly what this Republican tax plan does.   Exhibit A about how this has nothing to do with tax reform has to do  with the carried interest loophole. Many may recall that during the  last campaign, whenever Candidate Trump talked about the need to reform  the Tax Code, what was his No. 1 example? He said: We have to get rid  of the carried interest loophole for hedge fund managers. Go back and  run the tape. Every time somebody asked him what was broken about the  Tax Code, that is what he said. In fact, he said:         The hedge fund guys are getting away with murder. They're       making a tremendous amount of money. They have to pay taxes.    That was Candidate Donald Trump.   Well, here we are. Shortly, we are going to vote on the final  Republican tax plan. And guess what. In a tax plan that is over 500  pages, nowhere do they get rid of the carried interest loophole for  hedge fund managers. Hedge fund managers are still going to get a  better tax rate than the people who work for them--a better tax rate  than their secretaries and a better tax rate than their assistants. So  in Candidate Trump's words, in this tax bill, it looks like those hedge  fund managers are still ``getting away with murder.''   That is why it is a farce to call this tax reform. It is stacking the  Tax Code more in favor of the very wealthy and the very powerful. In  fact, if you are a millionaire in America, you are going to get an  average annual tax cut of $70,000. That is great if you are a  millionaire. At the same time, millions of middle-class taxpayers are  going to pay more.  [[Page S8138]]    The folks who get the biggest windfall are big corporations. Their  tax rate will go from 35 percent to 21 percent. Who are these folks?  Well, primarily, they are the folks who are already the wealthiest  people in this country, but I bet a lot of people will be surprised to  learn that 35 percent of the stockholders in those American  corporations are foreign stockholders. Thirty-five percent of the folks  who have stock in these companies are foreigners.   In the year 2019, foreign stockholders are going to get a $48 billion  windfall from that big corporate tax cut. In that same year, 11 million  Americans will pay more taxes. So money out of the pockets of middle- class American families will go into the bank accounts of foreign  stockholders. That doesn't sound like America first to me. It doesn't  sound like middle-class taxpayers first to me.    In fact, I want my colleagues to see just how skewed this tax bill  is. I mentioned that about 11 million Americans are going to see their  taxes go up right away, but if you take the tax cut for every working- class family in every State Donald Trump won in the last election and  you add up all of their tax cuts, it is still $5 billion less than what  foreign stockholders get in the year 2019.   Think about that. These are families who make about $100,000 or less.  If you take the tax cut that every family in every State that Donald  Trump won, and you add them all up, all those tax cuts, it still comes  out to less than foreign stockholders are going to get in the year  2019.   I will tell you, when the American public finds out what is in this  tax plan, they are going to get madder and madder. I heard Speaker Ryan  say: Well, people are going to see the result, and they are going to  like it. The more they see the results, the madder they are going to  get. Here is the thing, it gets worse with time. There are some things  that do well over time; this gets worse.   When this bill fully kicks in, the tax cuts for American families  expire. They are small, relatively, to start with, then they expire,  but the tax cuts for corporations, they are big and they are forever.  You know what that means. That means those foreign stockholders are  going to have their tax cuts go on forever.   In fact, when this fully kicks in 10 years from now, those foreign  stockholders are going to get a $23 billion windfall in that year, but  average American families making $75,000 or less--$75,000 or less--on  average, are going to see their taxes go up. They will see their taxes  go up when this fully kicks in to give that windfall to foreign  stockholders.   That is a bad deal for America. It is a bad deal for the middle  class. We should say no to this tax bill. We should start over and do  real tax reform that benefits middle-class families and those working  their way into the middle class.   This is not it. Let's start over. Let's vote this down.   I yield back the remainder of my time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.
