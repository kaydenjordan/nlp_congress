 Mr. President, on July 20, 2012, Colorado suffered a  horrific mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora. A gunman took 12  innocent lives from us, each of them full of aspirations for a future  that was tragically and senselessly cut short. They leave behind  family, friends, and a community in Aurora that still carries the pain  of their loss a decade later.   Colorado will never forget and forever honor the 12 victims of the  Aurora shooting. Today, I ask to read their names into the  Congressional Record.   Jonathan Blunk was 26 years old. He was a father of two who moved to  Colorado in 2009 after three tours in the Persian Gulf and North  Arabian Sea for the U.S. Navy. He was a certified firefighter and EMT.  Jon lost his life protecting his friend Jansen Young from the gunman's  line of fire. Jon shielded her from gunfire by pushing her to the  ground while shots were fired. He was supposed to fly that Saturday to  Nevada to see his wife Chantel Blunk and his 4-year-old daughter and 2- year-old son. Instead, his wife had to put up the dress her daughter  had picked out to wear to the airport. She told her daughter that they  would not see their dad anymore, but that he would still love them and  look over them.   Alexander Jonathan Boik was 18 years old. His friends and family  called him A.J. He had just graduated from Gateway High School. He  enjoyed baseball, music, and making pottery. A.J. was supposed to start  art classes at the Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design that fall.  He was described ``as being the life of the party,'' who could bring a  smile to anybody's face.'' He was a young man with a warm and loving  heart.   Jesse Childress was 29 years old. He was an Air Force cyber systems  operator based at Buckley Air Force Base. He loved to play flag  football, softball, and bowl. He was a devoted fan of the Denver  Broncos and held season tickets. His superior officer described him as  an invaluable part of the 310th family who touched everyone with whom  he worked.   Gordon Cowden was 51 years old. He was originally from Texas and  lived in Aurora with his family. He was ``a quick witted world traveler  with a keen sense of humor, he will be remembered for his devotion to  his children and for always trying to do the right thing, no matter the  obstacle.'' Gordon took his two teenage children to the theater the  night of the shooting. Both of them, thankfully, made it out unharmed.   Jessica Ghawi was 24 years old. She was an aspiring journalist, most  recently interning with Mile High Sports Radio in Denver, and went by  the nickname ``Redfield.''' She was hard-working, ambitious, and had a  generous spirit and kind heart. When several homes were destroyed by  Colorado wildfires, Jessica collected hockey equipment to donate to the  kids affected because she wanted to help. That was who she was.   John Thomas Larimer was 27 years old. He was a cryptologic technician  with the Navy based also at Buckley Air Force Base, a job that requires  ``exceptionally good character and skills.''' Originally from Chicago,  John was the youngest of five siblings and had joined the service just  over a year before the shooting. Like his father and grandfather, John  chose to serve in the U.S. Navy. John's superior officer called him  ``an outstanding shipmate, a valued member of the Navy and an extremely  dedicated sailor.'' Colleagues praised his calming demeanor and  exceptional work ethic.   Matthew McQuinn was 27 years old. Matt died while protecting his  girlfriend Samantha Yowler by jumping in front of her during the  shooting. Matt and Samantha moved to Colorado from Ohio last fall and  worked at Target. He and Samantha were in love and planning their  future life together. Matt's bravery saved Samantha's life.   Micayla ``Cayla'' Medek was 23 years old. Cayla was a graduate of  William C. Hinkley High School in Aurora and a resident of Westminster.  She worked at Subway and was a huge Green Bay Packers fan. Cayla would  plan weekend activities around watching the games with her brother and  father. She is remembered as a loving and gentle young woman.   Veronica Moser-Sullivan was 6 years old. She had just learned to swim  and attended Holly Ridge Elementary School in Denver. She was a good  student who loved to play dress-up and read.   Alex Sullivan was 27 years old. He was at the movie celebrating his  27th birthday and first wedding anniversary. He loved comic books, the  New York Mets, and movies. Alex was such a big movie fan that he took  jobs at theaters just to see the movies. Alex stood 6 feet, 4 inches,  and weighed about 280 pounds. He played football and wrestled before  graduating high school in 2003 and later went to culinary school. Alex  was known as a gentle giant and was loved by many.   Alexander C. Teves was 24 years old. Alex received an M.A. in  counseling psychology from the University of Denver and was planning on  becoming a psychiatrist. He also competed in the Tough Mudder, an  intense endurance challenge, and helped students with special needs.  Alex was at the theater on the night of the shooting with his  girlfriend Amanda Lindgren. When the gunman opened fire, Alex  immediately lunged to block Amanda from the gunfire, held her down, and  covered her head.   Rebecca Wingo was 32 years old. Originally from Texas, Rebecca joined  the Air Force after high school, where she became fluent in Mandarin  Chinese and served as a translator. She was a single mother of two  girls and worked as a customer relations representative  [[Page S3537]]  at a mobile medical imaging company. Rebecca was also enrolled at the  Community College of Aurora and had been working toward an associate of  arts degree. She was known to family and friends as a ``gentle, sweet,  beautiful soul.''   When I came to the floor a decade ago, I said that scripture tells us  ``not to be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.'' That is  what the people of Aurora have done for the past 10 years. Today, we  recommit to not remember July 20 for the evil act that day.   We choose to remember the beautiful lives lost and the loved ones  they left behind.   We choose to remember the 70 wounded survivors, whose resilience in  the years since is a testament to humanity's resolve.   We choose to remember the heroic acts of everyday citizens, our first  responders, and medical personnel who saved lives that otherwise surely  would have been lost.   And we choose to remember the profound generosity of the Coloradans  and Americans who donated blood in record numbers and raised funds to  support the survivors.   A decade later, Colorado and the country continue to draw strength  from the example set by the people of Aurora. And we recommit to ending  the American scourge of gun violence--unique among industrialized  nations--that has cut short too many innocent lives in our communities.                            ____________________
