 Madam President, I want to come to the floor to bring  up four subjects. The first one is 30 seconds.    Mr. President, on another subject, over the years, the  consolidation of the beef industry has threatened the livelihood of  Iowa farm families and rural communities where they reside, and it  isn't limited to just Iowa. This would be farmers all over the country.   I have been working since 2002 to increase the producers' leverage  against processors, improve market price discovery, and better situate  independent Iowa cattlemen in the fed cattle markets.   This past year, these issues became even more apparent and urgent  because of the COVID pandemic. While the cattle industry has internally  looked for ways to increase the amount of cash trade, it has not been  able to find a solution.   Unfortunately, this means that government intervention is needed as  it is past time for a solution. The government needs to step in to  guarantee that the free market treats cattlemen fairly.   From the 2012 USDA ``Agriculture Census'' to the 2017 ``Agriculture  Census,'' Iowa lost nearly 1,500 cattle producers. While we don't have  USDA statistics from the past 2 years, the release of the 2022 USDA  ``Agriculture Census'' will likely see an even more dramatic loss of  producers because of the pandemic. I know this because of my many  conversations I have with independent cattle producers from nearly  every county in Iowa.   During my meetings in all 99 Iowa counties, cattle market  transparency and my bill introduced last Congress with Senator Tester,  mandating 50 percent of negotiated cash trade in the cattle markets, is  one of the most mentioned topics at those county meetings. The aid that  Congress offered via the USDA Coronavirus Food Assistance Program  provided over $7 billion in assistance to cattle producers so far.   However, this assistance is merely a bandaid covering a gaping wound.  Congress must step up again and, instead of providing payments to  producers, make sure that producers have access to fair and transparent  markets. From the Holcomb, KS, fire at a Tyson's facility to the widely  reported closures of processing plants due to the coronavirus  outbreaks, we continue to see a wide disparity between the cash price  of fed cattle and the price of boxed beef, which, in turn, affects  consumer costs.   Normally, the packer spread between the price of live cattle and  boxed beef is about $21 per hundredweight, but USDA's report on the  coronavirus shutdowns showed that, last May, this spread was $279, as  opposed to that usual $21 per hundredweight, the highest since  reporting began 20 years ago.   It is just part of a pattern that has evolved during my time in the  Senate. That pattern is that farmers are getting a smaller amount of  the overall dollar for their food production.   I appreciate the leadership from Secretary Perdue in issuing their  USDA report last August. That report helps the cause for the Grassley- Tester legislation. Beyond just highlighting problems, Perdue also  offered recommendations, one of which was for Congress to consider a  mechanism to mandate a level of negotiated cash trade. This is not a  new issue in the beef industry. In fact, I first introduced a bill that  would mandate cash trade way back almost 20 years.   Today, on behalf of Iowa's independent cattle producers, I am proud  to reintroduce my bill with Senator Tester to mandate negotiated cash  trade at 50 percent. Without a mandated amount of cash trade, producers  continue to be residual suppliers and will lack leverage to fairly  negotiate with packing companies.   Earlier this month, Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska introduced the  Cattle Market Transparency Act of 2021. There are some excellent  provisions in Senator Fischer's bill, such as the creation of a  contract library, as well as new required reports on the number of  cattle scheduled for delivery. These provisions will add great  transparency and great price discovery. They are important to Iowans,  as they are to Nebraskans.   However, when it comes to a negotiated amount of cash trade, Senator  Fischer's bill only mandates a regional minimum. This means price  discovery would still be reliant upon cattle producers who already are  negotiating.   So what is price discovery?   Well, put simply, price discovery is where a buyer and a seller agree  on a price and a transaction occurs   Cattle producers of all sizes and in all regions recognize that price  discovery is a public good, a very good public good. These producers  also realize that the thinning of the cash market is a serious problem  for all market participants. Producers in the Midwest of the U.S.  reporting regions already provide ample price discovery by putting in  hard work and selling cattle using negotiated means at nearly 60  percent. They do this while producers who sell with formulas use these  prices in their contracts. That is why something must be done. Any  legislative solution should address the imbalance of the cash trade  across the entire beef belt.   My bill with Senator Tester would simply shift the burden of price  discovery from independent producers, like those in Iowa, and spread it  evenly among all cattle producers.   I am looking forward to working with Senator Fischer and the entire  Senate Agriculture Committee to  [[Page S1770]]  make permanent changes in mandatory price reporting, which needs to be  reauthorized by September 30 of this year.   Cattle producers are counting on us to make changes. We can no longer  take a wait-and-see approach. The beef industry employs hundreds of  thousands of hard-working men and women who work each day to help feed  our country and the world, but the USDA Agriculture Census shows we are  losing these producers.   I am asking my colleagues in the Senate to cosponsor my bill with  Senator Tester to ensure the strength of the beef supply chain and to  support our cattle producers                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Van Hollen, Mr. Brown, Mr.          Schatz, and Ms. Baldwin):   S. 961. A bill to prioritize funding for an expanded and sustained  national investment in basic science research; to the Committee on  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
