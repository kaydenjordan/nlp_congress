 Mr. Speaker, there are people whose empathy and compassion  glow like a beacon, and others whose shine like the sun.   That was Barbara Keller: A blazing star of kindness and an inspiring  local leader who lived to serve others, championed causes that uplifted  the sick, the poor, and fought for the rights of the LGBTQ community.   For 3 decades, Barbara called California's Coachella Valley home.  Barbara and her husband, Jerry, brought award-winning restaurants to  the Coachella Valley. But it was Barbara's generosity and commitment to  serving others that made her so remarkable.   Barbara was a champion for combating HIV/AIDS through her leadership  as the first female president of the Desert AIDS Project. Barbara was  moved by the deaths and suffering of many HIV-infected friends living  on the margins, facing injustice and discrimination in their struggle  to live. She brought hope and healthcare to so many individuals living  with, affected by, or at risk for HIV or AIDS.   As a doctor, I had the honor of working with Barbara on the Desert  AIDS Project in our shared advocacy for the health of local and  medically underserved communities.   Barbara's annual Steve Chase Awards fundraisers were a fixture of the  Coachella Valley, as was her incredible gala dress fashion, second only  to her beauty and class.   Barbara also lent her compassion to defending the health of patients  while working with the AIDS Assistance Project and the Loma Linda  Children's Hospital.   During her years of service to our communities, Barbara also helped  grow our desert's art scene through organizations like the Palm Springs  Art Museum and the McCallum Theatre.   Barbara's generosity in her public life was complemented by her  extraordinary kindness in her private life.   My wife, Monica, and I knew Barbara as a dear, dear, friend and a  wonderful role model to our daughters, Sky and Sage. I was constantly  personally touched by her loving nature, her unwavering support and  encouragement, and her dedication to her higher purpose.   Barbara most treasured her family, and her greatest pleasure was  being a loving wife, a mother, a daughter, and grandmother.   Barbara devotedly cared for her aging father, Marvin Cohn, until he  passed away in March at 106 years old, never once telling him she was  undergoing intense chemotherapy for breast cancer. Barbara's death soon  followed the following month on April 15, 2019.   Barbara and her husband Jerry's marriage was a love story few can  claim and a touching example of the power of true love.   Barbara leaves behind her devoted husband, Jerry, her son, Brad, her  daughters, Lindsay, Lisa, and Kelly, and her seven grandchildren,  Taylor, Rebekah, Graham, Ridley, Greta, Eva, and Levon, and her sister,  Carole.   While Barbara's passing deeply saddens me, her memory will live on in  my heart and in the hearts of the countless individuals whose lives she  touched.   In an era of ``me first,'' ego-driven, selfish ambition, Barbara  reminds us that love, kindness, and genuine service to others is  possible. She is the embodiment of good, humility, strength, and outer  and inner beauty. Her legacy lives on in the countless lives she  improved and inspired. And she was a giant, a social architect,  designing a healthier, kinder, more just community.   Knowing Barbara, and calling her my friend, was an incredible,  unique, and beautiful blessing in my life. And her story must be told  and recorded in our national records, so that generations to come can  learn the vast potential of our national spirit.   She will be missed.                            ____________________
