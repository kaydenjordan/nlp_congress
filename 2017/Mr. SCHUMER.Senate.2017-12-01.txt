 Madam President, before I address the issue of taxes,  let me address the matter of the government funding bill.   We are now only a week away from a government shutdown, which, to  remind my colleagues, could cost our economy thousands of jobs and  billions of dollars, as it did in 2013. I think a government shutdown  is something we all desperately want to avoid, Democrats and  Republicans--I talked to some of my colleagues this morning--with the  exception, it seems, of the President.   This morning's Washington Post reports that President Trump has told  his confidantes that a government shutdown could be good for him  politically and that he has asked friends about how a shutdown would  affect him politically. It is disappointing but maybe not surprising  that President Trump appears to be putting politics before the well- being of the American people. As President, the welfare of the American  people should always come first--always.   We have a lot of things to accomplish by the end of the year, and a  government spending deal is particularly important for our men and  women in uniform, as well as a host of programs that create jobs and  boost the economy.   The President talks about defending the troops and then threatens a  shutdown. It is a contradiction--a contradiction--and I am sure our  generals would tell him that even playing around with the possibility  of sequester and shutting down the government is no good for our armed  services, as well as for the rest of the country.   We should all be focused on avoiding a government shutdown. Certainly  Democrats will be working with our Republican colleagues in Congress to  that end. I think our Republican colleagues agree. I hope they won't  succumb to President Trump's whim based on a political decision and not  on what is good for America. President Trump must change his tune--and  soon--if he wants to be a constructive partner in those discussions  rather than the focal point of blame.   Madam President, on taxes, my Republican friends have stretched into  day 2 of their debate on the bill, which still lacks resolution on some  critical issues.   After promising over the past few months that their tax bill would  pay for itself through economic growth, the Joint Committee on Taxation  came out with a report yesterday that showed that these promises were  unfounded, way off the mark. Even considering economic growth, the  Republican tax bill will add roughly $1 trillion to the deficit. And  many economists have said  [[Page S7654]]  that this dynamic scoring doesn't work at all. Here, the JCT gave  credence to the theory of dynamic scoring but then came out with a  number that was not the kind of wild exaggerations we are hearing from  the Secretary of the Treasury, from the President, and from some of our  Republican colleagues, particularly those of the Club for Growth bent.   Earlier in this debate, Republicans claimed that this would be a tax  cut for everybody and that nobody in the middle class is going to get a  tax increase. Independent analyses show that these claims were not  valid, and to their credit, some Republicans corrected the record.   Now Republicans have gotten the ``dynamic scoring'' they have  demanded for years. They are in charge. They put dynamic scoring in  place. It is still not good enough. As recently as this week, the  Republican leader and others claimed that this bill would not add to  the deficit. We know now that even under the dynamic scoring method the  Republican Party asked for and received, this bill would add $1  trillion to the deficit. All of the claims that tax cuts for the  wealthy and corporations will pay for themselves were not correct. It  is time for my Republican friends to admit the error and come clean  with the American people.   The fact that we received the dynamic score only a day before a final  vote on the bill shows just how foolhardy it is to rush a bill like  this through.   From press reports, we know that the Republicans are making the  passthrough provisions more generous, widening what was already a  gargantuan tax loophole for wealthy business owners. Why should wealthy  business owners pay a significantly lower rate on their personal  income, because they are paying no corporate tax if they use the  passthrough, than the average American? That is what this bill does.  Hedge funds, big fancy law firms, and lobbyist firms would all get a  lower rate than the average American because of the passthrough. The  average American who makes $100,000, $200,000 is already paying in the  30-percent range.   From press reports--you would think that maybe Republicans would be  concerned by the many reports that their bill increases taxes on 60  percent of middle-class families by the end of the day. No. Instead,  the holdout Republicans are concerned that this bill isn't generous  enough to corporations and wealthy business owners. So now the  Republican leadership is working to fix that. In the waning hours, this  bill is tilting even further toward business, even further away from  families. Every time the choice is between big corporations and  families, the Republicans choose the big corporations.   And still no one knows what the final bill will look like. Why on  Earth wouldn't you want to spend more than a few hours looking at a  bill of this magnitude? What might have been snuck in? What might have  been changed by mistake--an innocent mistake? There are so many reasons  to not rush this bill through, but we know why it is being done. We  know why Republican Members will only have a few hours at most to read  the draft legislation before voting on it.   Notching a political win, I would say to my colleagues, isn't a good  enough reason to throw common sense and legislative responsibility out  the window. Notching a political win isn't a good enough reason to  raise taxes and premiums on millions of middle-classes families when  there is a much better bill to be had by working in a bipartisan way,  Democrats and Republicans, across the aisle, together. My Republican  friends must know that ``we needed to notch a political win'' isn't a  good enough excuse for a constituent who asks why you voted to raise  their taxes but slash them for big corporations.   Today may be the first day of the new Republican Party--one that  raises taxes on the middle class. The one thing Republicans always  promised the middle class is, we are not going to raise your taxes. A  good number of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle--the  junior Senator from Texas--I heard him talk about it--said he doesn't  want to raise taxes on any middle-class person, but this bill does it.   The Republican Party is abandoning its long-held principles to please  its political pay masters. It is a bad move for the Republicans, as  well as a bad move for America.   Again, ``we needed to notch a political win'' is going to be no  excuse when your constituents complain that they are getting the short  end of the stick in this tax bill and wealthy corporations, the richest  people, are not.   Democrats remain united against any middle-class tax increase, and we  will fight to reverse that. The stakes are too high. Our economy is  already stacked against working men and women. Corporate profits and  stocks have reached alltime highs. The top 1 percent capture 20 percent  of the national income--higher than at any time in our history since  the roaring twenties.   Meanwhile, for too many Americans, the American dream is slipping  away. Hard-working Americans who get up every morning worried about  paying the bills, making the mortgage payment, the tuition payment, the  healthcare bill, are not getting the help they need in this bill.  Instead, it is going to the wealthiest, biggest corporations on a  theory of trickle-down, which almost everyone accepts and rightwing  economists agree has never made sense.   Any moral tax bill would focus on giving a leg up to middle-class  Americans, to working class Americans. Instead, this bill directs the  lion's share of its benefits to those at the very top--the already  wealthy, the already powerful. It makes healthcare less affordable and  less accessible. It will deprive the government of the resources needed  to support the military, scientific research, education, and  infrastructure.   The hole it blows in the deficit will--make no mistake--endanger  Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. Republicans, including  President Trump, have openly admitted that they will seek changes in  this program after the tax bill. Senator Sanders has outlined  eloquently how dangerous this bill is to the future of Social Security  and Medicare. I know our Republican colleagues who came down to argue  against him were all on the defensive.   All the things our President and Republicans say they wanted to do  are not happening. And this bill moves in the opposite direction--not  only on helping the wealthy and not helping the middle class in the way  it needs to but also in endangering Social Security and Medicare. Most  insidious of all, the bill hides a ticking time bomb of middle-class  tax hikes at the center of our Tax Code. Who would want to vote for  that?   Many of my Republican friends feel that the hard right--big, wealthy  corporate interests--will put these ads on TV saying that this bill  helps the middle class. It is not going to work. When the middle class  gets a tax increase, they are going to know why, and they are going to  know whom to blame, and these ads will have faded into the air.   Today, my Republican friends can choose to cement their party as the  party that raises taxes on the middle class. It will be a dramatic  turning point in a downward spiral for the Republicans and something  they have never believed in before. But Republicans have an  alternative. They can step back from the brink and work with Democrats  on a bipartisan tax reform bill to deliver across-the-board tax relief  to the middle class, a bill that makes our businesses more competitive  while closing egregious corporate loopholes and that grows our economy  without adding a penny to the deficit.   Bipartisan tax reform--not this cynical bill, not this partisan  exercise, not this bill that seems to please the 1 percent but not the  rest of America--is possible but only if my friends and colleagues will  abandon this bill and reach out for a better kind of politics.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, in just a short time, we will proceed to  a final vote on the Republican tax bill. We understand they have the  votes to pass their bill, despite a process and a product that no one  can be proud of, and everyone should be ashamed of. Historians will  mark today as one of the darkest black-letter days in the long history  of this Senate.   Once hailed as the greatest deliberative body, as a beacon of  American democracy, and the envy of representative governments around  the world, the Senate seems to have abandoned those qualities in a rush  to pass a bill that no one is proud of. Substantively, the Republicans  have managed to take a bad bill and make it worse. It was chockful of  special interest giveaways before tonight, but now, under the cover of  darkness and with the aid of haste, a flurry of last-minute changes  will stuff even more money into the pockets of the wealthy and the  biggest corporations while raising taxes on millions in the middle  class.   One provision may be a metaphor for the whole bill. One college,  Hillsdale College, has been exempted from taxes on colleges with large  endowments. Hillsdale College is supported by the DeVos family, one of  the largest contributors to the Republican Party. A specific provision,  just like an earmark, was slipped into the bill, added by a Senator who  fought to remove earmarks from Congress several years ago. A single  wealthy college--the pet project of a billionaire campaign contributor  to the Republican Party--was exempted from a tax by a Senator who  fought to get rid of earmarks. This, unfortunately, is the metaphor for  this bill and how high the stench is rising in this Chamber as we  debate the bill tonight.    In my long career in politics, I have not seen a more regressive  piece of legislation so devoid of rationale, so ill-suited for the  conditions of the country, so removed from the reality of what the  American people need. Working people in this country are struggling.  Corporations and the very wealthy are doing great.   There is no reason for rushing through a tax break for millionaires  and billionaires, paid for by pilfering the pockets and the healthcare  of middle-class Americans. Millions of middle-class families will get a  tax hike next year and millions more thereafter because of this bill.  That is why this bill is such a monstrosity, such a danger to the  country, and the American people know it. That is why they oppose the  bill in large majorities.   My Republican friends will ultimately pay consequences for this bill  in 2018 and beyond. The Republican Party will never again be the party  of tax cuts for middle-class people. With the passage of this tax bill  today, it will be the first day of the new Republican Party--one that  raises taxes on the middle class, abandoning its principles for its  political paymasters.   With respect to the process, the bill my Republican friends hope to  pass so soon was received by Members of this body only a few hours ago.  Not a single Member of this Chamber has read the bill. It would be  impossible. Some of the pages were completely crossed off, and text had  been replaced by handwritten notes. When we got the bill, this is what  it looked like. This is what it looked like.   When asked before by Senator Durbin, the Senate clerk said she  couldn't even read it, and this section is one of the most complicated  sections of the bill, dealing with passthroughs. Lawyers are paid  thousands of dollars an hour to find ways for their wealthy patrons to  avoid sections just like this, and my Republican friends don't have the  decency, the honor to let us debate it.   Senator McCaskill was the first to discover that a list of proposed  amendments was circulating among lobbyists. My Republican friends  allowed lobbyists to see amendments, and likely the text of this bill,  before their fellow U.S. Senators.   There is no score of this bill by the Joint Committee on Taxation.  There will be no analysis of how American businesses and taxpayers fare  under this bill, how high taxes go up or go down, whether the economy  grows or shrinks, whether it creates jobs or loses them. Who knows?  Certainly no one here. No one could know because it hasn't even been  read, let alone thoughtfully considered.   I remember a few years back when my Republican colleagues gleefully  scolded us to ``read the bill'' because the Affordable Care Act was a  lengthy piece of legislation, and that bill was available for days  before anyone had to vote on it. With this stunning deception, with  this reckless ramrodding of a bill, Republicans are reaching heretofore  unreached heights of hypocrisy,  [[Page S7700]]  and the Senate is descending to a new low of chicanery.   Read the bill? They are still writing it by hand, mere hours before  voting on it. Is this really how Republicans are going to rewrite the  Tax Code, scrawled like something on the back of a napkin behind closed  doors with the help of K Street lobbyists? If that is not a recipe for  swindling the middle class and loosening loopholes for the wealthy, I  don't know what is. I don't know if it is possible for a Senate  majority leader to depart further from responsible legislating than the  process we witnessed with this tax bill.   Tonight, Mr. President, I feel mostly regret at what could have been.  What a grave shame it is that we weren't able to work together on this  bill. Tax reform is an issue that is ripe for bipartisan compromise.  Democrats have spent many long hours with our Republican colleagues  talking about our tax reform ideas. There is a sincere desire on this  side of the aisle to work with our colleagues, particularly on tax  reform, but we have been rebuffed time and time again. Even under these  difficult circumstances, Senators Coons, Warner, Bennet, Manchin,  Heitkamp, Donnelly, and McCaskill have tried in good faith to convince  our Republican colleagues to sit down and talk to us. We have tried to  convince you all that we want to join you in tax reform, to have a real  debate befitting this august body.   It is an expression of the brokenness of our politics that the  influence of moneyed interests and the political right was so great  that it overcame even the best of intentions of my Republican  colleagues, so many of whom I admire, so many of whom I know, because  they have said it to me, lament the steady erosion of bipartisanship in  the one institution in our government designed by nature to foster it.   I salute my friend the Senator from Tennessee for standing fast by  his principles and having the courage of his convictions. I only regret  that there were not more who followed his admirable example.   After a divisive and draining battle over the future of healthcare,  we could have moved the Senate back toward sanity, bipartisanship,  compromise. We could have accomplished something great for the country  and for this body at the same time.   Although time is running short, there is still time, and I will make  one final plea. Because this bill is so slanted toward the wealthy and  powerful and rains tax increases upon millions of middle-class  citizens; because the bill is laden with special interest provisions,  some recently found and many not yet seen; because the bill was given  to lobbyists to read and change before Senators saw it; and because the  bill was given to us on few hours' notice and has not been read fully  or considered fully by a single Senator, I move that we adjourn until  Monday so we can first read and then clean up this awful piece of  legislation.                              Motion to Adjourn    Mr. President, I move that the Senate adjourn until Monday, December  4, 2017, at 12 noon, and I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that he be given  a minute.    Mr. President, I yield back.
