 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Rule  governing debate of H.R. 3697, the ``Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal  Act of 2017'', and the underlying bill.   I oppose this unwise and irresponsible legislation because regular  order was not observed in bringing this bill to the floor, the bill  contains several constitutional and procedural defects, and is an  unnecessary diversion and distraction from the real issues facing the  American people.   As Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Crime Subcommittee, I am  highly disappointed that this bill was rushed to the floor without any  thorough and thoughtful consideration by the Judiciary Committee.   In particular, there was no markup or hearing on this legislation  that has such wide ranging and profound effect on a mass scale.   This bill extends the definition of ``criminal gangs'' as defined  under 18 USC section 521, and amends the INA to now include a  definition for criminal gangs as:   An ongoing group, club, organization, or association of 5 or more  persons that has as one of its primary purposes the commission of  certain listed offenses, including:   --a felony drug offense, including felony simple possession of  marijuana (this would impact high school kids who may gather to smoke  marijuana);   --bringing in and harboring certain aliens (this would cover  sanctuary sites like churches that aid undocumented immigrants);   --identity fraud offenses (including knowingly possessing a false  identity document);   --crimes involving obstruction of justice; and burglary.   A bill of this nature where the consequences are so severe to many  innocent parties, including a 13 or 14 year old juvenile, demands a  more robust dialogue with a prudent and judicious approach.   As legislators on the Judiciary Committee, we argue vigorously on  behalf of the American people, as is the case in any other Committee;  and in doing so, we will sometimes disagree.   So to suggest that we would not have been able to debate the merits  of this bill, so instead bypass the regular process is disheartening.   Are we passionate about the issues that impact our legislative  process, governance, and the American people? Yes we are! And we will  continue to probe vigorously, as a legislative body having  jurisdiction, notwithstanding the subject matter.   We will not stay quiet as to not offend a few when so many issues  with catastrophic consequences may result if we don't speak up.   So Mr. Speaker I make no apologies for doing my job and questioning  where necessary on behalf of the American people.   We should be having vigorous debate on matters such as jobs, schools,  health care, victims of Charlottesville, victims of climate change,  building bridges, healing broken communities, and bringing this country  together for `all' the American people, we are instead debating a  damaged bill in order to advance the President's campaign promise on  mass deportation, thus, distracting us from the people's business. We  are also uniting in protecting the American people against violent  crime.   I care deeply about crime as Ranking Member of the Judiciary Crime  Subcommittee, thus, if we want to have that debate here on the floor,  let's have a wholesome conversation.   The FBI reports some 33,000 violent street gangs, motorcycle gangs,  and prison gangs with about 1.4 million members that are criminally  active in the U.S. and Puerto Rico today.   Many are sophisticated and well organized; all use violence to  control neighborhoods and boost their illegal money-making activities,  which include robbery, drug and gun trafficking, prostitution and human  trafficking, and fraud.   Striking, for this conversation, in these 33,000 street gangs, a  significantly larger percentage were non illegal immigrants, as this  bill's objective purports.   Some of those street gangs include: 211 Crew, American Front, Aryan  Brotherhood of Texas, Aryan Circle, Aryan Nation, Aryan Republican  Army, Born to Kill, Dead Man Incorporated, European Kindred, just to  name a few here that are mainly white supremacist  [[Page H7332]]  gang groups. We could go on, as gangs are found everywhere, in almost  every ethnic group.   As a result, I oppose this Rule and the underlying bill for several  reasons; first, it has a discriminatory effect in targeting the  immigrant community by criminalizing immigration, and thereby, raises  due process and racial profiling concerns.   I offered an amendment which would have cured this defect by  requiring a uniform legal standard in the Secretary of Homeland  Security's designation of `criminal street gang' for purposes of ICE  enforcement.   Based on the government's own data via the FBI, it is clear that  criminal street gangs are not exclusively limited to the immigrant  community.   Second, I oppose this Rule because the bill has a sweeping effect  that will criminalize and/or deport anyone remotely connected to a  supposed gang member, even where there is no conviction and alarmingly,  no arrest.   My second amendment would raise the standard of proof from a mere  belief that someone is associated with a criminal street gang, to clear  and convincing evidence.   This bill lacks a constitutional construct for how Homeland Security  is to determine its designation of a `criminal street gang'.   That is why I offered my third amendment, which would have required a  uniform legal standard which will govern the identification of Criminal  Street gang members for purposes of ICE enforcement.   According to this bill, `any' immigrant, including minors, such as a  13 or 14 year old juvenile, would be subject to the harsh penalties of  detention and deportation.   If we begin to criminalize people merely for their associations, then  we are heading down a terribly dark road. Statistics show that the  brain does not fully develop until the age of 25, and thus to punish  juveniles for the mere associations they may have, is a bad idea and  bad legislation.   According to the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency  Prevention recent report, nationally, 48,043 juvenile offenders were  held in residential placement facilities as of October 28, 2015.   Due to this bill's vague nature, it would add to that alarming  number, and further complicate mass incarceration.    This bill would capture individuals, even those with permanent  residence status, so long as the government believes the individual is  associated with a criminal street gang.   My amendments attempted to fix some of the glaring defects in this  bill. In its current form, the bill is bad for our country and does not  keep our communities safe, but instead does the opposite.   For all the reasons stated above, I oppose this Rule and the  underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 513 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment is a very simple  proposition of adding $500,000 to the Community Development Financial  Institutions Fund, which supports locally based community organizations  working to expand economic development, affordable housing, community  banking, and financial services. The underpinning of this amendment is  to enhance financial literacy, as seen by many of us in our district,  as a very important component.   Let me thank the chairman and ranking member for bringing this  underlying bill to the floor, and let me indicate that this is a small  measure, working with all of the agencies, to ensure that the many  elements of financial documents or financial opportunities that low- income communities have, they will be informed and literate about how  much to borrow and, as well, what opportunities they can take advantage  of.   Certainly, it will be impactful for those of us in areas where we  have experienced the severe hurricanes and natural disasters that will  be impacting our community for a long time.   The CDFI provides for economic development, job creation, business  development, and commercial real estate development, affordable  housing, housing development, home ownership, community development,  financial services, basic banking services to underserved communities,  and financial literacy training.   It also helps Native Americans through providing for financial  assistance, technical assistance, and training to Native Americans  CDFIs and other Native American entities proposing to become or create  CDFIs.   Through these programs, direct investment is provided, supporting and  training financial institutions that provide loans, investment  financial services, and technical assistance to underserved  populations.   And I can assure you that the inequities in banking in low-income  communities, the access to banking clearly suggests that more work  needs to be done by the CDFI.   Finally, I would make the point that our overall community  experienced a major loss of wealth in the last 15 years, starting with  the 2007-2008 mortgage debacle, which caused a lot of low-income people  to lose wealth. The importance of helping them with financial literacy,  I believe, is an important element.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee  amendment.   Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to speak in support of the  Jackson Lee amendment to Division F of H.R. 3354, the ``Interior and  Environment Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2018.''   I wish to commend Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Quigley for  their work in shepherding this legislation to the floor.   Mr. Chair, the Jackson Lee amendment improves the bill by increasing  funding by  [[Page H7353]]  $500,000 to the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund  program for people receiving financial assistance and for the  responsibilities that this very important subagency has.   Treasury's Community Development Financial Institutions Fund program  administers the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, the  CDFI.   Through its various programs, the CDFI Fund enables locally-based  organizations to further goals such as:   1. economic development;   2. job creation, business development,   3. and commercial real estate development;   4. affordable housing;   5. housing development and homeownership;   6. community development financial services;   7. basic banking services to underserved communities; and   8. financial literacy training.   The good news is that this spreads across the Nation, regardless of  whether you live in an urban center or the rural countryside.   Through these programs, direct investment is provided supporting and  training financial institutions that provide loans, investment  financial services, and technical assistance to underserved populations  and communities.   From the perspective of Texas, this is a good thing because it  emphasizes overall investment and development.   CDFI also serves Native Americans through by providing financial  assistance, technical assistance, and training to Native American CDFIs  and other Native American entities proposing to become or create CDFIs.   I appreciate very much the support this Committee has been given to  CDFI and believe that the modest increase in funding provided by the  Jackson Lee amendment will it enable it expand economic opportunity for  more communities.   Finally, let us remember that the loss of wealth in rural communities  is creating hardships because, like urban dwellers, a substantial  portion of their wealth, like, was tied to the value of their homes.   The Jackson Lee amendment is intended to help restore and increase  financial health among our individual families and communities.   I urge all Members to support the Jackson Lee amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    While, I am clearly disappointed in the response, I  am glad that I offered this amendment. I think the position is wrong as  it relates to the needs to help individuals who have already suffered  an enormous blow.   In particular, financial literacy is an aspect that is certainly  needed in low-income communities, and we can see the impact of not  having the understanding of various financial opportunities. And the  CDFI has done that, and particularly supporting Native Americans among  many others.   So I would ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment  because it is not a lot and it would add to this aspect of financial  literacy, which we need.   There are a lot of products that are out there, and I guess I might  say that, as much as we have tried, with the Community Reinvestment  Act, to assist or to encourage or to push our financial institutions to  lend to our many diverse groups, low-income groups and minority  populations, it is still a problem in getting access to funds by low- income communities.   So the CDFI and the focused addition that I would add would, in fact,  make a major difference, and I would ask my colleagues to support the  amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the managers of this  legislation.   Mr. Chairman, any Member of Congress or any elected official has had  the sad duty of going to a child's funeral. Most of us in the Christian  faith have heard maybe the same words said often in the place of  worship and in the funeral service, no matter who it is, and that is  that a child should not go before their parents. We have seen the  brokenness and, of course, the absolute despair of that family that has  lost a child.   Unfortunately, as we have found in Hurricane Harvey, when people have  looted victims of the hurricane, it is unfortunate that bad things can  happen to good people.   So the families of deceased children are victimized. They are  saddened by the loss of their child, whether it is an accident that is  tragic or a sickness; and then, because those names are printed and  become public, they are victimized again.   Alexis Agin was 4 years old when she died last year from a brain  tumor. As her parents grieved from their daughter's loss, someone else  paid attention to the details of her death, too. An identity thief was  easily able to get Alexis' personal information after she died. Her  parents had no inkling until they went to file their taxes, then to  their astonishment and despair, they learned that someone else had  already filed a tax return using Alexis' Social Security number and  claiming her as a dependent.   The Agins soon learned they were one of many. They said: ``Within an  hour of learning that my daughter's Social Security number had been  compromised and stolen, no fewer than 14 other parents whose children  passed away due to cancer contacted us and advised us that their  children's Social Security numbers, likewise, had been stolen.''   Americans are told to jealously guard their Social Security numbers,  but after one dies, the government goes public with that coveted  information. It is included on the Death Master List.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record an article from ABC News  entitled ``When Loved Ones Die, Their Identity is There for the  Taking.''                        [From ABC News, May 8, 2012]        When Loved Ones Die, Their Identity Is There for the Taking                              (By Lisa Stark)         Alexis Agin was 4 years old when she died last year from a       brain tumor. As her parents grieved their daughter's loss,       someone else paid attention to the details of her death too.        An identity thief was easily able to get Alexis' personal       information after she died. Her parents had no inkling until       they went to file their taxes. Then, to their astonishment,       they learned that someone else had already filed a tax       return, using Alexis' Social Security number and claiming her       as a dependent.        The Agins soon learned they were one of many. ``Within an       hour of learning that my daughter's Social Security number       had been compromised and stolen,'' said Jonathan Agin, ``no       fewer than 14 other parents whose children passed away due to       cancer contacted us and advised us that their children's       Social Security numbers likewise had been stolen.''        Americans are told to jealously guard their Social Security       numbers, but after one dies, the government goes public with       that coveted information. It is all included on a Master       Death List.        ``This is a database of more than 8o million records that       the Social Security Administration maintains of all the       deaths in the country. And that information is actually       publicly available,'' said John Breyault at the National       Consumers League. ``Consumers can go online, on any number of       sites, and get full name, date of birth and full Social       Security number, which we call the holy trinity of personally       identifiable information.''        The list is used by banks, credit agencies and others to       try to prevent identity theft after someone dies. However, a       court case in the 197os forced the Social Security       Administration to make the list public, under Freedom of       Information Act laws. ``Unfortunately, dead people don't have       any privacy rights,'' said Breyault, ``That information, once       you're dead, is publicly available information.''        ``Within 3o seconds of learning that my daughter's Social       Security number had been stolen, I went online and found her       Social Security number,'' Agin told ABC News. ``All the       information is there.''        Breyault of the National Consumer League showed ABC News       just how easy it was. He sat down with me at a computer and       pulled up a wealth of information on my husband, who died of       cancer last year. My tax refund for this year has now been       held up because someone else filed a return, apparently using       my husband's Social Security number The Internal Revenue       Service said it might be a simple mistake by the other       taxpayer, not a case of identity fraud. The agency, however,       can't yet tell me for sure as it works to unravel the       situation.        Today on Capitol Hill, the House Ways and Means'       Subcommittees on Social Security and Identity Theft held a       hearing on this growing problem.        In his testimony, Russell George, the Treasury inspector       general for tax administration, told lawmakers that while       processing tax returns in 2011, the IRS managed to flag and       stop 940,000 returns that appeared to involve identity theft.       The refunds requested on those returns totaled $6.5 billion.        George told lawmakers, ``There is much more fraud that it       [the IRS] does not detect.'' The inspector general       ``identified approximately 1.5 million additional undetected       tax returns with potentially fraudulent tax refunds totaling       in excess of $5.2 billion,'' said George. Those refunds were       paid out. ``If not addressed, we estimate the IRS could issue       approximately $26 billion in fraudulent tax refunds resulting       from identity theft over the next five years,'' he testified.        The IRS told ABC News that it believes that five-year       estimate is ``far too high. The estimate was based on figures       from 2010, before the IRS instituted major changes in the way       it handles identity theft cases,'' the agency said. ``Our       increased compliance and prevention efforts mean we are       stopping more refund fraud than ever before.''        The Social Security Administration had recently taken steps       to cut back on the Master Death List information it releases       publicly, leaving off the decedent's state and ZIP code. And       the IRS said it has installed identity theft screening       filters on its computer systems to flag suspicious returns.       ``Fighting identity theft will be an ongoing battle for the       IRS and one we cannot afford to let up on,'' said Steven       Miller, an IRS deputy commissioner, in written testimony.        Late last year, the IRS established a special taxpayer       protection unit to help handle identity theft cases. But       George testified that those trying to file their 2011 taxes       found it difficult to get through to the unit. ``The unit       received more than 86,000 calls during the 2012 filing       season, but has only been able to answer about 21,000,'' said       George. And according to his testimony, the average phone       wait time for taxpayers was almost one hour.        Taxpayers caught in this mess are forced to prove their       loved one's identity to the  [[Page H7361]]       IRS. Agin said he had to provide evidence to show the IRS       that his late daughter was his child. Some cases have taken       up to a year to resolve.        Congress is considering a number of bills that would limit       access to the Master Death List For Agin and the hundreds of       thousands of other taxpayers who have been victims of this       fraud, it can't come soon enough. ``It's bad enough losing       your child to any type of disease, cancer in any manner,''       said Agin, ``but then have somebody steal their identify, the       last remaining vestige of your child, it's horrible.''     Mr. Chairman, there is no dedicated person in the  IRS to deal with these broken and grieving families, so they simply  become victims. By the time they find out, someone has bought a house,  someone has taken their luxury vacation, got many credit cards, and  used this dead child to abuse this family again.   The Jackson Lee amendment is simple. What it does is it provides a  dedicated person, funding to the IRS Taxpayer Advocate Service for the  purpose of assisting the parents of a deceased child where that child's  identifying information has been stolen and fraudulently used on a  personal income tax return filed with the IRS.   It is a simple request, Mr. Chairman. If the Taxpayer Advocate  Service office is what it is, and if anyone has tried to use it,  including Members of Congress, we know there needs to be a dedicated  person just to answer the phone of the grieving parent who finds out  through IRS filing that they are being abused again and their beautiful  angel is being used for other and evil works of someone who would use  that deceased child to their advantage.   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time   Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to speak in support of the  Jackson Lee Amendment to Division D of the Rules Committee Print 115- 31, which makes appropriations for Fiscal Year 2018, ``H.R. 3354, the  ``Interior and Environment Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2018.''   I wish to commend Chairman Graves and Ranking Member Quigley for  their work in shepherding this legislation to the floor.   Mr. Chair, the Jackson Lee Amendment is simple but provides an  important and necessary protection for grieving parents.   The Jackson Lee Amendment is intended to ensure that the IRS Tax  Advocate Service has adequate resources to assist parents of a deceased  child whose Social Security Number was stolen by tax cheats and used on  a federal tax return to receive an Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC).   The Jackson Lee Amendment is intended to be a compassionate use of  IRS funds to help grieving parents navigate the process of reclaiming  their child's identity from tax cheats.   This amendment is necessary when we consider the story of little  Alexis Agin who was just 4 years old when she died of a brain tumor in  2011.   As her parents grieved, someone stole Alexis' identity to commit tax  fraud.   Alexis' parents did not discover the crime until they filed their  taxes.   The sad fact is Alexis' parents are not alone--they were one of at  least 14 other parents whose children died of cancer and learned that  their child's Social Security number had been stolen by tax thieves.   Nearly all of us understand the importance of safeguarding our Social  Security numbers, but after someone dies Social Security numbers are  published on a national online registry called the Master Death List.   The Master Death List registry exists to alert businesses and  financial institutions to not renew credit cards or create new credit  in a deceased person's name.   But it also alerts thieves of opportunities to steal identities and  commit tax fraud.   As reported by the San Francisco Chronicle identity thieves have  stolen the tax refunds of more than 490,000 dead persons since 2008.   The thieves typically claim that a dead person is their dependent  when they file tax returns.   In Fiscal Year 2012, the IRS initiated approximately 900 identity  theft related criminal investigations, triple the number of  investigations initiated in FY 2011.   Direct investigative time applied to identity theft related  investigations increased by 129 percent over that same period.   On July 30, 2013, in St. Louis, Missouri, Tania Henderson was  convicted of theft of government funds and aggravated identity theft  and sentenced to 144 months in prison and ordered to pay $835,883 in  restitution to the U.S. Treasury.   According to her plea agreement and other court documents, Henderson  stole the identities of more than 400 individuals, many of whom were  deceased, and filed fraudulent tax returns using their names and Social  Security account numbers.   The theft of identities of deceased children for the purpose of  committing tax fraud is a sad fact that too many parents have to face  while they are attempting to cope with the tragedy of losing their  child.   The Jackson Lee Amendment will help ensure that the IRS Tax Advocate  Service has the resources needed to assist these grieving parents with  filing the last tax return where their child's name will be listed as  being a member of their household.   I urge all Members to support the Jackson Lee Amendment, which would  be a compassionate use of IRS funds.    How much time is remaining, Mr. Chairman.    Mr. Chairman, last time I was on the floor, I  mentioned that I was disappointed, and my friend on the other side made  a remark that we all come here disappointed. I am saddened by the  comment that he made earlier, and I am saddened by his response now  because this is simply asking for a dedicated person, the offset is the  operations account. It doesn't matter what conversations and what we  have done. It is a simple direct response to the pain of people.   This is a mountain if it happens to you. It is not whether we are  coming down or we have had conversations; it is a mountain.   So I would simply say, according to the San Francisco Chronicle,  identity thieves have stolen tax refunds of more than 490,000 dead  persons. This Death Master List continues. The IRS initiated  approximately 900 identity theft-related criminal investigations out of  490,000.  [[Page H7362]]    So what if you are this parent of a dead child?   I just would have a person dedicated to taking your calls. That is  all I am asking in this amendment with a slight offset.   It doesn't make any sense. Alexis' parents did not discover the crime  until they filed their taxes.   How many others have not?   So I ask my colleagues, out of the goodness of their heart--this is  the last amendment, and I don't think any manner of conversation about  what I did yesterday and what I did last year is going to be helpful.  Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment  to help the parents of deceased children.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, today I rise to mourn Sergeant Steve  Perez of the Houston Police Department who died on August 29, 2017, in  the midst of Hurricane Harvey as he was in the line of duty.   He served in the United States Army, and he joined the Houston Police  Department in 1982. He leaves behind his precious and beloved wife,  Lupe Cheryl Perez, and a host of police officers and law enforcement  across the Nation.   He became a sergeant in 1992. He worked in emergency ops and special  ops and juvenile. He worked across the county. When he died, he was  coming to work in the midst of the storm, because as the words were  said often by his colleagues and heard from his family members, he had  work to do.   Today in Houston, he was funeralized. My deepest sympathy is to his  family and how dismayed I was not to be able to be present with them,  but I want them to understand that we were there in spirit and that we  love the first responders who put the people of Harris County and the  people of Texas before anyone else. That is what Sergeant Steve Perez  did.   Today we say to him farewell and thank him for his good and faithful  service. He will never be forgotten for his kindness and service to his  community. My prayers are with the family, and I ask now for a moment  of silence.                            ____________________
