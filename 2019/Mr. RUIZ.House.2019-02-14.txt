 Mr. Speaker, two names have been lost in months of  government shutdowns and threats of national emergencies: Jakelin Caal  Maquin and Felipe Gomez Alonzo. Those were the children who died in  December while in the custody of our Federal Government.   Let me tell you a bit about Jakelin's story and how, in the next 48  hours, we will take a historic first step to forever change how our  Nation treats children fleeing violence.   Jakelin Caal Maquin was 7 years old. She joined her father in fleeing  the extreme danger and poverty of her village, San Antonio Secortez in  Guatemala. Together, they dreamed of new opportunities, of new safety,  of a home free from violence and discrimination where they could build  a life and support their loved ones at home.   Jakelin and her father chose the same destination that asylum  seekers, immigrants, and refugees have sought for centuries: the United  States of America.   But the conditions I saw at the Border Patrol facilities where  Jakelin and her father were held were not worthy of our American  ideals. The conditions did not demonstrate respect for the human  dignity of the individuals in our Federal Government's care.   Look, I am a doctor. I know what a functioning emergency medical  response protocol looks like and how it should operate, and this was  not it.   I saw women, infants, toddlers, and the elderly packed and even piled  on top of each other, open toilets in crowded cells without any  privacy, visibly sick people, children coughing on one another, and I  immediately saw that the Border Patrol agents did not have the  resources to respond to a life-threatening medical emergency.   Mr. Speaker, let me put this into perspective. I traveled to Haiti  days after the devastating 2010 earthquake, where I served as the  medical director of the country's largest camp of internally displaced  people. The conditions I saw at the New Mexico Border Patrol facilities  were worse than those I saw in Haiti, the most impoverished country in  the Western Hemisphere, after their most challenging and devastating  disaster.   Here we are, the greatest nation on our planet, and we are putting  children in cages and denying them free access to food, water, and a  private toilet.   Then and there, I committed myself to creating humanitarian standards  that are worthy of human dignity: real solutions, not empty promises,  that will save the lives of children at the border.   I introduced legislation that makes it clear Congress expects CBP to  implement three crucial reforms as soon as possible:   First, provide meaningful medical examinations of individuals  entering our borders. A basic physical exam would have shown warning  signs of Jakelin's septic shock and most probably saved her life. A  child who dies from septic shock does not look normal 8 hours  beforehand.   Second, invest in essential medical equipment and trained medical  personnel available to respond to life-threatening emergencies. When  medical care is far away, agents need the resources, equipment, and  knowledge to care for each other and the individuals in their custody.   Third, provide basic humane living conditions that are safe and  hygienic, where individuals can access adequate food, water, and  showers.   These are straightforward reforms. They move us closer to a system  that is safe, humane, and aligns with our fundamental ideals as  Americans.   Our work is not done, but we have reached an important milestone. We  are beginning to address the humanitarian crisis at our border, not  with rhetoric and political showboating or grandstanding, but with  real, life-saving solutions.   This week, we will not just pass a bill that averts a government  shutdown; we will pass a bill that provides funding for, and holds CBP  accountable to, implementing the humanitarian standards included in my  legislation, H. Con. Res. 17. These reforms will save lives and help  restore our legacy as a nation that recognizes the dignity and  fundamental rights of every human being.  [[Page H1998]]    So, Mr. Speaker, I will speak the names of those two children again:  Felipe Gomez Alonzo and Jakelin Caal Maquin. We must have the courage  to recognize their humanity.                            ____________________
