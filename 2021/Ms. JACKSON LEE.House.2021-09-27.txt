 Mr. Speaker, this is not about hijacking America. It  is about rewarding America. I stand here with one bill, the INVEST  bipartisan infrastructure bill, and, yes, the Build Back America--one  bill.   Let me share with you the reasons why. This bill on the floor right  now, the agreement will create good-paying union jobs. It will deliver  high-speed internet to every American, eliminating lead pipes, and  providing clean drinking water. Something in my district that is long  overdue. Public transit.   But most importantly, it will reconnect communities. As we try to  overcome this massive I-45 north in Texas where we need the input of  the government, Federal Government, to make a balance between highways  and Black communities and communities of color that are traditionally  divided by highways. This bill will do so. And it will remedy  brownfields and other sites.   At the same time, we have the recognition that we deal with people.  And what does that mean? That is that we will have pre-K in our Build  Back America. We will have expanded Medicaid in Build Back America. We  will have child care for the individuals, women in particular, that  need to go to work. We will have a care economy. We will have  affordable housing that invests so that people will have safe housing.   This will provide a wholeness. This is not a hijacking. It is  actually a reward that we put two outstanding directions of the  President's agenda, President Biden's absolutely progressive, moving  agenda for all of America.   We don't look at America and divide her in corners of conservatism  and progressive or right and left. We look at her and the needs of her  people. I am here today to say that I stand with America. I stand with  working families. I stand with women. We must move these bills, the  INVEST Act, creating union jobs, turning the corner on all the  necessities of infrastructure and, yes, bringing people into the light  once and for all. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.    Madam Speaker, George Washington fought for the  Nation. Abraham Lincoln tried to unify it.   I am absolutely stunned that the United States Senate would not  uphold its responsibility to pay America's bills--the bills that we  have paid over and over again--by refusing to raise the debt ceiling  for some foolish tomfoolery of politics. What is our Nation up to? What  are the Republicans up to?   But I do want to say as well that I look forward to the budget  reconciliation or the Build Back America and the INVEST Act traveling  the same pathway because my district needs the extra $20 million that  we had established here in the House to be able to help the corridor  along Scott Street where Texas Southern University is and the  University of Houston, a majority university and a historically Black  university.   We have to get to work. We have to realize that the importance of  connecting neighborhoods that lost the connectiveness because of major  highways is crucial-- like I45 North that divided the community; like  288, that is already there, that has divided communities of color.    Let's do the right thing and stand for the American people. Politics  has no place for deciding whether people have clean water, whether  people have roads that work and mobility, and, of course, broadband.   Madam Speaker, let's stand with the American people.                            ____________________
