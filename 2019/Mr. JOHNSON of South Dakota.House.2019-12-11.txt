 Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Americans want lower drug prices. I want lower drug prices. My  colleagues want lower drug prices.   We have been told tonight that H.R. 3 is the proper vehicle to  accomplish that goal. I regret to inform the body that it is not. H.R.  3 is not a bipartisan attempt to find common ground. Make no mistake  about it, it will not become the law of the land.   But for those of us who came to Congress to solve problems, there is  some good news. There is a better way.   H.R. 19, which was introduced by 111 of my colleagues and me this  week, is markedly better than H.R. 3, and it can become law. I want to  highlight four components of H.R. 19.   First, it would end abuse of the patent system, and it would end the  pay-for-delay agreements that allow generic manufacturers to actually  be paid by their competitors to keep drugs off the market.   Secondly, it would, for the first time ever, place a cap on seniors'  out-of-pocket drug costs. That is supported by 75 percent of Americans.  [[Page H10114]]    Third, it would establish a new negotiator within the Office of the  United States Trade Representative, allowing us to push back against  countries that expect that the U.S. should subsidize their drug costs.   Finally, it would increase transparency in the doctor's office and at  the pharmacy. That will be welcome news for the 90 percent of Americans  who want to see more transparency in the drug pricing system.   Madam Chair, with agreements this week on the U.S.-Mexico-Canada  Agreement and the National Defense Authorization Act, we have some  bipartisan momentum building in this town. Oh, my, perhaps it is a  Christmas miracle.   With that in mind, we should set aside the partisan H.R. 3 and  instead apply that reemerging bipartisan spirit to lowering drug  prices.
