 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of ending the  disenfranchisement of over 700,000 people, including most of the staff  that works for us every single day.   Our Nation is the only democratic country in the world that denies  full democratic rights to the citizens living in its Nation's Capital.  That is more than 700,000 American citizens who pay Federal taxes, who  fight and die in wars, who serve on our juries, and yet have no vote in  the Senate or the House of Representatives. That is the definition of  taxation without representation.   It is 219 years overdue for the citizens of the District of Columbia  to have their right to vote.   Let me thank and commend my colleague, Eleanor Holmes Norton, for all  of her decades of work. It is time to vote ``yes'' on statehood for the  District of Columbia.
