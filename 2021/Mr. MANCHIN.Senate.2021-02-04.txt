 Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 775 and ask that  it be reported by number.   I also ask for unanimous consent that the time be split between  myself and the Senator from Maine.    Mr. President, American families in every corner of our  country are struggling right now, and I don't think a single person on  this floor would disagree that the decent, compassionate thing is for  us to target relief to our neighbors struggling every day to get by, to  the families who are struggling to pay rent and put food on the table.  This $1,400 will make a significant impact on their ability to get by.  These families need our support right now.   Still, there are other families who have not missed a single paycheck  as a result of this pandemic. It does not make sense to send a check to  those individuals who are still working, earning a decent living over  the wages that we talked about.   My bipartisan amendment would simply ensure those Americans who are  truly struggling through no fault of their own--    Are given the support they need during this difficult  time.    I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds.    Mr. President, 18 rural hospitals across America closed  last year--three in my own State. Do any of you have any sympathy for  people who live in rural America?   Twenty percent of the population in America is rural. We only got 6  percent of the money that was associated that we sent out in the last  CARES package, and that is 6 percent to rural hospitals.   We need to treat them fair. That is all we are asking for. A 20- percent set-aside is fair. Thank you, and I would appreciate your  support.    Mr. President, I also support this and, I think,  basically, that transparency is something we all want, and that is all  we have asked for--to see the numbers and work from there in an honest  fashion.   I support it.
