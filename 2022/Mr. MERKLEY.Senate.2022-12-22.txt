 Mr. President, I am pleased that we are having this  amendment before us. It broadens the scope of the bill that we passed  12 years ago to enable nursing mothers to be able to return to work and  breast-pump milk for the benefit of their children.   For 12 years, it has worked so well for better health for the babies  and better health for the mothers, and it turned out to be a big win  for businesses because they found that workers returned to work and  were much happier doing so.   The chamber has sent out a letter endorsing it. They note that it  protects small businesses, providing a hardship exemption opportunity  for those with less than 50 and that they have accommodated the  concerns of the airline and railroad industries.  [[Page S10073]]    It is a win-win for babies, for mothers, and for business.   I hand this over to my colleague, and thank you so much, Senator  Murkowski, for championing this effort.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.
