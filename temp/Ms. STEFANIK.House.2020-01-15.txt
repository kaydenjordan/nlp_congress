 Mr. Chair, in my district, older Americans are staying  in the workforce longer than previous generations, making significant  contributions to our growing economy; yet these later years of a  worker's career are becoming increasingly unstable.   Over half of the workers over the age of 50 are pushed out of  longtime jobs before they are ready to retire.   The consequences of age discrimination are particularly harmful  because, once older workers are removed from the workforce, they are  more likely to remain unemployed. The economic strain that this can  cause for them and their families is significant.   But losing a career is bigger than just financial security.  Separating adults from the dignity of work has a broader impact on the  well-being of communities like my district, where I serve one of the  largest constituencies of older Americans in the entire country.   This bill strengthens the ADEA by reaffirming the pre-2009 standard,  simply, that age discrimination cannot be a motivating factor in  employment decisions.   I am proud to support H.R. 1230 on behalf of the many constituents of  the 21st District who have advocated for this bill for over a decade.
