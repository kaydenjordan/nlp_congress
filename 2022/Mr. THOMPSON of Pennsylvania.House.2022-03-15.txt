 Madam Speaker, over the weekend, we  celebrated National K9 Veterans Day. This day is set to honor the  service and sacrifice of American military and working dogs throughout  history.   Military working dogs are vital to our military missions. Dogs can  help sense incoming artillery, locate wounded soldiers, deliver  messages between troops, and provide a much-needed morale boost on the  front line.   The original war dog is Sergeant Stubby, the most decorated war dog  of World War I. He saw four offensives and 17 battles. Despite numerous  injuries, he always returned to his regiment.   Stubby's ability to warn of poison gas attacks, locate wounded  soldiers, and alert his unit to incoming artillery shells ultimately  earned him the rank of sergeant.   Madam Speaker, we recognize our military working dogs on March 13  because on that day in 1942, the U.S. K9 Corps was officially created.   Today, there are more than 3,000 military working dogs deployed  around the globe. They are trained to perform a wide variety of  critical and often dangerous tasks.   Their work to support our servicemembers and service to our country  should not go unrecognized.                            ____________________
