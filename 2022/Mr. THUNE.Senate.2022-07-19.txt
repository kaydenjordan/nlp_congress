 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, June inflation numbers came out last  Wednesday, and, as is typical for the Biden Presidency, they weren't  good. In fact, they were spectacularly bad. Inflation hit 9.1 percent  in June, the worst inflation since November of 1981. The last time  inflation was this bad, America was still a year and a half away from  finding out whether Han Solo would survive his time in carbonite.   Mr. President, we all know how we got here. In large part, it was via  a Democratic spending spree. When Democrats took office in January  2021, Congress had just passed a fifth bipartisan COVID relief bill  that met essentially all current pressing COVID needs. But now that  they were in charge, Democrats were eager to get spending. So they  passed a massive $1.9 trillion piece of legislation under the guise of  COVID relief that flooded the economy with unnecessary government  money, and, as expected, the economy overheated as a result.   Even worse, despite steadily climbing inflation in the wake of their  bill, Democrats seemed incapable of learning from their mistake. In  fact, they spent last fall attempting to double down on the strategy  that helped get us into this mess in the first place. Fortunately,  their plans for a second spending spree failed last December.   But it has become clear that they are not giving up. In fact, right  now, they are trying to pass a new version. In the latest iteration of  their tax-and-spending spree, Democrats notably plan to hike taxes on  small businesses. Yeah, that is right, on small businesses.   Our country is struggling with soaring inflation, the economy is  teetering on the brink of a recession, and the Democrats want to raise  taxes on small businesses--and particularly on small, individually, and  family-owned businesses or what are often called passthrough  businesses, which make up more than 90 percent of the businesses in  this country.   Mr. President, I guess it shouldn't be a surprise. After all, ``tax  and spend'' is the unofficial Democrat motto. The Democrats have made  their hostility to tax relief very plain. President Biden ran for  President on repealing tax cuts from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the tax  relief legislation Republicans passed in 2017 that helped increase  wages and incomes, boost economic growth, and drive the poverty rate to  a record low.   In addition to the natural economic recovery coming out of the  pandemic, much of the residual strength in the economy that President  Biden likes to tout is a result of the tax relief passed  [[Page S3346]]  in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, but that hasn't stopped President Biden  from claiming that the bill just benefited high-income earners and  corporations.   The only problem with his narrative, of course, is that lower- and  middle-income Americans are actually the ones who saw some of the  biggest benefits from Republicans' tax relief legislation. Wage growth  in the wake of Republicans' legislation was strongest for those in  lower income brackets. From 2017 through the end of 2019, real wealth  for the bottom 50 percent increased by an astounding 28.4 percent,  compared to 8.9 percent for the top 1 percent. Meanwhile, government  revenue, which Democrats claimed would be hit hard by the Republican  tax cuts, last year posted its largest increase in 44 years.   Mr. President, before the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,  Democrats charged that reducing the U.S. corporate tax rate--from the  highest rate, I would add, in the developed world, 35 percent, to a  more globally competitive rate of 21 percent--would strip the  government of corporate tax receipts. That has hardly been the case.  Not only did Federal corporate tax revenues come in at a record high in  fiscal year 2021; corporate tax revenue, as a share of the economy,  rose to its highest level since 2015.   Total tax receipts are set to increase this year by 19.5 percent or  $800 billion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office,  after rising last year by 18 percent. Tax revenues year over year: 18  percent last year; 19.5-percent increase in tax revenues this year,  which begs the question: Why do Democrats want to raise taxes when you  have got record revenue coming into the Federal Government?   The effects of tax reform on business investment, wages, and tax  revenue have been a boon to the American people and our economy. It is  fascinating how Democrats claim to want one thing yet push for policies  that will secure the exact opposite.   The President claims he ran for office because he was tired of the  trickle-down economy and that he wanted to build an economy that works  for working families.   The ironic thing is that the pre-COVID economy President Biden  complains about was working for working families, thanks in large part  to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and other Republican economic policies.   The Biden economy, in contrast, is the very opposite of an economy  that works for working families. Working families in the Biden economy  are suffering. Food prices have risen astronomically, and gas prices  are nearly twice as high as they were when President Biden took office.  Real average hourly earnings are currently declining at the fastest  pace in 40 years, and Americans continue to see a de facto pay cut  under President Biden. Currently, a growing number of Americans are  digging into their savings--when they have them, that is--to make ends  meet. Others are relying on things like credit cards or visits to food  banks, where demand has soared.   Now Democrats want to make things worse by raising taxes on small  businesses and other Americans. That is likely to lead to a combination  of lower wages for workers, lower returns for business owners, and  higher prices for goods and services. When you combine that with  soaring inflation and more unnecessary government spending, you have a  recipe for continued economic misery for American families.   If Democrats really wanted to help American families, they would be  focused on making all of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act tax cuts permanent.  Instead, they are pursuing tax-and-spending policies that will make the  economic havoc they created even worse.   Let's hope that the newest iteration of their Build Back Better tax- and-spending spree will fail before American families have to suffer  any more consequences.   I yield the floor.
