 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to  this bill.   This great Chamber has passed four bills, four bipartisan, bicameral  bills that the House, the Senate, Republicans, Democrats, and the White  House could agree on. This bill is not that. It is 3 trillion more  dollars of unrestrained spending.   When given the opportunity, the people's House does need to speak up  and does need to lead, but we need to lead on economic common ground,  not on partisan grounds that will never pass outside of this Chamber.   I spoke with a young man yesterday who showed me a picture of his 6- year-old daughter. I spoke with a friend yesterday at Saint Mary's  school in Oak Ridge, where they are having a graduation.   This is not a giving; it is a taking. We are burdening the American  people with over $30 trillion worth of national debt.   Mr. Speaker, where does our debt go? It goes on the backs of future  generations.   And worse, who buys our debt? China, other countries.   We are heading in the wrong direction. I plead with the majority to  change this bill; come together, as we have done in the past.   I urge a ``no'' vote on this. I urge us to stand up and do the work  for the hardworking Americans who are justly scared, justly concerned.  We owe that to them. We represent them, and that is our job, and that  is our calling.
