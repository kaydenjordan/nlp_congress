 Mr. President, yesterday evening, Iran launched more than  a dozen ballistic missiles against military bases in Iraq, which house  U.S. troops.   After General Qasem Soleimani was killed in a targeted drone strike  late last week in an act of self-defense and to deter further  aggression against America and our allies, our forces were on high  alert for an Iranian attack. President Trump and our military leaders  emphasized that we would be prepared for whatever response Iran chose  to deliver, and by all accounts we were.   If the present circumstances hold, it appears that no U.S.  servicemembers were harmed during this attack last night by Iran, which  is the best outcome we could have hoped for. In addition, I am glad no  Iraqi troops appear to have been injured or killed in this strike as  well.   While the result of this provocation by Iran could have been a lot  worse, it does not diminish the fact that the world's leading state  sponsor of terrorism has a sophisticated and capable ballistic program.  We know that those capabilities only accelerated under the Joint  Comprehensive Plan of Action--the so-called nuclear deal during the  previous administration--as has the regime's pursuit of their nuclear  aspirations.   I am confident that this administration's maximum-pressure campaign,  combined with our unparalleled military capabilities, as well as the  President's decisive actions that have culminated in the airstrike last  week, have prevented a much worse outcome from this attack by Iran.   Last week, I had the opportunity to visit Strategic Command,  STRATCOM, in Omaha, NE, where their motto is ``strategic deterrence.''  I think that is an important goal to keep in mind; that is, having the  means and capabilities not only of hitting back but a message of  deterrence to our adversaries to dissuade them from initiating  hostilities in the first place.   President Ronald Reagan had his own notion of strategic deterrence.  He called it ``peace through strength.'' I believe that is something  the President's actions last week have begun to restore, no less a  luminary than former GEN David Petraeus, who said, after the Soleimani  attack, that perhaps--just perhaps--this would reestablish deterrence.  Indeed, based on the response by the Iranian regime last night, where  they obviously targeted uninhabited areas, and they wanted to save face  by showing that they were doing something to retaliate but not wanting  to escalate, I think General Petraeus is right on. What has happened,  to this point, is reestablishing some level of deterrence.   I applaud the President for speaking to the American people this  morning and making it clear that, under his watch, Iran will never ever  have a nuclear weapon. In my view, this is the single most important  policy objective for the United States and our allies in the Middle  East.   Deterrence through strength, combined with additional economic  sanctions, are designed to encourage and persuade the Iranian regime to  rejoin the community of nations, which will help pave the way for a  better way of life for the Iranian people and to give up these tools of  terror which have characterized the Iranian regime since 1979, since  the revolution--exporting that terror to other countries. There was no  one more responsible for doing that than General Soleimani, who was  taken out in an airstrike last week.   As we move forward, the United States and our allies can't turn back.  We can't relieve this maximum-pressure campaign, and we also must  remain cognizant of the dangers of creating power vacuums in the Middle  East.   I also hope our allies in Germany, France, and the United Kingdom  will work with us to persuade the U.N. to invoke the snapback  provisions under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action to restore  international sanctions and restrictions on the Iranian regime to  further persuade them to join us in negotiations, which will lead to a  better outcome for all. It will be helpful if our friends and allies in  the UK, France, and Germany will join us in that effort.   While the United States has not purposely sought out further conflict  that could lead to an unnecessary loss of life, we need to defend--we  must always defend American personnel and our interests in the Middle  East.   As the President has pointed out this morning, one of the things  that, historically, has given Presidents like Jimmy Carter the  determination to declare the blocking of the Strait of Hormuz as an act  of war during his administration was our overdependence on energy from  the Middle East. As the President pointed out this morning, thanks to  the creativity and innovation in places like Oklahoma, Texas, North  Dakota, and elsewhere, we are now largely energy independent and self- sufficient. We can now use this as a tool to engage other countries  that are completely dependent on countries like Russia, Iran, and  others in the Middle East for their energy needs. So this is changing  the geopolitics of the world. This is not just the President taking a  divisive action against the leading master of terrorism in the Middle  East; the geopolitics of the world have shifted, and I hope we will all  work together to take advantage of that.   As I said, I appreciate the President's courage and leadership. This  must have been no easy decision, to be sure. I continue to be proud of  our military leadership and the rank-and-file servicemembers who have  worked so hard to protect the United States and our national interests  in the Middle East and around the world.
