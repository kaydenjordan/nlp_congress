 Madam President, last week Senate Republicans did  introduce a new coronavirus relief bill called the Health, Economic  Assistance, Liability Protection, and Schools Act. This bill is a $1  trillion piece of legislation focused on getting Americans back to  work, getting kids and college students back to school, and providing  healthcare resources to help defeat the virus. As the title says--the  Health, Economic Assistance, Liability Protection, and Schools Act--it  does have liability protections in there.   I just listened to the Senator from Illinois attack the idea of  including those types of protections in the legislation, but I think it  is really important to point out that those type of protections are  critical if we are going to get the economy reopened again.   Businesses that are doing all the right things--following the CDC  guidelines, adhering to all the laws, all the guidelines and  restrictions that are out there--shouldn't have to worry about  lawyering up and spending thousands and, in some cases, millions of  dollars to try and defend themselves against frivolous lawsuits, which  are being filed as we speak by the thousands.   The implication given by the Senator from Illinois that somehow this  is all about big corporations or big businesses is just not consistent  with the facts on the ground. In fact, I had a conversation 2 days ago  with the school administrators in my State of South Dakota, all of whom  are very interested in getting their schools opened up and getting kids  back in school, which, again, is one of the priorities of our  legislation and should be, I think, one of the priorities of the  country as we head into the fall.   One of their big issues was ensuring that they had protections  against liability--a liability shield, if you will, not against gross  negligence, not against intentional misconduct--those types of things  would not be covered--but protections if, in fact, they are doing all  the right things, consistent with the guidelines, following the rules  that have been put in place, that they should have at least some  protections.   That is going to be true not just of schools and small businesses,  but it is also going to be true of healthcare providers. We have people  on the frontlines who are sacrificing every day to try and get people  better, to heal those who have contracted the virus, and also protect  those who are on the frontlines from getting it. They, too, are going  to need those very types of protections that are called for in our  legislation.   So this is not something that was put in there on a whim just because  we knew that the Democrats wouldn't like it. It was put in there  because of feedback we received from States, local governments, school  districts, healthcare providers, hospitals, nursing homes, and, yes,  some small businesses, all of whom are going to be essential if we are  going to get the economy up and going again and get people back to  work, kids back to school, and Americans back on their feet.   So it is an essential part of the legislation, one which, so far, the  Democrats have demonstrated no interest in including and, frankly, no  interest in even having a conversation about, which is unfortunate  because it is a critical element, feature, of any bill that we should  be working on right now to provide coronavirus relief.   When we introduced this bill, we knew this version wouldn't be the  final draft. I think everybody conceded that. We knew we would need to  negotiate with our Democratic colleagues just like we did with the  CARES Act, which was our largest coronavirus relief bill, back in  March.   Back in March, the model that was used was having committee chairmen  and ranking members get together in compromise and work out differences  and end up with a strong, bipartisan bill. Was it a perfect bill? Well,  no, of course not. No bill is. Did everyone get everything that he or  she wanted? No, but it was a strong, bipartisan bill that was praised  by Democrats and Republicans alike--in fact, reflected by the unanimous  vote.   I would like to say that we are engaging in those same types of  negotiations right now, but unfortunately I can't say that. I can't  say, in fact, what is happening right now is even negotiations.  Negotiations involve both sides being willing to give something up to  compromise and to try and move toward a solution. While Republicans are  willing to make compromises to ensure that we can deliver another  coronavirus relief bill to the American people, Democrats apparently  aren't willing to make any.   Back in May, House Democrats proposed and passed a massive $3.4  trillion piece of legislation that they called a coronavirus relief  bill. Subsequently, it has been endorsed by Senate Democrats who have  gone so far as to offer up unanimous consent requests here on the  Senate floor to adopt the House-passed bill. In reality, that House- passed bill, $3.4 trillion bill, was a lengthy liberal wish list which  even Members of the Democrats' own party dismissed as dead on arrival.  In fact, Democrats had some work to do to persuade Members of their own  caucus in the House to vote for the bill.   As POLITICO put it at the time: ``As of late Thursday evening, the  House Democratic leadership was engaged in what a few senior aides and  lawmakers described as the most difficult arm-twisting of the entire  Congress: convincing their rank and file to vote for a $3 trillion  stimulus bill that will never become law.''   That is from POLITICO. The House bill includes various ``coronavirus  priorities'' like funding for diversity and inclusion studies in the  marijuana industry, tax cuts for blue-State millionaires, federalizing  elections. Those are just a few of the items that were included in the  House-passed bill that it is very hard to argue have anything to do  with defeating the coronavirus. In fact, the House bill mentions the  word ``cannabis'' more often than it mentions the word ``job,'' which  tells you all you need to know about the seriousness of that proposal.    Despite all that, Democratic leaders have taken the House bill as  their starting and, yes, their ending point for negotiations. They are  insisting that Republicans sign off on pretty much everything in their  bill, from the tax cuts for wealthy Americans to major changes in  election law. And  [[Page S4889]]  they are not budging on the pricetag either.   As I said, Republicans have proposed a $1 trillion piece of  legislation, and I can tell you--from being a Member of the Republican  conference and the discussions that we have--what a stretch it is for a  lot of Republicans, who already have voted for multiple coronavirus  relief bills to the pricetag of about $3 trillion so far, to do another  trillion dollars, knowing that every one of those dollars is a borrowed  dollar, every one of those dollars is going on a Federal debt which is  already upward of $25 billion and will ultimately have to be paid back  by our children and grandchildren.   Well, that said, the trillion-dollar legislation that was put forward  by Republicans is nowhere close to the pricetag for the Democrats'  bill, which is $3.4 trillion, as I said. Now, I think even an  elementary school student would realize that compromise lies somewhere  between those two numbers, more than, perhaps, the Republicans' bill  and less than the Democrats' bill, but apparently that is not something  Democrats are willing to entertain.   A senior correspondent for CNN talked to Speaker Pelosi yesterday,  who claimed she wanted to reach agreement on a bill this week. The  correspondent asked the Speaker what pricetag she was willing to agree  to. Her answer: $3.4 trillion. In other words, after more than a week  of negotiations, the Speaker of the House hasn't budged from her  original position. She hasn't budged, nor have the Senate Democrats,  who every time something has come up on our side to try and address  this crisis have answered with: Well, let's just pass the Heroes Act of  the House, the $3.4 trillion boondoggle.   Well, that is not a compromise. That is not a negotiation. And if we  emerge from this process without a coronavirus relief bill, the  responsibility rests squarely on the shoulders of the Democratic  leadership.   Let's suppose, for a moment, that Republican negotiators agreed to  every single thing that Democrats are insisting on: tax cuts for  millionaires, diversity studies for the marijuana industry, a trillion- dollar pot of money for States, which, I might add, haven't even come  close to spending the coronavirus money the government has already  given them. Let's suppose Republican negotiators agreed to everything.  What would happen then?   Well, the bill would never pass the Senate. In the Senate, you need  60 votes to pass a bill, and there simply aren't 60 votes in the Senate  for the Democrats' liberal fantasies. In fact, it would be lovely if,  as Democrats seem to think, the government drew its funding from a  magical pot of gold that never runs out, but it doesn't. Every dollar  of the coronavirus relief that we already provided has been borrowed  money, which continues to drive up our national debt. Now, arguably, it  was money that needed to be borrowed, but there has to be a limit.   The higher we drive our national debt, the greater the danger to the  health of our economy. Democrats may be fine with jeopardizing our  economic health to pay for diversity studies in the marijuana industry,  but I can tell you the Republicans are not. Republicans know we are  going to have to borrow some additional money to meet the demands of  the coronavirus crisis--and we have offered legislation to do just  that--but we are not going to further endanger our already battered  economy by signing off on every unnecessary spending item on the  Democrats' liberal fantasy list.   Now, are Republicans going to have to agree to some of the things  that we are not crazy about? Of course we are. But Democrats are going  to have to accept that they can't dictate every word of the bill.   The bill which passed the House, I might add, was 1,800 pages long.  The bill that we have proposed in the Senate is 165 pages. The ball is  in the Democrats' court. Republicans want to pass a coronavirus relief  bill, and we are ready to negotiate. The Democrats are going to have to  decide they want to come to the table.   ``Our way or the highway'' is not a negotiating position, and if  Democrats continue to insist on getting everything that they want, they  are going to be responsible for Congress's failure to deliver  additional relief. I hope--I really hope the Democratic leadership will  remember what it means to negotiate and that it will work with  Republicans to arrive at a compromise bill that can make it through  both Houses of Congress and actually become law.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
