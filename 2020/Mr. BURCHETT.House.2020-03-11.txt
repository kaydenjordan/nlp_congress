 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize the achievements of  Harold Agnew, from Knoxville, Tennessee.   At 91 years young, Harold continues to be active in our community  through his job as a barber and a gospel musician.   Harold was raised on a farm in South Carolina but came to call  Knoxville home in his adult years. For 61 years, Harold has been a  barber and still works 6 days a week at Gam's Barbershop in  Mechanicsville.   Anyone who has had their hair cut by Harold will notice something  unique about him. He is a gifted singer who sings gospel tunes as he  works. He is a member of the group known as Brother Agnew and the Angel  Voices, which released their latest album called ``Serving the Lord''  in November 2019.   At 91 years old, Harold has a cheerful personality and optimistic  attitude. He continues to live his life to the fullest, with no  intention of taking a step back from his day job.   One of the lyrics from his recent songs is, ``but sometimes a nobody  is your somebody.'' Harold believes everyone matters, regardless of who  you are. That is a message we can all believe in.   Congratulations, Harold, on all your success. Keep being an  outstanding member of our great community.                            ____________________
