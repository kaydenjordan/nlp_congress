 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize three high  school students from Kennewick, Washington, as the winners of  Washington's Fourth District 2017 Congressional App Challenge.   Seth Florman, Damon Fuller, and Kyler Zimmerman spent many hours  creating and refining an app they named Powerhouse, which enables the  user to take on the role of businessowner of an energy company. These  students designed the app to illustrate an energy company's  responsibilities to the community and to draw attention to the  challenges energy providers face.   Thank you to our panel of judges and to the engineers at Pacific  Northwest National Laboratory who will be providing the winners with a  tour of their great facility.   The Congressional App Challenge highlights the value of computer  [[Page H9853]]  science and coding, and I am proud to represent central Washington,  where schools and teachers are dedicated to encouraging students to  excel in STEM education.   This year, the Fourth Congressional District's App Challenge had the  highest number of entries since my office began participating in the  contest, which is a testament to the creativity of our young people.   I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating Seth, Damon, and  Kyler on their wining app, Powerhouse, and I look forward to their  continued educational and professional success.                            ____________________
