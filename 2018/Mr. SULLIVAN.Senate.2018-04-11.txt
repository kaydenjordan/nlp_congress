 Madam President, as we all know, our country is facing  a lot of challenges, particularly overseas, and a lot of them are in  the news--Iran, Syria, North Korea. When you  [[Page S2057]]  look out across the landscape of what the big, long-term, geostrategic  challenges are that face our Nation, in my view, there is no doubt that  the No. 1 challenge economically and from a national security  standpoint is the rise of China as a great power. We need to be  thinking about that a lot more because that is going to be the issue  our country faces, not just this year or next year but for decades.   I come from the great State of Alaska. We are an Asia-Pacific State.  We are always looking to that region--as a matter of fact, we are in  that region. My hometown of Anchorage is closer to Tokyo than it is to  Washington, DC. What I see as a positive on this issue--having been  someone in this body for a little over 3 years, I have come down to the  floor and talked a lot about this challenge, the rise of China. It is a  little concerning that a couple of years ago nobody was talking about  it. Very few people were talking about it, but that is changing, and I  think that is positive.   It is changing. This administration is focusing, and it is changing  with my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans. Certainly, this is an  area where, I think, there is a lot of agreement. I was just presiding  for the last hour. The majority whip and the Senator from Oklahoma both  were talking about issues dealing with China and trade and strategy,  and that is positive.   The administration is talking about it. If you look at the national  security strategy of the Trump administration, they are starting to  focus on this issue. Front and center is the return of great power  rivalries, with China as the leading, pacing threat and challenge, but  it is also an opportunity for this great Nation of ours.   When you look at the history of our country, particularly post-World  War II, the United States set up the international system--the  international trading system and security system. We have been leading  them, and so many countries--hundreds of millions of people in the  world--benefited from that. The irony, of course, is that the one  country that benefited probably more than almost anyone is China.   The rise of China was not only helped, but it was spurred by the  American international trading system, the sealanes of commerce that we  have kept open for decades. So there was a moment in the last couple of  decades where we reached out very much--there was a great speech by our  former Deputy Secretary of State in the Bush administration, a  gentleman by the name of Bob Zoellick, who went on to become head of  the World Bank. He asked in a speech to the Chinese: You need to now  become a responsible stakeholder in this system that we created because  you have benefited so dramatically. You are big, you are powerful, and  now help become a stakeholder in the international order that we set  up. Here is the offer to you.   Well, unfortunately, whether it is a Democrat or Republican, in the  national security and foreign policy realm, most people are sensing  that China has rejected that notion. No, we are not going to be a  responsible stakeholder in your system. We are going to set up our own  system. As a matter of fact, we might even try to undermine your  system--the global system set up by the United States of America by  Democrats and Republicans over decades.   You see it everywhere, whether it is decades-long theft of  intellectual property, whether it is high tariffs, whether it is any  American company coming into China and being forced to transfer their  technology. No other countries do this to China, but they are doing it  to our companies and have been doing that for decades.   So there is a rethinking right now. Clearly, the Trump administration  is thinking about what the new strategy should be. The national  security strategy of this administration, which I commend people to  read--it is quite a good document, written by the outgoing National  Security Advisor, H.R. McMaster--focuses a lot on this issue of  reciprocity and great power rivalry again.   So as we are thinking about it, I would like to briefly touch on  three principles I think will be key as we debate this. As we help  formulate this--hopefully, in a bipartisan manner--this issue is going  to be with us for decades. There are three key principles.   The first key principle is reciprocity--true reciprocity. The  majority whip was just talking about this. The national security  strategy of the Trump administration talks a lot about it. The  President talks a lot about this. This is just a fairness issue. As I  mentioned, there is IPR theft; high tariffs; the forced tech transfer  from American companies to China; giant, subsidized, state-owned  enterprises and state-backed investment funds buying up companies all  over the world. No other country does that to China.   So when you look at the issue of reciprocity, I would like to break  it down into a positive and negative. You have negative reciprocity. If  we can't do that in your country, you shouldn't be able to do it in our  country. It is pretty simple, pretty fair, and everybody understands  that.   Then there is positive reciprocity. One thing I have been encouraging  the Chinese to do for many years--and I have been over there a lot and  spent a lot of time with senior leaders in that country. The United  States has been going over and investing in China for decades.  Factories have been rebuilt from the ground up and we have employed  tens of thousands of Chinese with American capital. Well, you know  what, China is getting big enough. They can do that in America. The  Japanese did that in the 1980s. We had major trade disputes with them.  What did they do? They started coming to our country and investing in  our States with their capital, greenfield investments--auto factories,  for example--and employing tens of thousands, if not hundreds of  thousands, of Americans. We would welcome that. As a matter of fact, in  Alaska, the Chinese are talking about helping us develop a large-scale  Alaska natural gas project. Greenfield investment, employing Alaskans  would be positive if that is going to happen. So that is the way we  need to think about reciprocity.   The second key principle is allies--allies, allies, allies. The  United States is an ally-rich nation. Our adversaries and potential  adversaries--think about whom that might be: Russia, North Korea, Iran,  potentially China. They are ally-poor. No one wants to join the North  Korea team or the Iran team--well, maybe Syria--but the United States  for decades has had allies because they trust us. We are not a perfect  nation, but they trust us. Look all over the world.   So what we need to do with regard to our strategy on China is make  sure we remember not only our allies and deepen current relationships  with Japan, with Korea, with Australia, but expand them--Vietnam. The  Presiding Officer and I went to Vietnam with the chairman of the Armed  Services Committee, a war hero who spent time in prison in Vietnam,  Senator McCain. The Vietnamese are very interested in doing more with  us. India, there are incredible opportunities to have a deeper alliance  between the oldest democracy in the world, us, and the biggest  democracy in the world, them. So allies have to be a key part of our  strategy as we look at how we deal with the rise of China for the next  two or three or four or five decades because all of these countries-- all of our allies--are having the same challenges.   Finally, the third principle we cannot lose sight of--and for too  long this body lost sight of it--is robust American economic growth.  Since the founding of our Nation, we have been growing at about 3 or 4  percent GDP growth. I have a chart, and I talk about it all the time  down here. Yet, over the last decade, because of policies we inflicted  on the American people, we were barely growing at 1-percent GDP growth.  What does that mean? Everybody talks about numbers, wonky. That is a  proxy for the American dream, and we were not growing. We weren't  growing. In Asia, the coin of the realm of power more than anything-- more than military power--is the power of your economy, and we have not  had that. We have not shown up, and that matters.   What we are trying to do in this body now--tax reform, regulatory  reform, unleashing American energy--is we are going to start growing  this economy again, and that is going to help the American people, that  is going to reignite the American dream, but that is going to be key  with any policy we deal with China.  [[Page S2058]]    So as we are thinking through this challenge--and I am going to talk  about this a lot, and I know all my colleagues are interested in this.  I know my colleague from Michigan is interested in it--we need to  continue to focus on these core principles--reciprocity, our allies,  and robust economic growth as we all struggle with and put together a  long-term strategy to deal with the rise of China, the challenges and  the opportunities.
