 Madam Speaker, I want to answer his question with a  question.   Do you care about the 4 million children today that live off of less  than $2 a day and live in extreme poverty and they are alive? No, you  don't.   Let me quote our Founding Father Samuel Adams. ``. . . freedom of  thought and the right of private judgement in matters of conscience  direct their course to this happy country. . . .''   The First Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, the 14th Amendment, all  sort of convene to this notion of rights of privacy in this country,  except when it comes to women and their bodies.   Republicans continue to wreak havoc for women's health, operating as  if they have some sort of moral imperative to tell us. Get your laws  off our bodies.
