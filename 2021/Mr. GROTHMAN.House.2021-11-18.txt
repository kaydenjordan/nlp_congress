 Madam Speaker, we got horrible news yesterday; for the  first time in the United States, over 100,000 people died from illegal  drugs. When I got here 6 years ago, that number was 47,000. By  comparison, in 12 years, only 58,000 died in the Vietnam War. Almost  twice as many people die in this country every year from illegal drug  overdose than died in the entire 12-year period of the Vietnam War.   Today, we look at a major bill, the Build Back Better Act, and we  look at what is the effect of the Build Back Better Act on 100,000  deaths. In this bill, we are encouraging more illegal immigration; we  are taking more Border Patrol agents off the border and processing  young people. And finally, in this bill we are encouraging more people  to come here, which inevitably means more fentanyl, more deaths.   Madam Speaker, I ask the majority party to please step back, change  the bill to add a few more Border Patrol agents, and change the bill to  get out the carrots that are going to encourage more fentanyl and more  deaths.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I think I can find something I agree  with my Democrat colleagues on. This bill is a transformational bill.  It is a bill made up by people who think America is fundamentally  broken and that we have to make big changes. That is what we are going  to get.   I will focus quickly on five areas.   One, illegal immigration. Under this bill, we are adding no new  Border Patrol agents, but we are making it more difficult to deport  people who have committed serious crimes here. We are using an  additional carrot to get people here in that we are giving away free  college to match the free healthcare we are already giving.   One way that this bill would transform America is you get a lot more  illegal immigrants. Since yesterday, for the first time, we topped  100,000 illegal drug deaths in this country. I think this bill ensures  that number is going to continue to go up. That is an undersold story.   Secondly, I have always felt the biggest problem in America right now  is an out-of-control welfare system that  [[Page H6585]]  destroys families. That system becomes more generous in this bill, be  it through much more low-income housing or an earned income tax credit  provision that increases the marriage penalty or Pell grants.   This is a transformative bill, and I strongly wish my colleagues  would vote against it.
