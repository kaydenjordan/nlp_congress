 Mr. President, I speak today about my votes on the  motions  [[Page S3470]]  to discharge Senate Joint Resolutions 20 and 26, which sought to block  the sales of certain weapons to Bahrain and Qatar respectively.   As many of you know, I have long been a champion of a U.S. foreign  policy driven by our values and respect for human rights. This applies  to our foreign military support and arms sales. We must ensure that our  military might and weapons only go to support partners and allies who  uphold our values. We have both a moral and a national security  obligation to ensure that U.S. weapons, equipment, and training are  never used to harm civilians, abuse human rights, or end up in the  hands of enemies who seek to do us harm.   With that in mind, I was pleased to lead the Enhancing Human Rights  in Arms Sales Act of 2019 with my colleagues from both sides of the  aisle. This bipartisan legislation would put into place strict vetting  criteria and end use monitoring for certain weapons sales to prevent  U.S.-provided weapons from going to governments who commit human rights  abuses and war crimes. I urge all of my colleagues to support this  important and necessary legislation.   Until my bill is enacted into law and its critical safeguards are in  place, it is incumbent upon Congress to evaluate each arms sale with  important considerations for civilian security and human rights.   I have carefully examined both of the sales before us today, and  applied the same criteria outlined in the Enhancing Human Rights in  Arms Sales Act.   Through this lens, I was compelled to vote in favor of discharging  S.J. Res. 20, so the Senate could debate the pending sale of various  bombs and precision-guided munitions to Bahrain. Domestically,  Bahrain's Ministry of Interior police forces were responsible for the  repression of the 2011 uprising, and well over 100 Bahrainis have been  killed in the course of repressing the Shia-led unrest. In the Yemen  conflict, the Bahrain Air Force is participating in Saudi-led coalition  airstrikes that have led to civilian casualties. This pending sale  would in fact provide munitions for Bahrain's F-16 aircraft, which  would almost certainly be used in Yemen. We know this because Air Vice  Marshall Hamad bin Abdullah al Khalifah, head of the Royal Bahraini Air  Force--RBAF--stated in February 2019 that Royal Bahraini Air Force F- 16s had conducted over 3,500 sorties, or combat aircraft flights, since  the beginning of the campaign in March 2015. With 3,500 sorties in  Yemen, we have to assume that Bahrain is responsible for some of the  civilian deaths caused by the coalition airstrikes in Yemen. I have  repeatedly voiced my opposition to U.S. support for the war in Yemen,  and we cannot risk our weapons leading to further repression in Bahrain  itself. I cannot support the sale of U.S. weapons to Bahrain at this  time.   The case of the pending sales to Qatar is quite different. There is  no doubt that Qatar has significant human rights challenges,  particularly with respect to its labor practices. That said, I have not  seen any evidence of the Qatari Government using arms against its  people. Moreover, Qatar's involvement in the Yemeni war was limited to  primarily defending the Saudi border from the Houthis, not conducting  airstrikes in Yemen. The Qataris left the Saudi-led coalition entirely  2 years ago. Qatar has proven itself an important and responsible  partner for the United States. The Qatar Air Force flew strikes,  alongside the U.S. and other partners, against the Islamic State in  Syria in 2014 and 2015. It also flew strikes against Qadhafi in Libya  in 2011, but again, this was in concert with international partners  including the United States. In light of these factors, I voted against  discharging S.J. Res. 26.   While both discharge motions failed, this issue will not go away  because one thing that we all can agree on is that no U.S. arms should  ever be linked to the deaths of innocent civilians. No U.S. arms should  ever be used to intimidate and destroy the defenseless. No U.S. arms  should ever end up in the hands a child soldier or a terrorist. We may  disagree on policy, but our values will always bridge the partisan  divide. That is why Congress and the administration must take a more  holistic look at this issue. My bipartisan bill, the Enhancing Human  Rights in Arms Sales Act of 2019, offers a comprehensive approach, and  I urge my colleagues to support its passage.                            ____________________
