 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and legacy  of an honorable public servant, Mr. Ralph Owens, of Lavonia, Georgia.   As a lifetime member of the Franklin County community, Ralph humbly  answered the call to public service and played a critical role in the  city of Lavonia's success. In 1987, Mr. Owens was first elected to the  Lavonia City Council. Just two short years later, he became the mayor  of Lavonia, where he dutifully served his local community for over  three decades.   During his lifetime as a public official, Mayor Owens' leadership  ushered in impressive industrial and economic growth to the city. From  dramatically improving the city's police department, to bringing new  businesses to the community, Ralph was a dedicated servant to the great  people of Lavonia.   I am deeply saddened by the loss of such an accomplished individual  that led with his servant's heart to truly make a positive difference  in his community. Georgia's Ninth District will always remember Mayor  Ralph Owens and his profound impact on the city of Lavonia and both  Franklin and Hart Counties in northeast Georgia.                            ____________________
