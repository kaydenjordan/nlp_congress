 Mr. President, I am here today to recognize a loss for  the Murray office and a major victory for Wisconsin and that is the  return of Beth Burke, a longtime and deeply trusted aide of mine, to  her home State after 8 years with my office.   Over her time with us, Beth saw me through office move after office  move, countless hectic days of running to and from the Capitol all  without missing a vote, I should say and more rebooked flights back to  Washington State than sure she would like to remember.   All of that would be enough to keep a team of ordinary people busy,  but it doesn't even scratch the surface of what Beth has meant to me,  to our team, and to our country because, during those same years of  Beth's service, she helped lead our team as we grew from scrappy and  small to still scrappy, but spanning three different office buildings  in the Senate, in addition to our two coast, as I negotiated a  bipartisan budget agreement no one thought we could get done and  through the negotiations between Chairman Alexander and me on reforming  K-12 education to end No Child Left Behind.   She was up at all hours, all week, every week, doing everything she  could to advance our efforts to fight for patients' healthcare, for  women's reproductive rights and equality, and always, always for our  servicemembers, veterans, and their families.   It is a bit of a truism that the loudest voice in the room is not  always the one having the biggest impact. Now, Beth will be the first  to admit that she has a loud voice. But she used it and her expertise  at navigating every logistic and obstacle imaginable to ensure we were  in the best possible position to succeed in whatever we set out to do.  She is a true public servant with the biggest heart you can imagine,  and I know families and communities in Washington State and nationwide  are better for her time here.   I would also be remiss if I didn't note that Beth met her wonderful  husband Dan, got married, and had her adorable, fierce baby girl  Lillian all while she worked in our office.   It has been a true joy seeing her family grow, so before I close I  want to thank Beth's family--Dan, Lillian, their dog Karl--the most  important Burke and everyone who's excited to welcome her home to  Wisconsin, for sharing Beth with us.   I know it is not always easy having a Senate staffer as a spouse or a  family member or a close friend, especially one who works as hard and  cares as much as Beth, so I want to recognize all your loved ones for  their service as well.   Beth, thank you again from my State and my family to yours. We are so  deeply grateful for you and so excited to hear about everything you  have in store.                            ____________________
