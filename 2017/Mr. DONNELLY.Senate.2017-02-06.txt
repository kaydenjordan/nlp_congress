 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the nominee  for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos. I am here not only to  reiterate my concerns about Mrs. DeVos but to share some of the letters  and emails I have received from Hoosiers about her nomination.   Every Hoosier and every American deserves access to a quality  education. It prepares our students to enter the workforce, to secure  good-paying jobs, and to succeed. As I have said, after reviewing the  record of Mrs. DeVos, I believe she lacks the commitment to public  education needed to effectively lead the Department of Education. I am  deeply concerned that she will not focus on priorities important to  Hoosier families: expanding access to early childhood education,  improving our public schools, and addressing increasing student loan  debt.   Now I want to share some of the concerns I have heard from people all  across Indiana about Betsy DeVos.   A current undergraduate student at Purdue wrote to me, urging me to  vote against Betsy DeVos. The student wrote as follows:         I am concerned that she will cause major damage not only to       our public K-12 schools, of which I graduated from, but also       to federal student aid programs, which allow many of my       fellow students and I to attend our nation's fantastic public       universities.    A mother of three children in Fishers wrote:         I believe our democracy needs well-funded and accountable       public schools for all. Mrs. DeVos demonstrates zero interest       in supporting strong public education. For the future of our       children, our democracy, and our standing in the global       economic system, I ask that you vote against Mrs. DeVos.    A soon-to-be college graduate who is pursuing a career in public  education wrote:         I will be graduating from Indiana Wesleyan University in       Marion. I have spent the past semester student teaching at a       local school district in Gas City, IN.        One of the largest reasons that I wanted to embrace a       career in public education is to push students to see their       potential, just as I had a teacher do the same for me.       Teaching is not simply facilitating learning, but rather it       is taking the time to fully invest in the students. Getting       to know their students, listening to what they have to say,       and using the resources presented to best prepare students to       succeed.        I have been able to see this firsthand and put this into       practice as I have been in three different school districts       throughout my time at Indiana Wesleyan University. . . . As a       soon-to-be teacher in the state of Indiana, I ask you to       consider voting no for the nomination of Betsy DeVos for       Secretary of Education.        I chose this path as it directly impacted me, and I want to       see students find success. With the right reform, we can see       this happen, but with the suggested reforms of Betsy DeVos,       we will not be able to help students succeed.    Here's another story. This one is from Muncie.         As a mother and public education advocate, I am writing to       request that you vote no to the appointment of Betsy DeVos as       Secretary of Education. As you are aware, there are many       challenges facing education in the United States. . . . Ms.       DeVos' track record in the state of Michigan would be       devastating to the country as a whole if she were to be given       the position of Secretary of Education. For the sake of my       children, their dedicated teachers and children across the       nation, I respectfully request your ``no'' vote to her       appointment.    A woman in Zionsville wrote as follows:         I feel that the DeVos agenda plans a dangerous voucher       program that robs public schools of money and allows       unprecedented support of K-12 programs with opaque standards,       curriculum and accountability. In Indiana we have struggled       with the skills gap and graduating students that are prepared       for the available workforce positions. . . . I beg you to       speak out against the appointment of Ms. DeVos as Secretary       of Education.    Hoosiers have the right to an educational system that strives for  high standards, transparency, and success, and I do not believe the  DeVos model will be able to deliver on any front.  [[Page S722]]    A retired special education teacher who taught in Mishawaka for 24  years wrote:         I implore you to vote ``no'' on the confirmation of Betsy       DeVos as Secretary of Education. Her selection by Donald       Trump was clearly an attempt to further dismantle the public       school system in the United States. The poor, the       disadvantaged, and the disabled would suffer great       educational setbacks with her as Secretary of Education.    A woman in West Lafayette wrote:         As a future special education teacher, I find it horrifying       that [Ms. DeVos] seems to be unaware of the IDEA Act, which       protects the rights of millions of children with       disabilities. It is completely unacceptable that our country       should have someone in charge of education who is unaware of       this monumental law. Education is so important for the future       of this country and everyone deserves equal opportunity to       get a good education. . . . This is why I ask you to please       vote no for DeVos.    In a letter from Greenwood, a woman wrote:         As a mother of two children, one with severe disabilities,       please know I do not support Betsy DeVos as Secretary of       Education. I can only hope that you will bear with me as I       offer the story of my son below.        My son was born full-term and healthy. From 18 hours until       two weeks old, he fought for his life. At two weeks old, a       heart defect was discovered. Next was heart surgery,       recovery, and he was home at exactly one month old. Saying we       were ill-prepared for the future would be an understatement,       to say the least.        We had no way of knowing the repair to his heart would not       also repair all the damage to his brain and body. He was       eventually gifted multiple diagnoses: cerebral palsy,       congenital heart disease, significant mental and physical       disabilities and severe GERD. To match the diagnoses, he was       also provided coordinating medical equipment: wheelchair,       communication device, standing equipment, a special seating       device, feeding pump, and leg braces.        Skip ahead to today and you'll discover a 15-year-old doing       his absolute best to find his place in this quick-paced       world. It took a long time, but over the past 3 to 4 years,       he mastered his communication device and has shown he is       capable of learning and understanding.        While it took all this time for him to show us, it took the       relentless dedication of very special teachers to really make       it happen. His teachers worked tirelessly to develop       extremely specific Individualized Education Plans for him. I       am certain without the Individuals with Disabilities Act and       Free Appropriate Public Education, he would not have achieved       his current level of learning. I also feel his teachers would       not have been able to get him to this level without the right       educational tools in our public schools.        I wanted you to feel my emotions and how difficult his life       truly is. Please don't make his education any harder than it       already has been.    A former public schoolteacher in Indianapolis wrote:         I watched all of Betsy DeVos's Senate confirmation hearing.       As the minutes churned by fear, fury, and grief built within       me. I will not sit back and watch as a nominee for Secretary       of Education prepares to take the helm who does not commit to       protecting children in public schools. I hope you stand with       me to firmly reject Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education.       We must commit our care, our love, and our attention to       upholding the promise that all kids deserve a shot at success       through education.        These kids are our future, and we owe it to them to lead       wisely. Unfortunately, Ms. DeVos will not lead us to that       future.    A mom in Evansville wrote:         I have one child in college and two others in public       elementary schools. My children have received and are getting       very good education in public school and are in advanced       classes. I am very concerned about the appointment of a woman       who has been advocating against our public school system for       years. We must do better for our children. Please fight for       our public schools and our children, and do everything in       your power to keep Betsy DeVos from becoming our Secretary of       Education.    This is just a small sampling of the letters and emails I have  received from Hoosiers all over our State who are deeply troubled and  who are opposed to Betsy DeVos. They wrote to me not as Republicans,  Democrats, or Independents but as concerned Hoosiers, as moms and dads  who love their kids. They are worried about an issue we should all be  able to agree on: the importance of ensuring our children have access  to a quality education.   While I said I would vote against Betsy DeVos's nomination, I will  continue to fight for our public schools, our teachers, and our  students. I will continue fighting for them because ensuring our  students have access to good schools and good teachers lays a  foundation for our students to reach their potential, and it is  fundamental to their success and in turn our country's success.   We love our schools, we love our kids, and all we want is the best  for them and an extraordinary education. That is why I will be voting  against Betsy DeVos for Secretary of Education.   Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my postcloture debate time to  Senator Schumer.
