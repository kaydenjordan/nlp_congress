 Mr. Chairman, I would like to also thank Chairman  Thornberry and Chairman Sessions for making my amendment in order and  allowing floor consideration.   Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple. It prohibits telecommunications  companies that provide material support for North Korea cyber attacks  from contracting with our Defense Department.   While my amendment is simple in nature, it strikes at the heart of  what I believe to be the cornerstone of North Korea policy.   For far too long, China has enabled the North Korean Government to  pursue nuclear development, global provocation, and egregious human  rights violations. The Chinese Government is simply not a good faith  partner on the issue of North Korea.   For example, there have been multiple public reports indicating that  China's largest government-affiliated telecommunications firm, Huawei,  has been subpoenaed by the Commerce Department as part of an ongoing  investigation into whether it broke our export control laws by  conducting business with North Korea.   Additionally, earlier this year, a similar Chinese Government- affiliated firm, ZTE, was hit with a record-breaking billion-dollar  fine in connection with comparable North Korea-related export  violations.   Mr. Chairman, my amendment is one of many steps that our Congress  needs to take to demonstrate to China we will no longer tolerate its  alliance and partnership with North Korea.   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.
