 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the 60,000 direct and  indirect jobs that the medical device industry brings to my home State.   The last 4 years, Congress has worked together to continually suspend  the medical device tax because they know that it doesn't make sense.  This tax is a bane to innovation; it damages our manufacturing sector;  it raises healthcare prices; and it hurts high-paying jobs.   What our medical device industry needs more than anything is  certainty. There has been enough upheaval in our healthcare system over  the last decade to last us a lifetime.   Let's show our support for the hardworking Americans, the good jobs,  the patients, and the employers and permanently repeal this tax.
