 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the need for pro- growth tax reform for small businesses in America.   Last week, I was on Main Street in Grapevine, Texas, surrounded by  local businesses that were started in pursuit of the American Dream.  These businesses are opened by hardworking people trying to give their  families a better life and create jobs in north Texas and the  communities that I represent.  [[Page H5927]]    Washington's Tax Code is too big and too complicated for American  small businesses to grow and to be the job creation engine for future  generations. We need pro-growth tax reform that lowers the rates for  local businesses and simplifies the code for families. Main streets  across America are counting on us to do that.                            ____________________
