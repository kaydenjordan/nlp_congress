 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of lower drug prices,  because Americans are getting squeezed while drug companies are raking  in the cash.   One of my constituents, Mike McKenny, runs a minority-owned, small  business in St. Petersburg. He works hard for a living, making payroll,  serving his customers.   When Mike's daughter Taylor was diagnosed with diabetes, he had to  pull thousands out of the family's 401(k) and do, in his words, ``other  creative things'' to make ends meet when the insurance coverage ran  out. At the toughest point, he paid $120 for a 3-day supply of the  insulin to keep his daughter alive.   Mr. Speaker, $120 for 3 days. That is immoral.   Under the Elijah Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act, nearly 600,000 of  my constituents will pay less for drugs, some dramatically so.   End the drug company abuse. Lower drug prices now.                            ____________________
