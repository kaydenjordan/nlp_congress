 Madam Speaker, today I stand in opposition to H.R. 5129,  the Community Services Block Grant Modernization Act of 2022, CSBG.   While I recognize that the CSBG program has been serving those in  need for decades, I do not believe that this reauthorization bill  improves CSBG services or fixes the program's flaws.   As Members of Congress, we have an obligation to ensure that taxpayer  dollars are being spent as efficiently and effectively as possible. In  that regard, the CSBG program is missing the mark. Spending $1 billion  on a program that has limited accountability is yet another reason why  our country is experiencing the biggest inflation crisis we have seen  in 41 years.   With our national debt exceeding $30 trillion, it is time to stop  mortgaging the future of the next generation with spending on programs  that may not even work. There is little proof that CSBG programs are  accomplishing the one goal they were created for: moving Americans out  of poverty.   In fact, there is more proof that CSBG has become nothing but another  welfare program, which keeps Americans in poverty instead of lifting  them into self-sufficiency.   Under current law, CSBG lets States set their own benchmarks for  progress, allowing ineffective programs to continue receiving taxpayer  dollars despite poor performance. This bill continues that ineffective  policy rather than creating commonsense measures to judge the programs'  outcomes. This does not help people in need, and it is an irresponsible  use of taxpayer dollars.   When creating programs like CSBG, our goal should be self- sufficiency, not government dependence. This is particularly true with  some of the changes proposed in H.R. 5129.   For example, the bill raises the income threshold for individuals who  can receive services under CSBG programs from 125 percent of the  Federal poverty level to 200 percent.   In addition, it will allow individuals in the program to continue  receiving services even after they have exceeded the income threshold.  This program was created to help individuals most in need, but  Democrats are trying to twist it into a permanent welfare pipeline.   H.R. 5129 has other troubling provisions.   Under this bill, organizations would be able to use grantee  facilities for voter registration activities. While promoting political  participation is important, it is simply not the purpose of this  program.   This new provision risks distracting servicers from their primary  purpose and opening the door to partisan politics. We must preserve the  integrity of CSBG by keeping in place important safeguards that protect  against intertwining Federal policy and partisan political activity.   This legislation also adds a new requirement that will allow CSBG  funds to be used for vague, undefined ``healthcare needs.'' With  Democrats' increasingly radical stance on abortion and attempts to  strip the Hyde amendment from Federal legislation, this legislation  could open the door for taxpayer-funded abortions and gender  transitions. This is an unacceptable risk.   Lastly, one of the most concerning points of this bill is how it got  protections for faith-based organizations. Religious workers have been  on the front lines serving the poor long before this program began.  Instead of honoring their long history of service, this bill would  require religious organizations to check their faith at the door to  participate in the CSBG program. Faith-based providers deserve an equal  opportunity to serve those in need.   Our Founding Fathers wrote the First Amendment to protect the free  exercise of religion from interference by the Federal Government. Yet,  this bill suggests that faith-based organizations should not be able to  hire employees who share the same faith if they are going to  participate in a Federal program. This is unacceptable.   The Constitution protects the right of religious organizations to  hire in accordance with their beliefs. Congress recognized this right  in enacting title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Supreme  Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of a religious  employer's staffing exemption in 1987.   The current law protections, which were adopted in a bipartisan  manner nearly 25 years ago, should be uncontroversial, but H.R. 5129  makes these provisions controversial because Democrats think religious  belief is backward and discriminatory.                                time  0930    Democrats have claimed that these current law protections allow  faith-based providers to discriminate against program beneficiaries.  But that simply isn't true. Democrats can't point to a single instance  of widespread discrimination in the CSBG program. These faith-based  organizations exist to serve the neediest among us. The current law  protections ensure they can continue to do that. If the purpose of H.R.  5129 was to improve CSBG, then I am afraid the bill has failed  miserably. This modernization attempt is a false start.  [[Page H4937]]    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Banks).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, if CSBG programs were fulfilling their statutory  purpose, we would be hearing lots of numbers of people lifted out of  poverty. But those numbers have been notably absent in the committee  debate and here today.   We have been given no proof, no proof at all, that these programs are  working as they have been set up. We are asking hardworking taxpayers-- let me repeat that--hardworking taxpayers to give money to support  these programs that have no accountability.   The goal is to take people out of poverty and have them become  hardworking taxpayers to balance out the burden here in this country,  but that is not happening, Madam Speaker.   This bill would appropriate $1 billion. I said in my opening comments  that we are $30 trillion in debt. We are going to add to our debt with  this program with no accountability. We should not spend a dime of  taxpayer dollars without knowing that those dollars are being spent  effectively.   Republicans support commonsense efforts to fight poverty and provide  a safety net for Americans truly in need. We want to make our Nation's  antipoverty programs the best they can be, a streamlined network that  specifically focuses on aiding those in dire need and helps lift them  out of poverty, but that is not what we have here.   H.R. 5129 fails to reform CSBG. In fact, the program widely expands  the pool of eligible beneficiaries, leaving those most in need with  fewer resources.   It goes along with other programs that my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle and the Biden administration keep proposing, and that  is to put more people in dependency in this country, not make them  independent.   It also attacks religious liberty. I believe my colleagues have  basically admitted that in the last few minutes.  [[Page H4941]]    Over 19,000 vital faith-based organizations work tirelessly to help  their communities through the CSBG program. Yet, H.R. 5129 sets a  terrible and destructive precedent. Preventing faith-based  organizations from competing for grants while remaining true to their  religious character means fewer low-income Americans will receive the  help they need.   This legislation is another Washington-knows-best approach that will  keep Americans dependent on hardworking taxpayers' dollars. My  colleagues should reject this legislation, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the amendment.   Madam Speaker, while the amendments before us include some positive  reforms to improve accountability and transparency in the community  services block grant program, there are unfortunately several  problematic amendments in the mix that outweigh the improvements and  require me to oppose them when considered together.   These amendments are duplicative, add additional requirements to the  program, and lessen accountability.   It is critical to streamline antipoverty programs to make them work  for low-income Americans. But instead, these amendments layer on  duplication and move us in the opposite direction.   I cannot agree to add more inefficiency to an already ineffective  program, and therefore, cannot support the Democrat amendments before  us today.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1015     Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   My friends at home tell me all the time that they believe common  sense is in short supply in Washington. I completely agree with them.  It is practically nonexistent on the other side.   Madam Speaker, we can exercise common sense by focusing on reforming  the Federal safety net so that programs pull people out of poverty and  into self-sufficiency and not encouraging them to stay in dependency on  the Federal Government. Adding more duplication and bureaucracy to the  CSBG program will not accomplish that goal.   I urge my colleagues to oppose these amendments and yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, this en bloc includes several amendments that I  believe would vastly improve the underlying legislation.   First, one of the included amendments will address a critical  concern. I cannot support any legislation that opens the door for  taxpayer funding of abortion, and this bill opens that door. The  legislation includes vague language allowing program funds to address  health needs and improve health and well-being. While this might sound  nice at first blush, it hides a huge problem. I am concerned that  instead of helping people receive high-quality healthcare, it will lead  to taxpayer dollars funding abortions.   The majority of Americans oppose seeing their hard-earned dollars go  to pay for abortions, and we must do all in our power to stop that from  ever happening. This amendment will make sure that no taxpayer dollars  are used to reimburse healthcare services. It will also ensure that  taxpayer dollars are not used for experimental gender hormone  medications or other harmful gender medical interventions.   Additionally, this amendment takes the commonsense steps to prohibit  taxpayer dollars from funding lobbying activities and voter  registration activities. H.R. 5129 would allow program funds to be used  for voter registration efforts. While getting more eligible individuals  registered to vote is a worthy goal, we should not jeopardize the  integrity of this program or let the next election distract from  serving low-income Americans.   Finally, this amendment ensures that limited Federal funds are spent  on those Americans most in need by maintaining the poverty threshold  that exists in current law. Increasing this threshold will just expand  the pool of eligible participants and stretch resources thinner. We  need to tailor the program to ensure that Federal dollars serve those  most in need.   Madam Speaker, I hope my colleagues will support this group of  amendments, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Good).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. McClain.)    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, my colleagues have presented many good arguments  against this bill in general and why we should be voting for these  amendments that are in this en bloc. These amendments will provide  needed improvements to the underlying legislation and make sure that  program funds are spent on the program's original goal, serving low- income Americans and helping them get out of poverty.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this en bloc  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition, but I am not  opposed.    Madam Speaker, we owe our military veterans a huge debt of  gratitude, and we must make sure they are well supported as they  transition back into the civilian workforce.   This amendment encourages the CSBG program to meet the needs of low- income veterans, especially homeless veterans. It is surprising to me  that we need to put such an amendment in this bill because we would  think that the CSBG program would already be doing it. But since this  is a worthy goal and one that I support, I will support this amendment.   In fact, Madam Speaker, I wear a pin every day with the United States  flag, the North Carolina flag, and a banner under it that says: ``I  support veterans.'' Therefore, I must support an amendment that would  support veterans.   While I have concerns with the underlying bill, I think this is a  good amendment, and I appreciate the gentleman offering it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, we must do all we can to make sure we help low-income  and homeless veterans. I think this amendment furthers that effort.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
