 There is evil in the world, and for the better part of  the last century, America and our allies were squarely in the  crosshairs. Unfortunately, we tend to forget that.   On September 12, 2001, George Will coined a phrase, saying that the  free  [[Page S5095]]  world's ``holiday from history'' was over. When Russia escalated its  lawless invasion of Ukraine last year, many observers, including former  Secretary of Defense Bob Gates, invoked the same idea.   The West is at a crossroads. Increasingly, fringe voices on the left  and right are insisting that it is not America's business to lead. They  seem willing to accept American decline and to assume that their lack  of interest in history means history won't be interested in them.  Meanwhile, many of our allies are waking up to their own commitments to  collective defense.   As the world was reminded last February in Ukraine and again on  October 7 in Israel, some of our friends and fellow democracies have  never had the option of taking a holiday from history. Israel has no  choice but vigilant self-defense because murderous theocrats and  terrorists have vowed to wipe it off the map. Ukraine has no choice but  all-out resistance because an authoritarian thug with delusions of  Soviet glory has spent years butchering its people and carving up its  sovereign territory. Half a world away, the free people of Taiwan have  no choice but to stare down the threat from a communist superpower  intent on bringing their island to heel.   It is hard to ignore the growing strategic alignment between these  authoritarian forces. They share an interest in one another's violent  pursuits and in undermining the West--especially America.   Take the growing strategic partnership between Russia and Iran. The  Obama administration foolishly welcomed Putin's intervention in Syria,  and it gave Russia influence in the Middle East it hadn't had since the  1970s--mostly at America's expense. Iran and its terror proxies were  glad to see Putin prop up Bashar Assad. Under Russian protection, Syria  became a training ground and logistics superhighway from Tehran's  terror network. And as terrorists challenge America and Israel in the  region, Russia is the beneficiary.   It is a symbiotic relationship for the bad guys, and it has only  continued to grow. Russia defends Iran at the U.N., and Iran is now  providing the same lethal drones its terrorist proxies use to attack  American forces in Syria and Iraq directly to Russia for use against  Ukraine.   The world's largest state sponsor of terror--with American, Israeli,  and Arab blood on its hands--is also sponsoring Russia's war against  our friends in Europe.   As one good analysis put it recently, ``When Hezbollah terrorists,  Hezbollah mercenaries, and Iranian theocrats chant `Death to America'  after murdering Israelis, they're not confused.'' And it is hardly  surprising that Putin has aligned his regime with this terror, given  the devastation his forces inflict on civilians in Ukraine.   Meanwhile, China isn't just keeping a close eye on the West's resolve  to resist Russian aggression and Iran-backed terrorism; they are  actually getting more directly involved. Just yesterday, for example, a  summit of the PRC's so-called Belt and Road Initiative--a massive  influence operation aimed at bringing more parts of the world under  Beijing's thumb--featured Vladimir Putin as the guest of honor--yet  another sign that Russia and China are serious about their ``friendship  without limits.''   Beijing has released a flurry of statements responding to terrorist  savagery by condemning Israel's self-defense operations and  conspicuously avoiding any mention of Hamas.   The PRC is stepping up its coordination with and support for Iran. It  is no surprise that the regime that wants to break the will of the free  people of Taiwan is eager to see its fellow travelers in Tehran and  Moscow do the same to Israel and Ukraine.   Our adversaries know the challenges they pose to us are linked. The  belief that we can abandon allies in one part of the world and not hurt  allies elsewhere simply doesn't hold water. In fact, it is naive and  dangerous.   The people of Israel have a right to defend themselves, and the  United States has an interest in our closest ally in the Middle East  rooting out terrorists like Hamas.   Ukraine has a right to sovereignty, and the United States has an  interest in Europe--our largest trading partner and strongest ally--not  facing an emboldened thug at its gates.   Taiwan and other Asian democracies have a right to self- determination, and the United States has an interest in helping Asian  partners stand up to Chinese aggression.   We need to remember America is a superpower. Our interests are  global, and with global interests come global responsibilities. Our  alliances matter. Our credibility matters. Our friends on the  frontlines of authoritarian aggression and terrorist savagery don't  have the opportunity to take a holiday from history, and America can't  afford to either.   In the coming days, it will be the Senate's responsibility to take  strong and decisive action to put maximum support behind Israel's self- defense, equip Ukraine for victory as it defines it, and help Taiwan  deter growing threats.   The prosperity America has known for the better part of a century is  the direct product of our leadership. Preserving it means standing with  our friends and investing in our own strength.                            ____________________     Now, one final matter, I would like to take a minute  to thank an all-star member of the Senate community as she departs on a  well-deserved retirement.   For the past 25 years, recording, preserving, and sharing the stories  of the U.S. Senate has been Betty Koed's top responsibility. As Senate  Historian, Betty has immersed herself more than pretty much anyone in  the lore of this remarkable institution.   Betty joined the Senate as Assistant Historian in 1998, in time to  witness history with the impeachment trial of President Clinton. And  her intelligence and determination came in handy immediately as the  Historian's office phones rang off the hook with questions about the  complex rules, procedures, and precedents that surrounded the first  such event in more than a century.   But as much as Members of this body are prone to make history,  Senators also tend to like consuming history. I myself am no exception.  So back in 2009, when former Senate Historian Richard Baker retired, I  invited Betty to start visiting the Republican conference lunches to  deliver weekly presentations on Senate history.   By all accounts, Betty's ``History Minutes'' were the highlight of  many a lunch. In fact, they were always so popular that we asked her to  turn these stories into a book, and I am glad to say that an impressive  volume illustrating some of the most dramatic and significant events in  the Senate's history was actually published earlier this year.   Over her time in the Senate, Betty has been a fierce advocate for the  preservation of Senate records. Her colleagues describe her as a role  model and mentor who is highly knowledgeable, considerate, and  persistent. It would be no exaggeration to call Betty Koed's tenure as  Senate Historian a historic milestone in its own right.   So I would like to thank Betty, with heartfelt thanks for her loyal  service to this institution, and I know our colleagues join me in  wishing her all the best.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
