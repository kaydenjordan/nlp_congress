 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank every parent,  grandparent, aunt, uncle and neighbor that took a child with them to  the polling place during this past election.   This simple act of bringing a child to their polling place and  letting them see how a vote is cast is a powerful form of education  about the United States of America for the aspiring generations.   Involving children, too, in seeing how you fill out a mail-in ballot  is a lesson every person can teach. It teaches youngsters how important  voting is as an adult and allows children to absorb and learn directly  about liberty, about individual freedom, and about meeting one's civic  responsibility to community and Nation.   Voting demonstrates fundamental reverence to Old Glory. Long may she  fly high.                            ____________________
