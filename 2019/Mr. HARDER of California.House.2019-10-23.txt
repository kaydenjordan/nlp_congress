 Madam Speaker, I rise in frustration for my  constituents in California's Central Valley. Folks across my community  are reeling from blackouts caused by greed, corruption, and  mismanagement at our State's largest utility, PG&E.   I am not the only one who is fed up. More than 1,000 people in my  district had their power cut by PG&E, some for days.   Now the company is saying more blackouts could be coming this week  and that it could be the new normal for the next decade. I refuse to  accept that.   Regular people can't choose to not pay their bills, and PG&E  shouldn't be able to abuse that fact by refusing to invest in their  grid. These blackouts are happening because rich executives decided to  give themselves millions of dollars in bonuses instead of investing in  their crumbling infrastructure.   Hundreds of thousands of people lost power because of these  executives' greed. PG&E even proposed handing out another $16 million  in additional bonuses this year. It took a judge to stop their plan.  Meanwhile, their shutoffs are estimated to cost our families more than  $2 billion.                            ____________________
