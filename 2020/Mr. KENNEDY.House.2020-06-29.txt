 Madam Speaker, yesterday afternoon I spent a few moments  on the porch of a woman named Therese in Lowell, Massachusetts. Through  an oxygen tube and a mask, and surrounded by four generations of her  family, she told me the challenges of living with COPD, even though she  never smoked a cigarette.   Her mother and her brother both passed away in that home. She was  adamant that she would, too. She was hoping to make it for just a few  more months, but that survival, Madam Speaker, was contingent on having  access to healthcare. Access that our President, in court just this  last week, was still trying to take away.   Madam Speaker, how is our country made stronger by taking away  Therese's healthcare? What kind of person, let alone administration,  looks to the wreckage of nearly over 120,000 lives lost, 2\1/2\ million  infected by a pandemic, and decides that the best response is to take  away healthcare from millions more?   What is great about an administration that idly watches 40 million  Americans lose their jobs, and then tries to take away their  healthcare, too? How morally bankrupt that we can lavish praise on  essential workers, and then thank them by trying to strip away their  access to medicine? All so that the rich can become richer, the  powerful more powerful, backed up by a massive tax cut and aggregation  of corporate power.   Madam Speaker, this moment has proved, like many other moments of  truth in our Nation, that our fates are linked. That our future is  shared and uncertain. We have a choice to advance together or to  scramble for our own. Four generations of Therese's family know the  answer. We know that answer. Today is our chance to prove it.
