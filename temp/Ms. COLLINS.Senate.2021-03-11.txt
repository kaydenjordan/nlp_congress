 Mr. President, I rise to introduce the PPP Extension Act  of 2021. I'm pleased to be joined in introducing this bill by my  colleagues, Senators Cardin and Shaheen. Last March, the three of us,  along with Senator Rubio, formed a Small Business Task Force that  crafted the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)--a forgivable loan  program designed to help keep small employers afloat and their  employees paid during the pandemic. The bipartisan bill that we are  introducing today would simply extend the current application deadline  for new PPP loans from March 31st to May 31st of this year, and then  provide an additional 30-day period during which time the Small  Business Administration may continue processing applications received  prior to the new May 31st deadline. Representatives Velazquez,  Luetkemeyer, Bourdeaux, and Kim (CA) have introduced a companion bill  in the House.   The PPP has been hugely successful in helping our Nation's small  businesses and nonprofits survive the pandemic and continue paying  their employees. In 2020, more than five million small employers  received forgivable PPP loans, helping to sustain upwards of 50 million  American jobs. This includes more than 28,000 Maine small businesses,  who received nearly $2.3 billion in forgivable PPP loans.   Recognizing the importance of this program for our Nation's small  employers, the bipartisan December 2020 COVID-relief law provided an  additional $284.5 billion to reopen the Paycheck Protection Program and  allow the hardest hit small employers to receive a second forgivable  loan. The December law also made other improvements to the PPP, such as  expanding forgivable overhead expenses to include supplier costs and  investments in facility modifications and personal protective equipment  needed to operate safely.   Since reopening in January, more than two million additional  forgivable loans--totaling nearly $165 billion--have been approved for  small businesses across the Nation. In Maine, more than 10,000 small  employers have been approved for more than $692 million in forgivable  loans since PPP's reopening. In total, Maine small employers have been  approved for nearly $3 billion in forgivable loans since the program  was created last year.   I have heard from countless small employers about the impact this  program has had on them and their employees. The owner of Shipyard  Brewing Company in Portland told me that without the relief that PPP  provided, his company would be bankrupt. The Ecology School, a non- profit environmental education program in Saco, would have had to lay  off the majority of its staff without the support of two forgivable PPP  loans. I've heard from the owners of Jeff's Catering in Brewer, the  Poland Spring Resort, and the Hamilton Marine in Searsport that PPP  helped keep their businesses alive and their employees paid.   With the ongoing distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and the promise of  warmer weather throughout the Nation, there is a light at the end of  the tunnel. We're not there yet, which is why we need to extend the  deadline to apply for new loans. Extending the deadline would also help  address concerns I continue to hear from Maine small employers about  delays in the processing of new loan applications because of difficulty  in resolving error messages generated by the Small Business  Administration computer system.   By extending the PPP for another two months and then providing an  additional 30 days after that time for the SBA to process applications  that are still pending, this bill would help our Nation's small  employers retain access to forgivable PPP loans. I urge my colleagues  to support this legislation.   Thank you, Mr. President.  [[Page S1504]]                                ____________________
