 Mr. Speaker, nearly 700 million people across the  globe lack access to water. This is a disturbing world crisis. In many  countries, women and children walk for miles and face countless risks  just to find some water.   Mr. Speaker, water is not just about drinking; it is about  sanitation; it is about hygiene. It prevents diseases and drastically  improves the quality of life. That is why I worked with my friend,  Representative Earl Blumenauer, for the Water for the World Act.   This bill has made it U.S. policy to improve international access to  safe water, sanitation, and hygiene. I applaud the administration on  issuing the Global Water Strategy required by that law, and I look  forward to seeing its implementation.   The road ahead is long. Eighty percent of the countries receiving  U.S. aid still suffer from water issues. With our God-given resources,  we have an obligation to make sure people receive the basic element of  life--clean water--because water is life.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
