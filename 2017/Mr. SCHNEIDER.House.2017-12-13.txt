 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 5, line 23, strike ``to contribute to'' and all that       follows through ``by Iran;'' on page 5, line 25 and insert       the following: ``to contribute--''        (A) to the continued development, testing, and procurement       of ballistic missile technology by Iran; and        (B) to human rights abuses.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 658, the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Schneider) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this bipartisan  amendment to H.R. 1638, the Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act.   I would like to thank my colleague from Texas, Judge Poe, for joining  me in this effort.   Iran is a bad and dangerous actor in a volatile region of the world,  which is why Congress has enacted sanctions in response to Tehran's  dangerous ballistic missile program and support for terrorist proxy  groups, including Hezbollah. We must hold senior Iranian leadership  accountable for destabilizing actions in the region and around the  world.   The legislation on the floor today is an effort to shine a light and  focus our  [[Page H9877]]  efforts on assets held by top Iranian officials, including the Supreme  Leader, members of the Council of Guardians, members of the Expediency  Council, and high-ranking military leaders.   Specifically, the bill requires the Secretary of the Treasury to  report to Congress information on the assets held by senior Iranian  leaders. Included in this report are recommendations on how to improve  the effectiveness of U.S. sanctions to prevent these assets and funding  from being used by Iranian officials to further develop Iran's  ballistic missile program.   My amendment simply, but importantly, expands this requirement to  include Iran's human rights abuses. We should be using every tool in  our toolbox to make clear to Iran that its human rights abuses are  unacceptable.   The human rights situation in Iran is appalling, and abuses permeate  many aspects of Iranian society. In Iran, repression and persecution of  members of different religious faiths, including Sunni Muslims,  Christians, and Baha'is is pervasive. The State Department's  International Religious Freedom Report of 2016 cites at least 103  members of minority religious groups imprisoned for their religious  activities. Since 1979, Iran has executed more than 200 Baha'i leaders  and, over the past 10 years, has conducted more than 850 arbitrary  arrests of Baha'i individuals.   Sexual orientation and gender identity are not protected categories  from discrimination under Iranian law, and same-sex acts are punishable  by flogging and possibly even death.   Arbitrary and unlawful killings are numerous. The State Department's  annual Human Rights Report says the Iranian Government announced 114  executions by August of 2016 and that unofficial reports suggest a  total of 469 executions by the end of that year. The U.N. puts this  number even higher at 530 executions in 2016.   Freedom of speech is limited, media is censored, and publications  have been banned and closed by the government. Harassment and  detainment of journalists continue, and Iran's citizens are not allowed  to criticize the government, Supreme Leader, or official religion.   The electoral system in Iran is neither free nor fair. In 2016, 79  percent of the candidates running for the Assembly of Experts and 58  percent running for the Islamic Consultative Assembly were disqualified  by the Guardian Council.   And we cannot forget about the Americans and other foreigners who  Iran has unjustly detained and continues to hold on fabricated charges,  including the following individuals whose family members testified  before the House Foreign Affairs Committee earlier this year: Baquer  and Siamak Namazi, Nizar Zakka, and, of course, Robert Levinson, who  has been held for more than 10 years.   These are just a handful of examples of egregious human rights abuses  by the Iranian Government. This amendment helps ensure that funds held  by senior Iranian leaders do not contribute to these human rights  abuses and that U.S. sanctions are best positioned to improve Iran's  human rights situation.   I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting this important  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague, Judge Poe, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
