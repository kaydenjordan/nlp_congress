 Madam Speaker, contrary to the remarks from my friend from  South Carolina, leading economists in this country say that the Build  Back Better bill will help on inflation. It will ease inflationary  measures. It is important that we pass the Build Back Better bill if we  are going to deal with inflation.   Build Back Better, the Reuters Agency says Biden's spending plan will  not add to inflationary pressure.   Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said, ``The  bills do not add to inflation pressures, as the policies help to lift  long-term economic growth via stronger productivity and labor force  growth, and thus take the edge off of inflation.''   Madam Speaker, 17 Nobel Prize winners in economics have already  stated they believe the Build Back Better bill will ease longer term  inflationary pressures.   So it is not an inflation problem. In fact, by passing the bipartisan  infrastructure bill, we make it easier for people to get to work and  for goods to get to market. Improving our ports, our airports with  cargo, our highways, and our rail, all of those things, make it easier  for us to work against inflation and to get goods to market and improve  the economy.   So we should pass Build Back Better, and hurray Biden.                            ____________________
