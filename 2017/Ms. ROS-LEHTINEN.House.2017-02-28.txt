 Mr. Speaker, Vladimir Putin's regime has long  sought to undermine U.S. interests and shape a world more compliant  with its corruption. I have argued for a stronger stance against Russia  for years. I opposed the Obama administration's failed reset of  relations.   I helped lead the push for greater sanctions on Russia's human rights  violators, helping secure passage of the Sergei Magnitsky Act.   I have called for sanctions against those who poisoned my friend,  Vladimir Kara-Murza, and against all those involved in the murder of  opposition leader Boris Nemtsov, the 2-year anniversary of which  occurred just yesterday.   I also support the efforts to codify sanctions against Russia and to  limit the lifting of executive waivers. But we should be limiting the  ability to waive sanctions not just on Russia, but also on Iran, on the  Palestinian Authority, and on so many others because, in order for  sanctions to be effective, they must be fully implemented and fully  enforced.                            ____________________
