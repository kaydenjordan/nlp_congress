 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I think the  papers will remain on the table.   Mr. Chair, Speaker Pelosi said she wants to get money out of  politics. She said she wants free speech. But this sham puts more money  into politics. It doesn't offer free speech; it offers forced speech.   In fact, for every dollar contributed to a candidate, the American  taxpayer will be forced to contribute 6.   Now, let me say that again. For every dollar that is contributed to a  candidate, an American taxpayer will be forced to contribute 6.   You heard it right, a 6-to-1 match, whether you support a candidate  or not, whether you support their positions on life, the Second  Amendment, immigration, taxes, or anything else--6 to 1.   The bill would also require same-day registration, nationwide. States  already have the right to determine for themselves if they want same- day registration. My home State of Illinois has it. But with it, can  come challenges in ensuring the accuracy of a voter's registration  information.   I believe that every single legitimate vote needs to be counted-- every single legitimate vote--but it must be a single vote. And we are  not just talking about one State. Multiply that by 50.   Without proper safeguards, my colleagues are leaving the States less  capable of managing their voter systems. That is a big problem. This is  a bad bill.   Mr. Chair, I urge the House to vote ``no.''
