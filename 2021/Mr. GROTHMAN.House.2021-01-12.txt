 Mr. Speaker, this is an absurd resolution callously  politicizing an unpredictable tragedy last week. We all know that  President Trump called for a peaceful and patriotic march. I must have  attended a half dozen Trump rallies in the past year, and they have  always been peaceful, wholesome events, typical of the thousands of  peaceful protesters who remained away from the Capitol last week. I  never would have expected this in a million years.   This is a horrible event, but not like the Black Lives Matter, antifa  events that went on day after day in city after city, with prominent  Democrats fanning the flames by mischaracterizing police shootings or  apparently encouraging bail for lawbreakers.   Less than 2 years ago, a Member of this body encouraged harassment of  Trump officers at restaurants, gas stations, or department stores. And  what happened? She was rewarded with the chairmanship of an ``A''  committee.   Even in last week's riots, the Speaker tried to preposterously  racialize them, which can only lead to trouble, maybe violence.  Everybody back home says we ought to get along.   Is this the way to start things?   It is time to get back to dealing with the people's business, dealing  with the cancel culture.
