 Mr. President, to accommodate the Senator from Utah, I  will not make my remarks first, but just by way of introduction to say  that tonight at midnight American national security is going to be  irreversibly weakened by the actions of President Trump and his  administration. That is because at midnight the administration will  allow the online publication of blueprints to manufacture 3D plastic  guns, and this is one example.   So to accommodate the Senator from Utah, instead of making my remarks  now, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of S. 3304 submitted earlier today; that the bill be  considered read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action  or debate.    Mr. President, the Senator is basing that on First  Amendment rights. There are many limits on our First Amendment rights  of speech. You cannot say ``fire'' in a crowded theater. Why in the  world would you assert First Amendment rights to publish instructions  to manufacture a plastic gun that someone can take through a metal  detector, into a crowded theater, and start shooting in that theater-- instead of shouting ``fire,'' which is clearly an understood limitation  upon our First Amendment rights of speech.   It is inexplicable that the administration is allowing this to go  into effect at midnight tonight. It is dangerous. In fact, the  President this morning tweeted that allowing these blueprints to go  online--the President tweeted: ``It doesn't seem to make sense.''   I would say amen to that, Mr. President, but it is your  administration that has allowed this to happen because after years of  winning this issue in courts at every stage of litigation, the  administration has surrendered to the crazed demands of a self- described anarchist who is going to put this on the internet. He wants  to sow chaos--he said so--in our country and across the world by making  these blueprints widely available.   We can make this impossible if, No. 1, the President will do it. He  can stop it before midnight, and the clock is ticking. We are only  talking less than 9 hours from now because 3D-printed guns, made of  plastic or resin, can't be detected by metal detectors. Because they  are plastic, there is not a serial number on the metal so they are  untraceable, and anyone can get their hands on them, even people who  are legally barred from having a gun, such as felons or domestic  abusers. So after midnight, people can walk onto airplanes with a  deadly weapon because they are not caught in the metal detector, and  people would not know about it.   People can walk into schools. My State is the most recent for a  school shooting. As a result of Parkland, people are outraged. They  want to harden schools, but now are we going to render the metal  detectors useless as they try to harden the schools because somebody  can get through a metal detector with this or with an AK-47 or an AR-15  that can be manufactured by these 3D printers?   Somebody could come into this building, somebody could be up in that  Gallery right now, and if they have a plastic gun, including bullets  that are plastic bullets, we wouldn't know about it.   So whether you are talking about schools or this Chamber or whether  we are talking about airports, any public space that we try to protect  is going to be useless because these 3D-printed firearms are a direct  threat to our national security, and we are going to let these go up on  the internet tonight at midnight.   I think some of our allies like the Israelis should be concerned  about this because this is not limited to the United States. These can  be printed anywhere in the world. Therefore, it can give national  security apparatuses a great headache because they can't detect them.   So as I stated in the unanimous consent request, I and other Senators  have introduced the legislation today to block the online publication  of blueprints.   Now, as it turns out, since we can't do it here, and if the President  can't do it in 8 hours 45 minutes, it is going online, and it is going  to take us a long time--I mean, what Senator or Representative can  object to this? So even if we can get the legislation passed, it is  going to take a while because the legislative process is slow.   We have also introduced a separate bill to require every gun to have  a serial number and to have a main component made of metal so it can be  detected by a metal detector.   Obviously, this is all common sense. This is not a partisan issue.  Everybody should be concerned about the threat posed by these deadly  plastic guns.   I had intended to give these remarks before asking for unanimous  consent. As an accommodation to the Senator from Utah, who had to run  to an appointment, I went ahead and asked that unanimous consent. But I  want my fellow Senators, who have been so great and so articulate on  this issue, to be heard. I ask for them to also speak--the Senator from  Utah's objection was about First Amendment rights--about why those  objections don't apply here.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for the July 30,  2018, vote on Executive Calendar No. 1006, the motion to invoke  cloture, on Britt Grant, of Georgia, to be U.S. circuit judge for the  Eleventh Circuit. I would have voted no.                            ____________________
