 Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Aging  Committee, I am delighted to introduce, with my good friend and former  ranking member, Senator Claire McCaskill, the Senior$afe Act of 2017, a  bill that would help protect American seniors from financial fraud. I'm  pleased that Senators Isakson, Casey, Tillis, Klobuchar, Wicker,  Shaheen, Capito, Tester, Barrasso, Donnelly, Heller, and King have  joined us in sponsoring this bill.   According to the GAO, financial fraud targeting older Americans is a  growing epidemic that costs seniors an estimated $2.9 billion annually.  Stopping this tsunami of fraud is one of the top priorities of the  Aging Committee. Last Congress, we held several hearings examining an  endless variety of financial abuses targeting our nation's seniors.  These range from the notorious IRS phone scam that burst onto the scene  in 2015, to the incredible ``drug mule'' scam, where trusting seniors  have been tricked by international narcotics traffickers into  unwittingly serving as drug couriers, and then find themselves arrested  and locked-up in foreign jails. The common denominator in these schemes  involves innocent seniors falling prey and being tricked out of their  hard-earned savings.   Sadly, not all scammers are strangers to their victims, in too many  cases, seniors are exploited by someone they know well. Sometimes, that  abuse is perpetrated by ``friends'' or family members who are handling  the victim's affairs informally. Other times, the abuse is committed  under color of a fiduciary relationship, such as a Power of Attorney or  guardianship.   No matter the scheme, one factor is common to all--the fraudsters  need to gain the trust and active cooperation of their victims. Without  this, their schemes would fail. That is why it is so important that  seniors recognize as quickly as possible the red flags that signal  potential fraud.   Unfortunately, many seniors do not see these red flags. Sometimes  they are  [[Page S450]]  too trusting or are suffering from diminished capacity, but, just as  often, they miss the signs because the swindlers who prey on them are  extremely crafty and know how to sound convincing. Whatever the reason,  a warning sign that can slip by a victim might trigger a second look by  fmancial service representatives trained to spot common scams, who know  enough about a senior's habits to question a transaction that doesn't  look right. In our work on the Aging Committee, we have heard of many  instances where quick action by bank and credit union employees has  stopped a fraud in progress, saving seniors untold thousands of  dollars.   Let me give you an example. Last year, an attorney in the small  coastal city of Belfast, ME, was sentenced to 30 months in prison for  bilking two elderly female clients out of nearly a half a million  dollars over the course of several years.   The lawyer's brazen theft was uncovered when a teller at a local bank  noticed that he was writing large checks to himself on his clients'  accounts. When confronted by authorities, he offered excuses that the  prosecutor later described as ``breathtaking.'' For example, according  to press reports, he put one of his clients into a nursing home to  recover from a temporary medical condition, and then kept her there for  four years until the theft of her funds came to light. Meanwhile, he  submitted bills for ``services,'' sometimes totaling $20,000 a month,  including charging her $250 per hour for 6 to 7 hours to check on her  house, even though his office was just a one-minute drive down the  road.   In another example, in 2015, a senior citizen in Vassalboro, Maine,  was looking to wire funds from his account at Maine Savings Federal  Credit Union to an out-of-state location, supposedly to bail out a  relative who was in jail. Something about this transaction did not  sound right to the credit union employee. She asked the customer, and  he said he had received a call from an ``official'' at the jail--but  that ``official'' had instructed him not to speak to anyone about this.  The ``official,'' of course, turned out to be a con artist.   Fortunately, the credit union worker recognized this as a scam, and  her quick thinking saved her customer from falling victim and losing  his savings.   These stories demonstrate the critical nexus that financial  institutions occupy between fraudsters and their victims. Their  employees, if properly trained, can be the first line of defense  protecting our seniors from these criminals. Regrettably, various state  and federal laws can inadvertently impede efforts to protect seniors,  because financial institutions that report suspected fraud can be  exposed to litigation. The Senior$afe Act encourages financial  institutions to train their employees, and shields them from lawsuits  when they make good faith, reasonable reports of potential fraud to the  proper authorities.   There is no doubt that financial fraud and scams targeting seniors is  a growing problem that we must act on. Last November, the Aging  Committee heard testimony from Jaye Martin, the Executive Director of  Maine Legal Services for the Elderly, who told the Committee that her  organization has seen a 24 percent increase in reports of elder abuse  in just one year. Many of these cases involve financial fraud.   In a letter describing her support for the Senior$afe Act, Ms. Martin  says that:         In a landscape that includes family members who often wish       to keep exploitation from coming to light because they are       perpetrating the exploitation, the risk of facing potential       nuisance or false complaints over privacy violations is all       too real. This is a barrier that must be removed so that       financial institutions will act immediately to report to the       proper authorities upon forming a reasonable belief that       exploitation is occurring. These professionals are on the       front lines in the fight against elder financial exploitation       and are often the only ones in a position to stop       exploitation before it is too late.    Our bill is based on Maine's innovative Senior$afe program, a  collaborative effort by Maine's regulators, financial institutions, and  legal organizations to educate bank and credit union employees on how  to identify and help stop financial exploitation of older Mainers. This  program, pioneered by Maine Securities Administrator Judith Shaw, also  serves as the template for model legislation developed for adoption at  the state level by the North American Securities Administrators  Association, or NASAA. The Senior$afe Act and NASAA's model state  legislation are complementary efforts, and I am pleased that NASAA has  endorsed our bill.   I am pleased that our bill has received bipartisan support in both  houses of Congress. Last year, the House Financial Services Committee  approved a version of the Senior$afe Act by a vote of 59 to zero, and  it passed the full House by voice vote in July. In the Senate, the  Senior$afe Act was cosponsored by a quarter of the Members of this  body, balanced nearly evenly on both sides of the aisle, and was  discharged out of the Banking Committee. Unfortunately, just one member  of this body blocked it and prevented it from becoming law.   Besides receiving broad support in Congress, our bill has the support  of a wide range of stakeholders, ranging from the State securities  administrators and insurance commissioners to advocates for seniors.   Combating financial abuse of seniors requires regulators, law  enforcement and social service agencies at all levels of government to  work collaboratively with the private sector. The Senior$afe Act  encourages financial institutions to train their employees, and shields  them from lawsuits when they make good faith, reasonable reports of  potential fraud to the proper authorities.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be  printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      Legal Services                                                 for the Elderly,                                      Augusta, ME, December 5, 2016.      Re Senior$afe (S. 2216).       Hon. Susan Collins,      Chair, Senate Special Committee on Aging, Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Collins: I want to thank you for inviting me       to speak with the Senate Special Committee on Aging about the       serious problem of financial exploitation of seniors by       guardians and others in a position of power. I also want to       thank you for your leadership in working to ensure there is       training of financial institution employees in reporting       elder abuse and an improvement in the timely reporting of       financial exploitation when it is suspected through passage       of the Senior$afe Act. I strongly support this legislation       that is based upon work done here in Maine.        I served for over two years on the working group that       developed Maine's SeniorSafe training program for financial       institution managers and employees. It is a voluntary       training program. Through that work I came to fully       appreciate the very real concerns of the financial industry       regarding the consequences of violating, or being perceived       as violating, the broad range of state and federal privacy       laws that apply to their industry. I also came to appreciate       that absent broad immunity for reporting of suspected       financial exploitation, privacy regulations would continue to       be a barrier to good faith reporting of suspected financial       exploitation. In a landscape that includes family members who       often wish to keep exploitation from coming to light because       they are perpetrating the exploitation, the risk of facing       potential nuisance or false complaints over privacy       violations is all too real.        This is a barrier that must be removed so that financial       institution employees will act immediately to make a report       to the proper authorities upon forming a reasonable belief       that exploitation is occurring. These professionals are on       the front lines in the fight against elder financial       exploitation and are often the only ones in a position to       stop exploitation before it is too late.        I want to add that tying the grant of immunity to required       training for not just supervisors, compliance officers, and       legal advisors, but to all who come in contact with seniors       as a part of their regular duties, will have the direct       result of bringing more cases of exploitation to the timely       attention of the proper authorities because it will       significantly increase the knowledge and awareness in the       industry of the red flags for elder abuse. In Maine, where       our training program is entirely voluntary and carries no       legal status or benefit, we have already seen what a       difference training can make.        Senior$afe is a much needed step in the fight against       financial exploitation of seniors and there is no doubt it       will make our nation's seniors safer. I thank you again for       your leadership in this important area.            Sincerely,                                                    Jaye L. Martin,                                                Executive Director.  [[Page S451]]                                          ____                                          North American Securities                                Administration Association, Inc.,                                   Washington, DC, January 24, 2017.      Re The Senior$afe Act of 2017.       Hon. Susan Collins,      Chair, U.S. Senate Special Committee on Aging, Washington,           DC.        Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the North American       Securities Administrators Association (``NASAA''), I am       writing to express strong support for your work to better       protect vulnerable adults from financial exploitation through       the introduction of the Senior$afe Act of 2017. Your       legislation will better protect persons aged 65 and older       from financial exploitation by increasing the likelihood it       will be identified by financial services professionals, and       by removing barriers to reporting it, so that together we as       state securities regulators and other appropriate       governmental authorities can help stop it.        Senior financial exploitation is a growing problem across       the country. Many in our elderly population are vulnerable       due to social isolation and distance from family, caregiver,       and other support networks. Indeed, evidence suggests that as       many as one out of every five citizens over the age of 65 has       been victimized by a financial fraud. To be successful in       combating senior financial exploitation, state and federal       policymakers must come together to weave a new safety net for       our elderly, breaking down barriers for those who are best       positioned to identify red flags early on and to encourage       reporting and referrals to appropriate local, county, state,       and federal agencies, including law enforcement.        The Senior$afe Act consists of several essential features.       First, to promote and encourage reporting of suspected       elderly financial exploitation by financial services       professionals, who are positioned to identify and report       ``red flags'' of potential exploitation, the bill would       incentivize financial services employees to report any       suspected exploitation by making them immune from any civil       or administrative liability arising from such a report,       provided that they exercised due care, and that they make       these reports in good faith. Second, in order to better       assure that financial services employees have the knowledge       and training they require to identify ``red flags''       associated with financial exploitation, the bill would       require that, as a condition of receiving immunity, financial       institutions undertake to train certain personnel regarding       the identification and reporting of senior financial       exploitation.        The Senior$afe Act's objectives and benefits are far-      reaching. Older Americans stand to benefit directly from such       reporting, because early detection and reporting will       minimize their financial losses from exploitation, and       because improved protection of their finances ultimately       helps preserve their financial independence and their       personal autonomy. Financial institutions stand to benefit,       as well, through preservation of their reputation, increased       community recognition, increased employee satisfaction, and       decreased uninsured losses.        In conclusion, state securities regulators strongly support       passage of the Senior$afe Act of 2017. Please do not hesitate       to contact me, or Michael Canning, NASAA Director of Policy,       if we may be of any additional assistance.            Sincerely,                                                   Mike Rothman,                                      NASAA President and Minnesota,                                          Commissioner of Commerce.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DAINES (for himself and Mr. Manchin):   S. 228. A bill to ensure that small business providers of broadband  Internet access service can devote resources to broadband deployment  rather than compliance with cumbersome regulatory requirements, and for  other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and  Transportation.    Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Aging  Committee, I am delighted to introduce, with my good friend and former  ranking member, Senator Claire McCaskill, the Senior$afe Act of 2017, a  bill that would help protect American seniors from financial fraud. I'm  pleased that Senators Isakson, Casey, Tillis, Klobuchar, Wicker,  Shaheen, Capito, Tester, Barrasso, Donnelly, Heller, and King have  joined us in sponsoring this bill.   According to the GAO, financial fraud targeting older Americans is a  growing epidemic that costs seniors an estimated $2.9 billion annually.  Stopping this tsunami of fraud is one of the top priorities of the  Aging Committee.

Sometimes, that  abuse is perpetrated by ``friends'' or family members who are handling  the victim's affairs informally. Other times, the abuse is committed  under color of a fiduciary relationship, such as a Power of Attorney or  guardianship.   No matter the scheme, one factor is common to all--the fraudsters  need to gain the trust and active cooperation of their victims. Without  this, their schemes would fail. That is why it is so important that  seniors recognize as quickly as possible the red flags that signal  potential fraud.   Unfortunately, many seniors do not see these red flags. Sometimes  they are  [[Page S450]]  too trusting or are suffering from diminished capacity, but, just as  often, they miss the signs because the swindlers who prey on them are  extremely crafty and know how to sound convincing.

Second, in order to better       assure that financial services employees have the knowledge       and training they require to identify ``red flags''       associated with financial exploitation, the bill would       require that, as a condition of receiving immunity, financial       institutions undertake to train certain personnel regarding       the identification and reporting of senior financial       exploitation.        The Senior$afe Act's objectives and benefits are far-      reaching. Older Americans stand to benefit directly from such       reporting, because early detection and reporting will       minimize their financial losses from exploitation, and       because improved protection of their finances ultimately       helps preserve their financial independence and their       personal autonomy. Financial institutions stand to benefit,       as well, through preservation of their reputation, increased       community recognition, increased employee satisfaction, and       decreased uninsured losses.        In conclusion, state securities regulators strongly support       passage of the Senior$afe Act of 2017.
