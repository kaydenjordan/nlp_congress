 Mr. President, of course, the senior Senator from Florida  can speak from experience because he has been there--something no other  Senator currently serving has ever done.   I believe they are bringing a chair over. If not, I will go get it.   On Friday, December 21--coming up fairly soon, just 11 days from  today--the continuing resolution, what we call a CR, under which much  of the government currently operates, is going to expire. Now, if we  don't pass the remaining seven appropriations bills--bills that I  believe the Senate is prepared to pass--the government will shutter the  doors of nine Federal Departments and dozens of Agencies, and services  the American people rely on will grind to a halt, coincidentally, just  3 days before Christmas.   There is absolutely no reason for the government to shut down. The  Senate and House Appropriations Committees have been negotiating for  weeks. I commend those Senators on both sides of the aisle. They have  worked with us and certainly our staffs in conducting these  negotiations.   We have a seven-bill minibus that would fully fund the Federal  Government through the remainder of the fiscal year. We are very close  to a deal. Six of the seven bills are nearly complete. Most of the  funding issues are resolved. Only a few policy issues remain. A few  hours of debate, and they would be all done.   Because we are the United States of America and we have to care about  all  [[Page S7378]]  parts of the country, we are working on a disaster package for the  victims of Hurricanes Florence and Michael, the California wildfires,  the Hawaii volcano, the earthquake in Alaska, and other disasters from  this year that have devastated the homes, communities, and lives of so  many of our fellow Americans. These bills could be finished in short  order, they could be put before the Congress for a vote--I suspect they  would pass virtually unanimously--and then sent to the President for  his signature into law.   So Republicans and Democrats have worked together. The appropriators  have worked together. There is only one thing standing between fully  funding our government and a shutdown; that is, President Trump. For  months now, he has repeatedly called for a government shutdown unless  we provide $5 billion for his boondoggle border wall. Last month alone,  President Trump publicly threatened to shut down the government over  his wall at least five times, saying things in his Presidential  statements, as we are pointing out here, such as: ``This would be a  very good time to do a shutdown,'' as though any American believes it  is a good time, with disaster funding and everything else pending, for  a shutdown.   Those reckless and damaging threats are not new for President Trump.  He set a destructive and uncompromising tone for our negotiations  earlier in the year saying: ``I would shut it down over this issue.''  Then, something I never thought I would hear from the President of the  United States of either party, he said: ``I'd love to see a shutdown,''  during a February press conference. This from a man who is supposed to  have an obligation to all Americans.   Time and again, though, instead of showing his obligation to  Americans, President Trump has used the government and the American  people as a bargaining chip for his fabricated solution to his  manufactured crisis. Now, just days before the CR is set to expire, the  President appears ready to make good on his threat. He wants to score a  made-for-reality-TV moment, and he doesn't care how many thousands of  hard-working American men and women are going to suffer for it.   We have been negotiating the Department of Homeland Security  appropriations bill for weeks, but as we get closer to the December 21  deadline, the President is digging in. His position is: Fund the wall-- his wall--or he will shut down the government.   The President likes to stir up drama, but a government shutdown is  not the backdrop for one of his reality TV shows. A government shutdown  is a dreadful thing to do to so many loyal Americans. This is the real  world. It has real-world consequences.   I will give some examples. If the government shuts down on December  22, an estimated 380,000 Federal employees will be furloughed without  pay just days before Christmas, never knowing if they will be paid.  Nearly 430,000 Federal employees, including FBI agents, U.S. marshals,  the Coast Guard, Border Patrol, and TSA employees will be forced to  work without pay. The Secret Service, which will protect the President  if he goes to one of his golf courses over the holidays, will be  working without pay, but this is even worse: Millions of Americans-- farmers, small businesses, homeowners, veterans, the disabled, and the  elderly--will go without the government services on which they rely and  for which they paid their taxes. There is no reason for this. In fact,  it is unconscionable to put the country through this.   I oppose the President's plan for a 30-foot-high wall along the  southern border, especially--aside from the fact that it will do no  good, this is a wall the President gave his solemn promise to the  American people that Mexico, not American taxpayers, would pay for. He  gave his word over and over and over again at rallies throughout the  country, saying Mexico will pay for it. I haven't seen one cent coming  from Mexico, but the President is going to punish the American  taxpayers if they don't pay the money he promised Mexico would pay.   The United States is a country founded by immigrants. Walling  ourselves off from our neighbors to the south is not only an expensive  waste of American taxpayer dollars, it is immoral, it is ineffective,  and it is an affront to everything this country stands for. We are  better than this.   In fact, if we do what the President wants to do, we would have to  seize land from ranchers and farmers in Texas and other border States-- seize land from them that has been in their families for generations.  It would require building walls through wildlife refuges and natural  preserves. Incidentally, we would end up cutting ourselves off from the  Rio Grande in the process because we can't build a wall down the center  of it. Basically, we are saying to Mexico: By the way, we are going to  pay for the wall President Trump promised us you would pay for, and to  help you out, we are going to give you the Rio Grande. You can have our  half too. This is a cockamamie idea.    After all that and billions of wasted taxpayer dollars, what would be  accomplished? Would it stop people from fleeing violence in their home  countries and seeking sanctuary? Of course not. Would it stop drug  smugglers and human traffickers from engaging in illegal activity?  Definitely not. In fact, as one of my Republican friends said, show me  a 30-foot wall, and I will show you a 31-foot ladder or a tunnel.   These are complex issues. We need real solutions, not bumper sticker  slogans or angry tweets.   We had such a solution in 2013. The Senate passed bipartisan,  comprehensive immigration reform. In a 2-to-1 vote, Republicans and  Democrats joined in on comprehensive immigration reform. The Republican  leadership in the House would not bring it up because they were afraid  it might violate the sacred Dennis Hastert rule, as they said to us.   Everyone agrees we need to keep our border safe and secure. That is  not a Republican or a Democratic idea. We all believe our borders  should be safe and secure. President Trump is not the first person to  say that. We have all said that. In fact, over the last 2 years, we in  Congress have invested more than $3 billion for that purpose. It is the  largest infusion of border security funding in recent history.   I am on the Appropriations Committee that gave that money. We have  directed U.S. Customs and Border Protection to acquire new technologies  that are proven to work on the border and at our ports of entry,  purchase new air and marine assets, and hire additional personnel. This  approach has resulted in the acquisition of integrated fixed towers on  the border, remote video surveillance systems, enforcement helicopters  and other aircraft, and upgrades to existing unmanned aerial systems. I  have visited the border and seen some of those. For the ports of entry,  where the large majority of illicit narcotics and other contraband  enter, we have significantly increased funding for nonintrusive  inspection equipment, and we have hired over 360 new Customs officers.   These are successes. These are things that work. These are things  that do better than we have ever done before, but does the President  tweet about this? No. He is fixated on building his wall not because it  is good policy, but he hopes it will fire up his base.   This is not about border security, it is about politics, pure and  simple.   Over the last 2 years, Congress has provided nearly $1.7 billion to  build or replace fencing on the southern border, but the administration  has hardly spent any of that money, and the projects it has undertaken  have ballooned in cost. In fact, of the money we gave them, they have  only spent 6 percent of the funds--6 percent. This is such an amazing  need to only spend 6 percent.   We have recently learned that one project in the Rio Grande Valley  that was supposed to cost, according to the administration, $445  million, will now cost the taxpayers nearly $787 million, a 77-percent  cost overrun, at a pricetag of $31.5 million each mile. This is not for  roads. This is for barriers. The President doesn't talk about that, nor  does he talk about the fact that the American taxpayers will have to  pay it, not Mexico.   The administration is not responsible with the money we have already  provided. Why trust him to spend responsibly the additional money they  demand? The President wants the hard-working American taxpayers, not  Mexico--even though he promised American taxpayers, gave his word, that  [[Page S7379]]  American taxpayers wouldn't have to pay for this, that Mexico would.  Now he says: Forget what I said before. Give me a check for $5 billion  more or I am going to waste hundreds of millions of dollars by shutting  down the government. That is a cynical, political stunt.   The President's own budget request to Congress for fiscal year 2019  was $1.6 billion for his wall, not $5 billion. I opposed this request  when he made it in the spring, and I still do. I don't want to  appropriate another dime to advance a nebulous and ineffective agenda  that I fundamentally oppose, knowing the President will not keep his  word and have Mexico pay for it. Our system of divided government  requires compromise, so we came up with a bipartisan compromise to meet  the President's $1.6 billion request, with restrictions on where the  money could be used and what type of barriers could be built, such as  bollard fencing but not a 30-foot concrete wall. Instead of taking  ``yes'' and declaring victory, the President repeatedly moved the  goalpost and redefined the fine print. So much for the ``Art of the  Deal,'' more the ``Art of the Steal.''   By manufacturing a crisis over his wall, President Trump appears  willing to shutter the doors of the Justice Department, Farm Service  Agency, the Food and Drug Administration, the Small Business  Administration, the National Park Service, the Department of  Transportation, among others--that is just a few--grinding vital  services for the American people to a halt, services the American  people have paid for with their taxes, all to protect his ego and  satisfy his base.   Actions have real-world consequences for hundreds of thousands of  Federal employees and their families and millions of Americans who pay  taxes and depend on their government to function properly.   Taxpayers don't send their hard-earned money to Washington so the  President can shut down their government. Our job is to be good  stewards of taxpayer money, not bend to the whim of the President's  tweets. Congress controls the power of the purse, not the President. It  is our job to make responsible, thoughtful decisions.   There is a bipartisan path forward. We can pass a seven-bill minibus  comprised of bipartisan bills that meet the needs of the country or we  can pass a six-bill minibus with a continuing resolution for Homeland  Security.   Republicans do control the House, the Senate, and the Presidency, and  they are in the driver's seat. The only reason the government shuts  down on December 22, 3 days before Christmas, is if the President wants  it to and the Republican leadership lets the President close the  government. Let's hope that doesn't happen.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in 1948, in the wake of two World Wars that  caused death, destruction and atrocities on a massive and unprecedented  scale, the world came together at the nascent United Nations to  establish the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.   These rights, envisioned as the ``foundation of freedom, justice and  peace in the world,'' included article 19, the right of everyone to  freedom of opinion and expression. This, of course, mirrors our First  Amendment, which for more than two centuries has served as the  cornerstone of our democracy. Article 19 also includes the ability to  ``receive and impart information and ideas through any media and  regardless of frontiers,'' as necessary to the realization of that  right. The free and independent press has fulfilled this essential role  around the world ever since.   Today is the 70th anniversary of that landmark declaration; yet as we  commemorate that historic achievement, I have never been more concerned  about the state of freedom of the press. Increasingly, around the world  and even here in the United States, governments are actively trying to  intimidate and silence the independent media. This year alone,  according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, over 43 journalists  have been murdered for nothing more than publishing facts and informing  the public. Countless others have been harassed and threatened.  President Trump, who has called the press an ``enemy of the people''  and routinely denigrates journalists who do not portray him in a  favorable light, has inspired the world's autocrats to decry ``fake  news'' and imprison and even assassinate journalists who courageously  report on corruption and other government misconduct.   Eleanor Roosevelt, one of our country's greatest defenders of human  rights, served as chairwoman of the UN commission that wrote the  Universal Declaration. Its commitment to the ``inherent dignity'' and  ``equal and inalienable rights'' of all people is a testament to her  vision of a more humane, just, and peaceful world, but like any such  statement of principles, the declaration is aspirational. It has  tangible meaning only to the extent that people apply it in practice.  As the oldest democracy whose First Amendment has inspired countless  people on every continent, it is incumbent on us all to defend the  right of free expression enshrined in article 19 of the Universal  Declaration, here and around the world.                            ____________________
