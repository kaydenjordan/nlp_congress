 Madam Speaker, we are delivering a major victory for  American families today, a victory for transparency, integrity, and  accountability in our democracy.   I am proud to have helped introduce H.R. 1, the For the People Act,  because, in every corner of Illinois, I hear from folks who are  frustrated about politics. They are frustrated with the secret and dark  money that enters politics; they are frustrated by the self-dealing in  Washington; and they are frustrated by the culture of corruption that  rewards the powerful while the voices of hardworking Americans are  drowned out.   Our For the People Act will bring fundamental change to Washington.  Our bill will end the dominance of big money in politics; it will  ensure that elections are fair; and it will make sure Congress is  working for the people instead of for themselves, banning Members from  serving on corporate boards.   Our For the People Act will make it easier to vote.   Madam Speaker, the American people sent us here to clean up the mess  in Washington. Today we are delivering on that promise.                            ____________________
