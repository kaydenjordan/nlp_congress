 Mr. President, 6 days ago, on the 10th, I came down to  the floor after having discovered something that happened. I think it  really was not intentional the way it happened, but I would like to  share that with you and share the frustration that I have.   There is a situation that is taking place and has taken place for 30- some years in Western Sahara. This is an area where after a colonial  period, the different colonies in there were attached to other  countries. In the case of Western Sahara, that actually had been  attached to Spain. It was called Spanish Sahara at that time. This was  way back in pre-1966. One of the many good things that President Trump  has done is that he has put together this program called the Abraham  accords, and that is bringing the Arab population and the Jewish  population in the Middle East together. This is something that  Presidents have tried to do for a long period of time--both Democrat  and Republican, not successful. And this has become successful because  the thing that was announced just 6 days ago was that Morocco was going  to salvage a relationship with Israel.  [[Page S7531]]    I don't know how many or what kind of detail went into that, but,  inadvertently, I think, they agreed to something that Morocco has been  trying to do for a long period of time, and that is, to have the United  States recognize that they have rights to the land that is known as  Western Sahara.   Now, as for Western Sahara, back after the colonial days, they  started getting their independence in various parts of that world. They  had been attached to Spain at that time. Well, anyway, what the  President did--and I say I think this was inadvertently done--was to  give Morocco claims to the land that rightly belongs to the Western  Saharans.   Now, I think that he could have secured the agreement with Morocco  without giving away and reversing 45 years of our longstanding foreign  policy.   Now, I have to confess that when I came down to the floor last week,  I was feeling shocked and deeply saddened by the announcement. The news  about the United States recognizing Morocco's claim over Western Sahara  took me by surprise because I had been involved in that issue for a  long period of time. And we have had a policy in the United States  since pre-1966 that we firmly supported the rights of the Saharans--the  Western Sahara people--to their own land that was taken unfairly from  them.   Now, this came as a surprise to me, and I came down to the floor.  That was 6 days ago. And I want to tell you what has happened since  that time, just to refresh the memory of those individuals.   There are a lot of people out there who are concerned about this.   Remember what happened historically and kind of a chronology of what  happened in Western Sahara. First of all, in 1966, the United Nations  General Assembly resolution agreed that a resolution of self- determination should be held, and that is, to allow the United Nations  endorsing the idea that a resolution of self-determination be made for  the population of Western Sahara. That was 1966, and we are in full  agreement with that here in the United States.   Then, because of the fact that Morocco was trying to claim some  ownership of the land that belonged to the people of Western Sahara, in  1975 the International Court of Justice denied Morocco the right to  territory of Western Sahara. Now, this was the International Court of  Justice. That is supposed to be a final thing.   And Morocco then invaded Western Sahara. Now, keep in mind that you  have Morocco--a very, very wealthy country with all kinds of  resources--taking on a group of people who had been sent out of their  homes, out and living in the bush. I have been there several times. The  conditions are just not livable conditions. And then, of course, they  were invaded by Morocco as a result of the International Court of  Justice decision.   Then, in 1991, the U.N. ceasefire mission began to provide a  referendum of self-determination. So that is the United Nations coming  in again and saying that they need to have the right of self- determination. That is something that was restated over and over again.  Well, that was a ceasefire in 1991 that was supposed to stop all kinds  of brutality and the bad things that were going on in that part of the  world.   I became very close, many years ago, with James Baker. James Baker,  back during the Bush 1 administration, was Secretary of State, and he  was Secretary of Treasury, and he took this on, back during the first  Bush administration, as a personal thing. He went and became familiar  with this and tried to put together a special envoy to Western Sahara  and worked at it for a long period of time. James Baker is still around  and still committed.   I remember when I called James Baker--this was several years ago--and  I said: I have been watching what you did--what you tried to do--in  Western Sahara to free these people up, and I just want you to know  that I have been there, I have seen it, and I agree with you, and I  want to get your advice as to how we can best make this happen. All we  want is a referendum of self-determination so people can decide for  themselves what they want their land to be a part of.   So James Baker responded to me, and he said: That was one of the very  few failures that we had during that administration.   He said: I was Secretary of State, and I worked hard on it and did  everything I could, and I feel sorry. I wish you the best of luck.   Well, then, in 2004, the United States and Morocco signed a free- trade agreement. This is interesting because we signed the free-trade  agreement with Morocco, and the agreement explicitly--explicitly-- excluded Western Sahara because Morocco does not have sovereignty over  it. So they agreed. They signed the same thing that we signed saying  that that land did not belong to Morocco, and it was specifically  agreed that it be excluded. That was the United States and Morocco way  back in 2004.   So you have, in 1966, the United Nations making that declaration. In  1975, the International Court of Justice denied the right of the  territory to Morocco; 1991, the ceasefire; 1997; then again, in 2004,  the United States and Morocco signing a free-trade agreement--which all  of this was agreed to.   So this isn't news for me. I have been involved in this issue for  decades, as well, and I have visited the refugee camps in that area.  About 10 years ago, I met with Aminatou Haidar. It was someone who  would become well recognized and some of the abuses that had been  taking place for a long time. She was here in Washington and came to my  office. She is from that area, and she was here to accept an award from  the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Human Rights for her work on behalf of  her people in Western Sahara. I remember her so well.   She had been arrested by Morocco for demonstrating peacefully in  Western Sahara. She was in prison for 4 years. She was blindfolded the  entire time for 4 years, and she was tortured and treated terribly, and  she lost her eyesight as a result of that. And all that was for  peacefully protesting on behalf of her homeland.   But it didn't stop her work. She kept fighting for her people, even  facing arrest again. Additionally, 15 years ago, I did something that  is kind of unusual here in Washington. People don't realize this--that  Members of the House and the Senate don't always testify before the  other body. And 15 years ago, they were having a hearing in the House  on international affairs, and I asked if I could be a witness. So I  went there and testified, and I gave the history that is similar to  what I just stated--the history of what has been going on there--and  why the referendum for self-determination was so necessary.    But I also called out a hidden part of this, and that is the  lobbyists. You know, it seems like every time someone has a cause that  is unjust, they go and hire all the lobbyists in Washington. We are  having that right now with an organization in another subject area. But  at that time, that was 2005, and at that time, the following lobbyists  had been hired by Morocco: the Livingston Group, Tew Cardenas, Edelman  public relations, Miller & Chevalier, Gabriel and company, Robert  Holley, and Whiton Case. Those are seven lobbyists that were hired by  Morocco.   And now, that hasn't changed. Today, right now, they are represented  by JPC Strategies, Third Circle, and Neale Creek, and average over $1  million each year.   So all these lobbyists in Washington have been hired by Morocco. And  whom do the Western Saharans have to lift up their voices? They have no  one--no one at all.   So, given my personal history, you can forgive me for being shocked  and deeply saddened at having their future so harshly stolen from them  after they spent three generations waiting for the promise of a  referendum for self-determination.   I have to say this. I am quite sure that our President was not even  aware of that. He is doing the right thing in terms of the accords that  we are doing in that part of the world, bringing the Arabs and the Jews  together. It is a good thing. But this is an issue that should never  have come up or been a part of it, and I am quite sure that he was not  aware of this.   So now, seeing the reactions around the world, it is clear that there  is kind of a silver lining. I look at this as an opportunity. It is an  issue that people are worn out on. We tried and tried and tried  everything we could think of. And just from my coming to the floor 6  [[Page S7532]]  days ago, all these things have happened since that time. People have a  new hope.   And remember, the conflict in Western Sahara is what we used to call  a frozen, forgotten conflict. That has a finality to it. There is  something about a ``frozen conflict,'' you know--that nothing more is  going to happen. They called it a frozen conflict and made it easy for  the rest of the world to let the status quo continue, leaving the  Western Saharan people in limbo, waiting for a referendum that had been  promised way back in 1966.   The forgotten conflict allowed Morocco to continue encroaching and  getting away with human rights abuses like the one I just described-- torturing that young lady for 4 years, causing her to go blind. So  those were the unintended consequences of this arrangement that was  made with Morocco.   So it has never been so clear to the international community. I have  never seen the international community so united. Everybody is on our  side on this thing--the side that we have had and will return to for  some 30 years. The African Union said--this is just since the last 6  days: ``The position of the African Union remains unchanged, in  conformity with relevant AU''--that is the African Union--``and United  Nations resolutions.''   On the United Nations: ``The United Nations said Thursday its  position was `unchanged' on the disputed Western Sahara region after  the United States recognized Morocco's sovereignty there.''   That is the United Nations coming back again.   In a news article, the European Union indicated last Thursday that  ``the status of Western Sahara has not been determined and must be  negotiated in a process led by the United Nations, after the President  of the United States, Donald Trump, has recognized the Moroccan  sovereignty.''   So the European Union is in full agreement with what we are about to  try to do again.   The United Kingdom said: ``Our position on the status of Western  Sahara remains unchanged.''   It didn't change them a bit what we did here in the United States.   Algeria. Algeria is right next door. I meant to bring a map down here  to familiarize everyone with the area that we are talking about.  Algeria said: ``The conflict of Western Sahara is a question of  decolonization which can only be resolved through the application of  the international law and the well-established charter of the United  Nations and the African Union in this matter, which provides for the  authentic exercise by the Sahrawi people of their inalienable right to  self-determination and independence.''   That is Algeria. And, by the way, every one of the 52 nations in  Africa is in full agreement with what we are talking about right now.   And James Baker hasn't gone away. This is way back in the first Bush  administration. He was Secretary of State. This is his statement just  the other day--yesterday, it was. He said:         While I strongly support the Abraham Accords, the proper       way to implement them was the way it was done with the UAE,       Bahrain and Sudan, and not by cynically trading off the self-      determination rights of the people of Western Sahara. I agree       with Senator James Inhofe--    That is me--       when he characterized this development as ``shocking and       deeply disappointing.'' It would appear that the United       States of America, which was founded first and foremost on       the principle of self-determination, has walked away from       that principle regarding the people of Western Sahara. This       is very regrettable.    That is James Baker.   Even more, these are other opinions. These are opinion pieces. This  came out, and I just read them this morning.   David Keene--we all remember David Keene. He was with the Washington  Times. He was with the American Conservative Union and with the NRA.  His quote was this:         The United States has sometimes quite properly, given our       interests, stayed out of controversies like this, but one is       hard pressed to find another situation in which we have       virtually announced that justice doesn't matter and that       those like the Western Saharans who have sought their rights       peacefully rather than [by way] . . . [of] terrorism and . .       . [guns] are fools.   John Bolton, in Foreign Policy, said:         [T]he Polisario is at a crucial juncture. It would be fully       justified if it chooses to return to the battlefield, but       much depends on the positions of Algeria, Mauritania and       others--and what resources are available.    Now, that gets back to the question of resources. We have unlimited  resources by the very wealthy nation--one of the wealthiest nations in  the world, Morocco.   Stephen Zunes--I got to know him a long time ago. He is a scholar  with the University of San Francisco. He specializes in this area. This  is his quote just in the last 2 days:         Morocco's claim on Western Sahara is rejected by the United       Nations, the World Court, the African Union and a broad       consensus of international legal scholars that consider the       region a non-self-governing territory that must be allowed an       act of self-determination. This is why no country had       formally recognized Morocco's takeover--until now.    This is still Stephen Zunes. He said: ``Human Rights Watch, Amnesty  International and other reputable human rights groups have documented  widespread suppression of peaceful, pro-independence activists by  Moroccan occupation forces, including torture, beatings, detention  without trial and extrajudicial killings.   Still quoting the scholar, Stephen Zunes: ``Since the Polisario''-- Polisario, of course, are those fighting for their freedom and for  their reclamation. ``Since the Polisario proclaimed the establishment  of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic in 1976, 84 countries have  recognized Western Sahara as an independent state.''   Everybody agrees with this. It is one of the few things in foreign  policy where there is no opposition. They all agree with that self- determination for the Western Sahara people.   I am so saddened by the betrayal toward the people of Western Sahara  for unilaterally recognizing Morocco's claim. Yet I am seeing the  unexpected results from the proclamation.   If highlighting the injustice of these people pushes the rest of the  world to finally get them the referendum they deserve, it may be worth  it, and that is what I am seeing right now. I remember so well--it has  now been some three or four generations of Western Saharans and the  little kids you see in the camps, in the refugee camps, living under  conditions that we can't even imagine in this country, but they are  happy little kids. They carry around a sign. I don't have the  pronunciation in their language, but it says: ``We will fight till we  get back our homes.'' These are little kids. They all know--the fourth  generation of those who have been abandoned.   So I remember--and I called, and I found out--what was the year? Was  it 2007? Yes, in 2007, Mark Powers and I--he has been with me on a lot  of things in Africa that we have been interested in. He and I met with  all of the elected leaders of the Western Saharans in a room that is  out in the desert. We actually heard all their stories. They are all  Muslims out there, and we all prayed together. We prayed to the Lord  for mercy in this case. And I think that maybe it is closer than we  thought it was.   That is what is happening right now. It is something that--we have to  move back to our original position that we have held since 1966 in  supporting people--the right for a referendum of self-determination.   With that, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
