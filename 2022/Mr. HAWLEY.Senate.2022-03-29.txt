 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I thank the  Senator from Virginia for accommodating me here and allowing me to come  to the floor, and I thank him for his remarks. I only got to hear the  second half of his remarks, but I thank him for his remarks and am sure  that he is in earnest about this nomination.   Let me tell you why I am here, and I will be brief. I know we have a  vote that is about to kick off. But let me tell you what I am in  earnest about.   The crisis in Afghanistan--the attack at Abbey Gate this past August  that cost 13 American servicemembers, including 1 from my home State,  from the State of Missouri, their lives--is a catastrophe unparalleled  in our foreign policy in my lifetime. It is my firm conviction and it  is also a promise that I made to the family of the fallen marine from  my State that we should do--this Senate should perform its oversight  functions related to the catastrophic withdrawal from Afghanistan and  in particular the events leading up to that attack at Abbey Gate that  resulted in the deaths of those servicemembers and the deaths of  hundreds, I am afraid--hundreds--of civilians and many hundreds of  other Americans left behind.   I have come to this floor before many times now to ask the Senate to  hold accountable those who planned and led or failed to lead, in some  instances, this operation leading to the attack at Abbey Gate, leading  to that catastrophic loss of life, and leading, I am afraid, to the  disastrous turn in our foreign policy, the effects of which we continue  to feel.   So it is my humble but earnest request that the Senate perform its  basic oversight functions, and, very briefly, let me mention one.   U.S. Central Command ordered a report of the events leading up to the  Abbey Gate attack that we learned of in February. February 8, I  believe, we learned that that report had been completed. It is several  thousand pages long. I have the barest summary of it here.   My staff and I have been through all of it, the thousands of pages.  They had over 169 interviews that U.S. Central Command conducted,  again, to try to understand how we got to this crisis point leading up  to and including Abbey Gate.   We have not had a single hearing in the U.S. Senate Armed Services  Committee on this report. Now, I applaud Central Command for carrying  out the report, for ordering it, for putting it together, but we should  be learning what we can and holding accountable those who need to be  held accountable. Who has been fired? No one. Who has been relieved of  duty? No one. And if you read the report--and I commend it to my  colleagues. If you read the report, you will see individual after  individual, commanders on the ground warning that we are not prepared,  that the administration was not prepared to get civilians to safety in  Kabul; warning that the planning was not adequate; warning that there  were dangers.    So, Mr. President, I ask again that the committee do its basic  oversight job, perform its basic function, hold a hearing on this  report, hold accountable those who failed in that catastrophic  withdrawal from Afghanistan. Until that time, I am going to continue to  ask that the Senate observe regular order in leadership positions in  the Department of Defense.   And for those reasons, I object.    Madam President, had there been a recorded vote, I would  have voted no on the confirmation of Executive Calendar No. 789,  Mallory A. Stewart, of the District of Columbia, to be an Assistant  Secretary of State.                            ____________________
