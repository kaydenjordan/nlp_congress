 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Energy and  Commerce Committee and the chair of the Health Subcommittee for this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember my friend Artie. Artie and I  were friends from the time we were in third grade in Chicago, and we  stayed in touch all the many, many years. I was pretty devastated when  he told me that he had ALS.   A couple of years ago Artie made the decision, because ALS is a  really cruel disease, to take his own life, to set the date so that he  would just make the decision himself and not suffer so horribly to the  bitter end, because at that time he saw no hope.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of my constituent, Brian Wallach  and his wife, Sandra, who saw that there was hope in the future. They  would fight in order to get legislation that would make access to what  is promising therapies right now, therapies that weren't available or  even on the horizon to Artie.   I am so proud to join with colleagues across the aisle to say that we  can provide that hope, that opportunity to people who are facing what  has been a death sentence, and that we can see a future that is bright  for now the ALS victims.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank I AM ALS, the organization, and many of  the organizations that have been fighting for this. The advocates have  done a great job to bring this to our attention and bring this day  about and get over 300 cosponsors to this legislation. I am proud to be  among them.
