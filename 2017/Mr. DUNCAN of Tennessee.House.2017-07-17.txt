 Mr. Speaker, thank you for this opportunity  to speak, and thank you, Congressman Collins, for your leadership and  persistence on this critical issue.   Community pharmacies are so important to our Districts. There is  nothing like walking into your local pharmacy, and the pharmacist knows  you by name. He knows your medical history. He knows what you need. He  knows you.   As one community pharmacist described, ``People call me all hours of  the day and night. They know where I live, and they come to my house if  they need me.''   These local pharmacies are in danger of disappearing across the  Nation. Why? Because PBMs are running them out of business.   Pharmacy Benefits Managers, or PBMs, claim to act as middlemen and  help pharmacies and manufacturers find the best deals for their  patients. It's a great idea.   Despite these PBMs' promises, I have heard from more and more  pharmacy owners in my District who say that many PBMs are in reality  ripping them off with various unethical tricks of their trade.   PBMs are often dictating the prices charged by manufacturers and  pharmacists or insurance plans. PBMs are a key problem behind drug  price inflation.   One critical aspect of their strategy is gag orders that they impose  on pharmacists and manufacturers in contracts, thereby silencing  dissenters under threat of being excluded from networks or formularies  . . . in other words, under threat of being blocked from buying and  selling in the drug market altogether.   Often, PBMs use what they call clawbacks. The outright cost of a drug  might only be $40, but the patient might have to pay double or more  than that price through their insurance.   Too many times, pharmacists have to decide between two choices:  either violate their consciences by watching often low-income patients  pay exorbitant prices--or tell the patients to buy the drug outright,  saving them money.   But the second choice comes with a threat . . . because if a  pharmacist informs her patients about how to save money, she is  violating her contractual gag order imposed by PBMs.   A pharmacy consultant recently interviewed by the LA Times accurately  described PBMs like this--``The PBMs are sitting at the center of a big  black box. They're the only ones who have knowledge of all the moving  pieces.''   But awareness of PBMs' deceitful practices is increasing. More and  more pharmacists and manufacturers are speaking up and exposing PBMs.   One endocrinologist and professor of medicine at the University of  Washington recently said, ``It's becoming very, very common to see  patients intentionally withholding their insulin.'' Doing so can be  deadly, but patients are often facing $300 per vial and need two vials  a week.   There are three PBMs that control the market: ExpressScripts,  OptumRx, and CVS Caremark. These three PBMs rake in over $200 billion a  year and are responsible for 290 million Americans through their  contracts with both private insurers and government programs like  Medicare.   CMS, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, is ``wising up''  to PBMs. In June, CMS proposed a new guideline for Medicare Part D  PBMs. If finalized, this guidance will address PBMs' common practice of  imposing retroactive fees.  [[Page H5917]]    One of the pharmacists in my District told me these retroactive fees,  known as DIR fees, can cost him tens of thousands of dollars months  after the claims have been processed with no clarification, no  explanation, no reasoning from the PBM.   No business or even individual can plan a budget, if months later  they may be forced to pay thousands of dollars more for something they  thought they had already paid for.   According to one expert and pharmacy owner in my District, he has  seen three causes for recent increases in prescription drugs:   (1) FDA involvement, including requiring ``modern clinical trials''  of old drugs that have worked for decades;   (2) drug manufacturers' needlessly hiking the price of generic drugs;   (3) PBMs charging ridiculous prices for drugs and pocketing the  profits.   According to my constituent, PBMs are the main culprit of the three.   A number of lawsuits are being filed against PBMs, including one  class action lawsuit. More and more people are realizing what one  lawyer said recently: ``We describe this as basically a massive  fraud.''   We need to address artificially high drug prices right away. A good  place to start is PBMs and their ``massive fraud.''   As one small town pharmacist said, ``. . . The pharmacy benefit  managers . . . set rates I cannot control. I can complain, but it does  no good whatsoever. And in a town of 3,000, I cannot make it up on  volume.''   PBMs must be more transparent in their operations, so they can be  held to their promises and to the laws.   PBMs must not be able to get away any longer with conducting business  with their unethical, at best, methods.   In short, PBMs must be held accountable for their roles in the  Nation's drug price crisis.                            ____________________
