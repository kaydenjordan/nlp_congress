 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I rise today to discuss what is on so many  Americans' minds today and the last couple of days--President Trump's  recent trip to Europe, his meeting with Vladimir Putin, and his  comments about Russia's interference in our elections.   So many Pennsylvanians--and I am sure this is true in every other  State--have called or written to our office this week in complete  disbelief asking: What is next? Where do we go from here?   These are good questions. They are critically important questions.   This President's views on Russia's past actions and the way forward  have seemed to change every day this week.   Rather than focus on the news cycle following the Helsinki summit, I  want to take a minute to review where things stood before--before--the  President went to Europe.   Relations between the United States and Russia have been  deteriorating for some time. We know that. The Russian Federation is  clearly and unequivocally our adversary. Vladimir Putin envisions a  world more closely resembling the Cold War era, certainly, than  compared to today's realities, and he works toward a resurgence of  Russian power and influence every day.   Just take a few examples. Russia attacked, annexed, and continues to  illegally occupy Crimea. Russian-backed forces continue to violate  cease-fire agreements in Ukraine and destabilize other parts of that  country, preventing the Ukrainian people from fulfilling their dream of  a secure and prosperous nation.   Russia is backing and enabling the murderous Assad regime in Syria.  The conflict has emboldened terrorist groups, had dramatic humanitarian  impacts, and has threatened the region's stability. As many as a half  million people have been killed, and half the country has been  displaced.   Just imagine if half of our population, say 150 million people, were  displaced from their homes, sometimes to another part of the country  and sometimes to a completely different country. That is the reality in  Syria since  [[Page S5097]]  2011, and Russia has prolonged and exacerbated the Syrian people's  suffering for its own power projection.   No. 4, Russia is also developing a stronger relationship with the  Iranian regime and is reportedly considering arms sales and boosting  their economic relationship. This threatens not only our national  security interests in the Middle East but also those security interests  of our staunchest ally, Israel.   Finally, Russia continues to have a substantial nuclear arsenal. It  has violated the INF Treaty, and according to the Defense Department,  is developing low-yield, nonstrategic nuclear weapons that could  threaten our allies and partners.   Russia uses any number of tools, from manipulation of the energy  supply to arms sales, to loans and aid to promote its brand of corrupt  authoritarian governance around the world. It also employs nefarious  means like hacking, espionage, and sowing false information to meddle  in the most fundamental parts of our great democracy--our elections  and, of course, those of other countries.   I don't think it is wrong for a United States President to meet with  a hostile foreign leader. That is part of the job.   What is dead wrong is to sit across from a hostile foreign leader,  one on one, with no notes, no staff, and to fail completely-- completely--at your core mission, your job, which is protecting the  national security interests of the American people.   To many people, it might seem odd to be focused on who was or wasn't  in the room or whether any notes were taken, but without them, there is  absolutely no accountability for what was said. We hear that the  Russian military--let me say that again--the Russian military is ready  to start implementing the agreements reached between President Trump  and Vladimir Putin in that room.   We have to ask the President of the United States, what agreements?  What did you agree to in that room? What did the leader of our Nation  agree to that the Russian military is so eager to start implementing?   Further, there seems to have been some discussion between President  Trump and Vladimir Putin about the Russian Government's interest in  interrogating U.S. citizens, like former Ambassador to Russia Michael  McFaul. Yesterday, we heard the White House say the President was  giving that absurd proposal serious consideration. Of course Putin  wants to question Ambassador McFaul. He is an expert on Russia who  served our country honorably as Ambassador and as a public servant. He  stood up to Russian aggression and promoted U.S. national security  interests, especially when they contradicted Moscow's agenda.   The idea that we would entertain handing over an American citizen to  an authoritarian Russian Government with no rule of law and no history  of treating people fairly--and, of course, with a history of  interrogating and torturing political opponents--that is not only  insulting to our values, it is dangerous and it is wrong. That is not  America. No official in our government--of any branch of government-- should support that. If the administration tries it, the Congress  should take every effort to stop them from doing that.   The Russian threat is serious and persistent. It isn't solved by one  meeting and a press conference. It will take sustained commitment from  the national security professionals across our government, and it will  take real vision and leadership from the President and his Cabinet. I  do not object to meeting with an adversary, nor does anyone. That is  part of the job of being President. Instead, what I am concerned about,  what a lot of Americans are concerned about, is this President's  conduct during and after that meeting, especially his unwillingness to  say without reservation or caveat that Russia was responsible for  hacking our elections in 2016 and continues to meddle in our democratic  process. This isn't a political judgment; it is the judgment of our  intelligence and law enforcement experts, and it led to the indictment  of 12 Russian military intelligence hackers this past Friday.   Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats reaffirmed this judgment  just this week, saying:         The role of the Intelligence Community is to provide the       best information and fact-based assessments possible for the       President and policymakers. We have been clear in our       assessments of Russian meddling in the 2016 election and       their ongoing, pervasive efforts to undermine our democracy,       and we will continue to provide unvarnished and objective       intelligence in support of our national security.    So said the Director of National Intelligence, Dan Coats.   Why can't the President say this and say it repeatedly, that he  agrees with their assessment and is working to stop Russia from doing  it again?   My constituents, like so many Americans, were right to ask: Where do  we go from here? There is no playbook for this scenario.   I believe we must act in a bipartisan fashion to make clear to Russia  that the U.S. Congress will not stand for continued interference in our  elections and will work to counter them on other fronts.   First, we should enact new legislation to levy sanctions on Russian  entities responsible for this malicious behavior and demand the  administration fully implement legislation that was passed with an  overwhelming bipartisan majority last year. No. 2, we must pass  legislation to protect the special counsel and to shine a bright light  on the dark money in politics. No. 3, we must fully fund State and  municipal efforts to shore up our electoral systems. No. 4, we must  speak out in support of our alliances. Many of our closest  international partners are right on the frontlines of Russia's  destabilizing actions. Finally, we should insist that the  administration answer the questions so many of us have about what  happened in that room in Helsinki and what they plan to do to counter  Russia and protect our national security interests.   We are in uncharted waters in terms of the actions of the President.  His actions the last 2 weeks have made us less safe. I will say it  again--less safe. He must take decisive action to guarantee our  security by confronting malign Russian aggression against the United  States and our NATO allies and partners. At the same time, Congress,  both parties, both Houses, must act to protect our security and make it  clear to the President that this branch of government will continue to  discharge its constitutional duties.   I yield the floor.
