 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bipartisan  bill to recognize today as National Stillbirth Prevention Day. There  are 21,000 babies stillborn in the U.S. each year, and the way I see  it, that is 21,000 too many.   One in four stillbirths are preventable. Every baby lost to  stillbirth is a heartbreak that we can prevent, but amidst this grief,  there is hope. I am humbled to be joined today by women who have  endured stillbirths. These women are some of the strongest people I  have ever met. Out of their pain, they have found a purpose: preventing  stillbirth and ensuring expecting moms have healthy pregnancies and  healthy babies.   The stillbirth rate in the U.S. is unacceptably high. By leveraging  Federal resources for evidence-based care, research, and education, we  will save lives and save babies. We can and we must do more for moms  and their babies, and together we can end the tragedy of stillbirth.                            ____________________
