 Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to  the amendment, although I am not opposed to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for offering  the amendment.   Ubiquitous commercial data collection and bulk data sales represent a  privacy concern for all Americans. Companies and governments alike have  access to once unimaginable amounts of user data through commercial  channels. This development and the Fourth Amendment questions that come  with it deserve full consideration.   I look forward to working with the gentleman on this amendment to  ensure that these issues are addressed in a manner that does not unduly  burden the Department of Defense relative to the rest of the Federal  Government while ensuring its operational needs are met.   I think Congress will spend a substantial amount of time on the  privacy concerns addressed by this amendment in the coming months, and  I welcome that discussion.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  0945     Mr. Chair, pursuant to House Resolution 583, I  offer amendments en bloc.    Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman  from Iowa (Mr. Nunn), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr.  Mike Garcia), my friend.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Van Orden), an outstanding freshman.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Jackson), my friend.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Molinaro), my friend.    Mr. Chair, we have no further speakers if the  gentleman would like to close, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Mr. Chair, I thank our bipartisan HASC staff for their tremendous  work. As I talked about yesterday, our committee staff has worked for  monthslong hours in a very bipartisan fashion to get us where we are  today.   I also thank everyone from the Office of the Legislative Counsel, the  Congressional Budget Office, the Parliamentarian's Office, the Clerk,  the floor staff, the Rules Committee, and the leadership on both sides  of the aisle.   I especially thank my friend, Ranking Member Smith, for his hard work  and assistance. As a longtime former chairman of this committee, he  gets the ebbs and flows of this process and has been a very helpful  partner in helping me lead this committee.   Mr. Chairman, this is a good bill.   I will address this to my Conference: There is absolutely no reason  why any Republican should vote against the bill. It will enhance the  congressional oversight of the DOD. It will improve the quality of life  for our servicemembers and their families. It will help build the  ready, capable, and lethal fighting force we need to deter the Chinese  Communist Party and other adversaries.   Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to support the bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
