 Mr. Chair, I rise today to join my colleagues from the  Education and Labor Committee in speaking in support of the Protecting  the Right to Organize Act--the PRO Act.   The PRO Act is necessary for America's workers because the economy is  simply NOT working for millions of Americans who are struggling to get  by while corporate profits are soaring.   We know now, thanks to a study from Princeton University, that unions  have consistently provided workers with a 10- to 20-percent wage boost  over their non-union counterparts. And the benefits pervade race and  gender lines.   People of color in unions make five times more than people of color  who are NOT in unions. Women union members see the gender pay gap  nearly eliminated.   Unions across our country are fighting to secure better working  conditions and better wages for their members.   In my hometown of Las Vegas, the Culinary Union represents 60,000-- those are 60,000 people who already benefit immensely from fair wages,  job security, and good health benefits.   But we can expand these benefits to ALL Americans.   We must protect the mission and legacy of organizations like the  Culinary Union by passing the PRO Act, and strengthen workers' power to  stand together and negotiate for higher wages, better benefits, and  safer working conditions.
