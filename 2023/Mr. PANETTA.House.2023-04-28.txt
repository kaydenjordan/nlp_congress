 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution  because American solar companies need the delay on solar tariffs so  that they can keep up with the American demand for clean energy.   If we repeal this delay with this CRA, the American solar industry  could be hit with more than $1 billion--with a b, billion--in  retroactive duties, taxes that would cause cancellations and supply  chain issues, stall solar deployment, and set us back on our clean  energy goals.   Look, we have already seen, just with the threat of these tariffs, a  30 percent decrease in solar deployment last year. Of course, we want  to strategically decouple from China, I believe especially with their  solar pieces, parts, and equipment. However, American solar companies  need more time to adapt, adjust, and reduce Chinese inputs in solar  panels.   I also realize that we need to do more to bolster our domestic solar  manufacturing, but that is why we recently made significant investments  for domestic credits. However, if we allow these retroactive tariffs to  take place now, it would deprive our solar industry of the incentive to  invest in our manufacturing projects at home.   That is why we need this delay, and that is why this delay was the  right call, not just by this administration but it is also the right  call so the American solar industry can catch up to our domestic  demands, so Americans can continue to speed up their solar deployment,  and America can continue to step up when it comes to the continued  success of our economy and the future of our sustainability.   Mr. Speaker, that is why I urge a ``no'' vote on this CRA.
