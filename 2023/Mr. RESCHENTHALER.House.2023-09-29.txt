 Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 741 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 741         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 5525) making       continuing appropriations for fiscal year 2024, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The amendments printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution shall be       considered as adopted.        The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill, as amended,       are waived. The previous question shall be considered as       ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any further amendment       thereto to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Appropriations or their respective designees; and (2) one       motion to recommit.        Sec. 2. Upon passage of H.R. 5525 the title of such bill is       amended to read as follows: ``Reducing spending, securing the       border, and for other purposes.''.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I  yield the customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), my good friend, pending which I yield  myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this  resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  [[Page H4862]]  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and in support of the  underlying legislation. House Resolution 741 provides for consideration  of H.R. 5525, the Spending Reduction and Border Security Act, under a  closed rule, with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Appropriations or their respective designees, and provides one motion  to recommit.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the underlying legislation,  which fully funds programs for our Nation's veterans, servicemembers,  and the Department of Homeland Security while reducing other  discretionary spending.   Additionally, H.R. 5525 secures our southern border by resuming  construction of the wall, increases the number of Border Patrol agents,  and reforms our asylum laws to disincentivize mass illegal immigration.   Under the President's disastrous immigration policies, over 7 million  illegal immigrants have entered our country, while nearly 50,000 pounds  of fentanyl have flooded across our border. That is enough to kill  every single person on the entire planet. This crisis must end. It will  only end through efforts of House Republicans.   Finally, this legislation includes an important provision authorized  by the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), which establishes a  bipartisan fiscal commission that addresses our out-of-control debt.  While the Senate figures out what type of clothes to wear, House  Republicans have put forth a plan which averts a government shutdown,  restores fiscal responsibility, and addresses the Biden border crisis.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, if my friend from Massachusetts is  worried about energy prices in Boston, there is an easy solution. You  can import liquefied natural gas from Pennsylvania, which is cheap and  abundant.   Unfortunately, Democrats in New England and New York have refused to  build the Constitution Pipeline, which would actually bring LNG into  New England. Instead, people in Boston are paying higher prices for the  petroleum that is coming in from tankers from--guess where--Russia.  Again, just complete circular logic from my friends across the aisle.   Now, let's talk about not only the high energy prices that the middle  and working class have to pay because of Democratic policies but also  how real wages are down.   Inflation-adjusted average hourly wages were $11.39 when Biden took  office. They are now at $11.04, meaning that Americans have seen a 3.1  percent pay cut under Biden. You might think that it is only 3.1  percent, but let's talk about inflation.   Prices have risen 17.4 percent since President Biden took office.  That is roughly a 20 percent cut, so who is really working for the  middle class and looking out for the working class? It is not President  Biden.   You also have another crisis, which is totally ignored, and that is  the immigration crisis. Before I yield to my good friend from New York,  let's just talk about New York.   In New York, the immigration crisis has led to over 100,000 migrant  arrivals in 2022, which the mayor says is destroying the city. New York  City Mayor Eric Adams said: ``We are about to experience a financial  tsunami that I don't think the city has ever experienced.''   The mayor also said: ``The national government has turned its back on  New York City.''   Well, Mayor, it is not the national government that turned its back  on you. It is the Democratic President and the Democrats in Congress.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Lawler).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentleman from New York.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Lawler), for the purpose of rebuttal.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Spartz), my good friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Gaetz).    Mr. Speaker, just remember that the Senate has  passed zero appropriations bills.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Mrs.  Lesko).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Last week, our national debt reached a record high of--wait for it-- $33 trillion. This is a result of the White House and a result of the  previous Democrat-controlled Congress spending trillions of dollars  outside the appropriations process.   Let's remember, under Democratic control, we saw the highest  inflation in over 40 years, the highest interest rates in over 20  years, and a 17 percent increase in consumer prices. That is why this  underlying legislation establishes a bipartisan fiscal commission to  get our Nation on the right course.   This is just one of the many manufactured crises caused by Democrats'  far-left policies. Look at our southern border. At the southern border,  President Biden's immigration policies caused a flood of illegal  immigrants into our Nation and illicit fentanyl into our communities.   Just last week, our Nation set an all-time record for illegal  crossings in a single year. Over 25,000 pounds of fentanyl have also  been trafficked across our southern border this year. To put that into  perspective, this is enough to kill every single American citizen.   Sadly, too many towns across my home State of Pennsylvania have felt  the consequences of the Democrats' pro-open border agenda. In  Pennsylvania alone, there were over 5,000 reported overdose deaths in  2022. Not only is the White House doing nothing to address this crisis,  but the Democrats' pro-crime agenda actually encourages it.   If you doubt me on that, let's just take a look at what happened in  Pittsburgh recently. In Pittsburgh, law enforcement caught a drug  trafficker with $2 million worth of fentanyl. To put that into  perspective, that is enough to kill 35 percent of the population in  Pennsylvania. Then, to make matters worse, a far-left, radical judge  released that criminal on the streets the very next day, and he has  since fled the State.   This is absolutely ridiculous. House Republicans are the only leaders  in Washington willing to do something about this. Thanks to Republicans  and our Commitment to America, the underlying legislation will reduce  our exploding national debt, avert a government shutdown, and secure  our southern border.   For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the  previous question and ``yes'' on the rule.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:    An Amendment to H. Res. 741 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 3. Upon receipt of a message from the Senate       transmitting H.R. 3935 with a Senate Amendment or amendments       thereto, a single motion that the House concur in the Senate       amendment or amendments may be called up as a privileged       question, without intervention of any point of order, by the       chair or ranking minority member of the Committee on       Appropriations or their respective designees. The Senate       amendment or amendments and the motion shall be considered as       read. The motion shall be debatable for one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Appropriations or their respective       designees. The previous question shall be considered as       ordered on the motion to its adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of the motion.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time,  and I move the previous question on the resolution.
