 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 221 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 221         Resolved, That the requirement of clause 6(a) of rule XIII       for a two-thirds vote to consider a report from the Committee       on Rules on the same day it is presented to the House is       waived with respect to any resolution reported through the       legislative day of March 27, 2017.        Sec. 2.  It shall be in order at any time through the       calendar day of March 26, 2017, for the Speaker to entertain       motions that the House suspend the rules as though under       clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or his designee shall       consult with the Minority Leader or her designee on the       designation of any matter for consideration pursuant to this       section.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  McGovern), my dear friend, pending which I yield myself such time as I  may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded  is for the purpose of debate only.   Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met for some 13 hours,  maybe a little bit more, where we were tasked with the opportunity to  bring forth from the Republican Conference the new bill that is to  replace the Affordable Care Act. That discussion involved us taking  testimony from the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Kevin  Brady; the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Greg Walden;  and the chairman of the Budget Committee, Mrs. Black. It also involved  three other ranking members for those committees. They assembled up in  the Rules Committee.   We had a very vigorous and open debate about the bill, about the  effects of the bill, about the things which were occurring within the  Republican majority dealing with the United States Senate and dealing  with the President of the United States. All three are necessary to  agree upon a bill if we are to sign it into law.   There was a vigorous demand from Democrats to know more information,  and I believe I forthrightly attempted to answer those questions. We  did not have all the pieces of the puzzle together. We recognized that  by the evening hour. So by 11 p.m. last night, upon my consultation  with Ranking Member McGovern, I made a decision that we would not stay  up during the evening, we would ask that we would come back today. So  we did not actually complete our work last night.   I am here today because last night the Rules Committee issued a rule  that would be a same-day rule. The issues really don't change. The  facts of the case really don't change. Information is necessary for us  to make an informed decision. That is a change.   I have told the gentleman, Mr. McGovern. I have told the gentlewoman,  the former Speaker, the leader of the Democrat Party, Ms. Pelosi. I  have told Mr. Hoyer in a direct dialogue that we had that I would do my  best to make sure that we answer the questions that would be necessary.  The gentleman, Mr. McGovern, who very ably represents his party,  understood that I did not have all the answers that I needed.   So we are here today with the opportunity to say we are going to do a  same-day rule. We are going to try to pass this rule. We are going to  try to explain what we are doing. We are going to allow my team, our  Republican Conference, to get back together today because they, too,  want to know what is the final deal.   That is what my conference is doing right now. They are in this  building, several hundred Members of Congress, talking, debating,  understanding, listening, compromising, yes, on a way that we can  approach a chance to change what we see as one of the most devastating  pieces of legislation to the economy, to the healthcare system, and,  quite honestly, to the standing of America as the greatest country in  the world. We think we have to make changes.   But today we are here right now to say that we don't have all those  answers. A complete agreement was not available by the time I chose to  end the matter last night in the Rules Committee. So rather than  staying up all night, we are here today. We will be back here today.  This is not the debate about the bill. More information is needed. An  agreement is needed from my party. And when we reach that agreement, I  will then come back.   But make no mistake about it, Mr. Speaker, my party intends to bring  forth an agreed-to bill that we will be able to show to the American  people, and we will own it. We are very capable of saying that we  believe that market forces, we believe that free right of individuals,  we believe that free physicians and opportunities exist and abound, and  we will bring that to the floor, and we will openly debate it.   Much is being said about a Congressional Budget Office report that  has caused much fear. Unrightly? No, I can't say that. But it is  certainly explainable.   Mr. Speaker, I will start right now. The bottom line is that there  are some 30 million people who are uninsured in the United States of  America, 30 million people who did not find a home or chose not to take  a government-provided available system that is called the Affordable  Care Act. Even more people included within that are paying a penalty of  several thousand dollars rather than taking that healthcare system,  that availability. So we believe the right thing to do is not to force  anybody, not to have mandates, not to penalize people, but, rather, to  make available to them opportunities where it is their decision about  what they would do.   The corresponding facts of the case are real simple. The  Congressional Budget Office said: Fine, if you don't force people to do  it, then some 24 million people won't do it within the next 7 years.  [[Page H2354]]    Well, there are 30 million people today that do not have it and not  taking it. So to go from 30 million to 24 million will be a very  interesting task for us to understand.   Mr. Speaker, no freedom is free. But if we engage in telling the  American people that Washington, D.C., knows better than they do, then  that is a false promise--is a false promise that our friends, the  Democrats, tried and actually failed at.   So Republicans, in order to put together their plan--yes, even with  the consequences of a ``CBO report that say there will be 24 million  people who are uninsured,'' that is probably right, because they chose  not to accept what would be an equal opportunity for them to take what  might be called a tax credit that equals some $8,000 for a family of  four, allowing them straight up to purchase their own health care for  their family. But if they choose not to do it, that is their business.   Mr. Speaker, one of my attributes is I come from Dallas, Texas. And  Dallas, Texas, for all the great things that we have about us, we think  that some of the great things come from the way we believe. We deeply  believe we are in some ways a very open city. We have many different  thought processes, many people, but we respect each other and don't try  to tell each other what to do. It creates a flourishing environment  about ourselves where, when we get in trouble, we stick together; when  we see trouble, we ban together. But we tend not to tell each other  what to do in our own lives. That is one thing that I think makes us a  little bit different. We do not count on government to do the things  that we should do for ourselves.    That is part of the freedom model that I buy off on and part of what  we are offering--the Republican Party--today for the American people  rather than mandates, dictates, fines, the IRS and all sorts of other  government organizations that we could throw in a person's way simply  to tell them what to do. We reject that notion. We will, as quickly as  possible, bring about a bill that we can explain, that we will own, and  that we will pass.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the chance for us to be here today means that a lot of  people are going to have a lot of opinions, and I appreciate the  gentleman having an opinion. He knows what we are doing. So do the  American people.   The American people are watching TV, and they are seeing where  Republicans are huddling together and pushing this activity of health  care, debating ideas right, really, before the American people, really,  hundreds of TV shows.   I have been on 15 or 20 myself where I am saying that the Republican  replacement or repeal of ObamaCare is something we are taking our time  to discuss. We are taking our time to make sure our colleagues  understand it. We are taking time to be thoughtful. Otherwise, we would  have just rushed it through.   In fact, we took some 13 hours last night, yesterday, at the Rules  Committee to do exactly that. Ms. Pelosi spent 3 hours before the Rules  Committee, essentially talking about things that--we see things  differently. She thinks she sees things differently than we do, and  that is okay. It gave her a chance to have a debate opportunity. This  is what this is all about. It does not bother me at all.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, we want Members to have a chance to have  their thoughts and ideas on the record, to take their time to be  thoughtful about what we are doing. And it does matter.   Mr. Speaker, at this time I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Collinsville, Illinois (Mr. Shimkus), a gentleman whom I came to  Congress with in the 105th Congress. The gentleman is from the 15th  District of Illinois and served our country as a veteran. He was a West  Point graduate, and he is a really good guy.   (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I am delighted that the distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Mrs.  Lowey) came down. She, not unlike many of those in her party, are  intensely interested in making sure that the American people are going  to get the opportunity to have something that I have always said is  equal to or better than.   The bottom line is that families on ObamaCare, or the Affordable Care  Act, today--and that includes almost every single Member of Congress,  including myself and my family--did not get what we were told would  happen. Much of the Affordable Care Act was not even decided and  developed until after the bill was put together, and we knew that ahead  of time. They told us it is going to take a couple of years for us to  put this together. Right now, here, today, only about 24 out of 100  physicians across this country even accept ObamaCare.   The Republican plan is not simple, but it is easy to understand, and  that is this: We allow every single person to stay on ObamaCare 2017,  2018, and 2019. That is undeniably in the bill, and they know that.   We are allowing every single American that does not, today, receive  the tax benefit, the benefit that goes back to World War II, an untaxed  benefit by employers--we are allowing every single American family to  be able to receive a tax credit. You cannot use both. You cannot  double-dip into another system. But we are allowing every single one of  those families that, today, was completely excluded or chose not to  take ObamaCare to receive a tax credit.   That tax credit for families is important because, today, they are  paying after-tax dollars if they choose to get health care. And  tomorrow what we will do is allow up to $8,000 for a family of four-- that is $8,000 for a tax credit for a family--effective in November of  a year to be able to, before they purchase their health care in  January, to designate the first $8,000 to the healthcare plan of their  choice. Well, that obviously doesn't fly well either because the  Democrats want to tell people what they have to have.   Most families don't need many things that are covered. Why should  they pay for that? Oh, because the Democratic Party, Washington, D.C.,  says you have to. These are essential items.   No, no, no. A family will be able to make their own decisions and not  pay for what they don't need.   So, Mr. Speaker, there always are at least two sides of the story.  And it is true that what the Republican Party is going to do is allow  people to make their own choice, but to give them the tools necessary.  And if a family decides to do that, then they can; if they decide not  to, they don't have to. Just like what is happening today where people  are required to get health care but 30 million people are uninsured,  figure that one out, Mr. Speaker.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We have at least two different sides up here, and people are entitled  to believe whatever they want to believe. I am entitled to the same  opinion of myself, also.   There are also a set of answers and facts that need to be given,  evidently, and that is, in fact, we do make changes in the bill to  ObamaCare. We do.   Mr. Speaker, the law, the way it was written, we have virtually few  30-year-olds to 45-year-olds that actually pay for ObamaCare, the  people we were told who needed it the most. The reason why is because  it was dictated from Washington how to rate the coverage. In rating  that coverage, it became so illogically expensive for a young person to  pay an astronomical amount for their insurance, and even many times a  higher value for their deductible, to where 30-year-olds, 35-year-olds,  36-year-olds, 37-year-olds chose simply not to take the policy offered.   So what do Republicans do? It is real simple. Here is what  Republicans do: They allow the States the flexibility to determine what  might be called a rating.   And it is true that, now, people will be rated based upon their own  actuarial experience of where they are in life, their age. Mr. Speaker,  it is true that a 25-year-old, 30-year-old, 35-year-old needs less  necessary intricate and expensive health care. And it is actuarially  true that the older that we get--I celebrated my birthday yesterday. I  get it. I am getting older, and I probably am a little more expensive  at the doctor in things that I need, especially into my future.   So what we did is we said where you have that rating system, we will  allow more money through the tax credit system to adjust that so that a  50- to 64-year-old will not be at a disadvantage because those, too,  are the people we want in the healthcare plan.   So we are actually going to add, by making it actuarially sound and  attractive, a whole bunch of younger people; and we are going to  recognize this balance, and we are going to provide more of an  incentive to balance out for those who are older. That makes sense.   It is also reality based, Mr. Speaker. But to say that someone is  going to be paying more without us recognizing that and doing something  about it would not be a fair argument.   I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1000     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   What a shame the gentleman was not here to vote for the Affordable  Care Act when it took hold several years ago, and he would have known  this is a bad deal.   Mr. Speaker, even the American people cannot be fooled. The American  people saw ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act, waste billions of  dollars simply to try and put together a computer system.   Mr. Speaker, the American people understand it was a tax bill. It is  about using the IRS, and they were going to add 17,000 employees,  literally, to beat the brains out of the American people to force them  into having health care from Washington.   Mr. Speaker, no wonder Republicans won the majority several years  ago. No wonder Republicans have saved the American people not only from  the IRS, but from the massive taxes that were embedded within this huge  government takeover of our healthcare system.   The bottom line is that my colleagues have not yet met a tax they  wouldn't be for. They have not yet built and grown these massive  government organizations to the tune that they want to force the  American people to do things. And they are having a difficult time  understanding today why the American people--if given a choice and an  opportunity and an advantage that would be fair for all Americans to  have a tax credit, why that is something that people really want to  see.   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Trump may or may not have contemplated every single  part of the healthcare issue, but I will tell you what he did  understand. And that is, draining the swamp from a system that takes  away your freedom, that saps the economic growth and vitality of this  country, and that empowers the Internal Revenue Service is a bad idea.   Mr. Speaker, having to qualify by going through the IRS to look at  your records first to determine whether you qualify for a subsidy  should be an embarrassment, and it was seen that way by the American  people. Mr. Speaker, to guess at how much money and work you would have  during the year, and then if you are wrong, pay up, was a system that  did not work because many physicians across this country and many  hospitals simply do not take ObamaCare. They are acting like it was a  gift from God.   Mr. Speaker, it did not work, and it does not work. The Republican  Party is going to find a way, and we are going to get our act together,  and we are  [[Page H2358]]  going to gleefully go and do the right thing. It is a process, Mr.  Speaker. It is a long process. It actually does take the House, the  Senate, and the President, and we are going to get our job done.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Seven years ago, Mr. Speaker, this town was abuzz with this new  healthcare plan, the Affordable Care Act, that was signed by the  President of the United States. We were promised an enormous  opportunity to make health care better.   Mr. Speaker, fortunately, the American people had a chance to make a  decision, and the American people--after watching and seeing not only  people incapable of putting databases together, incapable of  understanding marketplaces, and incapable of understanding the limits  of the American people's real need to understand and to have a better  healthcare system--gave up on ObamaCare, the Affordable Care Act. They  gave up on it because, after 7 long years, they understood it simply  didn't equal what they were sold.   The Republican Party is selling what we believe in, and this is the  beginning of that sell. It is a beginning of an understanding for most  Members of this body and the American people to understand you can keep  your own doctor and you can keep your own healthcare plan, but you,  too, can make your own decisions. You can become a consumer.   Oh, my gosh, somebody from Washington isn't going to tell us exactly  what to do? Let's scare everybody; let's make them think that the  American people can't make their own decisions without the IRS or  Washington telling them what to do.   I understand there are some frustrations. I get that. I can be  frustrated; I am not. It is true last week I held a townhall meeting in  Dallas, Texas. It is true a bunch of people yelled and screamed at me.  They simply wanted to know: Yes or no, yes or no.   Mr. Speaker, policy is not like that in our country. The Republican  Party does owe people thoughts, ideas, and plans. We will have the  bill, and when we do it, we will own it, and we will be proud of it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the  previous question on the resolution.
