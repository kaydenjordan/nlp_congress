 Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed by the  qualifications of President Trump's nominee to be the leader of our  Department of Education. Betsy DeVos has clearly shown a disregard-- even a hostility--for the public school system. So I stand with the  thousands of parents, teachers, and students of New Mexico in fighting  to stop her confirmation.   Simply put, education is too important to New Mexico children and our  State's economy to have a Secretary of Education not fully invested in  the success of our public schools.   As someone who grew up going to public school, who is sending my own  kids to public schools, I am deeply troubled by Betsy DeVos's record on  privatization, which goes well beyond simply voicing support for  vouchers and private school. Mrs. DeVos has been a key player in the  well-moneyed effort to privatize and siphon funds away from public  education, and she has time and again undermined the teachers we all  rely upon.   It appears as though Betsy DeVos's most notable experience in  education is spending her career and her fortune advocating for  policies that divert public tax dollars away from public schools and  into private schools. I cannot support a nominee who wants to weaken  the kinds of public schools that so many New Mexicans rely on.   The privatization policies pushed by Mrs. DeVos would be especially  damaging to rural New Mexico, where there are few options to begin  with. It is not uncommon for students to travel more than an hour to  get to and from school in those parts of the State. School  administrators often wear multiple hats, sometimes running the after- school program or driving the local schoolbus. In rural areas in my  home State, the public school is often the only choice, and there  simply aren't enough students to support the kinds of for-profit  private schools that Mrs. DeVos wants to replace them with.   Having a Secretary of Education who has spent her entire career  pushing a privatization agenda is not reassuring to New Mexicans and is  at odds with the needs of the students and families across my State.   Further, I do not believe that Mrs. DeVos understands the Federal  Government's trust responsibility in serving Native American students.  Given Mrs. DeVos's rushed nomination hearing in the HELP Committee,  Senators were given very little opportunity to question her about her  understanding of tribal issues and impact aid. So I am concerned that  she will push her privatization agenda in these areas as well.   For example, the Zuni Public School District is a small rural  district in Western New Mexico. Earlier this week, their school board  sent me a letter asking that I oppose Mrs. DeVos's nomination. I want  to take a moment and read a few passage from this letter:         The beauty of the United States public school system,       unlike many in the rest of the world, is that we take       everyone who walks through our doors and love every child who       sits in our desks, without question.        This Board therefore stands by all of our students, no       matter what color or ethnicity, regardless of their creed;       every child who identifies on the spectrum of L,G,B,T, or Q;       every child with either a physical or learning disability, or       both . . . every child who speaks a second language; every       immigrant child as well as every Native American child who       can trace their lineage in this land back thousands of years;       every child who sees their education as the bridge between       their most ardent dreams and their most hopeful futures.    These are powerful words that I fully support, and I thank the Zuni  Public School District for speaking out on this matter. We should all  be this concerned.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire letter from  the Zuni Public School District be printed in the Record at the  conclusion of my remarks.   During her nomination hearing, Mrs. DeVos demonstrated over and over  that she is unfamiliar with even basic education issues, and she failed  to commit to uphold the responsibilities of the Secretary of Education  to support public schools. Given that Mrs. DeVos has no relevant  experience as a teacher or school administrator, we should be very  concerned with entrusting her to enforce key protections under title  IX, under IDEA, and under other civil rights laws. In particular, Mrs.  DeVos's lack of commitment to the Office of Civil Rights within the  Department of Education, combined with the fact that she and her family  have donated enormous sums of money to organizations that are anti- LGBTQ, anti-women's rights, and anti-Muslim, is simply troubling.   The mission of the Office of Civil Rights is to ensure equal access  to education and to promote educational excellence throughout the  Nation with vigorous enforcement of civil rights. During her nomination  hearing, Mrs. DeVos would not commit to continuing the Office's  policies that are making our college campuses safer by focusing on  prevention and response to sexual assault. In fact, she has donated  money to organizations that actually make it harder to prosecute sexual  assault on our college campuses. As amazing as that sounds, it is true.   If my Republican colleagues rubberstamp this nominee, they will  confirm a Secretary of Education who doesn't believe in public schools,  who will unravel rural education, and who has even worked to make it  harder to protect women against sexual assault on college campuses. I  believe that we have a moral imperative to ensure that all students  have equal protections while attending school. Mrs. DeVos will be a  massive step in the wrong direction.   As the members of the Zuni Pueblo wrote to me in their letter, ``our  children are our most sacred gifts.'' This is what we are voting on  with this confirmation.   We need an Education Secretary who is committed to upholding these  principles. We need an Education Secretary who is committed to ensuring  that every student has access to quality education, regardless of their  background or their ZIP code, regardless of their ethnicity or their  religion, and regardless of their gender or sexual orientation.   In the last few weeks, my office has fielded thousands of calls and  letters asking me to oppose this nomination. I have heard from more  than 8,000 constituents on this one topic alone, many of whom called as  parents, teachers, and some as students. That is more than any other  Trump nominee whom we have considered to date. Never has an Education  Secretary nomination received so much attention and opposition.   I stand with the thousands of parents, teachers, and students across  the country, and in my home State of New Mexico, fighting to stop this  nomination. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting no.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                    Zuni Public School District #89,                                    12 Twin Buttes Dr., Zuni, NM,                                                   January 30, 2017.        To our Honorable Senators and Representatives: We, the       Board of Education of Zuni Public School District, ask you to       add  [[Page S711]]       your support as we stand in opposition to the appointment of       Betsy DeVos as United States Secretary of Education on the       following grounds:        During her confirmation hearing, Mrs. DeVos demonstrated       that she was woefully ill-equipped to head the Department of       Education. She has never attended a public school, never       taught or administered in a public school, and her children       have never attended a public school. She does not hold any       degree in the field of education, either in theory,       administration, or practice. She has a documented history of       promoting a charter and voucher based system that she       supported in her home state of Michigan, diverting funding       and support away from public education and deserving       children. Furthermore, when questioned in her hearing, Mrs.       DeVos was unable to explain the difference between growth and       proficiency, nor was she familiar with the federal law behind       IDEA, two essential and basic aspects of education. As well,       Mrs. DeVos advocated in her hearing to allow the presence of       guns in schools during an era of rampant mass violence based       primarily on the use of guns in schools. Mrs. DeVos has also       publicly stated that she sees education as a way to further       proselytize for the Christian faith, which would constitute a       violation of the Constitutional separation of Church and       State in public schools as it would in all federal       institutions.        Our pueblo of Zuni is a small community in a western pocket       of rural New Mexico. We are neither a rich district nor one       that wields a great deal of political influence. What this       Board does represent is a rich, Indigenous tradition and       culture that holds high the ideals of hard-work, humility,       and integrity. We are an agricultural, peace-loving society       that has lived in this land since time immemorial.        Yet our memory is long. We remember the era during which       education was combined with religion to be used as a weapon       against the Native peoples of this great nation. We know the       trauma such action has caused to reverberate through       generations of good, decent Americans We also know the       resilience of those same people who, despite the infliction       of weaponized education, have come today to see literacy as       their American birthright, and to crave that sacred American       Dream for which we are all Constitutionally entitled to       strive. This is a living medicine and healing that must not       be undone through the dissolution of the separation of church       and state, one that we must nurture and safeguard for all       American children.        We are reminded during this time that, as you do, we hold       publicly-elected positions designed to represent a broad       spectrum of constituent. The beauty of the United States       public school system, unlike many in the rest of the world,       is that we take everyone who walks through our doors and love       every child who sits in our desks, without question. This       Board therefore stands by all of our students, no matter what       color or ethnicity, regardless of their creed; every child       who identifies on the spectrum of L,G,B,T,or Q; every child       with either a physical or learning disability, or both; every       child who speaks a second language; every immigrant child as       well as every Native American child who can trace their       lineage in this land back thousands of years; every child who       sees their education as the bridge between their most ardent       dreams and their most hopeful futures.        We further stand by each parent, guardian, grandparent,       sibling, aunt, uncle; every member of kin that builds and       holds strong the dream of education for each of our children,       knowing as we have always known in Zuni that our children are       our most sacred gifts.        And we, the Board of Education in Zuni Public School       District, stand by the teachers, aides, administrators,       counselors, liaisons, nurses, secretaries, custodians, cooks,       and bus drivers who as their daily work participate in the       painstaking and deeply patriotic act of ensuring equitable       access to education for all of our students. It is through       the diligence and action of just such citizens that this       nation is able to deliver unto each new generation of       American a passport to the possibility of American success.        The children, families and hard-working faculties and staff       of the American public school system deserve a Secretary of       the Department of Education who is most eminently qualified,       through both education and experience, to advocate for all       Americans: diverse, complex, and brilliant citizens; to work       toward the most equitable education for all; and to uphold       this cornerstone of our democratic republic.        It is for these reasons that the Zuni Public School       District Board of Education respectfully requests your most       passionate and vocal support in opposing the appointment of       Mrs. Betsy DeVos. We also ask that you look toward the       experienced and qualified education professionals working       within the public school system to fill this highest position       in the field.            E:lah'kwa (Thank you) for your representation,      Zuni Board of Education:      Mr. Jerome Haskie,        Board President      Ms. Stephanie Vicenti,        Vice Board President      Ms. Masika Sweetwyne,        Secretary      Ms. Bernadette Panteah,        Member      Ms. Shelly Chimoni,        Member.

Mr. President, in 1986, Coretta Scott King, the widow  of civil rights leader Dr. Martin Luther King, wrote a letter urging  Congress to block the nomination of Jeff Sessions for Federal judge.  The Senate Judiciary Committee would ultimately reject that nomination.   Here we are three decades later. Senator Sessions, who cannot erase  his troubling record on civil rights, is again undergoing a  confirmation hearing as President Trump's nominee for Attorney General.  I would like to read an excerpt from Mrs. King's letter, and I ask  unanimous consent that the letter in its entirety be printed in the  Record following my remarks.   Mrs. King wrote:         I write to express my sincere opposition to the       confirmation of Jefferson B. Sessions as a federal district       court judge for the Southern District of Alabama. My       professional and personal roots in Alabama are deep and       lasting. Anyone who has used the power of his office as       United States Attorney to intimidate and chill the free       exercise of the ballot by citizens should not be elevated to       our courts. Mr. Sessions has used the awesome powers of his       office in a shabby attempt to intimidate and frighten elderly       black voters. For this reprehensible conduct, he should not       be rewarded with a federal judgeship.        I do sincerely urge you to oppose the confirmation of Mr.       Sessions.    When Senator Elizabeth Warren tried to read this exact same letter  last night here on the Senate floor, Republicans voted to silence her,  citing that she was in violation of Senate rules aimed at preventing  Senators from impugning the motives of their colleagues.   The move by some of my colleagues to silence the words of Senator  Warren and Mrs. King last night is troubling not only because this is a  threat to our democratic values, but also, frankly, because it is  hypocritical. During a scathing speech last year in this same Chamber,  the Senator from Texas went so far as personally attacking the  Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell and accusing him of lying.  In May of last year, the Senator from Arkansas, also here on the Senate  floor, delivered a speech directly criticizing former Senate Minority  Leader Harry Reid, using the terms ``vulgar,'' ``incoherent,'' and  ``cancerous'' to describe him.   He said on the Senate floor:         I am forced to listen to the bitter, vulgar incoherent       ramblings of the minority leader. Normally, like every other       American, I ignore them.    I bring this up because neither of these Senators were silenced.  Neither were told to sit down and take their seat. Silencing Senator  Warren for reading Mrs. King's letter under the guise of following  Senate rules is hypocritical and rightfully leads some to question  whether the majority leader may have a different standard of expected  conduct for female Senators compared to their male counterparts.   I have already announced that I will vote against the nomination of  Senator Sessions. After this episode last night, I believe now more  than ever this position will require an unwavering commitment to  protect American's constitutional rights, and to stand up against  discrimination and hate.   Like the thousands of New Mexicans I have heard from, I lack that  confidence in Senator Sessions. I urge the American people to read and  share Coretta Scott King's letter and continue to make your own voices  heard because we will not be silenced. We will persist.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:           The Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social             Change, Inc.,                                  Atlanta, Georgia, March 19, 1986.      Re Nomination of Jefferson B. Sessions U.S. Judge, Southern           District of Alabama Hearing, March 13, 1986       Hon. Strom Thurmond,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Thurmond: I write to express my sincere       opposition to the confirmation of Jefferson B. Sessions as a       federal district court judge for the Southern District of       Alabama. My professional and personal roots in Alabama are       deep and lasting. Anyone who has used the power of his office       as United States Attorney to intimidate and chill the free       exercise of the ballot by citizens should not be elevated to       our courts. Mr. Sessions has used the awesome powers of his       office in a shabby attempt to intimidate and frighten elderly       black voters. For this reprehensible conduct, he should not       be rewarded with a federal judgeship.        I regret that a long-standing commitment prevents me from       appearing in person to testify against this nominee. However,       I have attached a copy of my statement opposing Mr. Sessions'       confirmation and I request that my statement as well as this       letter be made a part of the hearing record.        I do sincerely urge you to oppose the confirmation of Mr.       Sessions.            Sincerely,                                                Coretta Scott King.  [[Page S936]]                                          ____     Statement of Coretta Scott King on the Nomination of Jefferson     Beauregard Sessions for the United States District Court Southern                            District of Alabama             Senate Judiciary Committee, Thursday, March 13, 1986         Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: Thank you for       allowing me this opportunity to express my strong opposition       to the nomination of Jefferson Sessions for a federal       district judgeship for the Southern District of Alabama. My       longstanding commitment which I shared with my husband,       Martin, to protect and enhance the rights of Black Americans,       rights which include equal access to the democratic process,       compels me to testify today.        Civil rights leaders, including my husband and Albert       Turner, have fought long and hard to achieve free and       unfettered access to the ballot box. Mr. Sessions has used       the awesome power of his office to chill the free exercise of       the vote by black citizens in the district he now seeks to       serve as a federal judge. This simply cannot be allowed to       happen. Mr. Sessions' conduct as U.S. Attorney, from his       politically-motivated voting fraud prosecutions to his       indifference toward criminal violations of civil rights laws,       indicates that he lacks the temperament, fairness and       judgment to be a federal judge.        The Voting Rights Act was, and still is, vitally important       to the future of democracy in the United States. I was       privileged to join Martin and many others during the Selma to       Montgomery march for voting rights in 1965. Martin was       particularly impressed by the determination to get the       franchise of blacks in Selma and neighboring Perry County. As       he wrote, ``Certainly no community in the history of the       Negro struggle has responded with the enthusiasm of Selma and       her neighboring town of Marion. Where Birmingham depended       largely upon students and unemployed adults [to participate       in non-violent protest of the denial of the franchise], Selma       has involved fully 10 per cent of the Negro population in       active demonstrations, and at least half the Negro population       of Marion was arrested on one day.'' Martin was referring of       course to a group that included the defendants recently       prosecuted for assisting elderly and illiterate blacks to       exercise that franchise. In fact, Martin anticipated from the       depth of their commitment twenty years ago, that a united       political organization would remain in Perry County long       after the other marchers had left. This organization, the       Perry County Civic League, started by Mr. Turner, Mr. Hogue,       and others, as Martin predicted, continued ``to direct the       drive for votes and other rights.'' In the years since the       Voting Rights Act was passed, Black Americans in Marion,       Selma and elsewhere have made important strides in their       struggle to participate actively in the electoral process.       The number of Blacks registered to vote in key Southern       states has doubled since 1965. This would not have been       possible without the Voting Rights Act.        However, Blacks still fall far short of having equal       participation in the electoral process. Particularly in the       South, efforts continue to be made to deny Blacks access to       the polls, even where Blacks constitute the majority of the       voters. It has been a long up-hill struggle to keep alive the       vital legislation that protects the most fundamental right to       vote. A person who has exhibited so much hostility to the       enforcement of those laws, and thus, to the exercise of those       rights by Black people should not be elevated to the federal       bench.        The irony of Mr. Sessions' nomination is that, if       confirmed, he will be given life tenure for doing with a       federal prosecution what the local sheriffs accomplished       twenty years ago with clubs and cattle prods. Twenty years       ago, when we marched from Selma to Montgomery, the fear of       voting was real, as the broken bones and bloody heads in       Selma and Marion bore witness. As my husband wrote at the       time, ``it was not just a sick imagination that conjured up       the vision of a public official, sworn to uphold the law, who       forced an inhuman march upon hundreds of Negro children; who       ordered the Rev. James Bevel to be chained to his sickbed;       who clubbed a Negro woman registrant, and who callously       inflicted repeated brutalities and indignities upon       nonviolent Negroes peacefully petitioning for their       constitutional right to vote.''        Free exercise of voting rights is so fundamental to       American democracy that we can not tolerate any form of       infringement of those rights. Of all the groups who have been       disenfranchised in our nation's history, none has struggled       longer or suffered more in the attempt to win the vote than       Black citizens. No group has had access to the ballot box       denied so persistently and intently. Over the past century, a       broad array of schemes have been used in attempts to block       the Black vote. The range of techniques developed with the       purpose of repressing black voting rights run the gamut from       the straightforward application of brutality against black       citizens who tried to vote to such legalized frauds as       ``grandfather clause'' exclusions and rigged literacy tests.        The actions taken by Mr. Sessions in regard to the 1984       voting fraud prosecutions represent just one more       technique used to intimidate Black voters and thus deny       them this most precious franchise. The investigations into       the absentee voting process were conducted only in the       Black Belt counties where blacks had finally achieved       political power in the local government. Whites had been       using the absentee process to their advantage for years,       without incident. Then, when Blacks; realizing its       strength, began to use it with success, criminal       investigations were begun.        In these investigations, Mr. Sessions, as U.S. Attorney,       exhibited an eagerness to bring to trial and convict three       leaders of the Perry County Civic League including Albert       Turner despite evidence clearly demonstrating their innocence       of any wrongdoing. Furthermore, in initiating the case, Mr.       Sessions ignored allegations of similar behavior by whites,       choosing instead to chill the exercise of the franchise by       blacks by his misguided investigation. In fact, Mr. Sessions       sought to punish older black civil rights activists, advisors       and colleagues of my husband, who had been key figures in the       civil rights movement in the 1960's. These were persons who,       realizing the potential of the absentee vote among Blacks,       had learned to use the process within the bounds of legality       and had taught others to do the same. The only sin they       committed was being too successful in gaining votes.        The scope and character of the investigations conducted by       Mr. Sessions also warrant grave concern. Witnesses were       selectively chosen in accordance with the favorability of       their testimony to the government's case. Also, the       prosecution illegally withheld from the defense critical       statements made by witnesses. Witnesses who did testify were       pressured and intimidated into submitting the ``correct''       testimony. Many elderly blacks were visited multiple times by       the FBI who then hauled them over 180 miles by bus to a grand       jury in Mobile when they could more easily have testified at       a grand jury twenty miles away in Selma. These voters, and       others, have announced they are now never going to vote       again.        I urge you to consider carefully Mr. Sessions' conduct in       these matters. Such a review, I believe, raises serious       questions about his commitment to the protection of the       voting rights of all American citizens and consequently his       fair and unbiased judgment regarding this fundamental right.       When the circumstances and facts surrounding the indictments       of Al Turner, his wife, Evelyn, and Spencer Hogue are       analyzed, it becomes clear that the motivation was political,       and the result frightening--the wide-scale chill of the       exercise of the ballot for blacks, who suffered so much to       receive that right in the first place. Therefore, it is my       strongly-held view that the appointment of Jefferson Sessions       to the federal bench would irreparably damage the work of my       husband, Al Turner, and countless others who risked their       lives and freedom over the past twenty years to ensure equal       participation in our democratic system.        The exercise of the franchise is an essential means by       which our citizens ensure that those who are governing will       be responsible. My husband called it the number one civil       right. The denial of access to the ballot box ultimately       results in the denial of other fundamental rights. For, it is       only when the poor and disadvantaged are empowered that they       are able to participate actively in the solutions to their       own problems.        We still have a long way to go before we can say that       minorities no longer need be concerned about discrimination       at the polls. Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans and Asian       Americans are grossly underrepresented at every level of       government in America. If we are going to make our timeless       dream of justice through democracy a reality, we must take       every possible step to ensure that the spirit and intent of       the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Fifteenth Amendment of       the Constitution is honored.        The federal courts hold a unique position in our       constitutional system, ensuring that minorities and other       citizens without political power have a forum in which to       vindicate their rights. Because of this unique role, it is       essential that the people selected to be federal judges       respect the basic tenets of our legal system: respect for       individual rights and a commitment to equal justice for all.       The integrity of the Courts, and thus the rights they       protect, can only be maintained if citizens feel confident       that those selected as federal judges will be able to judge       with fairness others holding differing views.        I do not believe Jefferson Sessions possesses the requisite       judgment, competence, and sensitivity to the rights       guaranteed by the federal civil rights laws to qualify for       appointment to the federal district court. Based on his       record, I believe his confirmation would have a devastating       effect on not only the judicial system in Alabama, but also       on the progress we have made everywhere toward fulfilling my       husband's dream that he envisioned over twenty years ago. I       therefore urge the Senate Judiciary Committee to deny his       confirmation.        I thank you for allowing me to share my views.     I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
