 Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to rise to offer my  sincerest congratulations to Jon Rahm for his decisive victory in the  2023 Masters Tournament.   Every spring, the world's greatest golfers travel to Georgia's 12th  District to play at the world's greatest golf course, Augusta National,  a tradition like no other.   As people from all around the world make the trip to my district or  tune in from the comfort of their homes, they get to experience one of  the country's greatest competitions in the world of sports. In doing  so, they get a glimpse into the beautiful city I am privileged to call  home, Augusta, Georgia.   Many thanks to Chairman Ridley, the members of Augusta National, the  staff and volunteers, for another magnificent tournament.   In winning this year's tournament, Jon Rahm joins an elite group of  Spanish Masters champions that include Sergio Garcia, Jose Maria  Olazabal, and Jon's very own role model, the late Seve Ballesteros.   In typical Masters form, Jon made his charge to the top of the leader  board on the back nine on Sunday to finish with a 3-under-par 69 score  to finish at 12 under. He did so on the 66th birthday of his role  model, Seve Ballesteros.   Congratulations to Jon Rahm, a most deserving champion.                            ____________________
