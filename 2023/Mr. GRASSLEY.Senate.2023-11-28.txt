 Well, you just heard Senator Durbin say that this bill  has passed the Senate once. It is still not law. We are back here  again, and I hope my fellow Senators will see that Senator Durbin and I  don't give up on this very important issue of trying to bring a dose of  sunshine to the airwaves.   Lowering the cost of prescription drugs is a top priority of mine and  most of the Senators here. Without prescription medication, millions of  Americans would not survive. As a nation, we are incredibly blessed to  live in a country where investment and innovation unlock cures and  treatments.   But the escalation in price of prescription drugs, partly caused by  this advertisement that goes on, are a consuming concern for millions  of Americans, including Iowans who bring up this subject regularly at  my county meetings.   I have come to the floor of the Senate to address the sticker shock  that greets consumers when they pick up their medicine at the pharmacy  or open their medical bills after a hospital visit.   In recent years, I have worked in a bipartisan manner to pass the  CREATES Act, another bill called the Patient Right to Know Drug Prices  Act, and another one, the Right Rebate Act into law. Each of these  bills lowered prescription drug prices for patients and taxpayers by  stopping anticompetitive practices, putting sunlight on medications for  consumers at the pharmacy counter, and to keep drug companies in check.   I was chairman of the Finance Committee when we hauled Big Pharma in  for public hearings. As chairman, I also partnered with the senior  Senator from Oregon on a groundbreaking 2-year investigation of insulin  pricing. That investigation focuses not only on insulin manufacturers  but also powerful pharmacy benefit managers--PBMs.    I have worked to hold PBMs accountable by putting sunlight on their  practices and working to ban their anti-competitive behavior that  increases the cost to patients, rural pharmacies, and the taxpayers.   In this Congress, I have gotten passed the Prescription Pricing for  the People Act out of the Judiciary Committee and with bipartisan  support. I hope the Senate doesn't miss the opportunity to hold the  Federal Trade Commission accountable by requiring the 6(b) study of  drug middlemen to be produced within 1 year instead of the typical 3 to  5 years that it takes the FTC to do something.   I have also worked with the junior Senator from Washington State to  pass the PBM Transparency Act out of the Commerce Committee with  bipartisan support. The FTC can play an important role in holding PBMs  accountable in spread pricing and clawbacks across all health  insurance.   I have also contributed to and supported two Finance Committee  markups this year that included six of my PBM accountability and  transparency provisions. I am supporting the PBM provisions that have  come out of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee to  deal with this problem in the commercial insurance market.   I hope the full Senate doesn't ignore the aggressive actions the four  committees have taken this Congress to hold PBMs accountable. We must  enact these bold committee-passed bills into law. If we are timid, we  will be right back here a few years from now still fixing the problem.   On top of PBM reforms and accountability, we need price transparency;  so that brings me back to where Senator Durbin and I are right now.  With that background, I now go to the purpose of this unanimous consent  request and the Durbin-Grassley bill to bring important price  information to prescription drug consumers. When patients complain  about the high price of drugs, it is usually because they got their  bill or found out how much it costs when they were at the pharmacy  counter. They didn't have the ability to know the price before they  bought it. Knowing what something costs before buying is common sense.  So working with the Senator from Illinois to require the disclosure of  medication list prices and advertisements makes common sense. President  Trump pursued this through regulations, and the Senate even passed this  measure--as Senator Durbin has already said--a few years ago.   Each year, the pharmaceutical industry spends $6 billion in direct- to-consumer drug advertising to fill the airways with ads, resulting in  the average American seeing nine direct-to-consumer ads each day.  Studies show that these activities steer patients to more expensive  drugs even when a lower cost generic is available.   The Government Accountability Office has found that prescription  drugs advertised directly to consumers account for about 58 percent of  Medicare spending on drugs. We ought to require the disclosure of this  list price so that patients can make informed choices when inundated  with drug commercials.   Consumers and taxpayers would benefit from a dose of sunshine. By  passing the Drug-Price Transparency for Consumers Act, we could begin  the process of reforming the incentives in our prescription supply  chain that reward high-cost drugs and their manufacturers, along with  powerful middlemen.   If you watch these commercials on television, you see a lot of  information very quietly stated by the drug companies such as the side  effects possible from using some of these drugs. You get all the  information about what these drugs will accomplish, but you don't know  what they cost. And that information ought to be available to the  consumer.   I thank Senator Durbin for giving me this opportunity to express my  view on this piece of legislation.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1250
