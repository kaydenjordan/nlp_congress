 Mr. Speaker, I often hear at home from folks  who are frustrated with their experiences with air travel and airport  security.   We have an opportunity to address part of the problem to reduce  flight times, prevent involuntary bumping, save fuel, reduce emissions,  reduce the number of government employees, and save money both in the  public sector and out of our constituents' pockets.   The FAA is spending billions of dollars attempting to implement new  technologies and next generation air traffic control management  systems. They are failing.   Right now, we have the 21st Century AIRR Act, which is a step in the  right direction. It is going to unleash American innovation and allow  us not just to catch up with other countries but to surpass them.   It is about American jobs. It is about providing the American public  with the service they deserve.   I urge Members to support and advance the 21st Century AIRR Act.                            ____________________
