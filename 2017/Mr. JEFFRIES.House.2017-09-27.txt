 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3229, which will extend for 10  years the soon expiring authority for Federal judges and judicial  officers to redact from financial disclosure forms sensitive personal  information that, if revealed, could compromise their safety and  security.   An independent judiciary that is free of coercion is fundamental to  our constitutional democracy, fundamental to  [[Page H7550]]  the principle of liberty and justice for all, and fundamental to the  principle of equal protection under the law. Unfortunately, in this  country, there are some who seek to compromise the integrity of the  judicial branch through threats, harm, and harassment.   According to the U.S. Marshals Service, in fiscal year 2017, there  has been an increase in every major recorded statistical category  regarding the targeting of members of the Federal bench and judiciary  employees. Failure to extend this authority will create grave security  risks to judges, judiciary employees, and their families.   Each year, only a very small percentage of the financial disclosure  reports filed contain an approved redaction of information. Redaction  only occurs if there is a clear nexus between a security risk and the  information for which redaction is sought.   Federal judges and other employees of the judicial branch routinely  interact with disgruntled litigants or dangerous defendants and others  who may seek to do them harm.   For example, in 2016, a disgruntled defendant was convicted of a  diabolical plot to kidnap, torture, and murder U.S. District Judge  Andrew J. Guilford, who presided over that defendant's wire fraud  conviction.   In March of this year, the FBI reported that U.S. District Judge  Derek Watson, who issued a temporary retaining order against the  President's travel ban, has subsequently been the target of repeated  violent threats.   In April, Jason Springer, an ISIS sympathizer, was indicted on a  charge of threatening to murder U.S. District Judge Elizabeth  Kovachevich by flying an explosive drone into her window.   The need to extend the redaction authority is a time-sensitive  security matter, and I thank Chairman Goodlatte, Ranking Member  Conyers, Subcommittee Chairman Issa, and Ranking Member Nadler of the  subcommittee, for their leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Nadler), the distinguished ranking member of the  Subcommittee on the Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet.    Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a distinguished champion  of safety of Federal judges.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
