 Madam Speaker, I am concerned about the rhetoric I have  continually heard from the other side. I believe that all Members of  this body love our country, but some statements from this House are un- American in tone, such as comparing ICE detention centers to  concentration camps and the Holocaust. There have been suggestions that  terrorist organizations were justified in attacking our great Nation.  Members have even used language expressing how ashamed they are of this  country.   I am fed up with those continued attacks on the very foundations of  this great Nation.   I remind my colleagues that we, as Americans, pledge allegiance to  the flag of the United States of America. We must not use rhetoric that  leads other nations to question our loyalties.   Madam Speaker, I am not afraid to stand up for freedom, liberty, and  justice. I am proud to be an American, and I will defend the values  that make this Nation great until the day I die.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 51 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, July 17, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
