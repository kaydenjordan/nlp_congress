 Madam Speaker, I am very proud and so blessed to have  been born in the greatest Nation on Earth, the United States of  America, and I am a proud, proud American citizen, a proud husband,  father, son, and grandfather.   I come to you today in the midst of the longest shutdown in the  history of this country. I am disgusted that the issue here isn't about  protecting veterans or Americans' healthcare or education. Instead, it  is about the demand for Trump's wall.   Last week, I voted to end the shutdown. The bill passed this House,  and it sits in the United States Senate. Last year, the Senate  unanimously passed basically the same funding bill, so what is the  difference now?   President Trump has taken over the United States Senate, and now he  wants to punish the American people by attacking our national security,  our safety, and the lives of the men and women who serve our great  country, expecting them to work without a paycheck.   Trump's shutdown is hurting the Coast Guard, that, right now, is  protecting our national security. No pay for their families. They are  relying on food banks to feed their families.   The Trump shutdown is literally endangering the lives of workers like  [[Page H703]]  Mallory Lorge, who, without pay, cannot afford the insulin she needs to  stay alive.   President Trump, I demand that you reopen government and you stop  your Trump shutdown.                            ____________________
