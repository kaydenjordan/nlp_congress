 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind you and my  colleagues that Congress appropriated billions for disaster relief for  Hurricanes Irma and Maria. In the latest effort, however, to find  funding to build a wall, the White House and top budget officials  continue to discuss shifting disaster funding to pay for a wall that a  foreign nation was to pay for and now must be borne by people still  recovering from disaster.   The 2017 hurricane season was one of the worst on record. Among the  hardest places hit were Puerto Rico and my home, the Virgin Islands of  the United States, which not only lost power across the islands, but  many vital pieces of infrastructure were heavily damaged and destroyed,  and, most tragically, lives were lost.   This disaster significantly impacted the Virgin Islands, destroying  the island's infrastructure, with the loss of our only two hospitals,  multiple schools, thousands of homes, and it left residents without  electricity for a period of 9 months.   The total damage to the Virgin Islands is estimated at $10.8  billion--$10.8 billion in a place that only has a $1 billion budget-- $6.9 billion for infrastructure, $2.3 billion for housing, and $1.5  million for the economy.   Diverting disaster funds from this community would create a security  risk and make them even more vulnerable.   Mr. Speaker, shifting disaster relief funds appropriated by this body  from my district and others impaired by the 2017-2018 natural disasters  would create a catastrophic economic disaster.                                time  1030    Disaster funding from the Army Corps was critical to disaster  recovery, including power restoration, studies, repairs, and  construction projects in the Virgin Islands and other territories and  States impacted by the national disasters.   The Army Corps of Engineers, however, has barged more than 25,000  cubic yards of construction and demolition debris from the territory.  However, approximately more than 6,000, almost 7,000, cubic yards  remain on the island, still to be removed.   There is still so much work left undone. Individuals are still  without roofs. After extensive debate and discussion with FEMA, the  roof repair program is just now, a year and a half later, repairing the  thousands of roofs and homes destroyed.   The STEP roof program has been extended to March 1. The STEP program  debris removal is still in progress throughout the territory.   The hurricanes left not one but two hospitals overwhelmed with debris  and destroyed--our only two hospitals--and, now, worksheets still have  not been approved by FEMA for the rebuilding of those hospitals. The  modular hospital is still not in place.   Students have only recently, in this month, moved into the modular  classrooms. Can you imagine?   School reconstruction has not begun. Our communities still have a  long way to go to get in the disaster recovery and rebuilding process.   Mr. Speaker, nowhere else in this country would this be allowed. This  would not be allowed in any of your colleagues' homes.   However, before and after the storm, Virgin Islanders put their heads  down and did the work. They pitched in and helped one another because  that is all we had at that time, and the benevolence of other people,  until you, Congress, until you, colleagues, gave them the disaster  funding that was needed to rebuild.   Mr. Speaker, unlike other places, the Virgin Islands doesn't have  five or six Members of the House or millions of constituents living in  your own districts. The Virgin Islands didn't have thousands of people  on the news media or chefs or playwrights bringing musicals to our  island to draw attention to the devastation in our home.   The Virgin Islands had me, and I pray they have you--they have you,  Mr. Speaker; they have you, colleagues--to continue the fight for them,  for these Americans, to tell the White House that they should not shift  disaster funding to build a wall away from Americans living in  territories for something that a foreign country was to pay for in the  beginning.                            ____________________
