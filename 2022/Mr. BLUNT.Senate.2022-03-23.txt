 Exactly.   I am so glad to be here with you, Senator Stabenow. We have been  friends for a long time and have worked together on a number of issues  both in the House, to which we came at the same time, and in the  Senate, when I got to the Senate.    Clearly, this is one of the things of which, I think, we both have a  strong sense that we have really made a difference in not only how we  look at mental health but in also the way we talk about mental health.   To Senator Stabenow's point of treating mental health like all other  health and ``what happens when you do that?'' we got an award last  month when I was home and Senator Stabenow was virtually in Jefferson  City, MO, for a few minutes with the Missouri Behavioral Health  Council, and we received the Excellence in Mental Health award. Brent  McGinty, the head of that council, gave a talk about what they were  doing and what they were seeing from what they were doing.  [[Page S1738]]  Also, we talked about the partnership with community health centers,  another thing we have worked together on.   Joe Pierle and Brent McGinty are actually both here today,  coincidentally, as we are talking about this issue that is so important  to both of them.   I have often thought about the same type of discussion we had in 2013  as Senator Stabenow just pointed out. We went through the Community  Mental Health Act from 1963, and it became apparent that many of the  things that probably should have been closed but were serving a need,  did get closed, but then the support system didn't come in, in the way  that anybody would have envisioned when that came together. I can  remember it in Missouri when some of our mental health facilities or  hospitals were closed, and that was a fine thing if you had what the  bill that President Kennedy signed had in mind and, I think, what we  have had in mind.   One of the things we have looked at is--we have looked at 41 States  now that have some efforts, some unit, of excellence in mental health-- the Certified Community Behavioral Health Centers--in their States.  Maybe it is a big county. Maybe it is a city that was able to qualify  with the 365-days-a-year, 24/7 standards and with the kind of staff  available that you have to have to meet that criteria first. We now  have eight States, including Michigan and Missouri, in this process.   One of the things that is happening in all of those units is keeping  track of the person's other healthcare challenges when you are dealing  with their mental healthcare challenges. The NIH says about one in five  adult Americans has a diagnosable and almost always treatable  behavioral health issue, and one in five adult Americans probably has  other health issues as well. In fact, obviously, they would have.   One of the things we have been trying to keep track of is what  happens in the real, confined healthcare world when you deal with  people's mental health problems like they were any other health  problems. Do they start showing up at appointments more frequently? Do  they take the medicine that they are supposed to take for either  behavioral health issues or other health issues? Are they eating better  or sleeping better or feeling better about themselves? I think it is  pretty clear and totally logical that that would be exactly what  happens.   Another thing we have seen, after the 50 years of whatever happened  in mental health between October 1963 and the day we were on the floor  in 2013, is that, in so many ways, the police department, law  enforcement, and the emergency room became the de facto mental health  system for the country.   We have had people come and be part of the press conferences with us,  Senator Stabenow, when we are talking about fewer people being taken to  the emergency rooms and the importance of having a contact that you can  make or have, maybe, a place that is not only a place to spend the  night but also a place for you and your family so you know that you are  going to have an ongoing opportunity to have a relationship to deal  with your mental health problem just like you would if you had to be  taken to the hospital with other problems.   We have seen some things there, Senator Stabenow, that you may want  to talk about a little bit--everything from the iPad that law  enforcement officers and the crisis intervention team uses in  Springfield, MO, and other places in our State to where they can  immediately link the person they are dealing with up on the screen on  the iPad with the behavioral health counselor who is there any time of  the day--fully manned, 24/7--and see what begins to happen when a  professional is dealing with a person in crisis.    I have seen that happen, and I am sure I was there with, probably,  the best crisis intervention center person the police department had.  You can tell the difference when they start looking at that screen and  talking to somebody who is always a behavioral health specialist but  also who is just a little bit removed and is totally prepared to enter  into that discussion. We have had lots of people talk about the impact  on departments and emergency rooms, Senator Stabenow.    Well, we are.   As to what you were talking about with getting people into the  healthcare system instead of the criminal justice system, it is,  obviously, one of the goals we should have.   Missouri's really got started in January 2017, and in the first 4  years in these certified centers, they served more than 150,000  Missourians and more than 3,500 veterans. That was a 41-percent  increase over the 4 years of not being in the program to being in the  program. Not only is it able to serve people, but because of the way  this is set up, you are able to serve people so much more quickly. You  are able to have the staff that you can have because you know you have  got the funding you need to have the staff--largely, this is an  increase of the Medicaid coverage, but the other Medicaid costs go down  more than the behavioral health costs add to the system.    We have always known that this was the right thing to do--right thing  to do in the long run, right thing to do for police officers, right  thing to do for the emergency room, right thing to do for the prison  system, right thing to do for the people being at work.   I think what we are showing here is, not only is it the right thing  to do and  [[Page S1739]]  saves money over time, but it is the right thing to do and largely pays  for itself and maybe more than pays for itself within the immediate  context of healthcare; and that is one of the things we are looking at.   What we saw in the last 2 years with COVID was the real crisis that  became part of that healthcare crisis with a mental health crisis, of  isolation, of people who developed some kind of dependency. If you  don't have a mental health problem before you become dependent on  opioids or something else, you have one as soon as you become dependent  on those. The suicide numbers went up.   Having a structure in place ready to reach out and man the suicide  hotline to get people to where they need to get--there is no waiting  list for somebody who is thinking about doing harm to themselves or  others. We need to have a society where we understand that is an  immediate problem; it has to be dealt with immediately; and it is a  societal--not only a societal goal, but, actually, it should be one of  our primary responsibilities in this society. And I think that is what  we are seeing here over and over again, Senator Stabenow.    I think in almost--in all of the States, once they get  this fully running the way they hope it will, that everybody who needs  to be seen the first day is seen the first day.    There may be an occasional evaluation where you talk to  somebody and realize this is something that you don't have to put at  the very front of that day's line; but if you need to be at the front  of the line, you get to go to the front of the line. If you need to be  seen the first day, you get to be seen the first day. No more 7-day  waiting period for a crisis moment.    People still may have to occasionally wait and come back  tomorrow or come back Wednesday or whatever the schedule might be--and  I think that is critically important.   Now, Senator Stabenow, what you and I are trying to do is to further  expand the opportunity. You know, the President said in his State of  the Union message:         Let's get all Americans the mental health services they       need.    That is a quote: ``Let's get all Americans the mental health services  they need.'' That was a goal in the President's State of the Union  message; it should be a significant goal for the country.   What we would like to see happen in this Congress is the expansion of  excellence in mental health to every State that wants to do it.  Initially, we had 24 States apply to be part of the 8 pilot States.  Nineteen of them went all the way through that entire process.   You know, all 50 States may not apply, but we would like to create an  environment where all 50 States could apply.   Frankly, every time we get a score on this bill, the score is a  little lower than it was before because I think the facts are beginning  to persuade even the Congressional Budget Office that this makes  economic sense to do. And there may be some startup costs, but the  long-term costs may be actually long-term savings. If you do the right  thing and save money while you are doing it, Mr. President, that is a  pretty good place to be in for a society or a government or a country;  and that is what we are trying to get done, Senator Stabenow, in this  Congress.    Right. Right.    You can have a community behavioral health center working  with a primary care center or you could have an independent provider  working with their other healthcare provider or vice versa. It is very  interchangeable.   The one criteria for the certified community behavioral health  centers is the level of staffing--24/7, 365 days a year, always  available to be that critically important partner that people with a  mental health challenge need. And, frankly, their families and people  who care about them need it as well.    This is a big challenge for the individual that has a  behavioral health problem, but it can be an equally big challenge for  people who care about them.    We are, too.   Mr. President, we look forward to you joining us in this effort.
