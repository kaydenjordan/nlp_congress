 Mr. Speaker, I think about my wife, Andrea, and I  when we go to take a couple days away from the kids and we leave our 4- year-old with his grandparents, how heartbreaking it is to even leave  that kid when you are leaving him with grandparents.   I think about my great-grandparents, who came here from Italy as  immigrants. I think about the 13 years of Catholic school that I  attended. I think about the conversations in Washington, D.C., about  family values.   And then I think about how, in the most powerful country in the  world, our governmental policy is to strip kids--babies, toddlers,  infants--from their parents. The most powerful country in the world has  resorted to this nonsense. This is a joke.   It is by choice, Mr. Speaker. This is a choice that the most powerful  men in the most powerful country are choosing to take poor kids away  from their parents.   It is time for this most powerful President to act immediately and  stop the American carnage.                            ____________________
