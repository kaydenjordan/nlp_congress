 Mr. President, I intend to offer the following motion to  H.R. 1, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  The motion is supported by Senators Van Hollen and Warner.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                     Motion To Commit With Instructions         Mr. Carper moves to commit the bill H.R. 1 to the Committee       on Finance with instructions to report the same back to the       Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which the Senate is       not in session, with changes that--        (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and        (2) reduce incentives for companies to shift production and       jobs overseas by enacting a more effective minimum tax on       foreign profits that broadens the applicable income subject       to this tax and that applies this tax on a country-by-country       basis.
