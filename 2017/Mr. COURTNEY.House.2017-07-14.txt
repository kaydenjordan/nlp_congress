 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment  that is offered by my good friend from Alabama (Mr. Byrne).   I would just note that this is an amendment that has been around the  last couple Congresses, and the intent clearly is to carve out a larger  exemption from the longshoremen's act which is a law that goes back to  1927.   I would note that if that is the intent, the language of this  amendment actually is kind of like legislating with a chainsaw instead  of a scalpel because by carving out a larger exemption for recreational  vessels above or beyond 55 feet long, basically there is a whole series  of Coast Guard rules and regulations that have been enforced by the  Coast Guard for many years that this amendment, unfortunately, is going  to sweep up and undermine, including the rules related to alcohol on  board vessels, waste management, Coast Guard inspection categories,  vessel sales to non-U.S. citizens, tonnage taxes, and safety management  systems.   The Coast Guard is out there every single day making sure that these  rules which really protect our ports and make sure that particularly  foreign, large, super yachts are paying their fair share, in terms of  the costs of environmental protection, and boating safety is enforced.  That is, again, what this amendment will undermine.   That is why last year the Coast Guard issued a statement pointing out  the fact that because of the broad sweep of the language of this  amendment, it is really undermining some key missions that the Coast  Guard has been doing for decades for the American people.   So I would note that, at the outset, obviously there is, I think,  another  [[Page H5837]]  issue which is just as significant which is undermining the  longshoremen's act which goes back to Calvin Coolidge. It recognizes  the fact that the folks who are engaged in longshoremen activity but  also shipyard construction are engaged in a very high-risk type of  occupation.   The longshoremen's act was a recognition that State workers'  compensation systems, because of the fact that they varied up and down  in terms of protections, really required a Federal minimum standard.  That is really something that has obviously withstood the test of time  over the last 90 years.   Again, if you look at the data, people who were involved in shipyard  work, their risk of injury is much higher than many other occupations.   I am a proud Representative from a district that has the second  largest employment level in shipbuilding according to the American  Shipbuilding Association, and these folks are dealing with processes,  equipment, and parts that, again, really are much higher risk than even  aerospace or other forms of manufacturing.   Mr. Chairman, I think what we ought to do is stick to the Coast Guard  definition of what a recreational vessel is because that has been on  the books for many years, and it is something that I think all of us  should listen closely to in terms of evaluating this amendment.   I think also we should recognize that we can build a great American  shipbuilding sector in this country for commercial and recreational  vessels, but we should not do it on the backs of worker protection.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Virginia (Mr. Scott) who is a colleague from another great  shipbuilding district and also the ranking member of the Education and  the Workforce Committee.     Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  0915     Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
