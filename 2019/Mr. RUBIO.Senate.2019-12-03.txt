 Madam President, as the chairman of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  a small business that exemplifies the unique American entrepreneurial  spirit. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy: creating  jobs, fostering economic growth, and providing services to their local  communities. This week, it is my pleasure to honor a small business  that exemplifies these qualities, Tomato Express of Kissimmee, FL.   More than 28 years ago, the Siracuza family decided to immigrate to  the United States, leaving behind their home in Argentina and bringing  with them the hope of achieving the American dream. When Pedro, Stella,  and Luis Siracuza arrived in Florida, they discovered that quality  Hispanic foods were difficult to find in their Kissimmee community.  This observation marked the beginning of their entrepreneurial journey.  In November 1991, the Siracuzas opened the first Tomato Express, a  small produce stand selling local fruits and vegetables. As Kissimmee's  Hispanic population grew, Tomato Express's business expanded until  their produce stand became too small to support their customer base and  sales numbers. After securing private funding and a Small Business  Administration loan, the Siracuza family was able to grow from a small  produce stand into a larger grocery store.   Today, Tomato Express still focuses on their original vision,  supplying quality Hispanic foods for their community. The Tomato  Express grocery store now offers locally sourced fruit, vegetables,  meat, and imported beers and wines. In its deli and bakery, Tomato  Express offers various homemade Hispanic dishes from both Central and  South America, but its main focus remains authentic Argentinian  cuisine.   The Siracuza family has been recognized for their part in making  Kissimmee the dynamic and innovative community that it is today. In  2016, the Osceola Chamber of Commerce presented Stella Siracuza with  the Compadre Award commemorating her numerous contributions to the  Hispanic community. As a family-owned business, Tomato Express is  dedicated to giving back to the community that is their home. For  example, Tomato Express is a devoted sponsor to Orlando's Community  Vision, Inc., which aims to allocate resources to solve the community's  complex issues with innovative solutions. The Siracuzas' expansion and  success of Tomato Express has also inspired entrepreneurs in their  community to open Hispanic food businesses.   Today, the Siracuza family's initiative and passion has made them a  vital part of the Kissimmee community and economy. The Siracuzas'  entrepreneurial journey is a key example of the success that can be  achieved through dignified work. I offer my sincere congratulations to  the Siracuza family and the entire team at Tomato Express, and I look  forward to watching your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
