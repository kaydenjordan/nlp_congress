 Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget  scorekeeping report for July 2019. The report compares current-law  levels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate agreed to  in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, BBA18. This information is  necessary for the Senate Budget Committee to determine whether  budgetary points of order lie against pending legislation. The  Republican staff of the Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget  Office, CBO, prepared this report pursuant to section 308(b) of the  Congressional Budget Act, CBA.   This is my sixth scorekeeping report this year. My last filing can be  found in the Congressional Record for June 26, 2019. The information  included in this report is current through July 26, 2019.   Since my last filing, Congress has cleared four pieces of legislation  with significant budgetary effects. The first, the Emergency  Supplemental Appropriations for Humanitarian Assistance and Security at  the Southern Border Act, 2019, P.L. 116-26, provided nearly $4.6  billion in emergency funding to address needs at the Nation's southern  border. The second measure with significant budgetary effects, P.L.  116-29, provided for a 2-week extension of the Medicaid community  health services demonstration program. The third, the Protecting  Affordable Mortgages for Veterans Act of 2019, P.L. 116-33, revises  loan seasoning requirements related to a refinanced Veterans Affairs  housing loan. The fourth, the Never Forget the Heroes: James Zadroga,  Ray Pfeifer, and Luis Alvarez Permanent Authorization of the September  11th Victim Compensation Fund Act, P.L. 116-34, appropriates such sums  as necessary for the Victims Compensation Fund to pay claims to  eligible victims through fiscal year 2029 and fully compensate  claimants who have received reduced awards in the past because of  declining balances in the fund.  [[Page S5236]]    Budget Committee Republican staff prepared Tables A-C.   Table A gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee  exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays  under the fiscal year 2019 enforceable levels filing required by BBA18.  This information is used for enforcing committee allocations pursuant  to section 302 of the CBA. For this reporting period, 9 of the 16  authorizing committees are not in compliance with their allocations.  Over the current 10-year enforceable window, authorizing committees  have increased outlays by a combined $13.0 billion. Of the bills  clearing Congress this reporting period, P.L. 116-34 added to the  Judiciary Committee's existing violations, including an increase in  spending of $9.4 billion over the 10-year window, P.L. 116-33 reduced  the Banking Committee's allocation violation by $3 million in each  enforceable window, and P.L. 116-29 added $5 million to the Finance  Committee's existing fiscal year 2019 violations.   Table B provides the amount by which the Senate Committee on  Appropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This  information is used to determine points of order related to the  spending caps found in sections 312 and 314 of the CBA. Appropriations  for fiscal year 2019, displayed in this table, show that the  Appropriations Committee is compliant with spending limits for the  current fiscal year. Those limits for regular discretionary spending  are $647 billion for accounts in the defense category and $597 billion  for accounts in the nondefense category of spending.   The fiscal year 2018 budget resolution contained points of order  limiting the use of changes in mandatory programs in appropriations  bills, CHIMPs. Table C, which tracks the CHIMP limit of $15 billion for  fiscal year 2019, shows the Appropriations Committee has enacted $15  billion worth of full-year CHIMPs for this fiscal year.   In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican  staff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget  totals approved by Congress.   For fiscal year 2019, CBO estimates that current-law levels are $2.9  billion above and $3.3 billion below enforceable levels for budget  authority and outlays, respectively. These levels were adjusted to  accommodate the budget authority and outlay effects of P.L. 116-26, as  that funding was designated as an emergency and qualified for an  equivalent and concurrent increase in enforceable levels under existing  statute. Revenues are $426 million below the level assumed in the  budget resolution. Further, Social Security revenues are at the levels  assumed for fiscal year 2019, while Social Security outlays are $4  million above assumed levels for the budget year.   CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate  pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. The PAYGO scorecard shows deficit increases  in fiscal year 2019 of $1,959 million, $427 million revenue loss,  $1,532 million outlay increase; over the fiscal year 2018-2023 period  of $3,409 million, $907 million revenue loss, $2,502 million outlay  increase; and over the fiscal year 2018-2028 period of $797 million,  $798 million revenue loss, $1 million outlay decrease. During this  reporting period, P.L. 116-33 reduced the deficit by $3 million over  the fiscal year 2019, fiscal year 2018-2023, and fiscal year 2018-2028  periods, and P.L. 116-29 increased the deficit by $5 million in fiscal  year 2019. P.L. 116-34's budgetary effects are not included in this  table or the PAYGO scorecard pursuant to the direction included in the  statutory text.   This submission also includes a table tracking the Senate's budget  enforcement activity on the floor since the enforcement filing on May  7, 2018. Since my last report, no new budgetary points of order were  raised.   All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   TABLE A.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--ENACTED DIRECT SPENDING ABOVE                    (+) OR BELOW (-) BUDGET RESOLUTIONS                         [In millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                             2019    2019-2023  2019-2028 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry:     Budget Authority....................     2,414      4,249      3,123     Outlays.............................     1,401      1,797         70 Armed Services:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs:     Budget Authority....................        18        282        379     Outlays.............................        17        282        379 Commerce, Science, and Transportation:     Budget Authority....................        41         77         91     Outlays.............................        11         74         90 Energy and Natural Resources:     Budget Authority....................         0        -10        -24     Outlays.............................         0        -10        -24 Environment and Public Works:     Budget Authority....................         2          4       -333     Outlays.............................         2          4       -333 Finance:     Budget Authority....................       383      1,078     -1,090     Outlays.............................       164      1,070     -1,093 Foreign Relations:     Budget Authority....................         0         -5        -20     Outlays.............................         0         -5        -20 Homeland Security and Governmental  Affairs:     Budget Authority....................         0          2          4     Outlays.............................        43         48         49 Judiciary:     Budget Authority....................        13      6,361      9,944     Outlays.............................        13      6,357      9,939 Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:     Budget Authority....................         0        -36        -84     Outlays.............................         0        -36        -84 Rules and Administration:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          1     Outlays.............................         0          0          1 Intelligence:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Veterans' Affairs:     Budget Authority....................         4         79       -335     Outlays.............................     4,402      4,476      4,062 Indian Affairs:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0 Small Business:     Budget Authority....................         0          0          0     Outlays.............................         0          0          0                                          -------------------------------     Total:         Budget Authority................     2,875     12,081     11,656         Outlays.........................     6,053     14,057     13,036 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   TABLE B.--SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE--ENACTED REGULAR DISCRETIONARY                            APPROPRIATIONS \1\                [Budget authority, in millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                       2019                                        ---------------------------------                                           Security \2\   Nonsecurity \2\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Statutory Discretionary Limits........          647,000          597,000             Amount Provided by Senate Appropriations Subcommittee   Agriculture, Rural Development, and                   0           23,042  Related Agencies.....................

Hon. Mike Enzi,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of       Congressional action on the fiscal year 2019 budget and is       current through July 26, 2019. This report is submitted under       section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional       Budget Act, as amended.        The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues       are consistent with the allocations, aggregates, and other       budgetary levels printed in the Congressional Record on May       7, 2018, pursuant to section 30103 of the Bipartisan Budget       Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-123).        Since our last letter dated June 26, 2019, the Congress has       cleared and the President has signed the following       legislation that has significant effects on budget authority       and outlays in fiscal year 2019:        A bill to provide for a 2-week extension of the Medicaid       community mental health services demonstration program, and       for other purposes (Public Law 116-29);        Protecting Affordable Mortgages for Veterans Act of 2019       (Public Law 116-33); and  [[Page S5237]]         Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Humanitarian       Assistance and Security at the Southern Border Act, 2019       (Public Law 116-26).

Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include   $781 million in budget authority and $770 million in estimated outlays. c For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as   approved by the Senate, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a   result, amounts in this current level report do not include those items. d The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-5), as amended, extended several immigration programs   through February 15, 2019, that would otherwise have expired at the end of fiscal year 2018. The estimated   budgetary effects of those previously enacted extensions are charged to the Committee on Appropriations, and   are included in the budgetary effects of P.L. 116-6 shown in the ``Appropriation Legislation'' portion of this   report. In addition, division H of P.L. 116-6 further extended those same programs through the end of fiscal   year 2019. Consistent with the language in title III of division H of P.L. 116-6, and at the direction of the   Senate Committee on the Budget, the budgetary effects of extending those immigration programs for the   remainder of the fiscal year are charged to the relevant authorizing committees, and are shown in the   ``Authorizing Legislation'' portion of this report. e Section 30103 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 requires the Chair of the Senate Committee on the Budget to   publish the aggregate spending and revenue levels for fiscal year 2019; those aggregate levels were first   published in the Congressional Record on May 7, 2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also allows the Chair   of the Senate Committee on the Budget to revise the budgetary aggregates:                                                                         Budget                                                                   Authority         Outlays          Revenues ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Original Aggregates Printed on May 7, 2018:..................        3,547,094        3,508,052        2,590,496 Revisions:     Pursuant to sections 311 and 314(a) of the Congressional               921                0                0      Budget Act of 1974......................................
