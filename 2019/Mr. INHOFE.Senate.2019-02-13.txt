 Mr. President, I am here to speak today with a  heavy heart from the sudden and untimely passing of my dear friend and  confidant, Bill Burgess of Lawton, OK.   Bill spent his entire life in service to Oklahoma and the Nation, and  his loss will be felt throughout the State.   Bill was a talented attorney, businessman, and civic leader. Among  many different titles Bill held throughout his career, he served the  State he loved on the Oklahoma Board of Regents for Higher Education  and the University of Oklahoma Board of Regents.   Bill was widely recognized and respected as one of Oklahoma's  outstanding leaders, and he was inducted into both the Oklahoma Hall of  Fame and the Oklahoma Higher Education Hall of Fame.   As a businessman who developed the largest software engineering  company in Oklahoma and the owner and publisher of the Lawton  Constitution, Bill was admired for his entrepreneurial ability and  success. A tireless advocate for Oklahoma business, he served stints as  chairman of both the Oklahoma State Chamber of Commerce and the  Oklahoma Business Roundtable.   I worked closely with Bill in his role as civilian aide to the  Secretary to the Army and am so thankful to have a man of such  integrity, character, and grit in this position.   If you spent any time at all around Bill, you were sure to know that  he was the son of a sergeant major, the ``backbone of the Army.''  Friends say that growing up in the house of a non-commissioned officer  gave him a love not only for the Army but also for the enlisted men and  women who serve their country.   Bill was incredibly proud of his dad's service to our Nation and  continued that tradition of service. No one loved, admired, and  supported our men and women in uniform more than Bill.   Kay and I are praying for Bill's family, friends, and many loved ones  in this extremely hard time. Bill was an exceptional leader, a loving  father, and an incomparable friend.   I am blessed to have known him, and he will be sorely missed by  myself and the rest of Oklahoma.                            ____________________
