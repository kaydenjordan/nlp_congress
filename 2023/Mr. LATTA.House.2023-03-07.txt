 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1123) to direct the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for  Communications and Information to submit to Congress a report examining  the cybersecurity of mobile service networks, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1123         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Understanding Cybersecurity       of Mobile Networks Act''.       SEC. 2. REPORT ON CYBERSECURITY OF MOBILE SERVICE NETWORKS.         (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the Assistant Secretary, in       consultation with the Department of Homeland Security, shall       submit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House       of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science,       and Transportation of the Senate a report examining the       cybersecurity of mobile service networks and the       vulnerability of such networks and mobile devices to       cyberattacks and surveillance conducted by adversaries.        (b) Matters To Be Included.--The report required by       subsection (a) shall include the following:        (1) An assessment of the degree to which providers of       mobile service have addressed, are addressing, or have not       addressed cybersecurity vulnerabilities (including       vulnerabilities the exploitation of which could lead to       surveillance conducted by adversaries) identified by academic       and independent researchers, multistakeholder  [[Page H1129]]       standards and technical organizations, industry experts, and       Federal agencies, including in relevant reports of--        (A) the National Telecommunications and Information       Administration;        (B) the National Institute of Standards and Technology; and        (C) the Department of Homeland Security, including--        (i) the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency;       and        (ii) the Science and Technology Directorate.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 1123, the Understanding Cybersecurity of  Mobile Networks Act.   In recent years, we have seen a rise in large-scale cybersecurity  attacks that put Americans at risk. While mobile service providers take  numerous steps to address vulnerabilities in their networks, threats to  our mobile networks continue to exist.   To sufficiently address threats across networks, Congress needs a  sophisticated and comprehensive assessment of what vulnerabilities  persist, what issues have been resolved, and where mobile cybersecurity  policymaking should be focused.   The Understanding Cybersecurity of Mobile Networks Act requires the  National Telecommunications and Information Administration, NTIA, to  submit to Congress a comprehensive report examining the cybersecurity  of existing wireless networks and vulnerabilities to cyberattacks and  surveillance by adversaries.   This bipartisan bill will ensure that communication networks are safe  and protect the privacy and security of the American people.   I thank the gentlewoman from California's 16th District (Ms. Eshoo)  and the gentlewoman from Florida's Third District (Mrs. Cammack) for  leading this bipartisan legislation, and I urge my colleagues to  support it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Mrs. Cammack).    Mr. Speaker, cyberattacks are increasing in this country,  not decreasing. Again, that is why this bipartisan bill will ensure  that communications networks are safe and that they will protect the  privacy and security of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this very important legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
