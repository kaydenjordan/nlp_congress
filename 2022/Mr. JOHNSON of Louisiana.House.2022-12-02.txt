 Mr. Speaker, I rise to thank my defense  fellow, Jay Hurst, for a year of exceptional service to our office and  to our Nation.   Jay joined us in January, and he has enriched our office with his  invaluable insights and great company. He was instrumental in the NDAA  process and meeting with Members and staffers from offices across  Capitol Hill, and achieving great wins for our State, Louisiana, and  our country.   Although he was only with us for a year, Jay instantly became like  family to us, mentoring our interns and making complex military issues  understandable for staff. In his spare time--he didn't have much--he  also published scholarly articles on military matters on a number of  pressing policy questions.   Jay is leaving us for the Pentagon, where he will undoubtedly carry  on the high standard of excellence that he brought to our office. My  friend will be missed and prayed for. I thank him for all of his  service.                            ____________________
