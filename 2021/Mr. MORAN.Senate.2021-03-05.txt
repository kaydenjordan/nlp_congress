 Mr. President, I call up my amendment 1342 and ask that it  be reported by number.    I ask unanimous consent for 3 minutes of debate equally  divided.    My colleagues, I arise here at the request of many  veterans service organizations and veterans across the country who have  called for a long time for us to protect our military and veteran  students and close the 90-10 loophole.   What was once a partisan discussion is becoming a bipartisan  discussion, and while the American Rescue Plan closes the 90-10  loophole, we need to make sure we do it in the right way, make these  changes in the correct way,  [[Page S1246]]  and we need to ensure we put the policy back in the perspective of not  politics but the right answer.   I am thankful to my colleagues Senators Carper, Cassidy, and Lankford  for putting politics aside and working on this amendment with me. I  also want to thank Chairman Murray and Ranking Member Burr and their  staffs, as well as the veteran groups and the stakeholders, for their  help in crafting this amendment.   By providing a 6-month delay before the start of a negotiated  rulemaking process, Congress now has time to work together with our  veterans service organizations and the higher education community on a  bipartisan plan to deliver reasonable and needed protections for  veterans and taxpayers alike.   I ask my colleagues to join us in support of our bipartisan amendment  and continue to work with us on a path forward this Congress.   I yield to the Senator from Delaware    Mr. President, while the Senator from Delaware stole my  thunder, I believe this amendment can pass by voice vote, and I would  add the request that all of the amendments that follow this follow the  same precedent.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1342     Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 1154 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 minutes of  debate equally divided.    Mr. President, amendment No. 1154 is on community care  funding within the Department of Veterans Affairs. The VA has estimated  that it needs $13.4 billion for medical care. This bill provides $14.4  billion in care, but it currently limits how much money can be spent  within that care for community care. So we generally have all the care  within the VA, but sometimes people are referred out to the community,  sometimes there is telehealth, and sometimes the care actually occurs  in a VA facility.   This would eliminate that cap of $4.4 billion and replace it with  spending up to $5 billion on community care, the amount that it is  expected the VA will need. Again, this amendment removes this arbitrary  funding barrier, and it also includes additional dollars for  maintenance at our VA medical centers.   I retain the balance of my time.    Mr. President, the MISSION Act allows for the veteran and  the VA to make the decision where the care should occur.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1154     I ask for the yeas and nays.  [[Page S1260]]
