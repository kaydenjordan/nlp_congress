 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their support of  this important bill that I am providing here to the House today.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about a great gentleman, one who  fought for his community and who is so deserving to have the Statesboro  VA clinic named after him, as was stated, Sergeant Major Ray Hendrix.   For those of you who are not aware of the life and legacy of Ray  Hendrix, I would like to take some time here today to recognize the  impact he had on so many lives in the State of Georgia and nationwide.   Ray Hendrix spent his entire life serving this great country. After  42 years of putting his life on the line in the U.S. Army, where he  fought in the Korean war, his service was long from over.   As an active member of the American Legion, Ray continued to find  ways to help his country and community, serving in several leadership  posts at local, State, and national levels.   While working with the American Legion, Ray handed out wheelchairs,  walkers, crutches, and flags to public schools in his community. He  also organized an efficient bus system in Augusta and Dublin, both  located in Georgia's 12th District, that would transport veterans to  the Charlie Norwood VA and Carl Vinson VA to receive needed treatment.   Continuing his work, Ray saw a need for a VA clinic right in his  hometown of Statesboro. He worked diligently to collect 5,000  signatures from folks in his community to demonstrate the need for a VA  clinic close to home.   Ray then took his actions a step further by advocating for this cause  to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs right here in Washington,  D.C. He was also appointed to the Veterans Service Board by three  consecutive Georgia Governors: Governor Roy Barnes in 2001, Governor  Sonny Perdue in 2008, and Governor Nathan Deal in 2015. He served three  terms as the board chairman and is survived by his wife, Mary, three  children, 10 grandchildren, and 9 great-grandchildren.   As a veteran, public servant, and Bulloch County native for over 75  years, it is my hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting the  effort to rename the VA clinic in Statesboro, Georgia, after a man who  is truly deserving.   With the support of Georgia Senators and Representatives, as well as  the Georgia Southern Student Veterans Association, and many others, I  cannot think of a better or more worthy man to have his service to our  Nation and his community honored at the top of the VA clinic in  Statesboro, Georgia.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in passing my  bill, H.R. 3946, to rename the Statesboro VA the Ray Hendrix Veterans  Clinic.                                General Leave
