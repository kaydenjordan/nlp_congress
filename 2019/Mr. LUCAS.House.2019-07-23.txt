 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, research shows that early exposure to science,  technology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science has positive  impacts on a broad spectrum of student outcomes. For example, early  math knowledge not only predicts later math success; it also predicts  later reading achievement.   Studies have also found that children who engage in scientific  activities from an early age develop positive attitudes towards science  and are more likely to pursue STEM expertise and careers.   H.R. 1665, the Building Blocks of STEM Act, directs the National  Science Foundation to support STEM education research focused on early  childhood and to award grants to encourage young girls to pursue  computer science learning.   Across the country, the share of STEM jobs has expanded  significantly, with STEM employment increasing from 9.7 million to 17.3  million from 1990 to 2018.   Data suggests that this trend will continue, and the U.S. is  struggling to meet that demand. To meet it, we must engage children-- particularly young girls--in STEM in early childhood and sustain that  interest as they grow.   More graduates with STEM degrees means more advanced American  technologies and a more robust economy.   But it is not just about the economy. STEM graduates have the  potential to develop technologies that could save thousands of lives,  jump-start a new industry, or even discover new worlds.   By supporting more hands-on STEM engagement for younger ages, we are  supporting and investing in America's future.   In the 115th Congress, the House passed this legislation unanimously,  and I hope it will do so again today. I want to thank Representative  Baird and Representative Stevens for reintroducing this bipartisan bill  and moving it forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Baird).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  close.   The love of learning starts young, and the Building Blocks of STEM  bill promotes this by prioritizing a focus on early childhood STEM  education. It gives us the opportunity to encourage girls to get and  stay engaged in STEM, helping us to improve our educational programs  and diversify the STEM workforce.   I, again, thank Representative Baird and Representative Stevens for  reintroducing this bipartisan bill.   As the House did in 2015, I encourage this body to support and pass  this legislation unanimously.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 2397, the American Manufacturing  Leadership Act. This legislation reauthorizes and amends the bipartisan  Revitalize American Manufacturing Innovation Act of 2014.   Nationally, manufacturing supports nearly 13 million American jobs,  or roughly 9 percent of the workforce, and represents about 11 percent  of the American economy. Most of these firms are small manufacturers,  supporting local economies by providing well-paying jobs.   Technology will continue to change this sector dramatically. Today's  manufacturing floor looks far different from the assembly lines of the  past, and the skills needed by manufacturing workers will continue to  change.   Innovative processes, such as additive manufacturing, are  transforming the future of manufacturing. It is essential that these  technologies are transferred to and adopted by all U.S. manufacturers  so that we remain globally competitive and the number one destination  for companies looking to carry out advanced manufacturing.   With manufacturers in the United States performing 64 percent of all  private sector R&D in the Nation, it is important that we capitalize on  these investments and reauthorize the network of public-private  partnerships established in this act, which bolster manufacturing  innovation.   This bill includes important reforms to better coordinate centers for  manufacturing innovation funded by all relevant agencies and  incorporates recommendations made by the Government Accountability  Office to improve management. This bill also prioritizes manufacturing  workforce development and outreach to small and medium-sized  manufacturers.   I thank Representative Stevens and Representative Balderson for  introducing this legislation and for their work in ushering it through  the Science Committee on a bipartisan basis. I encourage my colleagues  to support this legislation.   I would note to my colleague that I have no other speakers so, as I  reserve my time, when the gentlewoman is prepared, I will close.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  close.   I rise again in support of H.R. 2397, the American Manufacturing  Leadership Act. This bipartisan legislation takes important steps to  reform the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of  2014.   It requires greater coordination among the centers for manufacturing  innovation and incorporating GAO recommendations on the management of  these centers. Most importantly, this bill prioritizes manufacturing  workforce development and outreach to small- and medium-sized  manufacturers.   These public-private partnerships combine the technical knowledge  base supported by our excellent universities and research institutions  with innovation leadership supported by our private industries, both  large and small. These centers provide the U.S. with the opportunity to  lead the world in advanced manufacturing competitiveness.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 3153, the Expanding Findings for Federal Opioid Research and  Treatment, or EFFORT, Act identifies gaps that exist in research of the  prevention and treatment of opioid addiction and authorizes the  National Science Foundation to support research grants in these areas.   This legislation will help drive research to understand one of the  most important issues facing our country: How do we stop the opioid  addiction crisis?   Congress must do all we can to combat opioid abuse and the continuing  increase in opioid-related deaths.   In 2017, more than 70,000 people died from drug overdoses, and  approximately 68 percent of those deaths involved opioids. With my home  State of Oklahoma being one of the leading States in opioid  prescriptions, I believe supporting programs intended to improve our  understanding of the science of addiction and combat this crisis is  just common sense.   I thank Representative Jennifer Wexton and Representative  Jim Baird  for their bipartisan work on this bill. Opioid addiction affects too  many in our communities, and I applaud this effort to support more  basic research in the science of addiction.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all the Members of this body to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Baird).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I might  consume. I have no additional speakers.   I rise again in support of H.R. 3153, the EFFORT Act.   Opioid addiction knows no economic or political boundaries. It  affects all of us.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Representative Wexton and Representative  Baird for their bipartisan leadership on this bill. I strongly urge my  colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I might consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 36, the Combating Sexual  Harassment in Science Act of 2019. I am proud to say that this bill is  a foundation of more than a year of investigation, analysis, and  recommendations to the Science, Space, and Technology Committee.   Curbing sexual misconduct in science is a priority that Chairwoman  Johnson and I share.   Engaging more women in STEM studies and careers is essential to  American competitiveness. Women make up half the workforce, but account  for less than 25 percent of America's STEM workforce.   Unfortunately, too many women have been driven out of STEM careers  due to a culture of harassment and abuse.   H.R. 36 takes the first steps to address this problem. The bill  directs the NSF to expand research efforts to better understand the  causes and consequences of sexual harassment affecting individuals in  the scientific, technical, engineering, and mathematics workforce.   Additionally, it directs the NSF to examine policies to reduce the  prevalence and negative impact of such harassment.   The bill also supports the adoption of uniform guidance across the  Federal science agencies to reduce the prevalence of sexual harassment  involving grant personnel.   There is an established legal process in place within higher  education and in the workplace for handling claims of sexual  harassment. I cannot stress this enough: This bill does not alter that  process.   What this bill does is to create a uniform policy for universities  and research institutions to report to Federal science agencies when  administrative action is taken that impacts the ability of a researcher  to carry out a grant.   Pervasive sexual harassment in the scientific community discourages  women from critical work in good-paying jobs and hurts American  competitiveness.   It is unacceptable for taxpayer dollars to fund researchers who are  guilty of harassing students or colleagues.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the stakeholders, especially the  university community, for working with the committee staff to improve  this legislation. I believe the revised bill strikes  [[Page H7176]]  the right balance of protecting due process and privacy, while making  sure that Federal science agencies can act if a Federal research grant  or the personnel supported by that grant is impacted.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairwoman Johnson and her staff for  working in a bipartisan and collaborative way to move this legislation  forward.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.   H.R. 36 takes the first steps towards addressing the prevalence of  sexual harassment in STEM fields, which is driving women out of STEM  careers and damaging U.S. competitiveness.   This legislation sends a strong message to the scientific community  that misconduct will not be tolerated, and it sends a message to women  who are in STEM studies and careers that we support them.   I look forward to working with our colleagues in the Senate and  stakeholders to advance this legislation and make sure it is meeting  the intended goals.   Mr. Speaker, I again want to thank Chairwoman Johnson and her staff  for working in a bipartisan and collaborative way on this legislation.  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3196, the Vera C. Rubin  Observatory Designation Act. This bill honors the contributions of the  late Dr. Vera Rubin, an astronomer who made groundbreaking discoveries  in the field of dark matter and contributed to the realization that the  universe is more complex and more mysterious than was ever even  imagined.  [[Page H7177]]    I agree with Chairwoman Johnson that it is fitting that the House  honor Dr. Rubin today on what would have been her 91st birthday. Dr.  Rubin was a pioneer and lifelong advocate for women in science, serving  as a mentor, supporter, and role model for many women astronomers.   The new Large Synoptic Survey Telescope under construction in Chile,  funded by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy,  will photograph the entire sky every few nights. One of the goals of  the project is to study the nature of dark matter and dark energy.   I thank Chairwoman Johnson and Representative Gonzalez-Colon for  their leadership and for working with stakeholders to update this  legislation.   Naming the observatory in honor of Dr. Rubin is a fitting tribute to  her contributions to the field, and I hope it will inspire future  generations of women in astronomy. This bill designates the new NSF and  Department of Energy's LSST telescope facility the Vera C. Rubin  Observatory. Given her remarkable contributions to the field of dark  matter and advocacy for the equal treatment and representation of women  in science, it is only appropriate that we honor Dr. Rubin this way.   I thank Chairwoman Johnson and Representative Gonzalez-Colon for  their leadership in introducing this bill. It is my hope that this will  ensure that Dr. Rubin's legacy lives on and continues to inspire young  women to pursue careers in STEM.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to cosponsor H.R. 34, the Energy and Water  Research Integration Act. This legislation is a product of bipartisan  Science, Space, and Technology Committee efforts to improve our  understanding of the critical relationship between the U.S. energy and  water sectors.   The production of energy is dependent on reliable sources of water,  and the distribution of clean water is dependent on the availability of  energy. No matter what the future U.S. energy market looks like,  integrating these  [[Page H7179]]  two systems is essential. But this is no simple task.   Both water and energy management are often impacted by many regional  challenges and resources and require careful consideration of local  factors. For example, back home in Oklahoma, agriculture is the single  largest driver of water consumption in the State. But that same  agricultural industry also creates a source of energy through biofuels.   Additionally, natural gas production, which is key to the development  of a cleaner U.S. energy market, relies on horizontal drilling and  hydraulic fracturing, processes which require large volumes of water.  But these processes can also produce water, enabling reuse of this  resource through fluid lifecycle management.   The Energy and Water Research Integration Act will help prioritize  research and development on this critical relationship between energy  and water systems and will help American researchers develop tools and  technologies to improve our Nation's energy efficiency, environmental  stability, and economic growth.   I am pleased to see the work that many Federal agencies, including  the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency, are  already doing to improve the efficiency of our energy water systems,  and to see the administration's clear prioritization of this work,  including the multiagency Water Security Grand Challenge and the  recently announced DOE Energy-Water Desalination Hub. But we, in  Congress, must also do our part.   Because of the complex relationship between energy and water systems,  this will require a multidisciplinary approach. At every step of the  R&D process there is a need to facilitate interactions between  chemists, engineers, geologists, and legislators, and to encourage  collaboration between the Federal Government, industry, universities,  and local stakeholders.   I believe this legislation, introduced by Chairwoman Johnson and  myself, can help to streamline and prioritize this work. The programs  authorized in this legislation will leverage the world-leading, early- stage research programs and unparalleled facilities at our national  labs and enable the development of next-generation technologies that  will improve the efficiency and production in both the energy and water  sectors.   I thank my colleagues on the Science, Space, and Technology  Committee, particularly Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, for  continuing to prioritize important research and development programs  that will make America stronger, cleaner, and keep us globally  competitive. I am grateful for the opportunity to continue to work with  my fellow Science, Space, and Technology Committee colleagues to guide  this important and bipartisan work.                                time  1515    H.R. 34 prioritizes critical research to help improve the way we use  energy and water.   I again want to thank Chairwoman Johnson for her leadership on this  bill. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Representative Norman's bill, H.R.  617, the Department of Energy Veterans' Health Initiative Act.   This bill authorizes a critical and ongoing partnership between the  Department of Energy and the Department of Veterans Affairs to improve  the way we diagnose and care for our veterans. This partnership, known  as the MVP-CHAMPION initiative, allows DOE to support the VA in  analyzing healthcare data.   H.R. 617 formally authorizes this program, allowing VA researchers to  gain access to DOE's high-performance computing research facilities and  significant resources, including DOE's extensive expertise in data  analysis and complex modeling.   The VA currently collects genomic and healthcare data, including the  deepest levels of DNA sequencing that allows for high-quality genomic  research, from veterans who have volunteered for the program. This data  is then securely transferred to DOE, where it is stored and analyzed in  a secure site at DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory.   This partnership and exchange of data benefits both DOE and the VA.  The rich and expansive dataset provided by the VA presents an  incredible opportunity to train DOE's next-generation computing  capacities to solve complex challenges; and with what they learn from  this analysis, the VA can improve and better target health treatments  for veterans.   This data can help the VA make discoveries about the causes of  various diseases and develop diagnostics to move more quickly to detect  them in our veterans. It will also help the VA develop more effective  treatments and improve treatment for critical medical needs.   In return, by giving DOE access to such a large database of  information, the VA will help DOE researchers improve their ability to  develop next-generation computing systems, algorithms, and models,  capacities that are critical in maintaining U.S. science and  technological leadership.   These enhanced capacities can then be applied in support of DOE's  core mission areas and has the potential to enhance expertise in  everything from biosciences and material designs to maintaining our  nuclear weapons stockpile.   With the next generation of supercomputers right around the corner,  most notably, the computing systems that DOE is expected to field in  2021, DOE will be able to tackle even bigger challenges after gaining  expertise in solving big data problems like this.   In short, the Department of Energy Veterans' Health Initiative Act  will improve the healthcare for those men and women who have served our  country. It also maximizes our Federal resources for facilitating  collaboration, and gives other agencies, academia, and industry the  chance to benefit from the Department of Energy's R&D expertise.   I want to thank Representative Norman for championing this important  collaboration, along with the basic research that will support our  veterans and American innovation.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Norman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking  Member Lucas for yielding me the time.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 617, the Department of Energy  Veterans' Health Initiative Act, introduced by my colleague,  Congressman Ralph Norman from South Carolina.   I think this bill is very simple, but very essential at the same  time. It essentially authorizes collaboration between the Department of  Energy and the Department of Veterans Affairs to establish a program  that facilitates computing capabilities to process data on health  issues affecting all of our veterans. The bill will subsequently  support the Veterans Administration with identifying potential health  risks and challenges that our communities have.   I think it is important because combining those processing  capabilities with health information compiled by the VA will help us to  better understand the healthcare issues related to our veterans and the  general population as well and ensures that both agencies will remain  at the forefront of scientific and medical research.   I am a proud cosponsor of this bill on behalf of our veterans.  Actually, we have more than 90,000 veterans registered in Puerto Rico,  and we are very grateful to Congressman Ralph Norman for introducing  this bill.   I want to also thank Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking Member Lucas for  their great work together on behalf of the scientific community and our  veterans.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  close, since I have no additional speakers.   Mr. Speaker, simply put, H.R. 617 harnesses the power of DOE's  supercomputers to revolutionize the way we care for America's veterans.   I want to thank Representative Norman for his leadership on this  bill.   I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
