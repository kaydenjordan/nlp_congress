 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the  concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 57) expressing the sense of  Congress supporting the State of Israel.   The Clerk read the title of the concurrent resolution.   The text of the concurrent resolution is as follows:                              H. Con. Res. 57         Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate       concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the State of Israel is not a racist or apartheid state;        (2) Congress rejects all forms of antisemitism and       xenophobia; and        (3) the United States will always be a staunch partner and       supporter of Israel.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, the President of Israel will address this body  in a joint session. It will be a great day in American history as  Representatives of one of the greatest democracies are addressed by the  head of state of another. Democracy and its shared values are at the  very core of the U.S.-Israel relationship.   The beauty of our friendship is that we stand together, shoulder to  shoulder, as we defend our freedom and our way of life from threats  like Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas, and other forms of terrorism.                                time  1545    Let me be clear. Israel is not a racist country. It is deeply  disturbing and concerning to me that some in this body have such a  profound misunderstanding of Israel and Israeli society.   The previous government in Israel had Arab parties and Arab ministers  serving in the coalition government. What a fantastic achievement for  democracy. It is no secret that Israel is a country in a tough  neighborhood that is clear-eyed in seeing many threats in its own  backyard.   The United States will always support Israel's right to self-defense.  We see Israeli citizens being murdered in senseless terrorist attacks.  At times, the fallen have been American citizens.   Israel is responsible for protecting the well-being of its citizens.  Protecting one's citizens from terrorist attacks is not racism. It is  national security. To think otherwise is small-minded, and quite  frankly, Mr. Speaker, it is just plain and simply wrong.   A key component of friendship is looking out for one another and  standing up for each other. Racism has no place in this body or in  public discord, period. I support this resolution rejecting false  accusations and repulsive anti-Israel statements. I stand--and I know  almost everyone in this Chamber stands--with our friends in Israel.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas (Mr. Pfluger) for bringing  this resolution forward. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support  this, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Pfluger), the author of this resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Bacon).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Iowa  (Mr. Nunn).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Miller).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the right to close, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.  [[Page H3673]]    Mr. Speaker, there is nothing progressive about racism. Racism is  ugly. I know my colleague, my dear friend, Mr. Meeks, who is a member  of the Congressional Black Caucus, knows what racism is.   He is also the strongest supporter of Israel.   I know our colleague, John Lewis, knew what racism really is, and  racism is ugly.   Israel is not a racist state. My father was a bombardier in a B-17.  He bombed the Nazis.   Why were we at war with Adolf Hitler and the Nazis?   For many reasons, but, fundamentally, because of their values. They  were anti-Semitic. During the Holocaust, racism, in its ugliest form,  took place in the concentration camps in Europe and, indeed, in  Auschwitz, where I attended to see the horrors of what mankind can do  against mankind.   Why was the State of Israel formed?   Israel was formed out of a racist society to say to the world: No  longer, never forget, and we will not tolerate racism.   Mr. Speaker, 75 years later we stand here in this body celebrating  this democratic state in the Middle East that was formed because of  persecution and because of racism. We do not stand for racism. No one  in this Chamber should stand for racism.    To call Israel, which was formed as a result of racism, anti- Semitism, and hatred, to call that very country a racist state is  repugnant to all of our values.   I think everyone in this Chamber should vote ``yes,'' because as my  dear friend across the aisle knows, racism and anti-Semitism have no  place--no place--not only in this Chamber, but not in America and not  anywhere in the world. Where we see it, we denounce it in its most  ugliest form.   So this is a call to action to defend her and to defend the nation  that was created by primarily the United States and our allies as a  result of the hatred that we saw come out of Nazi Germany.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes,'' and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
