 Madam Speaker, it has been interesting. I get to take my  mask off under the rules now.   We haven't quite caught up with the science here in the House. The  House of Representatives that has leadership proclaiming that we need  to follow the science refuses to do so, so far. But we are hoping we  will eventually get at least the majority of people here to follow the  science.   It has been an interesting time, not a good time, not a wonderful,  enriching time to be in the House of Representatives. It has been an  exceedingly frustrating time.   After January 6, apparently, the number one goal here in the House  was something referred to as optics. According to the Sergeant at Arms,  the reason the National Guard was not brought up in advance on January  6, so there would be no one entering the Capitol that was not desired  to enter the Capitol, was that word, ``optics.''   So, the Capitol Police, doing the best they could, were left to fend  for themselves without the support they needed. It is a big place. But  had the number one concern before January 6 by people here in  Washington, at the Capitol, at least, if that number one concern had  not been optics, there would have been no one coming into the Capitol  that we didn't want to be in the Capitol.   Since then, we have been entertained by all kinds of false  statements, false allegations. It has really been amazing. The number  one thing we keep coming back to is, apparently, it is not about  getting at the truth. It is all about optics.   The top person charged with the safety of Members of Congress, the  head of the Capitol Police, months ago indicated that there was no  intel from any source that any Member of Congress was at risk or a  threat to any other Member of Congress. No Member of Congress was at  risk from another Member of Congress.   Since then, as I understand it, there was an ethics charge leveled at  Marjorie Taylor Greene that she was encouraging a debate with another  Member of Congress and somehow that is apparently an ethics violation.   I had a Democrat some years back come up and threaten to kick my  buttocks. I think he used other language. But had he swung, I might  have filed a complaint.   Here on the House floor, what we have are words. We get into very  heated debates at times because we care deeply about the things we care  deeply about. But those are not assaults.   There have been assaults in the Capitol, and I know memory is  apparently a big question these days, but when the President of the  United States stands right up here at the second level, as Presidents  have since this opened before 1860, and have made speeches--in this  case, it wasn't to a joint session; it was to an invitation-only  session--but he indicated that what happened on January 6 was the worst  attack on democracy since the Civil War.                                time  1200    So being an ongoing student of history since Coach Sam Parker  instilled a love in me for history, especially American history--the  good, the bad, the ugly, the incredible--I have continued to be a  student of American history, and World history as well.   So sometimes it is helpful for those who don't know our history or  can't remember our history to be reminded that since the Civil War put  an end to slavery in America, even though it took an ordained Christian  preacher resolutely, peacefully advocating for civil rights, and that  the Constitution should be used as a document that means what it says.   And as the Declaration of Independence made clear, we are endowed not  by government, but by our creator with certain unalienable rights.   And Dr. King's letters from the Birmingham jail, as he was unjustly  incarcerated, pretty powerful words from a man full of vision. We miss  his vision. I think things would be very different if he were still  alive today. The assassin did great damage to the United States of  America, and the benefits that we would have had from a visionary still  if he were alive today.   Because there are some who say if you even use words to debate, that  somehow you are an insurrectionists, you need to be jailed. And that  has been happening since January 6. In fact, January 6 of 2017, I  believe there were 11 different Democrats that stood up and forcefully  objected to the results and to the electors that were voting for  President Trump.   And there was not a single Republican I ever heard on our side of the  aisle that accused them of trying to overthrow the government,  insurrection--all these things that some of us have been accused of-- simply wanting a fair election in which the votes of tens of millions  of Americans were not disenfranchised. The very same thing even our  current Speaker has said back in prior days about prior elections.   So imagine the shock for those of us who, for the last 20 years, had  been preached to by people on the other side of the aisle about the  unfairness of election, the vulnerability of electronic  [[Page H2349]]  elections, who seemed disgusted that some of us had the same kind of  objections as they had about the election in November.   There is nothing illegal, improper, against the House rules of  objecting, yet we had people on the other side of the aisle who were  encouraging all kinds of punishment for those on this side of the aisle  who did exactly what Democrats have been doing for 20 years or so-- objecting, as they did January 2001. And we saw objection January 6 of  2005.   And these ``woke'' corporations that now want to punish anybody that  objected to potentially--and there is evidence of fraud in the November  2020 election--and those who say there was no fraud in the election are  either doing so knowingly, knowing that it is false what they are  saying, or just because they bought in to what the mainstream/lame- stream media has reported. But there was fraud in that election. There  usually is some fraud in national elections.   And in States where it was somewhat close compared to the number of  people voting, like Arizona, they are doing the right thing. They are  trying to have an audit. And, obviously, the efforts of the audit is  being covered up. There is evidence being destroyed. I guess a bit like  when you have a Secretary of State that destroys evidence that she has,  that has been sought, has it destroyed with a hammer or with BleachBit,  obstruction of justice.   But, fortunately, for some, we had a Justice Department that saw  crimes committed by Democrats that did not need to be pursued or  punished, and things that were not crimes that Republicans did needed  to be punished.   People all across America are naturally going to be upset when they  don't just perceive, they see and know that there is a two-tiered  justice system--one for certain high-place Democrats and one for  Republicans, or those who support Republicans. And Heaven help them if  they support President Donald Trump.   That is what has been so amazing to someone like me, who has been  part of the justice system and seeing the law enforced for so much of  my adult life. It is unbelievable. And hearing from FBI agents around  the country who repeatedly said, if anybody in our office, in this  location, that location, different locations around the country had  done a fraction of the things that were done by top FBI officials in  Washington, D.C., then we would not only have been fired, but they  would have been looking at coming after us with criminal charges. And  they were despondent because they were devoting their lives to justice.   Republican and Democrat prosecutors in different parts of the country  couldn't believe what they were seeing. The injustice coming from what  was supposed to be the Justice Department. And what has happened since  January 6 is quite sickening. It is a war. It is an assault on our  Constitution.   Now, it is not new. Back when Mueller was head of the FBI, and the  inspector general shocked everyone who was paying attention, that there  had been over 3,000 abuses of the national security letter where FBI  agents had just wanted to do fishing expeditions--no crime, no probable  cause. They just wanted information about people when the Constitution  did not permit it.   So they send a national security letter demanding that a bank  accompany an individual, give them all the information on another  American, just because they wanted it. Outrageous. And that, we know,  occurred during President George W. Bush's administration, while  Mueller was FBI Director.   Now, he made a statement: Gee, I will take all the blame.   Well, he should because he created an environment at the FBI that  apparently encouraged lawlessness by top FBI agents. And if you look at  Ted Stevens, Senator from Alaska, who was framed by the FBI, and you  look at what Director Mueller did in the aftermath of finding out if he  did not know all the time before that while it was going on, that Ted  Stevens was framed, that he was not guilty of what was charged.    And the FBI had evidence that he was not guilty, and they covered  that up and they helped create evidence to make it look like he was  guilty. And they saw that he was tried right before his election. And  the loss seemed like it was between 1,000-2,000 votes. He lost his  seat.   The FBI did that. Mueller's FBI did that. And when one FBI agent with  a conscience pointed that out in an affidavit, the injustice that had  occurred by the FBI and his supervisor, well, Mueller's reward for that  FBI's agency was to drive him out of the FBI. And his reward for the  person that--according to the affidavit, helped frame Ted Stevens--was  that that FBI agent was promoted, got a better job with the FBI.   Apparently, Mueller likes people who are quite good at framing  somebody and getting them convicted, because that is what happened.   That should have been all the wake-up call we needed to have a  housecleaning at the top of the FBI, but that didn't happen. So the  abuses got worse during the Obama administration, and you had things  like fast and furious, where people actually encouraged the sale and  distribution of weapons to drug cartels. And no one, even to this day,  has ever been held accountable for that.   In fact, there was a cover-up by the Justice Department then. They  wouldn't let us have the documents so we could see exactly what  happened. In fact, Congress was so inane in its effort to obtain those  documents, that the best job--both on fast and furious and on the  Benghazi cover-up--was done by Judicial Watch. They got more  documentation out of the Justice Department than Congress did, and we  are charged with oversight.   Even when the Republicans had the majority, people were put in place  who did not pursue justice and a cleanup of the Justice Department. So  by the time President Trump came along, he had a number of people at  the top who created the Russia hoax--a fraud.   And as others have said, when the Justice Department and the FBI can  work as effectively at trying to frame the President of the United  States, who happens to be a billionaire, then most of us would be in  severe trouble. And that is the case, and we have seen it in the last  few years.   We have seen a Justice Department--of course, Christopher Wray--my  humble opinion--when he was put in there with a job of cleaning up the  FBI, his idea of cleaning up the FBI was to sweep as much of the dirt  under the rug so that people couldn't see it.   Just like now, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, their  job is not to just secure the border under this administration. Their  job is to now get them away from the border as quickly as possible so  that people don't see them. They are not in the news every night  because they have moved them out.   As the border patrolmen have said, they are looked upon as the  Mexican drug cartels' logistics. The drug cartels get paid money or  agreements to pay money from people they bring, including unaccompanied  minors; and then the U.S. Government is their logistics because the  government ships future drug sailors, traffickers, human traffickers,  sex traffickers. Our U.S. Government ships them around the United  States so that they can get to the town the drug cartels want them  doing their drug trafficking, human trafficking or sex trafficking.                                time  1215    The government has become a part of the process for the drug cartels,  all to the damage and often the death of American citizens.   When Pancho Villa and his minions invaded, I believe it was New  Mexico, John Pershing, General Pershing, was sent down. He had a  lieutenant named Patton. They were sent down to Mexico, even invade  Mexico, going after Pancho Villa and his troops because there were some  families who they killed in New Mexico.   We have thousands of people dying from fentanyl coming from Mexico,  and the answer of this administration, we heard in the last couple of  days, the administration is going to add 13 miles to the wall but  otherwise leave over 1,000 miles without wall.   The answer has not been to secure the border. The answer from this  administration has been to say that the border is secure, when anybody  with eyes to see or ears to hear knows that is not true.   The injustices that have occurred since January 6 appear to be a  continuation of the goal of that one word, ``optics,'' the one word  that prevented our  [[Page H2350]]  leadership from having the National Guard on hand to ensure that the  Capitol was not invaded.   We heard in the Judiciary Committee--that is why I had videotape,  which we are not allowed to have here on the House floor, obviously,  but had the videotape of John Sullivan, a Trump-hater, who has been  supportive of groups that wanted Trump pulled out of office, or as Mr.  Sullivan--and I will paraphrase--wanted to yank him out of the White  House and do things to him. But he was one of the first ones in the  Capitol. He is on video. He was bragging: See, I told you we would be  able to do this, getting into the Capitol. He was there egging on  people, even at the shooting of the young lady who was shot by a  Capitol policeman.   Many of us would like to know the full circumstances of so much that  went on here, but the thousands of hours of tape are not being used.  Now, some of us had heard that the wonderful Capitol policeman, Office  Sicknick, that he had died of natural causes. Yet, it was all over the  media that he was beaten with a fire extinguisher. It turned out that  was completely false. There is an article about that by Julie Kelly in  American Greatness, April 26.   Her article pointed out there is no reason to keep these men in jail,  let alone in solitary confinement in a D.C. prison. The cause of  Capitol Officer Sicknick's untimely death on January 7 is finally  settled, but the prosecution of his alleged attackers rages on. After  months of dishonest accounts about what happened to Officer Sicknick-- first, that he was bludgeoned to death by insurrectionists with a fire  extinguisher, and then that he died of an allergic reaction to bear  spray.   The D.C. medical examiner's office confirmed that 42-year-old Officer  Sicknick died of a stroke. The chemical sprayed in his direction during  the chaos outside the Capitol on January 6 did not contribute to his  death.   In its haste to bolster the new narrative, maintaining Sicknick was  killed by rioters wielding bear spray, the Acting Attorney General was  in on the lie from the start. The Justice Department charged two men  with the chemical attack. George Tanios and Julian Khater were arrested  March 14 and charged with several crimes, including four counts related  to possession and use of a deadly or dangerous weapon and for  conspiring ahead of time to use the spray against the officers. They  have been behind bars ever since.   Both were transported to the Nation's Capital, where they joined  dozens of January 6 detainees held in solitary confinement in a D.C.  Jail. A judge on Tuesday, this was dated April 26, will consider  motions filed by their attorneys to release both defendants as they  await trial.   This says, as I have reported: For the past few months, Federal  courts, at the direction of Joe Biden's Justice Department, are denying  bond to nonviolent protestors as their cases continue a slow slog  through an intentionally overloaded D.C. judicial system. The  presumption of innocence has been suspended for Trump supporters  involved in the January 6 protest, largely based on a supposed thought  crime of doubting the legitimacy of the 2020 election.   Parenthetically, if that were a crime, there would be Democrats who  would have been arrested and gone to jail going back to January 2001,  when an objection was made to electors. There were no woke corporations  back then saying they would no longer do business with those Democrats,  nor did they do that after the Democrat objections on January 6, 2005,  or after the significant number of objections on January 6, 2017.   Now, all of a sudden, it is supposed to be a crime, a heinous act, to  object under the rules in the Constitution? Things have to turn around  here if we are going to save this little experiment in self-government.   Anyway, dangerous evidence, the article questions, law enforcement  officials have argued in court pleadings that defendants shouldn't have  unfettered access to tens of thousands of hours of video evidence  because they might pass along the information to those who wish to  attack the Capitol again.   Instead, according to a recent Politico article, prosecutors are  ``working to build an archive of video that would permit defendants to  peruse relevant clips but sharply restrict their access and permit  prosecutors a chance to object if they feel such footage could be  misused or present a risk.''   Now, that sounds a great deal like what the prosecutors and the FBI  were saying about Ted Stevens and their evidence, that they restricted  him having access to his own evidence that would have proved his  innocence had he been allowed all the evidence that was seized from his  home and other places.   Anyway, toward the end of the article, it says:   ``Khater's family is asking the court to release him on a $15 million  bond guaranteed by 16 family members. As one journalist noted, that  amount is three times higher than Harvey Weinstein's bail.   ``Judge Thomas Hogan will hear the case on Tuesday and then decide  whether to keep Khater and Tanios behind bars until their next court  date or confine the pair to home detention.    ``There is no reason to keep these men in jail, let alone in solitary  confinement in a D.C. prison. Cherry-picked video evidence does not  support the weapon charges against them. The chief investigator  confessed no evidence exists to prove that the can of spray ever was  used or that Khater sprayed it at anyone, including police officers.  The Justice Department's refusal to allow access to the video evidence  raises plenty of red flags.   ``Neither man has a criminal record. George Tanios and Julian Khater  pose no threat to society. Their only crime, as is the case with  hundreds of nonviolent Capitol protestors, was supporting Donald Trump  and daring to question the validity of the 2020 Presidential election,  a doubt shared by tens of millions of Americans.''   So we have Federal judges that are playing along with this whole  outrageous miscarriage of justice for hundreds of Americans who were  concerned, as Democrats were in 2001, 2005, 2017. But fortunately for  them, Republicans didn't try to create a Federal crime out of  questioning election results.   Julie Kelly has done extraordinary research on what has occurred  since January 6 and on January 6. Some points that she has found:         On April 28, 2021, Paul Hopper heard a ruckus in his house.       He was in his bedroom answering emails. Clad in his pajamas,       he went downstairs to see what was happening. He was       confronted by at least a dozen FBI agents, some pointing guns       at him and his wife, Marilyn. The couple, along with their       houseguests, including a teenager, were handcuffed.    Now, where is the outrage that we have been hearing in the Judiciary  Committee about young people being unfairly treated? Where is the  outrage about the treatment of people since January 6 by any Democrats?  Even our Vice President was raising money to pay their bail in places  where there was not just looting but there was burning, physical  assaults, and, like in Missouri, even death of innocent people.   The Hoopers were placed in separate rooms in their home in Alaska,  without legal counsel, without the chance to inspect a warrant. Paul  and Marilyn were interrogated for hours about their trip to Washington,  D.C., in January. They attended President Trump's speech and walked  down to the Capitol. They committed no crime. They did not even enter  the building.   They did what tens of thousands of Americans did on January 6. They  traveled to their Nation's Capital, just like all the leftists did that  did such damage, and tried to physically assault some of us here in the  Capitol last year.   Yet, not only were they not punished, those of us who were being  threatened and people running after us, we were not protected at all.  But Paul and Marilyn, as they were so unfairly and unjustly treated by  the FBI and the Department of Justice, the FBI claimed they were  looking for Nancy Pelosi's stolen laptop.   They said Marilyn looked like a woman in the Capitol who was a  suspect, but the photos--that anybody could clearly see--the photos  that the FBI finally presented, eventually, it was clear, that wasn't  Marilyn, and that wasn't Paul. They didn't take the laptop. Yet, their  freedom was taken from them to teach a lesson.  [[Page H2351]]                                     time  1230    Nonetheless, agents threatened both Paul and Marilyn Heupers, the  teenager that was there. They threatened them with legal recourse. They  ransacked their home, and they took their cell phones and their  computers. They even took a copy of the Declaration of Independence. I  wish they would read it and understand it.   The Huepers have not been charged with any crime, but more than 400  Americans have been charged with various offenses relating to January  6, but most face nonviolent trespassing and disorderly conduct charges.   Just yesterday, the Justice Department announced the arrest of an  Active Duty United States Marine stationed at Quantico for his  involvement in the protests that day.   Joe Biden's Justice Department is criminalizing political protest-- but only political protest by Republicans or conservatives. They are  destroying the lives of American families. They are weaponizing the  events of January 6 to silence Trump-supporting Americans.   You don't have to take our word for it. Michael Sherwin, the acting  U.S. Attorney who handled the first few months of the Capitol breach  probe, bragged that his office arrested at least 100 people between  January 6 and January 20 to stop people from coming to D.C. to protest  Joe Biden's inauguration.   ``I wanted to make sure there was shock and awe, that we could charge  as many people as possible before the 20th, and it worked because we  saw through media posts that people were afraid to come back to D.C.  because if we go there, we are going to get charged.''   That is only part of what is happening. Dozens of Americans have been  hauled out of their homes, transported to Washington, D.C. and held in  solitary confinement for months awaiting delayed trials with no end in  sight. Nearly all have no criminal record. Some are veterans and ex-law  enforcement officers. But the Justice Department is throwing the book  at them. Even worse, Federal judges and prosecutors argue that these  folks are a danger to society because they doubt the outcome of the  2020 Presidential election.   In one case against a man who didn't even enter the building, a  Federal judge nonetheless denied bond and said this:   ``This is an offense that, at bottom, was an attempt to stop  democracy from moving forward, because people were unhappy about the  results of the election. I don't think that the defendant will follow  my conditions if he believes I am part of this machine of the  democratic process.''   Well, that judge ought to be part of the Democratic Justice  Department, because that is how that judge is acting, not as a judge  but as an advocate and as a part and parcel of what you could call a  conspiracy because these people are working to silence anybody who has  supported Donald Trump. That is one example of how government lawyers  and judges are criminalizing someone's belief about the 2020  Presidential election. It is much like the U.S. Attorney who is saying  that if they charge enough people, then Trump supporters are not going  to be willing to come back out because they know they will get charged.   We have in this city political prisoners held hostage by their own  government. They are victims of an unequal system of justice in a  country where rioters and looters on the left are let off the hook-- even considered heroes--while those on the right are considered  hardened criminals without any record before trial can even begin.   Here is how one defense attorney described the conditions in the D.C.  Correctional Treatment Facility: Detainees are held in solitary  confinement for 23 hours a day. They cannot shower or shave regularly;  some have been physically assaulted by prison guards.   They cannot play a role in their own defense. They have no regular  access to tablets to communicate with their lawyers or family members.  In-person meetings with counsel are nearly impossible; conversations  between defendants and lawyers are overheard by other defendants and  their lawyers in addition to prison guards.   At a detention hearing on May 11 for the two men accused of using  pepper spray against police officers and against the late officer,  Brian Sicknick, one defense lawyer told the judge he had not been able  to speak with his client for 2 weeks.   Julian Khater and George Tanios--about whom we were speaking  earlier--were arrested in March for allegedly spraying the officers.  They are still being held in the D.C. jail for weeks awaiting trial.   This week, a Federal judge--one I spoke of earlier--denied bail to  both defendants. Julian Khater's family was willing to put up a $15  million bond package. Neither man has a criminal record, but you have a  judge and a Justice Department with an agenda, and so what these men  are getting is not only not bond, but they are getting the most  injustice the Department of Justice can throw at them. They never even  went inside the building and the government has yet to prove their  cases at all, but the judge basically tried the case himself this week  without either defendant present. Judge Hogan said the men are a danger  to society because they attempted to halt the democratic process.   Well, if that were a crime, we would have dozens of Democrats with a  criminal record for coming in here. It was the first and only time in  American history that one party came in, took over the House floor, and  prevented a session from taking place. It never happened before, and it  never happened since. Of course, the election didn't go too well for  Democrats after that. We had a very weak Speaker of the House at the  time who kept saying that those people will be punished for their  improprieties and for their unethical and unruly behavior. There were  at least a dozen or more rules of the House that were violated by most  of the Democrats.   Madam Speaker, you are not supposed to sit on the House floor, on the  floor itself. You are not supposed to bring food. Heck, food was  catered in here. You are not supposed to take pictures in here. There  were not only pictures taken, but there was a broadcast going on from  the House floor. Rule after rule were broken. There could have  potentially been criminal charges, but none were made. None of us filed  any criminal charges.   Even though the insurrectionists and the Democratic Party came in  here and prevented the House from doing business for 24 hours, Paul  Ryan kept saying he was going to do something about it. He never did.  No one has ever been punished for the massive improprieties that took  place.   Many of these people are finally being charged with preventing, or  conspiring to prevent Congress from taking action. Well, that is  exactly what many of the House Democrats did that day when they  prevented, for 24 hours, us from going into session here. The fact is,  I didn't and wouldn't advocate that any of the Democratic  Representatives be charged or should have been charged criminally.  There were rule violations. I felt like it should have been handled by  Ethics, but I would not want criminal charges brought against other  Members of the House for the very things that Trump supporters are  being charged with.   I would have felt that was inappropriate against Democratic Members  of Congress then, and I feel like it is inappropriate for those who  were nonviolent--at least many of them. It is a misdemeanor, it should  be, but they are trying to make it for optics purposes into some kind  of justification for having metal detectors out here, even though they  ought to be other places, and Capitol Police ought to be other places.  But it is a great deal like I look around, and anybody who is not  speaking has to wear a mask because of optics, that we want people to  think there is this grave, great danger here.   That is why we have the fence. They took the outer fence down. The  inner fence is still around here. We have National Guard troops that  could be helping secure our border. That doesn't violate posse  comitatus, because they would be enforcing our border against non- American citizens, so posse comitatus, as I hear people bring up,  wouldn't come into play. They could be down there helping secure the  border, but instead, they are stuck around here in parking garages. I  see them in parking garages all the time. That is outrageous.   Why are they all here still after all this time?  [[Page H2352]]    Optics. Optics.   It was not as President Bush said when he signed the bill to be used  against political protesters, but that is exactly what is being done  right now. That bill did not apply to the thousands of people who  occupied the Senate and tried to stop the confirmation of Brett  Kavanaugh in 2018. It didn't apply to protesters who tried to stop his  swearing-in by banging on the doors of the Supreme Court. It didn't  apply to any of the protests we have seen over the years in Washington,  D.C., but people who were here on that day are being charged with that  offense, a felony punishable by up to 20 years in jail.   The media and Democrats continue to misrepresent what happened on  January 6. But nearly 200 people have been charged with ``obstruction  of an official proceeding.''   That is the vague law that President Bush signed into law in 2002. It  was aimed at white-collar criminals after the Enron scandal, and yet,  it is being used only against people who support President Trump, none  of those who officially obstructed the House Chamber for 24 hours who  were members of the Democratic Party.   Well, the claim about a fire extinguisher being used to murder  Officer Sicknick even made it into the Democrats' impeachment memo. But  it was a lie. We finally learned he died tragically at the age of 42 of  a stroke.   The three other people did not die because of what happened that day.  Two died of heart failure, and one died of a drug overdose. There is no  evidence as has been said on January 7 that this was an armed  insurrection--armed meaning with firearms. There were no firearms. Of  course, Bruno Cua had a little baton. He didn't use it against anybody,  but he still is being charged with using a deadly weapon.   Not one person has been charged with bringing a firearm to the  Capitol. People have been charged with carrying or using things like  Mace or a helmet, but no one brought a gun into this building, and we  still have no one in custody for allegedly planting inoperable pipe  bombs near the headquarters of the DNC and the RNC.   What was all of that about?   Some of us tried to get information about those bombs. Normally,  people don't put bombs that don't work out where people can see them  unless it is simply for the optics. Now, when they are serious, they do  what Bill Ayers' people, the Weather Underground, did when they set off  a bomb in the U.S. Senate. To me, that was more of an attack, more of a  war or an attack on democracy. In this very room, terrorists from  Puerto Rico came in here and shot four House Members. Four Members of  Congress were shot in this room in 1954.                                time  1245    To me, that was more of an attack on democracy, for the President's  information.   When Pearl Harbor occurred, that was more, thousands, 2,000 to 3,000  people were killed. That was more of an attack on democracy than the  protest of January 6.   When 9/11 occurred--and I know it has been so long ago, there are a  lot of people who have forgotten, apparently, about 9/11--3,000 people  killed. The Pentagon was hit. The two World Trade Center buildings were  hit. Thousands died. That was more of an attack on democracy.   I just want the President to understand there have been things worse  than people without any firearms coming into a building.   Now, I have been a judge. I wouldn't put up with that kind of  activity, disruption. Sure, people go to jail for that. They would not  get charged a felony, normally, but certainly misdemeanors. So there is  punishment that should and could be used, but not innocent people, not  like Paul and Marilyn. FBI swarmed their home, took all their stuff.  That is just so wrong.   The coverup of the video that was available here in the Capitol that  could really establish what all went on is atrocious.   I have so many friends in the Capitol Police. They are wonderful  people. I admire them greatly. But there are people in leadership  positions, apparently, who are covering up video of what went on here.  Now, even the news media is asking the D.C. District Court for access  to video evidence presented in virtual court proceedings.   As one of my Republican colleagues said this week in the House  Oversight and Reform Committee hearing, we need to release all the  tapes so the American people can see what happened before, during, and  after the disturbance on January 6.   There is no doubt people came here on January 6 to cause trouble.  Most did not come here to cause trouble. Most came here to protest in  the manner that I have advocated for years, and that is the effective  manner that Dr. King advocated for. So much more is done by peaceful  protest.   But Americans need to make their voices heard. This power-hungry  group occupying positions of power in Washington, D.C., right now, they  are wanting to intimidate and use injustice for their own political  purposes.   The overwhelming number of people caught up in this ``unprecedented  investigation,'' as the Justice Department promises, they are actually  nonviolent, peaceful Americans. Their only crime was supporting Donald  Trump and concern about the fraud Democrats have been telling us about  in elections for many years.   An article from April 12, Julie Kelly, ``Indefinite Incarceration for  Protesters with `Wrong' Politics,'' a great article, documents about  different people who are getting death threats. The press has helped  bring about all kinds of calamities on people whose crime was being  concerned about the election and being here and peacefully protesting.   It documents some of the travesties that are occurring with some  people whose only crime was being concerned about fairness in the  election in America.   Another, as ``Capitol Defendants Rot in D.C. Jail, Portland Rioters  Get Leniency,'' documents how lenient the Justice Department--yes, the  same Justice Department that is locking up in solitary confinement  people who really didn't commit the actions they are charged with. That  same Justice Department is going easy on the looters and destroyers in  Portland.   An article from April 19, ``From `Insurrectionists' to  `Interruptionists'''--that is probably going to be the charge that ends  up sticking in most cases. They obstructed Congress from their jobs,  not for 24 hours like the Democrat Members of Congress who kept us from  having session in here for 24 hours. Not like that, but just for a  matter of hours till things were under control. Then we were back in no  time, back here in this Chamber, doing our business.   But the FBI raided the Hueper couple's home. That was with guns  drawn.   Here is this 18-year-old, Bruno Cua, the complaint I have here. He is  charged with assault on a Federal officer. Yet, there has been no  evidence presented of any assault on a Federal officer--civil disorder,  obstruction of an official proceeding. That is the one that probably is  why Julie Kelly says they have gone from insurrectionist to  interruptionist: enter or remain on the floor or gallery of either  House of Congress; violent entry or disorderly conduct; engage in  physical violence; obstruct or impede passage; and parade, demonstrate,  or picket on Capitol Grounds.   That is what we have come to, locking up this 18-year-old with no  criminal history whatsoever.   Interesting, in Bruno Cua's case, the Justice Department was arguing,  since he had begun to be homeschooled before January 6, as thousands  and thousands of American children have been since teachers are  refusing in so many places to come teach them, that is used by the  Justice Department to say you can't allow this guy to be released, this  dangerous 18-year-old with no criminal history.   It says, oh, but look at his social media, and he is being  homeschooled, so you can't release him home because, you know, that is  where he came from. That would be terrible.   Yet, in Portland, they are letting people go, right and left, with  long criminal histories and with actual violence that they have  committed.   Anyway, Rick Manning has a good article from May 12 in Townhall,  ``Biden's America Resembles the Bad Old Days of 1973.''   I keep expecting, at any time, our President to say that we need to  put  [[Page H2353]]  out big pins with the letters W-I-N on them, as Gerald Ford did. That  stood for ``Whip Inflation Now,'' and that didn't work. Wearing a pin  with ``Whip Inflation Now'' did not whip inflation, nor did Jimmy  Carter wearing a sweater heal or fix our problem with a lack of energy.  That didn't work. But that looks like the kind of thing we are headed  back to.    There is a great deal of injustice, and I would think, for all of  those who obstructed an official proceeding here on the House floor,  under the leadership of the Democrat Party leadership, that for far  longer disrupted the House proceedings, violating countless House  rules, I would think that with that in someone's background, that they  have committed that crime that these people are being charged with,  that we would get a lot more sympathy from our colleagues across the  aisle.   Many were not here then. But the ones who were, who committed that  crime being charged now, have it a little easier on those who  interrupted us that day.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
