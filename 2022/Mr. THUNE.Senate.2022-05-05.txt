 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it is National Small Business Week, a week  that is set aside to honor the contributions that small businesses make  to this Nation.   Small businesses are an essential part of our economy. Ninety-nine  percent--99 percent--of South Dakota's businesses are small businesses,  and almost 60 percent of South Dakota employees work for small  businesses.   Nationally, small businesses make up most of the businesses in this  country and are responsible for 62 percent of net new job creation.   And small businesses are not only an essential part of our economy,  they are also an essential part of our communities--doing everything  from creating gathering spaces for community members to supporting  local charities and sponsoring local sports teams.   During National Small Business Week, I would like to be able to  report that small businesses around the country are thriving. But the  truth is, while some are doing well, a lot of small businesses are  having a difficult time right now, not because of COVID, as Democrats  might like you to think, but because of inflation. Inflation, which has  hit American families hard, is also creating major difficulties for  small businesses.   Now, when I talk to small business owners in South Dakota, one of the  first things they tell me is how inflation is affecting their  businesses.   In a recent survey from the National Federation of Independent  Business, 62 percent of small businesses reported that inflation is  having a substantial impact on their businesses, and 84 percent  reported that they are experiencing lower business earnings due to  inflation, and it is no surprise.   Inflation has driven up the final price of goods and services. It has  also driven up the cost of raw materials.   The producer price index, which measures wholesale costs to sellers,  hit 11.2 percent in March--its highest level ever recorded.   And small businesses are struggling with high energy costs, which  affect everything from production to the transportation of finished  products to the cost of keeping a storefront open.   Farms and ranches, which make up a substantial part of South Dakota's  small businesses, are seeing huge price increases in the cost of  essential inputs, like fertilizer, while the price of diesel, which  powers farm equipment, reached an all-time high this week.  [[Page S2348]]    Agriculture is already a challenging industry by its very nature.  Many farmers and ranchers in South Dakota, for example, are currently  dealing with a severe drought, and inflation is making things a lot  worse, especially right now in the midst of planting season.   We all know how we got here. Democrats came into office last year  mere weeks after Congress had passed a fifth bipartisan COVID relief  bill totaling more than $900 billion, and meeting essentially all of  the current pressing COVID needs.   It was abundantly clear that we were not in immediate need of  trillions more in government spending.   But that didn't matter to Democrats. Now that they were in charge,  they were eager to take advantage of the COVID crisis to begin  implementing their Big Government vision.   And so in the name of ``COVID relief,'' they pushed through a massive  partisan $1.9 trillion piece of legislation filled with unnecessary  spending and handouts to Democrat interest groups.   And the result was entirely predictable.   The definition of inflation is too many dollars chasing too few goods  and services, and that was exactly the situation that Democrats helped  create.   Democrats flooded the economy with unnecessary government money and  the economy overheated as a result, and there is no clear end in sight.   It is small wonder that, after months and months of high inflation  and anti-growth policies from the Biden administration, our economy  shrank in the first quarter of this year.   Unfortunately, there is no easy solution to the inflation crisis  Democrats helped create.   One essential thing, of course, is to do no more harm, and that means  no more excessive government spending and no bloated Build Back Better  tax-and-spending spree, a spending spree that some Democrats are  still--still--advocating for.   Another essential thing is to unleash American energy production, and  that includes conventional energy production.   I am a strong supporter of clean energy. I come from a State that, in  2020, derived 83 percent of its energy generation from renewables.   But no matter how much Democrats and the President might wish it were  otherwise, the fact of the matter is that our Nation is nowhere close  to being able to eliminate our reliance on traditional energy sources.  Clean energy technology is simply not advanced to the point where we  can replace all conventional energy production with renewables. And  cutting off investment in clean, responsible oil and gas production  will do nothing but drive up energy prices for American families,  farms, and businesses.   Unleashing American energy production, on the other hand--including,  I might add, production of oil and natural gas--could quickly result in  relief for families and businesses and help ease our inflation crisis.   Unfortunately, the President has made his hostility to conventional  energy production very clear. He set the tone on day 1 of his  administration when he cancelled the Keystone XL Pipeline, an  environmentally responsible pipeline project that was already underway  and that was paired with $1.7 billion in private investment in  renewable energy to fully offset its operating emissions. The Keystone  Pipeline was set to be what they call ``net zero''--net zero--when it  comes to emissions.    The President also immediately froze new oil and gas leases on  Federal lands. And while his administration is finally conducting sales  for new onshore oil and gas leases after being ordered to do so by a  Federal judge, it has reduced the land available for such leases and  substantially increased the royalty rate, sending a loud and clear  signal to American energy producers that the administration is  reluctant to collaborate with them.   Meanwhile, the Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed  requiring publicly-traded companies to comply with costly new climate- related disclosures that would likely discourage investment in  conventional energy production.   In short, the Biden administration is creating a recipe for sustained  high energy costs and a lot more pain for American businesses and  families.   But I and my Republican colleagues will continue to do everything we  can to unleash conventional energy production here at home and drive  down energy prices for Americans.   I am grateful for all that small businesses contribute to our  economy, and during this National Small Business Week, and every week,  I will continue to work to mitigate the harm of Democrats' inflation  crisis and advance policies that make it easier for our small  businessmen and -women to continue to drive the American economy  forward.   I yield the floor.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from South Carolina (Mr. Graham), the Senator from Kansas (Mr.  Marshall), the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran), the Senator from Ohio  (Mr. Portman), the Senator from Florida (Mr. Rubio), the Senator from  South Carolina (Mr. Scott), the Senator from Alabama (Mr. Shelby), and  the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Kansas (Mr.  Marshall) would have voted ``yea.''
