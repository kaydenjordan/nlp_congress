 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on Alejandro  Mayorkas, President Biden's nominee to be Secretary of Homeland  Security.   Up to this point, I have voted in favor of the President's mainstream  nominees to key posts. I will have my differences with Secretaries  Austin, Yellen, and Blinken on policy, but they were mainstream choices  from the President.   Mr. Mayorkas is something else. He does not deserve Senate  confirmation to lead Homeland Security. Frankly, his record should  foreclose confirmation even to a lower post. The problem isn't  experience--not exactly. Mr. Mayorkas is all too familiar with the  levers of power that control U.S. immigration law. The problem is when  he is chosen to pull those levers--and for whose benefit.   As a high-ranking official in the Obama administration, Mr. Mayorkas  did his best to turn U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services into an  unethical favor factory for Democratic Party royalty. Governors, a DNC  chair, Hollywood executives, a Senate majority leader from Nevada--they  all received special treatment to a degree that stunned and disturbed  the Obama administration's own inspector general over at that  Department. His independent report blasted the ``appearance of  favoritism and special access.'' We are talking about shoving through  green cards as political favors and intervening to overturn denials.  The IG confirmed this wasn't just about speed; Mr. Mayorkas's improper  influence actually changed outcomes.   This wasn't the first time this nominee abused an office for  political purposes. Before his tenure at DHS, while U.S. attorney, the  nominee had helped his fellow California Democrats get a well-connected  L.A. drug kingpin onto President Clinton's infamous eleventh-hour  pardons list. The drug dealer's father was a Democratic Party donor.  Mysteriously, several notable California Democrats took an extremely  keen interest in the case. Both Mr. Mayorkas and yet another one of  President Biden's nominees, Mr. Becerra, came under scrutiny for their  personal roles in the special treatment that was dished out to this  donor's son.   When questioned about these actions, Mr. Mayorkas responded with  false and conflicting statements, including while under oath. Reviews  of USCIS under Mr. Mayorkas found intimidation and retaliation against  employees when they were too focused on rooting out fraud instead of  merely rubberstamping applications. According to some of his own  employees, his leadership led to ``a culture of fear and disrespect.''   Does this sound like somebody who deserves a promotion?   Employees reported Mr. Mayorkas viewed the people applying to live  here as the Agency's ``customers,'' whom it was their job to please and  satisfy. They said the crucial goal that defined his approach was not  enforcing American laws, protecting American jobs, or defending the  American homeland, but rather ensuring there were ``zero complaints''  from the customers.  [[Page S217]]    I will close with one observation. Last week, I heard the Democratic  leader compare the confirmation timelines for Mr. Mayorkas versus Gen.  John Kelly--an ethically compromised partisan lawyer versus a retired  four-star general whom the Senate confirmed 88 to 11. The contrast  could not be sharper. For one thing, I would say Secretary Kelly  understood that our customers, first and foremost, are always the  American people. It is, frankly, remarkable that someone with his  record is even up for a Cabinet appointment.   I will be voting against this confirmation and urge our colleagues to  do the same.                            ____________________     Now, on another matter, the United States and  democratic countries around the world are anxiously watching events in  Burma. I have had an interest in Burma for many years, since I chaired  the Appropriations Subcommittee for State and Foreign Operations.   Just last November, here on the floor, I cautiously celebrated  Burma's recent elections. I warned that its military remained a toxic  influence and an obstacle to democratic progress.   Sure enough, the world was horrified over the weekend when Burma's  military rounded up the country's civilian political leadership,  including Aung San Suu Kyi and civil society leaders. The military was  afraid the popular support of the new government would yield the  constitutional economic reforms they long opposed. So they tried to  simply claim control for themselves.   I spoke with President Biden and Secretary Blinken yesterday about  the situation in Burma. The new administration deserves credit for  approaching the situation in a way that is bipartisan and coordinated  with Congress.   The world is watching. I hope and expect the United States will  quickly make the obvious legal determination that this is a military  coup and impose significant costs on the military for its attack on  democracy. We already have sanctions in place against key military  officials in that country, and Congress has already given the executive  branch the authorities it actually needs to swiftly apply even more  sanctions to the military and its infiltration into Burma's economy.   But we will also need the help of our friends and allies to  effectively pressure the junta. It is time for freedom-loving nations  to stand up for democracy and impose their own meaningful costs on the  military junta.   The Chinese Communist Party's state news organ dismissively called  the events in Burma a ``major cabinet reshuffle.'' A ``cabinet  reshuffle''? That is a joke and the free world knows it. This is a  military coup and an attack on democracy--plain and simple.   There are two paths before Burma. It can continue to grow into a  modern, democratic country connected to the global economy or remain a  corrupt, impoverished authoritarian backwater in the shadow of the  People's Republic of China.   The people of Burma have said which they prefer. They have spoken at  the ballot box. The threat of force must not be allowed to silence  their choice.                            ____________________
