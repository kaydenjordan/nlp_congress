 Madam President, I come to the floor today to oppose  Jonathan Kobes' nomination to serve on the 8th Circuit Court of  Appeals. People across the country know how important it is that we  fight back against extreme and extremely unqualified judicial nominees.   Earlier this year, during Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation, we saw just  how far President Trump and Senate Republicans are willing to go to jam  through extreme judges who will work to strip away women's rights.   But that wasn't all we saw. We saw millions of women and men across  the country inspired to stand up and fight back against his nomination.  We saw people speak out and share their own personal stories about what  was at stake, about sexual assault, and how important it is that we  believe survivors, and about the right to safe legal abortions, what it  means for women and their families, and about what kind of country we  want to live in.   We saw, without question, that people across the country want us to  stop President Trump from swinging our courts far right by packing them  with ideological judges--judges like Mr. Kobes, who will continue the  Trump-Pence agenda of rolling back women's rights and access to  healthcare.   Making sure families know exactly what Mr. Kobes would mean for women  if he is seated is what I am here to do today. It means weaker rights  and less access to healthcare.   He is like many of President Trump's nominees before him. Mr. Kobes  lacks almost any real experience to qualify him for a seat on the  Eighth Circuit Court. He has little trial experience, little appellate  experience, and no record of legal scholarship to speak of.   I am not the only one concerned by that. The American Bar Association  has rated him unqualified. That makes Mr. Kobes the sixth judicial  nominee from President Trump who is opposed by his professional  colleagues.   But the thin record he does have is disqualifying because it shows he  will put extreme rightwing ideology ahead of women and science. Mr.  Kobes is an outspoken advocate for fake women's healthcare centers,  sometimes called crisis pregnancy centers, that seek out women looking  for information about their healthcare needs and reproductive rights  and then use misleading--even blatantly false--propaganda to scare and  pressure them. Mr. Kobes even went out of his way to represent some of  these fake clinics free of charge.   He voluntarily defended a law requiring providers to give a lecture  full of ideological propaganda and fearmongering to women seeking safe,  legal abortions. The required lecture in this case actually went so far  as to demand that providers lie to women and claim abortion increases  their risk of suicide. It does not.   Think about that. He argued for a law that directly interfered with  the relationship between a patient and her healthcare provider--a law  that said women making their own decisions about their own bodies and  seeking healthcare, which is their constitutional right, should be lied  to, should be frightened out of a decision with fake information,  including fake information about suicide. That is utterly wrong and  disqualifying for any judicial nominee.   Mr. Kobes hasn't merely represented these fake clinics. He served on  the board of an organization that aimed to deceive and frighten women  out of getting abortions. It is clear he wasn't chosen for his bona  fides in the legal field. He doesn't have them.   Women and men across the country are paying attention. They know what  is at stake. Hours before the final vote on Kavanaugh, I came here to  speak about how angry I was when the Senate failed Anita Hill in 1991  and confirmed Justice Thomas, how I decided to run for the Senate after  that so I could fight to change things, and how I hoped everyone who  was angry about Judge Kavanaugh would stay angry and keep fighting for  change. I also promised right here that whatever happened, I was going  to get up the next day and keep fighting, too, and I meant it.   I am going to keep standing up, speaking out, and making clear just  how harmful the President's ideological nominees are.   I strongly oppose Mr. Kobes' nomination. I hope all of our colleagues  will do the same.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I thank Chairman Alexander and join him  in commending Ms. Bolden for her many years of dedicated and  outstanding service to the Government Publishing Office, the Congress,  and the American people. I greatly appreciate the sacrifice that Ms.  Bolden has made over the past 13 years in assisting the HELP Committee  by applying her expertise in editing, printing, and memorializing our  important work. We wish her and her family all the best in her well- deserved retirement.   We hope our colleagues will join us in thanking Ms. Bolden for her  service.                            ____________________
