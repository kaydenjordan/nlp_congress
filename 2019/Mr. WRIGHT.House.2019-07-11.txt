 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 962,  the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and ask for its  immediate consideration in the House.    Mr. Speaker, I urge the Speaker to immediately schedule  this important bill.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I stand in opposition to the amendment  offered by Mr. Sherman that conditions defense transfers to Azerbaijan.   Azerbaijan actively contributes to international security efforts. We  see their forces working alongside coalition forces in countering  terrorism in Afghanistan, in addition to contributing a logistics  supply route vital to U.S. and coalition forces.   Azerbaijan lies in a compromising position between two hostile  forces: Russia and Iran. Our bilateral relationship and the incredible  amount of support the Azeris have provided to U.S. missions in  Afghanistan were strong indicators of how our partnership has grown  since Azerbaijan first gained its independence in 1991. We must not  limit our ability to provide reciprocal support to our friend and  partner in a tumultuous region.   Putin's history of utilizing military force against its neighbors,  such as Ukraine and Georgia, forebodes his willingness to use the same  methods against others that counter him.   The United States Department of State is responsible for the review  of sales and transfers of defense articles and services. They exercise  this responsibility through an interagency process that assesses each  possible arms transfer on a case-by-case basis. Mr. Sherman's amendment  unnecessarily singles out Azerbaijan by placing an additional  certification requirement on the State Department's armed sales review  process.   The length of time this amendment would add to the defense exports  review process is detrimental in the event of an attack by militarily  superior Russia against our security partner, Azerbaijan, while  providing no added benefit to our bilateral relationship. This would  include a lengthening of time in reviewing arms sales intended for  Azeri forces operating in counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan.   Nagorno-Karabakh is an Armenian-occupied territory inside the borders  of Azerbaijan, which has undergone bitter conflict for two decades.   The OSCE Minsk Group, co-chaired by the United States, has sought a  peaceful solution to the conflict since 1992. By conditioning sales to  Azerbaijan, the United States Congress would tilt the United States  neutral position as a member of the Minsk Group and hinder resolution  efforts in Nagorno-Karabakh. By taking sides, the trust that has been  built up by the U.S. and Azerbaijan through the group's efforts would  be gravely diminished, and the conflict would degenerate further.                                time  1230    The NDAA is not the appropriate vehicle for taking sides on a  political issue, nor should it be used to influence a process that  clearly lies within the jurisdiction of the Foreign Affairs Committee.   This amendment is not required. The Department of Defense already  adheres to the provisions of the Department of State's March 2019  extension of section 907, which specifies that assistance to Azerbaijan  will not be used for offensive purposes against Armenia.  [[Page H5596]]    I oppose this amendment, which halts the positive momentum of our  bilateral relationship, particularly with the arrival of U.S.  Ambassador Lee Litzenberger in January of this year.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
