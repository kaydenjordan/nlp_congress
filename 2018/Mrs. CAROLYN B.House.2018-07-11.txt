 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend  and colleague from the great State of California (Mr. Correa), for  yielding and for his leadership on this very important humanitarian  issue and so many other issues before this Congress.   Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Trump administration missed its court- ordered deadline to reunite the toddlers and babies it kidnapped at our  southern border with their families.   And, yes, I say kidnapped. I don't know how else to describe this.  That is the only appropriate word to describe the implementation of the  so-called zero-tolerance policy when there was clearly no forethought  as to how children would be returned to their parents.   The cruelty and inhumanity at the border has led to nearly 3,000  children being torn away from their families and imprisoned. Instead of  having a plan in place to reunite these families, the administration  lost, destroyed, or never even created records, and clearly did not  care or think about reuniting these children.   Now we have a crisis of a whole different kind: figuring out how we  put the pieces back together, how we put the families together again.  Some parents of these children have already been deported. Some are  totally unaccounted for.   President Trump and his administration are utterly failing to fix  this tragedy that they created. We have so  [[Page H6103]]  many tragedies in the world that we are reacting to. This was one that  was literally created by this administration.   While we deal with this unorganized chaos and incompetence, the  children still in custody continue to suffer irreparable trauma in  unimaginable conditions, all because the President wanted to punish  those who sought safety for their children and a better life in the  United States of America.   We will not rest until each one of these children is back safely in  their parents' arms. We will continue to demand information on how  these children will be reunited with their families and insist that  officials who took part in this tragedy are held accountable.   I have visited two facilities with my colleagues. One was in  Elizabeth, New Jersey. We went there on Father's Day with permission  from lawyers and the inmates to visit with them. At first, they would  not allow us access. Finally, after we pushed and pushed, we were  allowed to see five gentlemen, four of whom entered the country  legally. They entered the country and immediately turned themselves  over to immigration authorities. One came in illegally because there  was violence at the border, and he then immediately turned himself over  to immigration facilities.   They all had very sad stories to tell. I share one from a man, from  which country, we can't say, but there was a lot of violence and drug  violence. His partner was killed, and his business was destroyed. They  went to the school, threatening to take his daughter. She, luckily, was  not in school at the time. The thugs were looking for her.   So he grabbed his daughter and fled to America. He was in detention  when they came to his cell at 3 o'clock in the morning and tore his 8- year-old daughter from his arms.   Along with my five colleagues, Members of Congress from New York and  New Jersey, we asked to speak to the head of the facility, the head  representing ICE, the head of the detention facility.                                time  1830    They said they had no records of where his daughter was. To this day,  they have not reunited this father with his 8-year-old daughter. He  broke down in tears.   I also visited a facility in New York City, Cayuga in East Harlem.  This is a facility that I feel was very well-run. It is for foster  care. Children are there in the daytime, and then they are placed in  foster homes during the night.   Again, the children did not know where their parents were. The  professionals said it usually takes them 59 days to find a relative, an  appropriate guardian, or the parents.   I just have to join my colleagues in saying that this is a disaster.  Mr. Speaker, 3,000 migrant children who were taken from their parents  at the border are still waiting to be reunited.   There are accounts of pregnant women being shackled in detention and  callously denied prenatal care or medical attention when they are  clearly experiencing symptoms of miscarriage.   On Tuesday, the administration missed the court-ordered deadline to  reunite all children under 5 years of age. I understand there are more  than, roughly, 100 children in this category. Very few have been  reunited.   Neither HHS nor DHS have consistent answers about how and when any of  these children under 5, or over 5, are going to be returned to their  parents. In short, there is no plan.   There was no planning. They took children from the arms of their  parents and did not keep records on where they are now.   Repeatedly, I have joined with Ranking Member Elijah Cummings in  calling for hearings in the Oversight and Government Reform Committee.  Despite numerous, numerous requests from him and others, we have not  had one single hearing about this humanitarian crisis being put forth  by our own government. Yet, there is a hearing planned tomorrow on  Hillary Clinton's emails.   The election is over. Let's focus on the crisis before us: these  children.   Again, we will keep calling for and asking for hearings on this  crisis before our country.   I want to thank my colleague for working so hard and trying to find  answers. I support his work completely, and I will continue working  with him and others to reunite these families who came to our country  looking for a better life.
