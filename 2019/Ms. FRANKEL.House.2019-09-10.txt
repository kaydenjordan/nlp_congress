 Madam Speaker, it is great to be with the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Speier). I thought maybe we could have some sort  of a colloquy. The gentlewoman looks like she is up to it.    First all, I want to thank the gentlewoman for her  leadership.   And I also know that Representative Hank Johnson has also been  involved with the FAIR Act.   First, I want to just make a statement.   Forced arbitration deprives men and women--not just the women, but  men--of fundamental legal protections and also prevents--this is  important--the public from knowing about the harm that corporations  often create or the secrecy of arbitration.                                time  1615    So I am very pleased to join you in supporting the Forced Arbitration  Injustice Repeal Act, or FAIR Act. So, you know, I want to talk to you  about a woman named Lilly, but I want to read this to you. This is an  advertisement from a massage spa that Lilly went to. And this is what  it says, ``The world is out to get you. Thankfully, we got you. Stress  can take a toll on your body, and even though your body works hard to  keep it up, it needs help. Keeping your body running efficiently should  be high on your to-do list, and regular massage is a key to operating  at peak efficiency. Keeping your body in optimal working condition with  routine massage along with rapid tension relief and total body stretch  is easy at any Massage Envy franchise location.''   Now, I would assume you would agree it is pretty appealing.    Anyway, this is the advertisement. We got your back. And  the fact of the matter is, as I said, The world is out to get you.  Thankfully, we got you. And they did get Lilly, who I am here to talk  about today, because on her visit to the Massage Envy Spa she was  sexually assaulted.   First, she tried to get--it is one of these things where you sign up  and get a series. So, first, she tried to get out, and she had to get  the app, and she tried to cancel her membership, which she wasn't even  allowed to do because in the little fine line it said, you have to go  to arbitration.    I yield to the gentlewoman from California.    Right.    Right. And she didn't want to go back because she was  sexually assaulted. And so, we are not talking about, obviously, she  can make a criminal claim, but she wanted to actually get out of having  to continue to pay Massage Envy.   She is just an example of, literally, the many women this has  happened to. There was an investigation. There are about 1,200 of these  franchises across the country, and BuzzFeed did an investigation, and  they found that there were about more than 180 women who had been  sexually assaulted at these spas.   Now think about this, aside from the criminal consequences, which  obviously there must be, the company does not want to let you out of  your contract unless they force you to arbitration.   Maybe you can explain again why forced arbitration is really so  contrary to our system of justice?    Is it true that in many of these arbitration cases that  the company actually gets to choose the arbitrator and then the  arbitrator--it is the same arbitrator, and then what are the  implications of that?    And, obviously, the arbitrator wants to be rehired. And  so the power is with the employer. And I think it is important to know,  and I think we can help.   We have been talking today about instances of sexual abuse and sexual  harassment, but what people should know is that these arbitration  agreements  [[Page H7591]]  touch almost every part of our life. For example, when you go into a  doctor's office or a hospital.    So what this means in practical terms, we always think  if we are harmed or we are wronged that we should have our day in court  where a judge or a jury can hear evidence publicly and decide the case.  But really what we have now is this system, I call it the system of  injustice with this forced arbitration that is secret that is really  weighted towards the corporation.    And, again, just to emphasize this, maybe you can give  some examples of how this results in a coverup of wrongdoing that  really keeps other people, whether they are employees or consumers,  from being protected?    And one more point, if you can emphasize again, when you  go into arbitration, does it cost the consumer or the employee money?    So before I let you go on with your next story, can you  just reemphasize again exactly what this legislation will do?    Well, I think you will bring a lot of justice to people  all over the country, and I want to thank you for your leadership.
