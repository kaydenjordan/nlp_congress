 Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the  resolution before us.   It has obviously been tried before, and I think there is no doubt  that if it were to pass, this could pose a very dangerous threat to our  relationship with Saudi Arabia at a time when the Iranians have now  achieved a peninsula all the way across from Tehran all the way to  Baghdad, and there is no doubt that the Iranians have continued their  aggressive behavior.   If we vote down this arms sale to Saudi Arabia, it would have a  devastating effect on our standing in the Middle East and a long-term  impact on our ability to counter what is clearly Iranian aggressive  behavior. So I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this  resolution.
