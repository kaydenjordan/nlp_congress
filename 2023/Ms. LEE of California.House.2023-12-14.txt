 Mr. Speaker, today I rise with a heavy heart  to honor the life of my friend, Ady Barkan, who passed away earlier  this year due to complications of ALS.   Ady is fondly remembered by many as a brilliant strategist,  communicator, and activist. He was an activist who brought our Nation  closer to making healthcare in America a basic human right.   Beyond being one of the most powerful activists in America, Ady  Barkan  [[Page H6964]]  was also a loving husband and a dedicated father. My condolences to  Rachael, his partner of 18 years, and their two children.   My heart goes out to your family, Rachael, during this difficult  time. While I can't imagine a world without Ady, I know that through Be  A Hero, his work and legacy will live on. That is why I am so proud to  partner with Be A Hero and work towards introducing the Ady Barkan  Memorial Resolution, and I urge my colleagues to support this  resolution when introduced.   Thank you, Ady, for advocating for a better tomorrow.                            ____________________
