 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of Victor  Link.   Victor was an intelligent man who had a vast knowledge on many  topics. He was the father to his adopted son, Christian, and was  engaged to be married to his fiancee, Lynne.   Victor loved music and loved sharing his expertise on craft beers. He  attended the Route 91 festival in Las Vegas on October 1.   He often traveled around the country to attend many different music  festivals with his fiancee, but he always made sure to make time for  friends and family.   His son remembers him as being a very strong role model who had a  deep passion for life.   I would like to extend my condolences to Victor's family and friends.  Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the  entire country grieve with you.                            ____________________
