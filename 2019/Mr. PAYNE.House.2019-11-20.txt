 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize November as  National Entrepreneurship Month.   America has always been known as a land of innovation, and  entrepreneurs combine innovation with capitalism.   But there is a group of future business leaders that need our help,  the minority entrepreneurs. Many do not get the funds they need, based  on bias in the banking and loan industry. Too many bank managers still  refuse to see minorities as worthy of loans. When they do get them,  minorities are charged higher interest rates on average than Whites.  Many do not even fill out the loan applications because they know they  will be rejected. Major banks have programs to deal with it, but  clearly more needs to be done. We need to make sure loans are  distributed based on credentials of the applicant, not the color of his  or her skin.                            ____________________
