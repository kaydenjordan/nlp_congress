 Madam Speaker, you have been a dear friend for a long  time. You have been in my office, and you sat on the couch. I sat  across, in the chair. And you know the portrait that hangs in my  office, a portrait of Abraham Lincoln. I am proud that he was the first  Republican President of the United States. I am proud of the action  that he took in a defining time of our Nation. The greatest challenge  ever to our Constitution was the Civil War, by long and by far.                                time  1530    The bill we are voting on today we voted on before. I supported it  then, and I support it now.   But let me state a simple fact: All the statues being removed by this  bill are statues of Democrats. Madam Speaker, as I heard the Speaker  talk earlier about removing the four portraits of Speakers in the hall,  the same answer goes for that, as well. They were all Democrats.   What is interesting is the statues that need to be removed were sent  to the Capitol by States that were a majority controlled by Democrats  sent to a House that had a majority controlled by Democrats accepting  of these statues.   I think the bill should go further. Maybe it is time the Democrats  change the name of their party. They may be desperate to pretend their  party has progressed from the days of supporting slavery, pushing Jim  Crow laws or supporting the KKK.   But let's be honest, at any place at any time if those fundamentals  rest somewhere, we cannot let them.   Let's go through some of the words and actions of a few Democrats.  Just a few years ago then-Vice President Joe Biden praised Democrat  Senator Robert Byrd. He was an ``exalted cyclops'' of the Ku Klux Klan.  In his eulogy for Byrd he said: ``For a lot of us, he was a friend . .  . mentor . . . and guide.''   Another leading Democrat who praised Byrd at the time was Speaker  Pelosi. She called Byrd a friend, a great person, and a great American  patriot.   Madam Speaker, today the Democratic Party has doubled down on what I  consider this shameful history by replacing the racism of the past with  the racism of the critical race theory.   They continue to look at race as the primary means of judging a  person's character. We saw this just last week. Senate Democrats voted  to confirm one of President Biden's appointees who said: ``We must do  everything in our collective power to realize Dr. Kendi's vision for  America.''   Let me be clear about what that vision is. Kendi, the author of ``How  to Be an Antiracist'' proposed in his book that the solution to past  discrimination is present discrimination. Now that is what the person  who is now in charge of the personnel of the entire Federal Government  is endorsing. And this divisive vision isn't confirmed or just confined  to one person or department.   The Navy included Kendi's book on its official reading list for  sailors and the Department of Education has praised the debunked ``The  1619 Project,'' citing it as an example of what should be taught to our  children.   Critical race theory is the governing ideology of what we are now  finding in the Biden administration. By advocating for it Democrats  continue to fuel hatred and division across the country.   I agree with Senator Tim Scott: America is not a racist country.   America must reject critical race theory for the simple reason:  State-sponsored racism is wrong and always will be.   It was wrong when it was segregated lunch counters of Jim Crow, and  it was wrong when it was segregated classrooms of critical race theory.   Madam Speaker, many times I wonder what would America have looked  like had Abraham Lincoln not been assassinated? Malice towards none.  What would America have looked like had the agreement to remove the  Federal troops from the south because Joseph Rainey was elected to  Congress, and Jim Crow laws were passed by Democrat-controlled offices  in the south?   Our Nation was built on a unifying vision from the beginning. As  Lincoln said, we are conceived in liberty and dedicated to the  proposition that we are all equal.   I will vote for this bill today, just as I voted for it before, but,  Madam Speaker, if we have not learned anything, we should not divide  our Nation based on race.   I applaud the Democrats for standing up, removing Democrat statues  from Democrat-controlled majorities sent to a Democrat majority House  that accepted them. It is about time. But, Madam Speaker, to continue  along in a critical race theory where you would teach an individual  that they are right or wrong based upon the color of skin goes against  everything that we are voting about today.   Madam Speaker, you know my heart, and I know yours. There are times  we might disagree on philosophy or how best to run a government, but we  never disagreed by judging somebody by the color of their skin.   And I hope we take this moment and this opportunity as we promised  before to strive to be a more perfect Union.
