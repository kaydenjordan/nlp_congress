 Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank my dear friend and  constituent, Rabbi Evan Hoffman, for giving the opening prayer today.   Rabbi Hoffman has led Congregation Anshe Sholom in New Rochelle, New  York, since 2012. He graduated Yeshiva College summa cum laude, where  he received ordination from Rabbi Isaac Elchanan's Theological  Seminary.   Rabbi Hoffman is an accomplished author, writing the weekly essay  series titled ``Thoughts on the Parashah,'' as well as the editor of  English language publications for Talmud Israeli.   Rabbi Hoffman was raised in Great Neck, New York, and is an avid New  York Mets fan. Rabbi Hoffman and his wife, Sari, are the proud parents  of two wonderful children, Eliyahu and Elana.   Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for the wonderful prayer this  morning.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 655, I call up  the resolution (H. Res. 296) affirming the United States record on the  Armenian Genocide and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H. Res. 296.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us is an important measure to set  the record straight on the atrocities suffered by the Armenian people  at the hands the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century.   We know what happened in this dark period of history. Between 1915  and 1923, 1.5 million Armenians were murdered. This was a genocide, and  it is important that we call this crime what it was.   Many American politicians, diplomats, and institutions have rightly  recognized these atrocities as a genocide, including America's  Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire at the time, Henry Morgenthau, and  later, President Ronald Reagan.   It is time that we set the record straight. Only by shining a light  on the darkest parts of our history can we learn to not repeat them.  And properly acknowledging what has occurred is a necessary step in  achieving some measure of justice for the victims.   H. Res. 296 sticks to the historical facts. It is a good, commonsense  measure with broad bipartisan support.   I want to thank Mr. Schiff, the resolution's author, as well as Ms.  Eshoo, Ms. Speier, Ms. Shalala, Mr. McGovern, Mr. Pallone, Mr.  Bilirakis, Mr. Smith, and the many other bipartisan champions of this  issue for their persistent, steadfast pursuit of recognition for the  suffering the Armenian people endured.   I strongly support this measure, and I urge all my colleagues to do  the same. With its passage, we put Congress on the right side of  history, properly acknowledging and condemning this horrific genocide.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader.   (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Schiff), the author of this important resolution, the  vice chair of the Congressional Armenian Caucus, and the chair of the  Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Eshoo), an important leader on these issues for many  years.                                time  1445     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New  York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), the acting chairwoman of the Committee  on Oversight and Reform.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Speier), co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on  Armenian Issues.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Sherman), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia, the  Pacific, and Nonproliferation on our Foreign Affairs Committee. He has  been a leader on this issue for years.                                time  1500     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Cicilline), a valued member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Costa), another wonderful member of the Foreign Affairs  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 1 minute to  the gentleman from California (Mr. Ted Lieu), another respected member  of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the co-chair of the congressional Armenian  caucus, who has, for many, many years, been at the forefront of  championing this very important resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlemen from  Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time for the  purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, the resolution before us is an important measure for  Congress to set the record straight and to call out the atrocities  suffered by the Armenian people at the hands of the Ottoman Empire in  the early 20th century as a genocide.   I, again, want to thank the author of this measure, Mr. Schiff, along  with the many champions for the Armenian people in the House. I want to  congratulate the Armenian American community which has worked for so  many years to try to get this resolution to the House floor and then  get it passed.   We are really making history today, and I thank my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle: Mr. Smith, and all the others who spoke. I think  this is very important, and I think we will be sending a very, very  strong message all around the world.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important  resolution, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.  [[Page H8568]]    The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 4695) to impose sanctions with respect to Turkey, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4695         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protect Against Conflict by       Turkey Act'' or the ``PACT Act''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) the United States and Turkey have been treaty allies       since 1952, when Turkey became a member of the North Atlantic       Treaty Organization (NATO);        (2) being a NATO member means that Turkey is treaty bound       to safeguard the principles of democracy, individual liberty,       and the rule of law and, importantly, should be united with       other NATO allies in efforts for collective defense and the       preservation of peace and security;        (3) Turkey's military invasion of northern Syria on October       9, 2019, is an unacceptable and unnecessary escalation of       tensions with the potential to cause a severe humanitarian       crisis and undo the collective gains made in the fight       against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) by the       United States and the 81 countries and organizations of the       Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, including NATO and the       European Union (EU);        (4) Turkey should immediately cease attacks against the       Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), Kurdish and Arab civilians,       and other religious and ethnic minority communities in       northern Syria and recall its forces back to Turkey;        (5) targeted sanctions against Turkey are an appropriate       response in order for Turkey to be held accountable for its       military invasion of northern Syria;        (6) Turkey's military invasion of northern Syria is the       latest example of the weakening and problematic United       States-Turkey bilateral relationship and undermines the       security of the United States and its NATO allies, including       that of Turkey;        (7) the SDF have been critical partners to United States       and allied counter-ISIS and broader counterterrorism efforts       in Syria, and the United States should continue this       partnership with the SDF;        (8) the United States Government should utilize diplomatic       and military tools to ensure the enduring defeat of ISIS;        (9) the United States should stand by critical allies and       partners;        (10) Russian and Iranian political and military influence       in Syria present a threat to United States national security       interests; and        (11) the United States Government, in concert with the       international community, should hold accountable members of       the Syrian regime and the Governments of the Russian       Federation and Iran for atrocities against the Syrian people.

SEC. 20. SUNSET.         This Act shall terminate on the date that is three years       after the date on which sanctions imposed pursuant to this       Act have terminated.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 4695.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I have described the administration's approach to  international affairs as ``fly by the seat of your pants'' foreign  policy, but over time, we have seen a pattern emerge. The President of  the United States stokes a crisis and then steps in with some sort of  half measure in a failed attempt to look like a great deal is  happening.   You can't be the arsonist and the fireman at the same time. And the  situation in Syria right now may be the clearest example of this and  the most disastrous.   Around 2 weeks ago, President Trump gave Turkey's President Erdogan  the green light to launch a military invasion of northern Syria, and  that is precisely what Turkey did.   What followed was a gruesome campaign slaughtering our Syrian Kurdish  partners who fought alongside the United States against ISIS. Already  nearly 200,000 people, including women, children, and families, have  been displaced, driven from their ancestral homes--ethnic cleansing at  its worst.   The deal we signed with Erdogan has led directly to this ethnic  cleansing in northern Syria's indigenous Kurdish region. It is really a  disgrace. These people fought with us. These people took bullets for  us. These people were our loyal and faithful allies. For the United  States to turn our backs on them, or to start a chain of events that  would hurt them, really is a very dark day in our country's history.   As the Kurds fight to survive this onslaught, they have been forced  to abandon their watch over the prisons holding thousands of ISIS  fighters. Over 100 of these terrorists have reportedly escaped. Now,  the situation in northeast Syria is a humanitarian and national  security crisis.   In a region already rife with conflict, Turkey's military operation  is wreaking even more havoc. And rather than hold Turkey accountable  for how they have conducted this bloody campaign, President Trump has  given them a free pass. When the head of ISIS was finally killed,  President Trump, unfortunately, thanked the Turks, thanked the Turkish  Government. That doesn't sit right with me.   First, the administration arranged a sham cease-fire that gave  Erdogan all he could have wanted. Then, Turkey entered into an  agreement with Vladimir Putin that ceded America's influence in the  region to Russia. And then, President Trump lifted sanctions on Turkey  once the Kurds fled.   President Trump has let Erdogan off scot-free for a heinous assault  that is destabilizing the region and threatening international  security. President Trump and President Erdogan are responsible for the  catastrophe in northeast Syria. They both must be held accountable.   On October 16, the House passed a measure rebuking President Trump  for this disastrous policy--passed, I will note, with overwhelming  bipartisan support.   Now, the United States needs to make sure that Turkish President  Erdogan faces consequences for his behavior. Because President Trump  has failed to demonstrate American leadership in this regard, it is now  on Congress to step up and impose consequences on Turkey.   The PACT Act, which is this act, underscores the devastating  consequences of Turkey's invasion and President Trump's decision to  step back and let it happen. It employs targeted smart sanctions to  incentivize Erdogan to stop his military offensive, cease violence  against Syrian Kurdish communities, and withdraw from Syria.   These sanctions are specifically designed to target the Turkish  officials and institutions responsible for the bloodshed in Syria  without senselessly hurting the Turkish people. After all, it is  Erdogan, not the Turkish people, who is responsible for this horror.   Erdogan is an authoritarian thug. His rule has left a glaring black  mark on Turkey's historic secular, democratic traditions. We need to  pressure him while ramping up diplomacy in the hopes of getting Turkey  back on the right track as a NATO ally. That is one of the goals of  this measure.   This bipartisan legislation also requires the Trump administration to  develop concrete strategies for combating ISIS, protecting Syrian  Kurdish communities, and ensuring Syrians who partnered with American  forces, as well as NGOs and humanitarian organizations, can be safely  resettled in the United States.   This is a smart response to address the calamity caused by Turkish  forces in Syria. It is up to Congress to act to make it clear where the  American Government stands.   I want to thank my friend Ranking Member McCaul for working with me  to introduce this legislation, and I  [[Page H8572]]  hope all of our colleagues will join us in supporting it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

Engel,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                   Washington, DC, October 29, 2019.      Hon. Elliot Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 4695, the       ``Protect Against Conflict by Turkey Act'' or the ``PACT       Act'. In order to permit the H.R. 4695 to proceed       expeditiously to the House Floor, I agree to forgo formal       consideration of the bill.        The Committee on Financial Services takes this action to       forego formal consideration of H.R. 4695 with our mutual       understanding that, by foregoing formal consideration of H.R.       4695 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and       that our Committee will be appropriately consulted and       involved as this or similar legislation moves forward with       regard to any matters in the Committee's jurisdiction. The       Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation that       involves the Committee's jurisdiction and request your       support for any such request.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and I would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during Floor consideration of H.R. 4695.            Sincerely,                                                     Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Foreign Relations,                                   Washington, DC, October 28, 2019.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       4695, the Protect Against Conflict by Turkey Act. I       appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary under House       Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on H.R.       4695 to expedite floor consideration. I further acknowledge       that the inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill       does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the       matters contained in the bill that fall within your       jurisdiction. I will also support the appointment of       Committee on the Judiciary conferees during any House-Senate       conference convened on this legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill.

Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                   Washington, DC, October 28, 2019.      Hon. Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Engel: This is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 4695, the ``Protect Against       Conflict by Turkey Act'' that fall within our Rule X       jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting with us on those       provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no objection to your       including them in the bill for consideration on the House       floor, and to expedite that consideration is willing to forgo       action on H.R. 4695, with the understanding that we do not       thereby waive any future jurisdictional claim over those       provisions or their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                   Washington, DC, October 28, 2019.      Hon. Carolyn B. Maloney,      Acting Chairwoman, Committee on Oversight and Reform, House           of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Maloney: I am writing to you concerning       H.R. 4695, the PACT Act. I appreciate your willingness to       work cooperatively on this legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on Oversight and Reform under       House Rule X, and that your Committee will forgo action on       H.R. 4695 to expedite floor consideration.

I will also support the appointment of       Committee on Oversight and Reform conferees during any House-      Senate conference convened on this legislation.

[[Page H8573]]                                          ____                                          House of Representatives,                               Committee on Oversight and Reform,                                   Washington, DC, October 28, 2019.      Hon. Eliot Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       4605, the Protect Against Conflict by Turkey (PACT) Act.       There are certain provisions in the legislation which fall       within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Oversight       and Reform.        In the interest of permitting your Committee to proceed       expeditiously on this bill, I am willing to waive this       Committee's right to sequential referral. I do so with the       understanding that by waiving consideration of the bill, the       Committee on Oversight and Reform does not waive any future       jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in       the bill which fall within its Rule X jurisdiction. I request       that you urge the Speaker to name Members of this Committee       to any conference committee which is named to consider such       provisions.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our respective       Committees.            Sincerely,                                                Carolyn B. Maloney,                                                 Acting Chairwoman.     Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for his kind  words.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), our Speaker of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   I would like to again thank Ranking Member McCaul for his partnership  in writing this important bipartisan bill. And it is even more than  just a partnership. It is working together on both sides of the aisle  to do good for the American people. That is really what this should all  be about, particularly when we are talking about foreign affairs. So I  want to thank Mr. McCaul for working closely with me and for really  making this a real collaborative bill.   The measure before us represents what the Foreign Affairs Committee  does best, bipartisan, commonsense legislation that advances American  interests and American values on the global stage.   The PACT Act holds Turkey accountable for its bloodshed in Syria. It  calls on Erdogan to immediately stop his campaign of ethnic cleansing  to expel Syrian Kurds and other minority groups from their homeland,  and to start living up to the democratic values that we expect from a  NATO ally, values that, right now, are under constant attack in Turkey.   Mr. Speaker, it is a sad coincidence. Today is the 96th anniversary  of the founding of the Republic of Turkey. For nearly a century, the  Turkish people have fought hard to grow and preserve democracy in their  country, and Erdogan has done such incredible damage to that legacy.   I call on all my colleagues to join me and Mr. McCaul in supporting  this legislation and sending a strong message that the United States  Congress will not condone Turkey's horrific atrocities against the  Kurds. Not only will we not condone it, we oppose it; we will speak out  about it; and we will try in every way we can to stop it.   I urge my colleagues to support this very important measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
