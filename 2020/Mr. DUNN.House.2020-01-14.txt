 Mr. Speaker, the amazing capabilities of our men and women  in uniform, combined with decisive action by President Trump, inspired  thousands of civilians throughout Iran to take to the streets over the  weekend to protest their government. These individuals braved the  threat of live fire, teargas, and further damage to show the Ayatollah  and his thugs that enough is enough.   It is a shame that in sharp contrast, House Democrats last week  buckled to the Iranian regime and passed a concurrent War Powers  Resolution attempting to tie the President's hands and obstruct his  already successful Iranian strategy. Furthermore, the Speaker yesterday  sadly attempted to downplay these nationwide protests as just  ``students'' upset about the downed airliner.   To the protesters in Tehran, Shiraz, and elsewhere: I say the Speaker  of this House does not speak for all of us. We do not downplay your  courage, and we stand with you.                            ____________________
