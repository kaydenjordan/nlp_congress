 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.  [[Page H6413]]    Mr. Chairman, I would like to read the amendment because I think  there must be some confusion on this, and it will become important  later in the debate:   ``The Budget Analysis Division of the Congressional Budget Office,  comprising 89 employees with annual salaries aggregating $15 million is  hereby abolished. The duties''--underlined duties, because it is only  duties--``imposed by law and regulation upon the employees of that  division are hereby transferred to the Office of the Director of the  Congressional Budget Office.''   That is the simple amendment, Mr. Chairman.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Meadows).    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Chairman, we have heard some of the problems with CBO from Mr.  Meadows. We heard from Mr. Perry immediately before on his amendment.   The CBO is meant to help Congress evaluate legislation. But I do not  believe the agency, as currently constituted, has or can do so  effectively.                                time  1745    Too often, predictions made by CBO turn out to be far off the mark.   We heard about the 2002 farm bill and the 2008 farm bill from Mr.  Meadows. That is true, but people back home may not realize that, in  fact, we don't do a farm bill every year. We do one roughly every 5  years, sometimes a little later than that, so there have not been so  many to score.   One of our favorites on the Energy and Commerce Committee, on which I  am pleased to serve, is the fact that, in 2015, we decided we would  push forward and sell, as a nation, some broadband spectrum. CBO said  zero dollars would be yielded from that sale.   Now, I use this all the time when I am talking to high school  students, because you don't have to be a CBO person living in the ivory  tower that they must live in to understand that broadband spectrum has  value in today's society, and zero is not the right score. In the end,  it brought in $44 billion. When you take away the costs, it brought in  a net $40 billion. CBO was wrong.   CBO has overestimated on a number of things. Mr. Perry talked about  ObamaCare. But time after time after time, they have gotten things  wrong. They said it cost more or didn't save as much.   In fact, I just saw, today, a report put out by Xcenda that the per- patient oncology drug costs were 0.06 to 2.3 times lower than what CBO  said they were going to be from roughly 2003 to 2013, according to that  study.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, we have heard from our colleagues on the other side of  the aisle that we ought to trust the CBO, that the referee should be  taken at their word and that they are doing the best they can. But  let's look at this amendment.   The CBO scored it, and they said:         CBO estimates that your amendment would have no net effect       on budget authority or outlays in fiscal year 2018.    No net effect. Who here actually believes that eliminating 89  positions, as the gentleman from Virginia, my friend, just said it is  going to affect his people, who believes that 89 people being  eliminated and $15 million in aggregate salaries has no net effect on  budget authority or outlays? I don't think any of us believe that.   So here is the conundrum that my friends have on the other side of  this issue: a ``yes'' vote means that you agree with me that something  needs to be reformed at CBO; a ``no'' vote means that you agree with  CBO's assessment that this amendment abolishing 89 employees will have  no effect. Therefore, I would submit to you that the CBO has, in  effect, determined that their budget analysis division has no value.  Therefore, if you actually support CBO, you must vote ``present.''   Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to join me with a ``yes,'' and  let's start the reform at CBO so we can get accurate numbers. If you  don't agree with this reform, I ask that you vote ``present,'' or else  you, too, are agreeing with the CBO that the budget analysis division  has no value.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
