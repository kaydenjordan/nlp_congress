 Mr. Speaker, this week our Nation  celebrates Public Schools Week. It is a time when we acknowledge the  diversity and success of our public schools and the sound education  that they provide.   Strengthening America's public schools is the best way to ensure our  children's future success and our country's prosperity. Ninety percent  of American children attend public schools.   This week, supporters across the country will share stories of the  many students, schools, and professionals who make public schools such  a vital component of our communities. This includes parents who are  working hard to improve educational outcomes for children. Advocates  nationwide will share scores of stories about public school students  and their successes.   Mr. Speaker, public school teachers truly make a difference in the  lives of our students. They prepare them for a bright and successful  future. It is their dedication to our students that builds strong  public schools and, therefore, strong communities.   As a senior member of the Education and the Workforce Committee and a  product of public schools, I know the incredible role our schools play  in communities across the Nation. Public schools today have much good  news to share, from increasing graduation rates and reduced dropout  rates to improved ratings given by communities on school performance.   In fact, public school graduation rates have risen from 79 percent in  2010-2011 to 83 percent in 2014-2015. This increase of the measured 5  years reflects that four out of five public school students receive a  regular high school diploma within 4 years of starting ninth grade.   While the graduation rates varies among States, 34 States have  reported graduation rates between 80 and 89 percent, with the highest  being 91 percent in Iowa, followed by 90 percent in New Jersey. Based  on data from the current population survey, the dropout rate has  steadily decreased, from 10.9 percent in 2000 to 7.4 percent in 2010  and 5.9 percent in 2015.   Last year, 69 percent of recent high school graduates enrolled in a  2-year or 4-year college.   We are making progress, but we can do more.   In many communities, the school district is the largest employer.  Teachers, busdrivers, administrators, cafeteria workers, coaches, and  facilities management all depend on the school district, and all of  these jobs contribute to the fabric of a community. Communities are  stronger and schools are better when we all work together to support  public education.   Public schools also make sure our kids receive at least one  nutritious meal a day. More than 30 million school lunches are served  each day, including 20 million free and 2 million reduced price  lunches. For some students, it may be the only meal they receive will  be the one at school.   Mr. Speaker, a child's opportunity for success should not be left to  chance. Every child needs a quality, well-equipped school right in  their neighborhood where they can learn, be inspired, and thrive.   Public education has always been the great equalizer in the United  States, and I am grateful for the contributions of our public schools.  I know that, together, we will continue to work to strengthen them for  our most precious resource: our children.   Happy Public Schools Week.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, March is National Athletic  Training Month, and I rise today to honor these healthcare  professionals who provide care for athletes and patients, soldiers,  workers, and performers.   Athletic trainers are committed to providing compassionate care for  all in work, life, and sport. Anyone who has been sidelined with an  injury can tell you how important their athletic trainer has been in  helping them make a full recovery.   Athletic trainers provide medical services to all types of patients,  not just athletes participating in sports, and can work in a variety of  job settings. They are instrumental in relieving widespread and future  workforce shortages in primary care support and outpatient rehab  professions, and they provide an unparalleled range of care for the  patients. They also improve functional outcomes and specialize in  patient education to prevent injury or reinjury.   As a former athlete, therapist, and rehabilitation services manager,  I know just how valuable our athletic trainers are, and I thank them  for the work they do to care for so many patients in various  industries.                            ____________________
