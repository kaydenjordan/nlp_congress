 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the work  of Mrs. Frances Percival, who has dedicated 63 years of her life to the  students of Millwood School District.   Mrs. Percival began her service in 1958 as a volunteer with the  Millwood School District, and then served in the Parent Teacher  Association for several years. She was affectionately known as ``Mrs.  P'' and a ``homeroom mother''.   Fifty-one years ago, Mrs. P made the decision to run for the school  board and was successful. In her five decades on the board, she was the  recipient of many awards, including the National School Boards  Association Award for Distinguished Service.   In addition to being a strong leader, Mrs. Percival said her mission  was to teach Millwood students to appreciate life and show respect for  humanity.   Madam Speaker, we should let Mrs. Percival's story be an inspiration  for us all to focus on improving the lives of our children, our  communities, and our schools.   Individuals like Mrs. Percival hold together schools and communities  across this Nation. I thank Mrs. P for her years of service, and I wish  her the best in her well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________
