 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, our great country was founded on the  idea that freedom leads to prosperity, which is better known as the  American dream.   I have always said this country owes you only one thing, and that is  an opportunity to succeed. This country gives you the opportunity to  live the life you dream of because, with hard work, anything is  possible. For a couple, the American dream may look like saving enough  to buy their first home. For a small family business, it might look  like opening its doors for the first time. For a first-generation  college graduate, it might be walking across the stage, and for a  soldier, returning from war with the hopes of starting a family. The  American dream takes on many unique forms reflective of the opportunity  that countless generations have strived to realize.   At the core of the American dream, you will find the American family  because for centuries, the American dream has been rooted in the idea  of family and freedom. Strong families are the foundation of strong  communities. That is why we need to uplift the American family rather  than to continue to rip it apart.   But recently, we have seen policies from the Democrats that inject  politics into parenting, that insert the heavy hand of the Federal  Government into the American home and stop at nothing to tell parents:  We know best when it comes to raising your children.   Threats to the American family are knocking on the front doors of  homes across the Nation as the left becomes focused on telling the  American people what they want rather than listening to what they need.  A prime example is the Democrats' socialist spending spree, designed to  create a cradle-to-grave welfare system that does more to tear the  American family down than to build it up. Just look at the child tax  credit--a once bipartisan policy initiative that has now been  weaponized to benefit some families at the expense of others. If you  are a working-class, married couple with children, you drew the short  end of the stick. Then there is the Democrats' Federal childcare  program. It is more focused on perpetuating government dependency than  giving low-income families the means to stand on their own two feet.   With these proposals in their reckless tax-and-spend spree, the  Democrats are picking winners and losers, and the losers are the  American family. Anti-family policies like these grow the size of the  government while chipping away at American freedom. We should focus on  pro-family policies that put families first, policies that make  achieving the American dream a reality, not something to feel shameful  about.   If you are born with two parents in this country, you hit the  lottery. So many children don't have the stable family that some have;  they grow up with one parent or are raised by another family member.  Then there are children who grow up with no parents, thrown into the  foster system. It is a shame because we know stable families can  provide foundations that children need to seize the American  opportunities.   As we talk about supporting the American family, I want to focus on  an important issue to many families across the country; that is,  adoption.   November is National Adoption Month in the United States. In the  United States, over 400,000 children a year don't have a safe place to  call home or a loving family to care for them. The idea that children  have a safe and stable home, with a family who loves them, should be  something we should all agree on.   In my career, I have traveled across the country for 40 years. People  from all walks of life welcomed me into their homes. I have seen  firsthand the immeasurable impact that family can have on a child's  life. I have seen parents who provide stable foundations, who instill  the belief that with hard work, grit, and determination, anything is  possible.   Success stories can be found across my State of Alabama. In fact, in  2019, Alabama had 731 adoptions--the highest number in Alabama's  history.   One of those is Katie, who was adopted through the Heart Gallery of  Alabama. Katie's parents adopted her at the age of 12, after years  spent in and out of foster care. Her forever family provided her with  the secure foundation she needed to jump-start her future. Now, Katie  just completed her first year at Yale University.   Like Katie, children in our foster care systems have endless  potential but need the stability that having a family brings to unlock  it. While we celebrate the heartwarming stories of families being made  whole, we cannot forget about the children waiting for  [[Page S8067]]  their forever home. Those are the stories of kids who deserve these  families and families who deserve kids.   As a Christian, I believe life begins at conception, but too often,  when discussing pro-life issues, we often refer to that life as the  child's time in the womb. We should, however, be focusing on the life  of a child after they are born, and that philosophy should apply to  children all around the world.   Many other countries don't place the same value on life as we do here  in the United States. In some countries, parents may choose to abort  babies who might have disabilities, and if a child is born with a  disability, they are put up for adoption at much higher rates.   China is one of these countries. Right now, there are several hundred  American families who have been matched with or have begun the process  of adoption with children in China, but the pandemic has indefinitely  halted most of the adoptions from China moving forward.   Back in May, I sent a letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken  asking for the State Department to have diplomatic discussions with  China so these kids could go home to their new families, but here we  are in November, and I have yet to receive a response from the State  Department.   Over 400 children are still stuck in China, with their families  unable to bring them home. Most of these children have some type of  medical or special need and are currently living in Chinese orphanages.   One such child is Cherry. She is stuck in China while her forever  family is waiting with open arms here in the United States. Cherry has  Down syndrome and needs medical attention, which is currently being  delayed.   When speaking about Cherry, her forever family said:         The sooner we can get little Cherry into our home, the       sooner we can give her all the attention, therapy, and love       to bring out her fullest potential in life.    Cora Lee has lived in an orphanage for 3\1/2\ years, ever since she  was an infant. Cora Lee has a medical condition that needs to be  treated or could eventually lead to blindness. Here in the United  States, there are parents, siblings, aunts and uncles, and a church  family who are waiting for her to come home so they can help provide  help in the future.   Then there is Charlie, who recently had a fourth birthday. He has a  family in Alabama who cannot wait to welcome him home. The first  several years of Charlie's life have been tough. He needs specialized  care that only a loving family can provide.   Given that the Biden administration just reopened our borders to so  many international travelers and that one of our COVID vaccines for  children age 5 through 11 has just been authorized, I believe it is  past time for us to get these children home to the families who have  been waiting years to love them and care for them.   Adoption is the gift that keeps on giving by providing children the  opportunity to rise above difficult circumstances. We need to work  together towards policies that make this gift more attainable for all  who can provide a stable home. After all, family is the heartbeat of  the American dream.   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
