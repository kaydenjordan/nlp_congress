 Mr. Speaker, today, with my colleagues Mr. Young of Alaska  and Mr. Huffman of California, I am proud to introduce the National  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps  Amendments Act of 2019.   The women and men of the NOAA Corps proudly and professionally  operate NOAA's highly specialized fleet of research and survey ships  and aircraft, including the famed Hurricane Hunter aviators. Several of  those ships are based in my State of Hawaii and conduct surveys used to  manage our fisheries and protected species and study and map the ocean  floor.   Like the other uniformed services, the NOAA Corps officers spend most  of their careers away from home at sea, in the air, and in remote  locations such as Antarctica conducting this important work but are  often overlooked in the legislative and administrative process,  resulting in a patchwork of statutory authorities, benefits, and  obligations of service.   Our bill will help the NOAA Corps improve recruitment, retention, and  diversity to attract the best and the brightest commissioned officers  and better align this great Corps with the other uniformed services as  they continue their great service to NOAA and to our Nation.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this bill and  support the efforts of the NOAA Corps.                            ____________________
