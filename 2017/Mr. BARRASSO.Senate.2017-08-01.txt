Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, President Trump has been in office for  just a little over 6 months. We had an election. The American people  said they preferred the Republican vision for the direction this  country should go, but it just seems today the Democrats in the Senate  think the inauguration never happened.   For more than 6 months, Democrats have engaged in a historic effort  to obstruct the work of the Trump administration and the U.S.  Government. Normally, on inauguration day, the President gets a  substantial number of people confirmed to his Cabinet. The idea is to  let the President get his team in place so then they can go about  hitting the ground running.   President Obama had six of his Cabinet Secretaries confirmed on  Inauguration Day in 2009. All of them were confirmed by voice vote.  They didn't even have to do a rollcall. People agreed, in a bipartisan  way, to let the President have his nominees. Republicans in the Senate  did nothing to try to block any of those Cabinet Secretaries for  President Obama. We understood it is best to give the new President a  chance and for all of us to work together when we can. President George  Bush had seven people nominated and confirmed on his first day in  office. That is the way it usually worked but not anymore.   Now, Democrats aren't interested in giving a Republican President a  chance. They weren't interested in working together. Last January,  President Trump only had two people confirmed to his Cabinet on  inauguration  [[Page S4639]]  day. There were two people ready to get to work on the day he took  office, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Homeland  Security. These were the only two jobs the Democrats let the President  fill. By the end of January in 2009, President Obama had 10 of his  Cabinet Secretaries in place. His Cabinet was almost entirely set by  the end of the month that he took office, January 2009, but because of  ongoing obstruction by Democrats in the Senate, President Trump still  only had three Cabinet Secretaries in their jobs by the end of January.  That is an incredible level of obstruction when you compare it to what  has happened historically.   It didn't stop with members of the Cabinet, and it didn't just end in  January. Democrats have continued to make the Senate jump through  procedural hoops. In President Obama's first 6 months of office, 206  people were confirmed to serve in his administration. In President  Trump's first 6 months, Democrats continued to block the way, allowing  us to approve only 55 nominees for those first 6 months. So President  Obama had nearly four confirmations for every one of President Trump's  over the same period of time. The difference is stark and the reason is  simple: Democrats have been putting up roadblocks, one after another,  on even the most noncontroversial of nominees. It is not how things  worked in the past in previous administrations. Many of these nominees  for important jobs would get approved by what we call in the Senate  unanimous consent or by a voice vote.   Republicans have been willing to let a lot of Democrats take their  jobs without wasting time on rollcall votes and running out the clock.  In President Obama's first 6 months in office, Republicans allowed 182  of his nominees to be confirmed by unanimous consent or voice vote.  That is almost 90 percent of the jobs filled in those first 6 months by  unanimous consent--general agreement--but in the same time, the  Democrats only allowed five of President Trump's nominees to get  through without a rollcall vote. That is the level of Democratic  obstructionism.   They have been blocking judges, Cabinet Secretaries, and other high- ranking officials. Many of these nominees even had Democratic support.  It is interesting. Democrats have supported many of these so they  weren't controversial at all. Democrats in the Senate forced us to file  cloture 34 times on people nominated to fill important jobs in the U.S.  Government. We had to force the Democrats to act.   In President Obama's first 6 months, there were only eight cloture  votes. There is no way Democrats can argue that they had principled  objections to these 34 nominees where we had to file cloture on their  nominations. The only explanation is that they did not want the  President to have his team in place. When you take a look at these 34  people whom we had to go ahead and file cloture on, half of them ended  up getting 60 or more votes for their confirmation so they had support  by Democrats as well as the Republicans. There was no reason--no need  to slow them down other than obstruction of the President. One nominee  whom we had to file cloture on and go all the way through the process  even received a unanimous confirmation vote--a rollcall vote in the  U.S. Senate--100 to 0. Yet the Democratic leader made us file a motion  to proceed and get a cloture vote on this individual whom then they  approved 100 to 0.   Why the need to go through this? Democrats blocked him as long as  they could. Yet not a single Democrat then stood to vote against him  when his name was called for a rollcall vote. So why are Democrats  blocking votes on people whom they then intend to support and do  support with their votes? They are just trying to slow things down. The  Democratic leader actually admitted that was his plan during the debate  over confirming the No. 2 person at the Pentagon. It is someone whom  the Senate actually confirmed with 92 votes in his favor. Yet they  slowed him down. Then he received 92 votes.   Republicans wanted to speed up the process a little. Senator Schumer  objected. Did he have a problem with the nominee's qualifications? No.  The Democratic leader said on the floor: ``We would be happy to  consider the nominee in regular order, and maybe once things change a  little bit in healthcare, we can.''   It had nothing to do with the person who was nominated, nothing to do  with anything, according to Senator Schumer, other than the fact that  we were discussing healthcare in this country. It had nothing to do  with the importance of the position that was going to be filled in the  Pentagon. It was all because Democrats were trying to stall the debate  over healthcare reform. There are the numbers: nominees confirmed in  the first 6 months for Obama, 206; President Trump, 25.   Republicans are trying to keep the Federal Government functioning by  filling these jobs that had been empty. Healthcare is a very separate  thing. Both of these are important. The only thing they have in common  is the Democrats have been playing politics with both of them. It is  not normal. It is not acceptable. The Democrats' blockade against  President Trump's nominees has caused what I believe has been a  dangerous backlog. We still have 84 people who have been nominated by  the President for positions in the government who have cleared the  committees and are now just waiting for a vote on the Senate floor-- slowed down by Democratic obstruction.   Democrats are trying their best to drag this out, it seems to me, as  long as they possibly can. The Senate rules say that means up to 30  hours of debate once we vote to move forward on a nomination. Maybe  that is too long. Senator Ron Johnson wrote an op-ed in the Washington  Post over the weekend with the headline: ``Let's break this Senate  logjam.'' He suggests we cut the time back from 30 hours of debate to 2  hours of debate. That would certainly speed things up, and maybe that  is the step we are going to have to take if this level of obstruction  continues.   Whatever we do, we cannot allow this logjam to continue. These are  important jobs--important positions. The American people deserve to  have someone doing their work.   Last Friday, after the healthcare vote, Senator Schumer called for us  to work together. He said: ``There are things we can do rather quickly,  including moving a whole lot of nominations.'' I am going to hold the  Democratic leader to his word on this. Let him show that he meant what  he said. We should be able to clear the decks of these 84 nominees who  have come through the Senate committee, who have been approved by the  committee and are waiting here to be confirmed. We should do it by  unanimous consent. If Democrats object to one or two of them, let's  have a rollcall vote so we can get it on the record. It is time to stop  this mindless obstruction that serves no purpose except to delay.   Thank you, Madam President.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
