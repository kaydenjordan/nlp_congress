 Mr. Speaker, this evening, I rise to honor the life of  Charles Evers, who passed away earlier today.   Charles and his brother, Medgar, dedicated their time on this Earth  to the advancement of civil rights for all Americans. Following the  tragic murder of his brother, Charles assumed Medgar's position as head  of the NAACP in Mississippi, to continue his efforts to expand civil  rights for African Americans in the Magnolia State.   In 1969, he became the first African American mayor elected in  Mississippi since Reconstruction, making Mr. Evers a symbol of the  civil rights that he and his brother fought to advance.   He served as an adviser and mentor to many public officials, from  local governments, to the President of the United States.   Today, I join our Mississippi family in thankful prayer for his time  on Earth, and that he returned to our Heavenly Father having  accomplished his goal of creating a better nation for all people.   Please join me in a moment of silence as we remember his service to  our State and our Nation.                            ____________________
