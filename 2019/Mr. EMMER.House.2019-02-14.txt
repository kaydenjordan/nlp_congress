 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of a dear  friend, Tommy Rukavina, who passed away after his battle with cancer.  Tommy's life ended the way he lived, with a fight. He wouldn't have had  it any other way.   It is hard not to think of Tommy when I travel northern Minnesota and  see all the great communities that rely on the mining industry and when  I am with the amazing men and women who sustain Minnesota's Iron Range  today. These are the people Tommy cared about. These are the people he  represented and the people he helped.   Tommy Rukavina was outspoken. He never shied away from a fight, and  yet, win or lose, he preserved civil discourse in every interaction.  After difficult battles, you would still want to hang out with Tommy.   The Croatian Sensation, as I once called him, was passionate about  life. He was passionate about people, and he was passionate about the  causes he believed in and fought for every day. I have no doubt that he  has a special place in Heaven, and I know Heaven will never be the same  now that he is there.   Our State has suffered a great loss. Tommy will be deeply missed.   Our condolences to his family and loved ones, and a special thanks to  all of you for sharing Tommy Rukavina with the rest of us.                            ____________________
