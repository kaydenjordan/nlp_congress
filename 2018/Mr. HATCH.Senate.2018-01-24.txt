 Mr. President, earlier this week, the Senate voted to pass  a continuing resolution to reopen the government. This came after weeks  of acrimony and no shortage of hostility here on the Senate floor and  elsewhere. While most of the recent debate has been focused on the  future of immigration policy, another vitally important priority--and a  bipartisan priority, no less--was also addressed this week.   I am talking, of course, about the 6-year extension of the Children's  Health Insurance Program, which was included in the funding bill. It is  a shame, really, that this bipartisan accomplishment has, in some  respects, been overlooked while more attention has been given to  partisan squabbling over other divisive issues.   Since its inception, CHIP has been a bipartisan program. In 1997,  Senator Kennedy and I came together to create CHIP in order to provide  health insurance to vulnerable children. It was a Republican-controlled  Congress working with a Democratic President that brought this program  into existence.   The year before, that same Republican Congress and Democratic  President worked together to produce another landmark welfare reform  bill that sought to replace a culture of dependency with an emphasis on  work. S-CHIP became a necessity for those families making the  transition.   Prior to the introduction of the original CHIP bill, I came across a  number of families with parents who worked but still could not afford  private coverage for their children. Yet they made too much to qualify  for Medicaid. Senator Kennedy and I designed our bill to fill this gap  and meet those needs.   Today, the CHIP program provides health insurance for about 9 million  needy children every year. While the program isn't perfectly designed-- though few programs are--it is widely considered to be one of the most  efficient and cost-effective healthcare programs. For that reason,  Members from both parties have been supportive of the program since the  day it was signed into law.   Last year, with an extension deadline approaching, Senator Wyden, the  ranking member of the Finance Committee, and I went to work on drafting  another bipartisan CHIP bill, one that would make needed improvements  to the program and extend it for an additional 5 years. We were  successful. We introduced our bill in September and, shortly  thereafter, the Finance Committee marked it up and reported it by voice  vote.   We have been working to pass our bill since last September, and,  thankfully, that time came earlier this week. When we voted to pass the  CR, we also voted to successfully extend CHIP for 6 years. That is the  longest CHIP extension in the history of this program.   Other than that extra year of funding, the bill we passed was  identical to the one Senator Wyden and I introduced last year. I know  we have colleagues already talking about adding additional years, and I  know a number of stakeholders would like to see that as well. I am  definitely open to having a conversation with my colleagues on how we  might move forward to support an additional 4 years of funding for  CHIP.   In my view, if we can work together to pass a bill adding 4 years to  the 6 already in place, that would be simply fantastic, but for this  moment, let us not overlook the success we have achieved this week. A  6-year CHIP extension gives security and certainty to millions of  American families and allows States to plan their budgets for several  years into the future. That is a big deal. Let us keep that in mind as  we look for ways to do more.   I would like to thank Senator Wyden, my partner on the Finance  Committee, for his efforts in developing this legislation. I would like  to thank other members of the Senate Finance Committee who supported us  all the way. Thank you to our distinguished majority leader and his  team, as well as the leaders in the House who worked alongside us. I  also thank the stakeholders across the country--the Governors, care  providers, and of course the families who depend on CHIP for making  their voices heard throughout this endeavor. I look forward to working  with all of you going forward so we can make sure we do right by the  children who benefit from CHIP.   Now, Mr. President, I would like to turn to a related issue in the  healthcare space. The Senate will soon vote on President Trump's  nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services. I can think of very  few others--and I have only been here 42 years--but I can think of very  few others as qualified to take the helm of this very large ship than  Mr. Alex Azar.   As Secretary of Health and Human Services, Mr. Azar would be  responsible for trillions of dollars in spending, liabilities, and  contracts that make up the backbone of our healthcare system.   What is more, Health and Human Services is still in the process of  off-ramping many of the poor decisions made throughout the 8 years of  the Obama administration. Unfortunately, many of those policies,  regulations, procedures, and practices remain in place, continuing to  undermine the sustainability of programs like Medicare and Medicaid,  and artificially propping up the so-called Affordable Care Act.   The good news is, Mr. Azar brings with him nearly two decades of  experience in the healthcare system, working in both the private and  public sectors. Mr. Azar spent several years as a senior official at  Health and Human Services, holding key positions overseeing Medicare  Part D and Medicare Advantage. He also led Health and Human Service's  responses to the anthrax victims shortly after 9/11, the SARS and  monkeypox crises, Hurricane Katrina, and many others.   Clearly, Mr. Azar has seen both the good and the bad at Health and  Human Services and knows how to manage them. I don't think there is  anyone here, even on the other side of the aisle, who would contest  that. In fact, in the past, Mr. Azar has actually been confirmed twice.  With experience both on the company side and the government side of  healthcare, he is now only more experienced and knowledgeable.   I think the broad exercise will serve him well, particularly at this  critical time when the Health and Human Services Secretary will need to  be intensely focused on the opioid epidemic and other major problems  facing our country. No doubt all of these are reasons why we reported  Mr. Azar out of the Finance Committee with a bipartisan vote. If we set  aside the partisan and the preconceived notions some have about certain  industries, Mr. Azar would likely get a near-unanimous vote.   I hope at least some of our Democratic colleagues will vote to  confirm him. I urge all of my colleagues to join me in doing so.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise with my good friend from Tennessee  to discuss some truly landmark legislation we are introducing today  that is long overdue. It is called the Music Modernization Act, and it  will reshape the music licensing landscape to bring it into the 21st  century.   As a songwriter myself, I have a deep interest in music issues and in  ensuring we have a music licensing system that works. Unfortunately,  our music licensing laws have not kept pace with technological change.  We have an outdated, antiquated system that is designed for the era of  CDs and cassette tapes rather than the era of digital streamlining and  audio on demand.   Most of us rarely think about the complex laws that govern who can  listen to what music when and who gets paid when we purchase an MP3 or  listen to an interactive stream. We pay our money to iTunes or the  streaming service without thinking about how that money then gets  distributed to dozens or even hundreds of actors across the music  industry. You have songwriters and publishers and recording artists and  record labels. You have agents and broadcasters and streaming services  and performing rights organizations. You have multiple copyrights  across multiple individuals for the same song. It is a dense,  interconnected web of licenses, rights, and legal obligations that all  need and should be carefully calibrated, but our current regime is not  well calibrated--far from it.   To begin with, the process of ensuring that songwriters are paid when  the songs they have written are downloaded or played on the internet is  a complete mess. The problem lies in matching sound recordings to the  underlying musical work; that is, to the song performed in the sound  recording. When a person downloads or streams a song, there are  actually two sets of copyright holders whose interests come into play.   The first is the recording artist who owns a copyright in the sound  recording; that is, in the recorded version of the song. Often, the  recording artist will have assigned his or her copyright to a record  label.   The other relevant copyright holder is the songwriter--the person who  actually wrote the music and, in virtually every case, the lyrics that  the recording artist performed. The songwriter owns a copyright in the  song itself, in the actual words and music. Often, the songwriter will  have assigned his or her copyright to a music publisher.   When a sound recording is reproduced, whether by download,  interactive stream, or fixing the song on a CD or other physical  object, the recording artist and songwriter or their respective  assignees will both receive royalties. The recording artist receives a  royalty for the sound recording itself, and the songwriter receives a  royalty for the underlying song. These are called mechanical royalties  because, historically, the reproduction of sound recordings was done  through mechanical means. Think of a vinyl record and its grooves.   There is also a second type of royalty that comes into play when a  song is performed publicly, such as on the radio, at a concert, or over  a digital transmission service like Pandora. This type of royalty is  called, sensibly enough, a public performance royalty. Just like with  mechanical royalties, it is paid to both the recording artist and the  songwriter or their assignees.   As I said earlier, the problem lies in matching the sound recording  to the underlying musical work; that is, in determining who should get  paid when an individual downloads a song or listens to an interactive  stream.   Figuring out the recording artist is pretty easy. When digital music  services play music, they play sound recordings. They play a song  recorded by Taylor Swift or Jay-Z or Garth Brooks or they offer the  sound recording for download. In either case, determining who recorded  the song is straightforward. Figuring out who the songwriter is,  however, can be much more complicated.   A recording artist may play 10 different songs by 10 different  songwriters on a single album or 10 separate writers may have  contributed to a single song, with each being entitled to a cut. Unlike  with recording artists, it is usually not apparent from the sound  recording itself who the songwriter is.    Of course, the recording artist--or the record label, if the  recording artist has assigned his or her rights to a record label--may  know who the songwriter is, but not always, and it is simply not  feasible for digital music providers to independently track down  [[Page S502]]  every individual songwriter for the millions of songs they offer over  their services.   The problem of unmatched works--that is, works for which the sound  recording has not been matched to the underlying songwriter--creates  significant difficulties for both digital music providers and  songwriters.   Start with digital music providers. By law, these services are  required to pay mechanical royalties to songwriters for interactive  streams and digital downloads. But if they don't know who the relevant  songwriter or publisher is, they can't pay the royalty. This exposes  digital music providers to significant liability if a songwriter or  publisher later appears and asserts their rights. At the same time,  songwriters get short shrift because they don't get paid when they are  supposed to be. Streaming services play their songs and digital  platforms offer their songs for download without paying the required  royalties. As you can see, this is a complicated system. It is a bad  situation all around.   That is where the legislation Senator Alexander and I are introducing  today comes into play. Our bill, the Music Modernization Act, creates a  blanket mechanical license for digital music providers. This license,  which will be administered by a mechanical licensing collective, will  enable digital music providers to obtain a single mechanical license  for the music they play rather than having to individually seek out  songwriters and publishers. Services that obtain the license will  receive liability protection.   Songwriters and publishers, in turn, will benefit from increased  royalty payments. Among the mechanical licensing collective's duties  will be establishing and maintaining a public database that identifies  musical works and their owners. This will help reduce the number of  unmatched works.   In addition, the Music Modernization Act provides that royalties for  unmatched works will be distributed after a holding period of 3 years  to known copyright holders on a market-share basis. This means that  rather than going unpaid, royalties for unmatched works will go to  existing copyright holders according to how active each copyright  holder is in the marketplace.   Our bill also contains a critical update to the rate standard for  mechanical royalties for songwriters. Current law requires the  Copyright Royalty Board to consider a variety of statutory factors in  setting mechanical royalties. These factors, however, do not accurately  reflect market demand, with the result that songwriters are paid a  below-market rate. Our bill revises this standard to instruct the Board  to establish rates that reflect what a willing buyer and willing seller  would agree to in the marketplace.   Lastly, the bill makes two changes related to public performance  royalties for songwriters. As I explained earlier, this type of royalty  comes into play when a song is performed publicly, such as on the  radio, at a concert, or over a digital transmission service like  Pandora.   Public performance royalties for songwriters and publishers are  administered through performing rights organizations, or PROs, the best  known of which are ASCAP and BMI. ASCAP and BMI offer blanket licenses  to radio stations, restaurants, digital transmission services, and  others that allow licensees to play all songs in the PRO's catalogue.  These blanket licenses are governed by 1940s-era consent decrees that  require all rates under the licenses to be set or approved by a Federal  judge in the Southern District of New York.   The Music Modernization Act makes two changes relevant to these  consent decrees. First, it says that any judge in the Southern District  of New York may hear a rate-setting case involving ASCAP's or BMI's  license fees, not just the particular judge who oversees the consent  decree.   Second, the bill revises current law to allow judges in these rate- setting proceedings to consider evidence of public performance  royalties paid for sound recordings in setting public performance  royalties for songwriters. The purpose of this provision is to better  align public performance royalties for sound recordings with public  performance royalties for the underlying musical work and to ensure  that songwriters are properly rewarded when a song they write becomes a  hit.   As I mentioned earlier, music licensing is an incredibly complicated  subject. I have endeavored today to explain the Music Modernization Act  in a straightforward way that individuals not steeped in this subject  can understand. The key points are as follows. First, the bill will  have to solve the problem of unmatched works so that digital music  providers are protected from liability and songwriters receive the  royalties they are due. Second, the bill will better align royalties  for songwriters with royalties for recording artists and with market  demand. It will also bring much needed transparency to our music  licensing system by creating a public database that identifies musical  works and their owners.   I am pleased to report that our bill has broad support across the  music industry, which is a tremendous thing. One of the things that  makes this legislation such a breakthrough is that we have been able to  get the songwriting side of the industry--the songwriters and their  representatives in all these matters in the publishing and PRO  community--on board with the recording and distribution side of the  industry--the record labels and digital music providers. Indeed, I  don't think I have ever seen a music bill that has had such broad  support across the industry. All sides have a stake in this, and they  have come together in support of a commonsense, consensus bill that  addresses challenges throughout the music industry.   I should also note that introduction is just the start of the  process. Bills change as they move through markup and floor  consideration, and there are some outstanding issues in the latter part  of the bill that remain to be resolved with broadcasters. I am  committed to working through these issues as the bill moves forward so  that we have the broadest consensus possible.   I said at the outset that I am a songwriter myself. I have a deep and  abiding interest in these issues. These matters are personal to me.  They are also an important part of my legacy. I am relatively unknown,  and I don't expect to make a lot of money out of the music industry,  but I am deeply interested in this, in making sure that those who do  create these wonderful musical subjects will be treated more fairly  than they are today.   I have fought long and hard for strong copyright protections my  entire time in the Senate. I have passed a number of landmark copyright  bills, from the Copyright Term Extension Act to the Digital Millennium  Copyright Act to the Family Movie Act.   The Music Modernization Act is another in that long line of landmark  legislation. In fact, I view it as the capstone of my work on  copyright. I say that because I want my colleagues to know how  important this bill is, not just to me but to my friends, and I want my  friends in the industry to know how important this bill is to me as  well. I have less than a year left in this body, and one thing that I  am dead set on is enacting this bill into law before I leave.   I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting and sponsoring this  bill. The music we create in our country is an important part of our  culture and of the message we carry to the rest of the world. Let's do  everything we can to ensure we have a music licensing system that is  fair, that rewards creativity, and that creates the right incentives to  write, perform, and sell music. That is exactly what the Music  Modernization Act will do.   I have a partner in this business of trying to get this bill through,  the great Senator from the State of Tennessee, Lamar Alexander, who  himself is a very accomplished musician. He is a great piano player,  and he is a great friend, and he understands these issues as much as if  not more than anyone else I know in the Congress of the United States.  I just feel very indebted to him and blessed to have him as one of the  people who will be working with me on this matter.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I can't express my appreciation well enough  to thank the Senator from Tennessee for this wonderful set of remarks  he has just given. He has outlined it as well as it could be done.  Tennessee has always been very well represented, but Lamar Alexander is  one of the great Senators here, and I am just grateful that he is  standing side by side with me on this.   The songwriters of America have been mistreated for years and years  and years, and it is time to change it. It is time to get some equity  and some fairness into this system, and I think Lamar has outlined that  about as well as it could be outlined. I want to personally express my  appreciation to the Senator from Tennessee for what he has said here  today.    Mr. President, I thank my good friend, Senator Coons, for  co-sponsoring the Music Modernization Act and for his engagement on  this critically important subject. Like Senator Coons, I want this bill  to achieve broad support so that it can move forward in a consensus  manner. To that end, I intend to work with broadcasters to address  their concerns as the bill moves from introduction to markup and look  forward to a productive, successful dialogue on these issues.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise with my good friend from Tennessee  to discuss some truly landmark legislation we are introducing today  that is long overdue.
