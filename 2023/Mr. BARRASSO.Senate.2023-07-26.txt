 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 75th  anniversary of True Companies. This network of Wyoming businesses spans  several major industries that directly benefit Natrona County, Wyoming,  and our Nation.   Headquartered in Casper, WY, True Companies is a Wyoming institution.  Proudly owned and operated by the True family, the businesses that make  up True Companies are diverse. They contribute to multiple industries  including energy, agriculture, real estate/development, and the  financial sector. True Companies employs over 1,000 individuals across  the United States in Wyoming, Colorado, Montana, North Dakota, Utah,  New Mexico, Arizona, Missouri, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma.   In Wyoming, we follow the Code of the West, a set of cowboy ethics  that drive and shape our values. These principles remind us to take  pride in our work and to do what has to be done. Today, the Code of the  West hangs in the lobby of True Companies, serving as a reminder of the  values of its  [[Page S3614]]  founder H.A. ``Dave'' True, Jr. Henry Alphonso True, Jr., or Dave as he  was known to friends and family, was born in 1915 in Cheyenne. He  married his high school sweetheart Jean in 1938. After earning his  engineering degree from Montana State University, he followed in the  footsteps of his father. Dave worked for Texaco, formerly known as the  Texas Company, in Cody, where he lived with Jean and their four  children: Tamma, H.A. ``Hank'' III, Diemer, and David L. In 1948, the  family relocated to Casper. Here, Dave became part owner and manager of  the Reserve Drilling Company, a one-rig drilling outfit that would  change the course of his career. Just 3 years later, he was the  president of Reserve Drilling and then opened his own drilling  enterprise, True and Brown Drilling Contractors.   Dave had an uncanny ability to anticipate the needs of a then-booming  oil industry. In 1954, he founded True Oil and True Drilling. He  discovered several oil reservoirs in the ensuing years. In the next two  decades, he founded eight additional businesses, each uniquely situated  to meet the needs of--and capitalize on--the booming oil sector and  Casper's growing population. It was also during this period that Dave  began to diversify his interests. In 1957, he entered the ranching  sector. True Ranches, a 36-head cattle operation included Nugget, his  lone bull. Other endeavors were the Belle Fourche Pipeline Company,  Black Hills Trucking, and Eighty-Eight Oil LLC. In all his business  dealings, Dave was a consummate professional. He valued integrity and  respect over making a quick buck. He was known to say, ``A good deal is  not a good deal unless it's good for both parties.''   Quiet and hard working, Dave took seriously his role of sharing his  time and talent with his community. In 1961, he established a  scholarship program for the children of True Companies employees. For  over six decades, the program has rewarded deserving, high-achieving  students with money to pursue their education. Dave also taught his  children the importance of public service and giving back. Today, the  True family is well-known for its generous philanthropic efforts. In  May of this year, the University of Wyoming, our State's only 4-year  university, established the H.A. ``Dave'' True Jr. Family College of  Business Deanship. This distinct honor recognizes the True family's  legacy of dedicated service and entrepreneurial spirit.   The history of True Companies began with the humble vision and  determination of Dave and Jean. After Dave died in 1994, Jean continued  as the family's matriarch until she passed in 2006. She was 90 years  old. Today, the company's heritage lives on through their children,  grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and even great-great-grandchildren.   Hank III and Karen True have three children: Thea True-Wells and  Scott Wells with children Eric, Christopher, Jean Marie, and Katelin  Wells; H.A. ``Tad'' IV and Jennifer True with children H.A. ``Henry''  V, Sam and Charlie; and Barbara True.   Diemer and Susie True have four children: Kip and Chris True with  children Hailey True, Hannah and Steven Gutenberger, Hollie and Seth  Snitker, Hayden and Lydia True, Harrison and Meghan True, Haines,  Helaina, Hadleigh and Hyldie True; Kyle and Caridee True with children  Connor and Suzanna True, Kennedee and Shawn Dalke, Cross and Megan  True, Johnathon and Jacqueline True, Jordan, Sophia, and Patton True;  Tara and Kirk Aamot with children Abbie and James Cooksey, Mark, David,  and Grace Aamot; and Tracy True-Propp with children Mikayla and Preston  Propp.   Dave and Melanie True have four children: Shane and JoAnn True with  children Ellie True, Elijah and Katherine True, Rand, Delaney, Finn,  and Reagan True; Christy and Quintin LeClercq with children Brayden,  Kellan, Lincoln, and Zanden LeClercq; Bryce and Kelsey True with  children Taggart, Roark, and Akston True; and Ashley and Gene VanDeest.   Dave and Jean's eldest daughter Tamma True-Hatten died in 2017. Her  husband Donald Hatten predeceased her in 2002. Their memories live on  through their two children Jaci and Dale Kerns with children Kodi  Kerns, Jake (JD) and Dawn Kerns, Josh and Randi Kerns, and Joel Kerns;  and Dave Hatten with children Kaci Hatten and Kara and Christian Sabo.   True Companies includes the following businesses: True Oil, True  Drilling, True Ranches, Toolpushers Supply Company, Black Hills  Trucking, Measurement Services LLC, Bridger Pipeline LLC, Eighty-Eight  Oil LLC, Equitable Oil Purchasing Company, Hilltop Bank, Flowstate, and  Brick and Bond, in addition to numerous other ranches and properties.   This year, members and employees of the True Companies family will  celebrate its 75th anniversary by giving back to the community. On  August 19, 2023, True Companies will join Bluepeak in sponsoring the  annual 5150' Festival, a free community event hosted by Visit Casper.  It is a wonderful opportunity to celebrate all that Casper has to offer  with food, vendors, and live music.   True Companies was built on a foundation of humble service and hard  work. Its founder, H.A. ``Dave'' True, Jr., established a culture that  encouraged employees to ``talk less and say more.'' Bobbi and I are  honored to celebrate its 75th anniversary, and we look forward to the  next 75 years of success.                            ____________________
