 I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and  thank her for her leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this piece of legislation. This  bill undermines our commitment to our veterans, it weakens our  background check system, and it puts guns in the hands of those who  shouldn't have them.   I am a combat veteran and I am a gun owner. I strongly support the  Second Amendment. With responsible gun ownership comes the recognition  that not everyone is mentally capable to own a gun.   Every day, 20 veterans take their own life, most of those with a  firearm, so the VA acted to prevent violence and to comply with the law  by keeping guns out of the hands of veterans who are in crisis. These  are veterans with very serious diagnoses, including 20,000 veterans  diagnosed with schizophrenia, over 11,000 with dementia, and more than  5,000 with Alzheimer's. Passing this bill would remove their names from  our background check system.   This is absolute stupidity. The VA has done a good job to keep more  than 174,000 veterans with serious mental health problems from getting  a gun. They are working hard to save the lives of these veterans. This  bill would make it easier for veterans to take their own life.   I don't want to see another veteran become a statistic. Passing this  bill puts our veterans at risk. We owe them the best care and support.  Sadly, this bill would leave them more vulnerable than ever. This is a  dangerous overstep, and I urge every Member to seriously consider the  impact this will have on our veterans, their families, and their  communities.
