 Mr. Speaker, I rise in celebration of the life of a great  and rare American, Toledoan Norm Nitschke.   Mr. Nitschke passed away in February at the age of nearly 101. He led  a full and exceptional life. As an inventor, an engineer, and a  renowned pioneer of glass and solar manufacturing, Norm Nitschke  literally changed the world.   He was pivotal in the development of tempered glass and creating a  market for it in the automotive industry. It is a technology many of us  take for granted today, but it has been instrumental in saving lives  and making modern cars safer.   Then, he went on to found Glasstech Solar and Solar Cells, pioneering  thin-film cadmium telluride technology, central to modern solar panels  like those installed on homes and buildings across our country and now  the world.   His pathbreaking work with Dr. Harold McMaster created America's most  important company in solar energy, First Solar in Toledo, Ohio.   In retirement, he gave back generously to our community and is a  benefactor of so many educational institutions: University of Toledo's  engineering school, Bowling Green State University, Toledo Symphony,  and Toledo Museum of Art.   I simply cannot say enough about this great American.                            ____________________
