 Mr. Chairman, today we know that a major factor  leading up to the worst economic crisis in our lifetime was the  heavyhanded and meddlesome politics of the Federal Government.   Unfortunately, the previous administration responded to that crisis  not by limiting the intrusion of the Federal bureaucracy, but by  increasing it. They implemented Dodd-Frank under the guise of  protecting the consumer, but, in reality, this bill empowered  government, created new bureaucracies, made the big banks bigger, and  virtually ended the creation of new community banks.   In the wake of the financial crisis, Georgia lost more banks than any  other State in the Nation. Unemployment skyrocketed, and hundreds of  businesses went under. But instead of creating opportunities for  Georgians to pick themselves up and start again, Dodd-Frank continued  to suppress our economic recovery, and today, nearly a decade after the  end of the recession,  [[Page H4728]]  there are still 47 counties in Georgia without a local community bank,  and 3 counties without a single bank branch at all.   The Financial CHOICE Act will reverse these burdensome regulations  and, once again, sow the seeds of prosperity on Main Street, not just  Wall Street. The bill will end bailouts of big banks by taxpayers and  unleash our economic potential by opening the economy to everyone.   I urge my colleagues to support the Financial CHOICE Act.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).
