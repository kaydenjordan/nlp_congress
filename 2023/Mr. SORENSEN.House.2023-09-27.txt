 Mr. Chair, the annual Defense Appropriations bill is  one of the best tools we have to strengthen our national security and  foster innovation.   This year's bill includes a well-deserved 5.2 percent pay raise for  our troops and $12.5 million dollars to support the Rock Island Arsenal  and manufacturing jobs in my district.   Workers in Central and Northwestern Illinois take great pride in  supplying our military with new equipment that helps service members  safely defend and protect our nation.   That is why I'm proud to introduce my amendment to fund novel  technology that can 3D print high-strength, lightweight carbon fiber  composite parts into state-of-the-art wings for Unmanned Air Vehicles.   This new technology will produce wings roughly 10 times faster than  traditional technologies on the market, allowing for the fabrication of  a wing in a single day and assisting the military in meeting the demand  for Collaborative Combat Aircraft.   At the same time, this funding will create good-paying jobs for the  families in my neighborhood.   I urge Congress to pass my amendment and get this project off the  ground for our taxpayers and for our national defense.
