 Mr. Chairman, I thank Chair Foxx for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, we have a problem. Today, America's education system is  being purchased and manipulated by foreign nations. Since 2013, we know  about $12 billion has flooded in from foreign sources to U.S. colleges,  and outside experts say billions more in foreign funds could have been  underreported.   Foreign nations are pumping money into our higher education systems,  and these nations are not our friends. This means our enemies are  funding our colleges and universities.   Make no mistake, every dollar that flows into our classrooms comes  with strings attached. By accepting these foreign funds, our colleges  and universities are importing toxic hatred straight from the dogma of  our Nation's enemies into our classrooms.   The results speak for themselves, as we saw in Chair Foxx's committee  hearing yesterday: rampant anti-Semitism, censorship, and disdain for  our U.S. Constitution, our Founding Fathers, and our American way of  life.   This is what happens when our institutions of higher learning accept  the Trojan horse of foreign funding. This blatant attempt to inject  foreign ideologies into our schools undermines the fundamental purpose  of American education.   It goes without saying that we should be teaching American values in  American schools.   As a proud cosponsor of Representative Steel's bill, H.R. 5933, the  DETERRENT Act, I look forward today to supporting this timely  legislation, which will provide much-needed transparency in foreign  funding to schools and reporting requirements.   As we say in Florida, let the sunshine in. Mr. Chairman, let me be  clear: America's institutions of higher learning are not for sale.
