 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is very  straightforward. It just requires that funds in Transportation, Housing  and Urban Development, and Related Agencies only go to cities and  States that uphold Federal law.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the gentleman across the aisle  is correct when he says that this does not change current law and it is  just enforcing current Federal law. I would just urge the body to  support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
