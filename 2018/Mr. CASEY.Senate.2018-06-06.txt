 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Mr.  William T. Kerr and his contributions to the creation of Flag Day. His  passion for the flag spurred a lifetime pursuit to establish a national  holiday to honor it.   Mr. Kerr grew up in Pittsburgh and established himself in Yeadon, PA.  After hearing the stories of sacrifice and patriotism during the Civil  War, Mr. Kerr garnered a unique appreciation for the flag of the United  States.   In 1888, Mr. Kerr established the American Flag Day Association, an  organization committed to promoting patriotism and respect for the flag  on a national scale and establishing Flag Day on June 14. In Mr. Kerr's  capacity as the president of the American Flag Day Association, a  position he held for five decades, he met with nine Presidents and  wrote countless letters to Senators, Members of Congress, Governors,  and local officials to petition for Flag Day to be celebrated on June  14.   Mr. Kerr's activism inspired several leaders, including President  Woodrow Wilson, who went on to proclaim June 14 as National Flag Day on  May 30, 1916, and General Douglas MacArthur, who wrote a letter to Mr.  Kerr in 1947, citing reverence and honor in the flag itself. Though  Congress initially failed to submit legislation to President Wilson  supporting the proclamation to recognize the holiday, three decades  later, Congress passed a bill formally declaring June 14 as National  Flag Day. On August 3, 1949, President Harry S. Truman, with Mr. Kerr  standing next to him, signed the Flag Day bill into law, formally  declaring June 14 as National Flag Day.   I commend Mr. Kerr on his commitment to creating a day to honor the  flag. Pennsylvanians are renowned for their hard work, dedication,  perseverance, and patriotism, and Mr. Kerr is an excellent example of  that assessment. Mr. Kerr's legacy has lived on, especially in the  small farm town of Yeadon, where the town celebrates Flag Day as an  all-day affair.                            ____________________
