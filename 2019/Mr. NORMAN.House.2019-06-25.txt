 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to enter into the Congressional  Record a special poem that was written by Harold Renwick, Jr. to his  daughter, Penny, on her second birthday.   Harold Renwick never delivered the poem as he was killed in action  during the Vietnam war. The poem was discovered by Captain Bennet and  mailed by a friend of Harold Renwick's, Major Charles King. It was  mailed to Harold Renwick's wife, Penny's mother, on March 22, 1968.   The poem is titled: ``Now You Are Two.''       Rejoice and be happy this fine day.      Have fun in all the games you play.      Run, sing, be happy and gay,      For you are 2, my daughter, today.      Of all the wonderful days of the year,      Today especially I wish I could be near      To hold you, to hug you and share your world      Of being a year older and being a girl.      But alas, my child, with you I cannot be      Because there is a need to keep the world free.      A need that was created many years ago,      When a people's thirst for freedom began to grow.      You do not know these people; they are strangers to us.      And you may ask, ``Daddy, why all the fuss      For a people who live in a land far away?      Daddy, why can't you be with me on my birthday?''      As you grow older, my child, you will learn      That in men's hearts a spark will burn.      A spark so intense that it cannot be denied,      So strong it is that men have died      Fighting for what they believe is true;      Fighting for freedom the way all men do.      We have watched enough television to know      That in this world bad people will go      And try to hurt and harm the good guys.      Cheat, steal, and tell all kind of lies,      These are some of the things these bad guys do.      This is the reason that your daddy flew      Across the oceans to a land far away      To help other daddies with their children to play,      To help these daddies see their struggle through      So they can say, ``Happy birthday, my daughter, now you are             2.''      Don't weep, my child, for this birthday I'll miss.      Go to your mommy and she'll give you a kiss      From me, to remind you I've not forgot.      You see, my child, I do love you a lot.      So much, in fact, that to you I do pledge      That a world of freedom shall be your heritage.      Sleep, my child, the night is here.      Sleep, my child, and wake without fear.      Grow, my child, be happy and free,      For these are the dreams I have for thee.    This poem was written in 1968, over 51 years ago, and I submit to you  that now is the time for America to heed these words of this poem  written by a father who voluntarily made the ultimate sacrifice in  defense of freedom.                            ____________________
