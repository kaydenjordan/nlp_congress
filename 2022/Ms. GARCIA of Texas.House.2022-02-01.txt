 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the jobs  created by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.   By passing this historic piece of legislation, we have set in motion  adding two million jobs a year for the American people. High-paying,  stable jobs filled by skilled, union, American workers.   These are the jobs that hold families together. They put everyday  people in control of their future for themselves and for their  children.   We are building the roads, bridges, high-speed internet, ports, and  airports we need. We are strengthening our frail electric grid.   We are building back better now and for the next generation to come,  for all our children.                            ____________________
