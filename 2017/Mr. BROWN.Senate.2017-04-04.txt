 Mr. President, nearly 70 years ago today, the United  States and 11 other nations--in the face of Soviet aggression--joined  together in mutual defense to form the North Atlantic Treaty  Organization, NATO. Since its inception, NATO has expanded to 28 member  nations. The breadth of its mission is impressive--from ensuring  regional stability and combating terrorism to training partner  countries and supporting humanitarian aid. While NATO was founded to  ensure Western peace and stability in the face of the Cold War, its  work has come to encompass all corners and peoples of the globe.   NATO is more important than ever today in deterring regional conflict  The U.S. must stand by its ironclad commitment to NATO's security and  solidarity as Russian President Vladimir Putin flouts international law  and exerts Russian aggression around the world, from meddling in our  own election to the illegal annexation of Crimea.   Our NATO allies need our support. I applaud Operation Atlantic  Resolve, which coordinates the deployment of additional NATO troops to  our allies in Eastern Europe. I also commend other U.S. efforts that  support our NATO allies, like the European Reassurance Initiative.  These play an essential role in bolstering our force readiness in the  region to deter Russian aggression and demonstrate our commitment to  the common cause and democratic principles that NATO embodies.   American support for NATO is and must remain steadfast. The nearly  unanimous vote in the Senate ratifying Montenegro's accession to be a  member state is evidence of this well-established, deeply founded  support.  [[Page S2213]]  Ukraine's stated intention to achieve the criteria for joining NATO,  too, is testament to the organization's renewed importance in our  deterrence policy in the region.   While the sentiment of NATO's article 5--``an attack on one is an  attack on all''--helped guide the U.S. stably through the Cold War,  NATO has remained a relevant source of stength for the international  community, beyond regional deterrence. Since 1999, when NATO identified  the risk international terrorism posed for member nations, the  organization has remained a steadfast resource in the fight against  terrorism. In fact, the only instance in which article 5 was invoked  was in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Since  then, NATO has helped ensure freedom of navigation in waters plagued by  piracy, helped train Iraqi security forces counter improvised explosive  devices, commanded counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan for more  than a decade, provided support for Global Coalition to Counter ISIL,  and innumerable other contributions. As threats to member nations  evolved in the 21st century, NATO demonstrated its ability to adapt.   NATO showed the power of strength through solidarity, not only for  its member nations, but also for its dozens of partner nations around  the globe. The power of NATO's partnerships lends strength to the  global community as a whole, better equipping regions of the world to  respond when disaster strikes. Programs like NATO's Centres of  Excellence help partner countries fight corruption, piracy, and  terrorism and collaborate to stem the spread of weapons of mass  destruction and other arms. By serving as a resource for nonmember  countries, NATO not only strengthens the resolve of the international  community to strife and instability, but also serves as a beacon for  democratic values like gender equality and rule of law.   Finally, NATO has long served as a force for human rights. It was  central to ending the genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1995, and  it helped bring an end to violence in Kosovo in 1999. NATO has served  as a vital resource assisting with the waves of refugees escaping from  violence and atrocity in Syria, and the organization has been at the  frontlines to combat international human trafficking.   NATO plays a critical role in combatting increased Russian  aggression, but its mission is much broader than that. The world is a  safer place thanks to NATO, from stemming regional conflicts, to  assisting partners around the world. It serves as an indispensable,  indisputable resource for the international community. As we celebrate  the anniversary of this pivotal organization today, we must remain  committed to its successful future.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 minutes--1  for Senator Donnelly, 1 for Senator Casey, and 1 for me. I thank  Senator Boozman for the time to talk for 3 minutes on the mine workers  healthcare law.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.                            Miners Protection Act     Thank you, Mr. President.   I rise today on the seventh anniversary of the tragedy of the Big  Branch Mine, where 29 mine workers were killed. There is no better way  to ask this Senate to do the right thing on extending healthcare for  mine workers permanently.   We have seen far too many times where mine workers in Ohio, West  Virginia, Kentucky, and all over this country, the retired mine workers  or their widows get a letter in the mail saying their healthcare is  about to be canceled. We kick the can down the road for 3 or 4 months  at a time. That is not acceptable.   It is up to this Senate this month to make sure that we fix this once  and for all so that mine workers who did so much for their communities  and their families and their country can be assured that they will have  healthcare for the rest of their lives as President Truman promised.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.    Mr. President, I always appreciate the remarks--the well- thought-through remarks of my colleague, and the history lesson putting  it into context is always so important and something we should do more  of in this body.   I thank Senator Bennet for his words.   The Supreme Court, as we know, has tremendous influence over the  lives of our country, the lives of Ohioans, my State, and the lives of  so many. Nominees must defend the rights of all Americans to make their  own healthcare decisions, to collectively bargain for safe workplaces  and fair pay, and to be protected from discrimination and Wall Street  greed.   Unfortunately, Judge Gorsuch is simply not that nominee. His record  is clear. He has ruled that corporations are people. I am not a lawyer,  but I understand that it is a relatively recent concept in American  jurisprudence to equate corporations with people. When you do that, you  simply give corporations more rights than individuals have. When you  come from that position, it means that judges repeatedly rule to choose  corporations over workers; they choose polluters over communities; they  choose Wall Street over consumer protections; they choose special  interest money over our citizens. We have seen too much of that in this  country.   We have seen a decline of the middle class, in part because the  Federal judiciary is choosing corporations over  [[Page S2348]]  workers. If chosen, polluters over communities; if chosen, Wall Street  over consumer protections; if chosen, special interest money over  citizens--that is the Court we have seen in far too many 5-to-4  decisions, as Senator Whitehouse has pointed out so effectively on this  floor.   The misguided idea that corporations are people is far outside the  mainstream of what most Ohioans believe. It may work for graduates of  Harvard and Yale Law School. Interestingly, if Judge Gorsuch is  approved, all nine of the Supreme Court Justices will have attended  Harvard or Yale Law School. I don't know what is wrong with Ohio State  or the University of Toledo or Akron University or University of  Cincinnati or Case Western or Michigan or Chicago or anywhere else.  That is whom Presidents have chosen; those are the people we seem to  confirm.   But this view that corporations are people simply doesn't wash with  the American people. It is how we got rules that allow Wall Street  banks and hedge funds to wreak havoc on ordinary working people and  ordinary working families, with no consequences.   Judge Gorsuch himself has argued against the rights of working  Americans to band together to hold Wall Street and corporations  accountable. He ruled against children with autism. He ruled against  students with disabilities. We have a President in the White House who  makes fun of disabled people. Now, we are going to put a Justice on the  Court who rules against students with disabilities. We have a Secretary  of Education who barely knew what IDEA was--the provision of the law  that guarantees disabled students an education.   Why we are moving in this direction, I think, amazes most people in  this country, whether you have a disabled person in your family or not.  His views of protecting students with disabilities are so outside the  mainstream that last month, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected his  reasoning.   A boy with autism, Luke, wasn't making progress in school, and it was  recommended that he be placed in a residential program. An impartial  hearing officer and two different judges agreed. But Judge Gorsuch  disagreed. He said that, as long as a student with a learning  disability is making ``merely . . . more than de minimus'' progress in  his or her education, the school district didn't have to do anything  else. Think of that. That student, he counts a little bit, but he  really doesn't count that much. He doesn't count as a full human being  with full rights and full citizenship in this country.   If your disabled child is getting more than nothing, I guess that is  good enough, according to Judge Gorsuch. Luckily, this Supreme Court,  as conservative as it usually is, overturned Judge Gorsuch's precedent  that denied a real education to students like Luke. Again, they  overturned him unanimously. Chief Justice Roberts noted that a student  offered an educational program providing merely more than de minimus  progress from year to year--this is Justice Roberts, a very  conservative Chief Justice--can hardly be said to have been offered an  education at all.   In other words, what Judge Gorsuch thinks and thought about this case  was that doing only a little bit for this student was meeting the  obligation of this civilized society that we are proud of. Fortunately,  the eight members of the Supreme Court--four Republican conservative  nominees, four more moderate to liberal nominees from the Democrats-- unanimously came together and disagreed with Judge Gorsuch.   But think about what can happen the next time. If an Ohio family has  a child with a learning disability and struggles with that school  system, they won't find sympathy from Justice Gorsuch. In fact, forget  sympathy. They can't count on him to protect their child under the law.   Take a look at the case of Alphonse Maddin, the truckdriver from  Michigan. He was hauling meat through Illinois when he stopped to  refuel. His brakes froze. He was stranded. He called for help, for a  company repair unit. He waited for hours for help. He nearly froze to  death. He couldn't feel his legs. It was 14-degrees below zero in the  truck. He needed to get to shelter or risk losing his limbs or worse.   But his company fired him. They claimed he abandoned his cargo. Mr.  Maddin later returned to get the cargo and completed his job. But it  just did not matter to the company. To the company, the cargo was more  important than Mr. Maddin's life. To Judge Gorsuch, that company's  interests were more important than Mr. Maddin, more important than his  health, more important than his life.   Imagine that. That is what we mean when we say he puts corporations  ahead of workers. At the beginning, you remember I said there is this  relatively new idea in American jurisprudence that corporations are  individuals and people are corporations. When you say that, it means  that you side with corporations over workers. You side with polluters  over communities. You side with Wall Street over consumer protections.  You side with big, dark money from billionaires in Citizens United over  citizens.   Take a look at the case of a mother who had leukemia and had to take  time off for treatment. After the treatment was over, her doctors  advised her not to return to work quite yet. There was a flu epidemic.  Her immune system was compromised from chemotherapy. But her employer  told her she needed to show up within a week or they would fire her  despite 15 years of dedicated service. Guess who Judge Gorsuch sided  with? It was not the worker suffering from cancer, who had dedicated a  decade and a half of her life to her employer and who wanted to return  to work, but she simply was advised against it by her doctor.   This woman's daughter, Katherine, said that when Judge Gorsuch issued  his ruling, ``he didn't even think about the impact that this had on  our family.'' She said his ruling ``set the precedent that a company's  needs come before workers like her mother.''   At a time when Americans work longer and harder than ever before,  when we devalue work in this country, when workers' wages--for huge  percentages of workers in this country--are stagnant, when people work  longer and harder with less and less to show for it, the last thing we  need to do is elevate someone who sees workers as nothing more than a  cost to be minimized.   That is what is at stake here. We are talking about putting someone  on the Court who wants to give corporations special rights, but he has  a record of ignoring the rights of ordinary citizens, choosing  corporations over people, saying that corporations are, in fact,  people. That means that he is almost always, in his cases, choosing  corporations over workers, choosing polluters over communities.   Judge Gorsuch's record makes clear that he would turn back the clock  on a woman's right to make her own healthcare decisions, or LBGT  rights, or clean air and clean water, or safe food and medicine.   That is what is at stake here. If the Senate does not reject his  nomination, the decisions Judge Gorsuch hands down will haunt our  Nation for generations. My opposition to this nominee has nothing to do  with what has occurred in the Senate over the past 8 years, as  despicable as it has been. It has everything to do with what could  happen over the next 100.   This is about our children and our grandchildren. Seven of the eight  current justices have met the 60-vote benchmark. In other words, seven  of the eight justices on the Court right now were fairminded enough and  centrist enough and agreeable enough that far more than 60 Senators-- people in both parties--came together to confirm those nominees.   With so much at stake, it is up to Judge Gorsuch to earn the votes of  60 Members of this body. I do not believe someone who fundamentally  wants to give and has given corporations more rights than individual  citizens has earned that broad support. The solution is not to change  the rules; it is to change the nominee.   That is what we mean by advice and consent. The American people need  a Supreme Court Justice who looks out for the interests of all  Americans, not just the 1 percent, not just the most powerful, not just  the most privileged. That is why I oppose Judge Gorsuch's confirmation  to the U.S. Supreme Court.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.
