 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am an unabashed optimist. I am a glass- half-full not a glass-half-empty kind of guy, and I tell my staff that  I am like the little boy who goes down on Christmas morning and looks  under the Christmas tree and finds a pile of manure and wonders where  my pony is. That is how much of an optimist I am.   So I am optimistic about our progress made in the war against COVID- 19 after this long year that we have all endured. So far, a quarter of  Americans over the age of 18 have received at least one dose of the  vaccine. More than two-thirds of people over 65 have gotten their first  shot. In my State, they have recently said everybody 50 and up can get  a shot. Now, very soon, any adult person over the age of 16 will be  eligible to get the vaccine. That translates into good news across the  board. New cases, deaths, and hospitalizations are all declining. Over  the last week, the 7-day positivity rate in Texas dropped to the lowest  point since last May.   While we continue to follow the public health guidelines to slow the  spread of the virus, it is clear we are moving closer and closer to an  eventual end of this pandemic, and there are a million reasons to be  optimistic.   Despite the narrative pushed by some, all of this hope isn't the  result of just the last couple of months, and it certainly is not the  product of the partisan bill that was passed just 2 weeks ago. These  efforts have been underway for more than a year now, and we owe a great  deal of credit to Operation Warp Speed, the initiative set up by the  Trump administration to accelerate the development of vaccines,  treatments, and therapeutics.   Last summer, when President Trump speculated that we would have an  effective vaccine by the end of the year, he received some serious  blowback. One media outlet published a fact check saying it would  require nothing short of a ``medical miracle.'' Well, thanks to the  leadership of the previous administration, thanks to the great  scientists, pharmaceutical companies, and others, that so-called  miracle has come true not just once but twice. Both the Pfizer and  Moderna vaccines received emergency authorization last year, and  Johnson & Johnson's vaccine was authorized last month.   Rather than setting ambitious goals to bring an end to the pandemic,  the Biden administration has embraced a different approach. An  Associated Press headline in January evaluated the situation pretty  well when it said that Biden's early approach is to ``underpromise''  and ``overdeliver.''   Well, in December, President-Elect Biden announced his  administration's vaccine goal as 100 million shots in the first hundred  days. That announcement came about a week before the first doses of the  vaccine were distributed, before we had a real-world test of the  processes that had been in the planning stages for months. But it  quickly became obvious that we were on a pace to meet that goal before  President Biden even took the oath of office on January 20. The week of  the inauguration, we averaged 1 million shots a day. On January 20, 1.5  million Americans received the vaccine. One physician and public health  expert described the President's goal as a ``disappointingly low bar.''  To no one's surprise, the administration met that goal well ahead of  the deadline.   Last week, the President claimed a victory for hitting 100 million  vaccines in 58 days. Well, so did he follow up with a new goal, a truly  ambitious one that would get us shots in arms even faster? Did he set  up a new benchmark to encourage States to make their vaccination  efforts more efficient and effective? Well, not yet. Maybe he will.  Maybe he will announce a new goal this week. For the sake of our  country, I hope he sets the bar high.   Given the fact that we are now vaccinating about 2.5 million  Americans per day--a staggering number, really--it is time for the  administration to take a truly bold step. The goal here isn't to set a  target you are almost certain to meet. After all, you didn't see the  previous administration set a target of a successful vaccine by the  summer of 2021, which is what many experts believed at the time.   Unfortunately, the underpromise, overdeliver strategy doesn't end  with vaccinations. Just look at the President's latest comments about  small outdoor gatherings. In the same speech where he tried to take a  victory lap for the ``disappointingly low bar'' set for vaccinations,  he made a rather confusing promise to the American people.   He said:         If we keep our guard up, stick together, and stick with the       science, we can look forward to a Fourth of July that feels a       little bit more normal with small groups able to gather for       cookouts in backyards.    Well, that was a little bit of a head-scratcher, when President Biden  said that he anticipated that everybody who wanted the vaccine could  get it by May, and now he is talking about having outdoor gatherings on  the Fourth of July.   I can tell you, these small outdoor gatherings have been a part of  many Texans' routines for almost all year now. Families and friends  have spent time in driveways, backyards, open-air spaces, parks. They  follow the public health guidelines to keep themselves and their loved  ones safe while managing some sense of normalcy   The Centers for Disease Control has said it is safe for fully  vaccinated individuals to gather not just outdoors but indoors as well.  But based on the President's remarks last week, he is trying to frame  these gatherings as a reward if things go well over the next few  months. If you do everything right, then you might be able to hang out  with your family in the backyard in 3 months. Well, the  administration's own Centers for Disease Control has already told us  that these gatherings are safe. Your current public health guidelines  can't also double as a goal for 3\1/2\ months from now.   Then there is another big inconsistency between what the experts are  telling us and what the administration is doing, and that has to do  with reopening schools. Some children have now hit the anniversary mark  of virtual learning. Studies have shown consistently that this is  having a huge negative impact on America's kids academically, mentally,  socially, and emotionally.   We need our schools to reopen, and, of course, we need that to happen  safely, which they can. Back in December, then President-Elect Biden  seemed to share that goal. He promised to safely reopen the majority of  schools within his first hundred days in the White  [[Page S1698]]  House, another hundred-day goal. The experts tell us it is not only  possible, but it has already been done across the country.   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a report in  January that said:         There has been little evidence that schools have       contributed meaningfully to increased community transmission.    In short, the schools are not a breeding ground for COVID-19, and as  long as proper precautions are taken, schools can reopen safely. In  fact, it has already happened across most of Texas. Nearly two-thirds  of Texas schools are fully in-person, and just 3 percent of districts  are still fully remote. Two-thirds are fully reopened, and 3 percent  are fully remote.   Unfortunately, in this case, the science is at odds with a key  supporter of our Democratic colleagues, and that is the teachers  unions. For months, teachers unions have fought a safe return to in- person instruction even though the experts and real-world evidence tell  us that it is safe. It has gone so far that they have now gotten into  some pretty sticky situations.   A leaked post from a private Facebook group for the Los Angeles  teachers union warned teachers not to post pictures of their spring  break photos because it makes it difficult to argue that it is unsafe  to return to school. Well, it is tough to tell parents that it is not  safe for their kids to go to school and then turn around and tell  teachers it is fine to go on vacation; just don't post pictures.  Trusting science and listening to the experts means doing so all the  time, not just when it is convenient or politically expedient.   We are seeing progress every day in our fight against COVID-19. That  is the light at the end of the tunnel that is getting bigger and  brighter, and the question is not if we get there but when. How quickly  can we get more vaccines into arms? When will our children--all our  children--return safely to the classroom? How long until families can  hug one another without fear of spreading the virus to someone they  love?   We all know this is a community effort. It is a team effort. It is a  personal responsibility effort. Each of us has a role to play in  stopping the spread of the virus. But leadership matters too. The goals  and benchmarks set by the administration will determine how quickly all  of these things can happen. Now is not the time to walk back goals, set  low bars, or bow to unions and political supporters. The administration  needs to set clear metrics and targets for how we reopen and find our  new normal, and these goals should be based on the science and the  advice of the experts--nothing less.   So we are getting close to safely crossing the finish line, and we  shouldn't let politics or any other consideration slow us down.   I yield the floor.   I would suggest the absence of a quorum.
