 I thank the Senator from Texas.   Continuing:         In your statement you assert that our actions, even though       peaceful, must be condemned because they precipitate       violence. But is this a logical assertion? Isn't this like       condemning a robbed man because his possession of money       precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn't this like       condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to       truth and his philosophical inquiries precipitated the act by       the misguided populace in which they made him drink hemlock?       Isn't this like condemning Jesus because his unique God       consciousness and never ceasing devotion to God's will       precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? We must come to see       that, as the federal courts have consistently affirmed, it is       wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to gain his       basic constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate       violence. Society must protect the robbed and punish the       robber. I had also hoped that the white moderate would reject       the myth concerning time in relation to the struggle for       freedom. I have just received a letter from a white brother       in Texas. He writes: ``All Christians know that the colored       people will receive equal rights eventually, but it is       possible that you are in too great a religious hurry. It has       taken Christianity almost two thousand years to accomplish       what it has. The teachings of Christ take time to come to       earth.'' Such an attitude stems from a tragic misconception       of time, from the strangely irrational notion that there is       something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure       all ills. Actually, time itself is neutral; it can be used       either destructively or constructively. More and more I feel       that the people of ill will have used time much more       effectively than have the people of good will. We will have       to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words       and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence       of the good people. Human progress never rolls in on wheels       of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of       men willing to be coworkers with God, and without this hard       work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social       stagnation. We must use time creatively, in the knowledge       that the time is always ripe to do right. Now is the time to       make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending       national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is       the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of       racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.        You speak of our activity in Birmingham as extreme. At       first I was rather disappointed that fellow clergymen would       see my nonviolent efforts as those of an extremist. I began       thinking about the fact that I stand in the middle of two       opposing forces in the Negro community. One is a force of       complacency, made up in part of Negroes who, as a result of       long years of oppression, are so drained of self respect in       the sense of ``somebodiness'' that they have adjusted to       segregation; and in part of a few middle-class Negroes who,       because of a degree of academic and economic security and       because in some ways they profit by segregation, have become       insensitive to the problems of the masses. The other force is       one of bitterness and hatred, and it comes perilously close       to advocating violence. It is expressed in the various black       nationalist groups that are springing up across the nation,       the largest and best known being Elijah Muhammad's Muslim       movement. Nourished by the Negro's frustration over the       continued existence of racial discrimination, this movement       is made up of people who have lost faith in America, who have       absolutely repudiated Christianity, and who have concluded       that the white man is an incorrigible ``devil.''        I have tried to stand between these two forces, saying that       we need emulate neither the ``do nothingism'' of the       complacent nor the hatred and despair of the black       nationalist. For there is the more excellent way of love and       nonviolent protest. I am grateful to God that, through the       influence of the Negro church, the way of nonviolence became       an integral part of our struggle. If this philosophy had not       emerged, by now many streets of the South would, I am       convinced, be flowing with blood. And I am further convinced       that if our white brothers dismiss as ``rabble rousers'' and       ``outside agitators'' those of us who employ nonviolent       direct action, and if they refuse to support our nonviolent       efforts, millions of Negroes will, out of frustration and       despair, seek solace and security in black nationalist       ideologies--a development that would inevitably lead to a       frightening racial nightmare.        Oppressed people cannot remain oppressed forever. The       yearning for freedom eventually manifests itself, and that is       what has happened to the American Negro. Something within has       reminded him of his birthright of freedom, and something       without has reminded him that it can be gained. Consciously       or unconsciously, he has been caught up by the Zeitgeist, and       with his black brothers of Africa and his brown and yellow       brothers of Asia, South America and the Caribbean, the United       States Negro is moving with a sense of great urgency toward       the promised land of racial justice. If one recognizes this       vital urge that has engulfed the Negro community, one should       readily understand why public demonstrations are taking       place. The Negro has many pent up resentments and latent       frustrations, and he must release them. So let him march; let       him make prayer pilgrimages to the city hall; let him go on       freedom rides--and try to understand why he must do so. If       his repressed emotions are not released in nonviolent ways,       they will seek expression through violence; this is not a       threat but a fact of history.        So I have not said to my people, ``Get rid of your       discontent.'' Rather, I have tried to say that this normal       and healthy discontent can be channeled through into the       creative outlet of nonviolent direct action. And now this       approach is being termed extremist. But though I was       initially disappointed at being categorized as an extremist,       as I continued to think about the matter I gradually gained a       measure of satisfaction from the label. Was not Jesus an       extremist for love: ``Love your enemies, bless them that       curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them       which despitefully use you, and persecute you.'' Was not Amos       an extremist for justice: ``Let justice roll down like waters       and righteousness like an ever flowing stream.'' Was not Paul       an extremist for the Christian gospel: ``I bear in my body       the marks of the Lord Jesus.'' Was not Martin Luther an       extremist: ``Here I stand; I cannot do otherwise, so help me       God.'' And John Bunyan: ``I will stay in jail to the end of       my days before I make a butchery of my conscience.'' And       Abraham Lincoln: ``This nation cannot survive half slave and       half free.'' And Thomas Jefferson: ``We hold these truths to       be self evident, that all men are created equal . . .'' So       the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what       kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate       or for love? Will we be extremists for the preservation of       injustice or for the extension of justice? In that dramatic       scene on Calvary's hill three men were crucified. We must       never forget that all three were crucified for the same       crime--the crime of extremism. Two were extremists for       immorality, and thus fell below their environment. The other,       Jesus Christ, was an extremist for love, truth and goodness,       and thereby rose above his environment. Perhaps the South,       the nation and the world are in dire need of creative       extremists.    I yield to the Senator from Alaska.    Mr. President, investing in the development of a robust,  well-trained, and stable child welfare workforce is central to  improving outcomes for children and families across the United States.  The existence of such a workforce is essential to a child welfare  agency's ability to carry out the responsibilities with which they have  been entrusted. Child welfare work has been shown to be physically and  emotionally challenging, as demonstrated by recent studies into the  impact of secondary traumatic stress (STS) on child welfare  professionals. The multitude of challenges inherent in child welfare  work, combined with relatively low compensation and work benefits, make  these careers difficult to sustain, resulting in high rates of  turnover.   Studies conducted over the last 15 years estimate the national rate  of turnover of child welfare workers to be 20-40 percent annually. In  2017, Virginia reported a turnover rate of 30%, while Washington State  reported a turnover rate of 20% and Georgia reported a turnover rate of  32%. These high rates of turnover detract from the quality of services  delivered to children and families and result in an estimated cost of  $54,000 per worker leaving an agency.   Greater action is needed to ensure that individuals pursuing child  welfare careers receive appropriate training and support to improve the  sustainability of their important, yet demanding work. Higher rates of  retention for child welfare workers translates to greater stability for  families and improved services for vulnerable youth. Existing research  provides a number of evidenced-based and promising practices for  improving recruitment and retention in the child welfare workforce.   This is why I am pleased to introduce today the Child Welfare  Workforce Support Act. This bill directs the Secretary to conduct a  five-year demonstration program for child welfare service providers to  implement targeted interventions to recruit, select, and retain child  welfare workers. This demonstration program will focus on building an  evidence base of best practices for reducing barriers to the  recruitment, development, and retention of individuals providing direct  services to children and families. Funds will also be used to provide  ongoing professional development to assist child welfare workers in  meeting the diverse needs of families with infants and children with  the goal of improving both the quality of services provided and the  sustainability of such careers. Investing resources in determining what  practices have the greatest impact on the successful recruitment and  retention of child welfare workers will assist in developing an  evidence-base for future federal investment in this space.   I hope that as the Senate begins to discuss reauthorizing the Child  Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act that we consider the Child Welfare  Workforce Support Act and recognize the important role that child  welfare workers make to improve outcomes for vulnerable infants and  children.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Ms. Baldwin):   S. 1073. A bill to amend the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act  to ensure protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender youth  and their families; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions.    Mr. President, according to the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS), lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) youth are at an  increased risk for experiencing maltreatment compared to non-LGB youth.  A 2011 meta-analysis of 37 school-based studies found that LGB  adolescents were 3.8 times more likely to experience childhood sexual  abuse and 1.2 times more likely to experience physical abuse by a  parent or guardian when compared to their heterosexual peers.  Additional studies have demonstrated that gender nonconformity during  childhood may increase the risk for child maltreatment. Unfortunately,  there is not enough research and data available to identify the risk of  child maltreatment for individuals who identify as transgender.   These risks for maltreatment often times result in LGBTQ youth  entering the child welfare system. Studies have found that, ``LGBT  young people are overrepresented in child welfare systems, despite the  fact that they are likely to be underreported because they risk  harassment and abuse if their LGBT identity is disclosed.'' This  overrepresentation of LGBTQ youth in the foster care system raises  concerns about issues in the child abuse and prevention space.  Additional research is needed to understand the risk of maltreatment  among LGBTQ youth, particularly those identifying as transgender. These  studies will yield invaluable information to be used in developing  targeted prevention strategies to reduce the rates of adverse childhood  experiences of LGBTQ individuals.   This is why I am pleased to introduce the Protecting LGBTQ Youth Act,  which calls for HHS and other federal agencies to carry out an  interdisciplinary research program to protect LGBTQ youth from child  abuse and neglect and improve the well-being of victims of child abuse  or neglect. This legislation also expands current practices around  demographic information collection and reporting on incidences and  prevalence of child maltreatment to include sexual orientation and  gender identity. Additionally, the bill opens existing grant funding  opportunities to invest in the training of personnel in best practices  to meet the unique needs of LGBTQ youth and calls for the inclusion of  individuals experienced in working with LGBTQ youth and families in  state task forces. Improving data collection and disaggregation will  provide greater insight into the circumstances LGBTQ youth face in the  home that, when left unaddressed, lead to entry into the child welfare  system. This improved data-driven understanding can then be used to  develop appropriate and effective primary prevention practices to  decrease the risks faced by LGTBQ youth.   I hope that as the Senate begins to discuss the reauthorization of  the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act we consider the Protecting  LGBTQ Youth Act to better inform our collective understanding of the  risks faced by LGBTQ youth and the best ways to address them.                            ____________________     Mr. President, investing in the development of a robust,  well-trained, and stable child welfare workforce is central to  improving outcomes for children and families across the United States.
