 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 1464,  the rule providing for consideration of S. 4524, The Speak Out Act.   I commend you and Rules Committee Chairman McGovern for providing  this rule to allow The Speak Out Act to be brought before us for debate  and a vote, as it reflects our priorities for the American people.   Our Democratic Party Caucus deeply believes in women's rights, from  reproductive rights to workplace rights, including the right to engage  in one's career without being subjected to sexual harassment or abuse  that impairs lives and livelihoods.   By bringing this rule to the House, and allowing consideration of The  Speak Out Act, our leadership emphatically asserts that women's rights  are American rights; that the right to be treated with dignity and  respect in the workplace is a priority of Democrats, and that those  rights must not be deterred.   The Speak Out Act would limit the judicial enforceability of  predispute nondisclosure and nondisparagement contract clauses relating  to disputes involving sexual assault and sexual harassment.   This bill is critical to ending the culture of silence that quiets  the voices of survivors of sexual harassment. Ending the cycle of abuse  starts with eliminating the power that perpetrators have over their  victims.   Currently, companies can sue workers for breaking an NDA. The threat  of legal retaliation is daunting enough to keep workers from coming  forward with stories of abuse.  [[Page H8504]]    These NDAs have become commonplace in many industries. Harvard  Business Review has estimated that over one third of the U.S. workforce  is bound by NDAs.   These NDAs not only appear in settlements after a victim of sexual  harassment has raised their voice, but also have become routinely  included in standard employment contracts that are used at the time of  hiring.   Typically, NDAs work to provide confidentiality and protection, but  they have increasingly been used to protect power dynamics that enable  abusers to continue their dangerous and disgusting behavior.   One in 3 women has faced sexual harassment in the workplace during  her career, and an estimated 87 to 94 percent of those who experience  sexual harassment never file a formal complaint.   The reality is that many of these women have no voice because the  system rewards male manipulators and penalizes women who challenge the  status quo. This is institutionalized abuse.   The Speak Out Act can change this reality by preventing employers  from enforcing nondisclosure or non-disparagement agreements (NDAs) in  instance's when employees and workers report sexual misconduct.   In the wake of the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements, our country has  become acutely aware that men in power frequently leverage that power  abusively to exploit women.   Sexual abuse and harassment can destroy a victim's financial  security, mental health, and career path.   By standing up for their rights, the women who have been subjected to  abuse often become mired in a lengthy and costly lawsuit that drains  their finances, imposes a heavy psychic toll, and impairs their future  job prospects by creating a misimpression that they are disruptive  workers.   Women face a disturbing choice when sexually assaulted in the  workplace: report the abuse publicly and face litigation, leave the  company and abandon their income, or the choice that many are forced to  make, put their heads down and pretend it did not happen.   Passing this rule to allow consideration of The Speak Out Act aims to  provide victims with a third option to pursue justice.   It is time to amend the NDA system to strip the power from abusive  employers and give it back to the employee.    Madam Speaker, I rise for a series of issues that I  think are important.   First of all, two simple words, thank you, to all of the election  officials in all 50 States, the bulk of whom worked unceasingly to  ensure that the votes of the American people would be answered,  counted, and respected.   Let me also say how important it is in this moment that we recognize  the responsibilities of the Federal Government to raise the debt  ceiling, not for itself, but to ensure the stability and security and  protection of the American people. Medicare, Social Security, defense,  all of these issues fall under the debt ceiling. Not recklessly, but  rightly, we should do that.   I say to the Federal Reserve, stop raising the interest rates. You  are negatively impacting the consumer who is trying to stand up on  their feet. That is important.   Finally, I say, we should pass H.R. 40, the Commission to Study and  Develop Reparations Proposals for African Americans Act.   What is it about? Reconciliation, restoration, recognizing the  history of enslaved Africans, and recognizes the unequal distribution  of wealth to ensure that there is a recognition of dealing with the  disparities in education, disparities in housing, disparities in social  issues.   I believe we can work together. Let us come together on these issues  that I have mentioned. That is what America is all about.                            ____________________
