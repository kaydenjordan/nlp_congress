 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. on Friday, March 3, 2023.    Madam Speaker, South Africa's Government has recently  adopted a worrying path highlighted by its refusal to clearly oppose  Putin's war of aggression in Ukraine and its shameful decision to host  Russia and China for naval exercises on the war's anniversary.   I am a combat veteran. I have participated in both war games and war.  Make no mistake, one is intended to prepare for the other.   In hard times it is easy to be seduced by the siren song of  isolationism. Allowing vacuums of American influence around the world  to be filled with Chinese yuan and Russian lies is a threat to our  American economy and security at home.   We must speak softly and carry a big stick. And with our big stick,  we must eliminate safe havens for terror organizations in Africa that  would metastasize into direct threats to America in the Western  Hemisphere; ensure that American-made goods both catalyze economic  growth at home and help reduce long-term aid dependence in Africa; and  eliminate slave labor in our battery supply chains starting with  minerals stripped from Africa on the backs of Black children.   In a world where America is no longer the only choice, we must return  to being the most desirable choice. It is in our vital national  interest to ensure that when nations like South Africa have a choice  between China or the United States of America, they will always choose  America first.                            ____________________
