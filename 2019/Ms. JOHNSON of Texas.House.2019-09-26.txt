 Mr. Speaker, this summer, we witnessed a record  number of Americans take the opportunity to travel. Unfortunately, this  also meant a record number of travelers were subjected to hidden fees  charged by hotels, motels, and other places of accommodation.   It is projected that, in 2019 alone, over $3 billion in revenue will  be collected from consumers due to these deceptive hidden fees.   That is why I, along with my colleague Mr. Fortenberry from Nebraska,  have introduced H.R. 4489, the Hotel Advertising Transparency Act. This  bill would require the prices regularly advertised by hotels and online  travel agencies to include all mandatory fees that will be charged to a  consumer, excluding taxes.   Mr. Speaker, consumers deserve full transparency when making their  travel plans. They should be able to enjoy their vacations without  being ripped off and financially burdened with almost twice as much as  the room that had been advertised.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 2528) to direct the Director of the Office of  Science and Technology Policy to carry out programs and activities to  ensure that Federal science agencies and institutions of higher  education receiving Federal research and development funding are fully  engaging their entire talent pool, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2528         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS; FINDINGS.         (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``STEM       Opportunities Act of 2019''.

(c) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:        (1) Many reports over the past decade have found that it is       critical to our Nation's economic leadership and global       competitiveness that the United States educates and trains       more scientists and engineers.        (2) Research shows that women and minorities who are       interested in STEM careers are disproportionately lost at       nearly every educational transition and at every career       milestone.        (3) The National Center for Science and Engineering       Statistics at the National Science Foundation collects,       compiles, analyzes, and publishes data on the demographics of       STEM degrees and STEM jobs in the United States.        (4) Women now earn nearly 37 percent of all STEM bachelor's       degrees, but major variations persist among fields. In 2017,       women earned only 20 percent of all bachelor's degrees       awarded in engineering and 19 percent of bachelor's degrees       awarded in computer sciences. Based on Bureau of Labor       Statistics data, jobs in computing occupations are expected       to account for nearly 60 percent of the projected annual       growth of newly created STEM job openings from 2016 to 2026.        (5) In 2017, underrepresented minority groups comprised 39       percent of the college-age population of the United States,       but only 18 percent of students who earned bachelor's degrees       in STEM fields. The Higher Education Research Institute at       the University of California, Los Angeles, found that, while       freshmen from underrepresented minority groups express an       interest in pursuing a STEM undergraduate degree at the same       rate as all other freshmen, only 22.1 percent of Latino       students, 18.4 percent of African-American students, and 18.8       percent of Native American students studying in STEM fields       complete their degree within 5 years, compared to       approximately 33 percent of White students and 42 percent of       Asian students who complete their degree within 5 years.        (6) In some STEM fields, including the computer sciences,       women persist at about the same rate through doctorate       degrees. In other STEM fields, women persist through       doctorate degrees at a lower rate. In mathematics, women earn       just 26 percent of doctorate degrees compared with 42 percent       of undergraduate degrees. Overall, women earned 38 percent of       STEM doctorate degrees in 2016. The rate of minority students       earning STEM doctorate degrees in physics is 9 percent,       compared with 15 percent for bachelor's degree. Students from       underrepresented minority groups accounted for only 11.5       percent of STEM doctorate degrees awarded in 2016.        (7) The representation of women in STEM drops significantly       from the doctorate degree level to the faculty level.       Overall, women hold only 26 percent of all tenured and       tenure-track positions and 27 percent of full professor       positions in STEM fields in our Nation's universities and 4-      year colleges. Black and Hispanic faculty together hold about       6.8 percent of all tenured and tenure-track positions and 7.5       percent of full professor positions. Many of the numbers in       the American Indian or Alaskan Native and Native Hawaiian or       Other Pacific Islander categories for different faculty ranks       were too small for the National Science Foundation to report       publicly without potentially compromising confidential       information about the individuals being surveyed.        (8) The representation of women is especially low at our       Nation's top research universities. Even in the biological       sciences, in which women now earn more than 50 percent of the       doctorates and passed the 25 percent level 37 years ago,       women make up only 25 percent of the full professors at the       approximately 100 most research-intensive universities in the       United States. In the physical sciences and mathematics,       women make up only 11 percent of full professors, in computer       sciences only 10 percent, and across engineering fields only       7 percent. The data suggest that approximately 6 percent of       all tenure-track STEM faculty members at the most research-      intensive universities are from underrepresented minority       groups, but in some fields the numbers are too small to       report publicly.        (9) By 2050, underrepresented minorities will comprise 52       percent of the college-age population of the United States.       If the percentage of female students and students from       underrepresented minority groups earning bachelor's degrees       in STEM fields does not significantly increase, the United       States will face an acute shortfall in the overall number of       students who earn degrees in STEM fields just as United       States companies are increasingly seeking students with those       skills. With this impending shortfall, the United States will       almost certainly lose its competitive edge in the 21st       century global economy.        (10) According to a 2014 Association for Women in Science       survey of over 4,000 scientists across the globe, 70 percent       of whom were men, STEM researchers face significant       challenges in work-life integration. Researchers in the       United States were among the most likely to experience a       conflict between work and their personal life at least       weekly. One-third of researchers surveyed said that ensuring       good work-life integration has negatively impacted their       careers, and, of researchers intending to leave their current       job within the next year, 9 percent indicated it was because       they were unable to balance work and life demands.        (11) Female students and students from underrepresented       minority groups at institutions of higher education who see       few others ``like themselves'' among faculty and student       populations often do not experience the social integration       that is necessary for success in all disciplines, including       STEM.        (12) One in five children in the United States attend       school in a rural community. The data shows that rural       students are at a disadvantage with respect to STEM       readiness. Among STEM-interested students, 17 percent of       students in rural high schools and 18 percent of students in       town-located high schools meet the ACT STEM Benchmark,       compared with 33 percent of students in suburban high schools       and 27 percent of students in urban high schools.        (13) A substantial body of evidence establishes that most       people hold implicit biases. Decades of cognitive psychology       research reveal that most people carry prejudices of which       they are unaware but that nonetheless play a large role in       evaluations of people and their work. Unintentional biases       and outmoded institutional structures are hindering the       access and advancement of women, minorities, and other groups       historically underrepresented in STEM.        (14) Workshops held to educate faculty about unintentional       biases have demonstrated success in raising awareness of such       biases.        (15) In 2012, the Office of Diversity and Equal Opportunity       of the National Aeronautics and  [[Page H8006]]       Space Administration (in this Act referred to as ``NASA'')       completed a report that--        (A) is specifically designed to help NASA grant recipients       identify why the dearth of women in STEM fields continues and       to ensure that it is not due to discrimination; and        (B) provides guidance that is usable by all institutions of       higher education receiving significant Federal research       funding on how to conduct meaningful self-evaluations of       campus culture and policies.        (16) The Federal Government provides 55 percent of research       funding at institutions of higher education and, through its       grant-making policies, has had significant influence on       institution of higher education policies, including policies       related to institutional culture and structure.       SEC. 2. PURPOSES.         The purposes of this Act are as follows:        (1) To ensure that Federal science agencies and       institutions of higher education receiving Federal research       and development funding are fully engaging the entire talent       pool of the United States.        (2) To promote research on, and increase understanding of,       the participation and trajectories of women, minorities, and       other groups historically underrepresented in STEM studies       and careers, including persons with disabilities, older       learners, veterans, and rural, poor, and tribal populations,       at institutions of higher education and Federal science       agencies, including Federal laboratories.        (3) To raise awareness within Federal science agencies,       including Federal laboratories, and institutions of higher       education about cultural and institutional barriers limiting       the recruitment, retention, promotion, and other indicators       of participation and achievement of women, minorities, and       other groups historically underrepresented in academic and       Government STEM research careers at all levels.        (4) To identify, disseminate, and implement best practices       at Federal science agencies, including Federal laboratories,       and at institutions of higher education to remove or reduce       cultural and institutional barriers limiting the recruitment,       retention, and success of women, minorities, and other groups       historically underrepresented in academic and Government STEM       research careers.        (5) To provide grants to institutions of higher education       to recruit, retain, and advance STEM faculty members from       underrepresented minority groups and to implement or expand       reforms in undergraduate STEM education in order to increase       the number of students from underrepresented minority groups       receiving degrees in these fields.

SEC. 7. CULTURAL AND INSTITUTIONAL BARRIERS TO EXPANDING THE                     ACADEMIC AND FEDERAL STEM WORKFORCE.         (a) Best Practices at Institutions of Higher Education and       Federal Laboratories.--        (1) Development of guidance.--Not later than 12 months       after the date of enactment of this Act, the Director, in       consultation with the interagency working group on inclusion       in STEM, shall develop written guidance for institutions of       higher education and Federal laboratories on the best       practices for--        (A) conducting periodic climate surveys of STEM departments       and divisions, with a particular focus on identifying any       cultural or institutional barriers to the recruitment,       retention, or advancement of women, racial and ethnic       minorities, and other groups historically underrepresented in       STEM studies and careers; and        (B) providing educational opportunities, including       workshops as described in subsection  [[Page H8007]]       (b), for STEM faculty, research personnel, and administrators       to learn about current research on implicit bias in       recruitment, evaluation, and promotion of undergraduate and       graduate students and research personnel.        (2) Existing guidance.--In developing the guidance under       paragraph (1), the Director shall utilize guidance already       developed by Federal science agencies.        (3) Dissemination of guidance.--Federal science agencies       shall broadly disseminate the guidance developed under       paragraph (1) to institutions of higher education that       receive Federal research funding and Federal laboratories.        (4) Establishment of policies.--Consistent with the       guidance developed under paragraph (1)--        (A) the Director of the National Science Foundation shall       develop a policy that--        (i) applies to, at a minimum, doctoral degree granting       institutions that receive Federal research funding; and        (ii) requires each such institution, not later than 3 years       after the date of enactment of this Act, to report to the       Director of the National Science Foundation on activities and       policies developed and implemented based on the guidance       developed under paragraph (1); and        (B) each Federal science agency with a Federal laboratory       shall maintain or develop and implement practices and       policies for the purposes described in paragraph (1) for such       laboratory.        (b) Workshops To Address Cultural Barriers to Expanding the       Academic and Federal STEM Workforce.--        (1) In general.--Not later than 6 months after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Director, in consultation with the       interagency working group on inclusion in STEM, shall       recommend a uniform policy for Federal science agencies to       carry out a program of workshops that educate STEM department       chairs at institutions of higher education, senior managers       at Federal laboratories, and other federally funded       researchers about methods that minimize the effects of       implicit bias in the career advancement, including hiring,       tenure, promotion, and selection for any honor based in part       on the recipient's research record, of academic and Federal       STEM researchers.        (2) Interagency coordination.--The Director shall, to the       extent practicable, ensure that workshops supported under       this subsection are coordinated across Federal science       agencies and jointly supported as appropriate.        (3) Minimizing costs.--To the extent practicable, workshops       shall be held in conjunction with national or regional STEM       disciplinary meetings to minimize costs associated with       participant travel.        (4) Priority fields for academic participants.--In       considering the participation of STEM department chairs and       other academic researchers, the Director shall prioritize       workshops for the broad fields of STEM in which the national       rate of representation of women among tenured or tenure-track       faculty or nonfaculty researchers at doctorate-granting       institutions of higher education is less than 25 percent,       according to the most recent data available from the National       Center for Science and Engineering Statistics.        (5) Organizations eligible to carry out workshops.--A       Federal science agency may carry out the program of workshops       under this subsection by making grants to organizations made       eligible by the Federal science agency and any of the       following organizations:        (A) Nonprofit scientific and professional societies and       organizations that represent one or more STEM disciplines.        (B) Nonprofit organizations that have the primary mission       of advancing the participation of women, minorities, or other       groups historically underrepresented in STEM.        (6) Characteristics of workshops.--The workshops shall have       the following characteristics:        (A) Invitees to workshops shall include at least--        (i) the chairs of departments in the relevant STEM       discipline or disciplines from doctoral degree granting       institutions that receive Federal research funding; and        (ii) in the case of Federal laboratories, individuals with       personnel management responsibilities comparable to those of       an institution of higher education department chair.        (B) Activities at the workshops shall include research       presentations and interactive discussions or other activities       that increase the awareness of the existence of implicit bias       in recruitment, hiring, tenure review, promotion, and other       forms of formal recognition of individual achievement for       faculty and other federally funded STEM researchers and shall       provide strategies to overcome such bias.        (C) Research presentations and other workshop programs, as       appropriate, shall include a discussion of the unique       challenges faced by different underrepresented groups,       including minority women, minority men, persons from rural       and underserved areas, persons with disabilities, gender and       sexual minority individuals, and first generation graduates       in research.        (D) Workshop programs shall include information on best       practices for mentoring undergraduate, graduate, and       postdoctoral women, minorities, and other students from       groups historically underrepresented in STEM.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and to include extraneous materials.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in support of H.R. 2528, the STEM Opportunities Act of  2019. I thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas), the ranking  member, for joining me in introducing this bill. I also thank the  committee cosponsors on both sides of the aisle and the endorsing  organizations.   Mr. Speaker, this bill has been a long time coming. Over a decade  ago, in 2007, I introduced an early version of this legislation in  response to the National Academies' report titled ``Beyond Bias and  Barriers.''   This report was a call to action to address the biases and outdated  institutional structures in universities that perpetuate the  underrepresentation of women in many STEM fields. The report made clear  that it is not a lack of talent but external factors, like limited  access to support and campus resources, pay disparity, bias, and  discrimination, that have hindered the advancement of women in academic  STEM careers. The National Academies is conducting a follow-up study  under the leadership of former NASA astronaut Dr. Mae Jemison.   While progress has been made, the fact remains that women are  woefully underrepresented at all levels of STEM studies and in STEM  careers. We need action, and we need bold leadership.   Women already comprise 50 percent of the population. By the year  2050, racial and ethnic minorities will also comprise 50 percent of our  Nation's population. Many of these groups are woefully underrepresented  in STEM fields. Our Nation will not continue to lead in science and  innovation if we do not tap into all the talent this Nation has to  offer.   While there are unique challenges for different groups  underrepresented in STEM, there are also many common themes and many  common solutions.   Eventually, I combined my legislation focused on the advancement of  women in STEM with another piece of legislation focused on  underrepresented minorities in STEM. That combined legislation became  the STEM Opportunities Act.   The STEM Opportunities Act addresses both the uniqueness and  similarities, the challenges and solutions. Over the years, I have  updated this legislation to incorporate new expert recommendations and  stakeholder feedback to reflect emerging needs.   The STEM Opportunities Act of 2019 provides for research and  demographic data collection to better understand the participation and  career trajectories of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM  research careers.   The bill directs the Office of Science and Technology Policy to  develop consistent policies at Federal science agencies to minimize the  effects of implicit bias in the grant review process, to help  universities identify and address barriers for women and  underrepresented minorities in STEM research careers, and to  accommodate the needs of grant recipients who have caregiving  responsibilities.   The bill also directs the National Science Foundation to award grants  to support computer science education at the Nation's Tribal colleges  and universities.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to close and simply request  that all Members support this bill. It is a bill that we need for the  Nation and for our Nation's future in innovation, in order to maintain  any activity on the world stage in innovation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 335) to require the Inter-Agency Task Force on  Harmful Algal Blooms and Hypoxia to develop a plan for reducing,  mitigating, and controlling harmful algal blooms and hypoxia in South  Florida, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 335         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 335, the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 335, the South Florida  Clean Coastal Waters Act of 2019.   I want to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Mast) for introducing  this bill and for his commitment to this important issue.   South Florida has been suffering from economically and ecologically  costly blooms of harmful algae in both its marine and freshwater  systems for years, and it continues to get worse. Last year, south  Florida was plagued with one of the most severe harmful algal bloom, or  HABs, events on record.   Simultaneous toxic red tide and massive freshwater blue-green algae  blooms choked waterways and coastlines. This caused a mass mortality of  wildlife, including, dolphins, manatees, and sea turtles. Hundreds of  tons of dead fish washed up on the shores.   Beyond the millions of dollars of lost revenue for businesses, red  tide and other HABs also pose health risks to humans from direct  exposure and from eating infected seafood.   Low oxygen, known as hypoxia, can result when the algae die, sink to  the bottom of the water bodies, and decay. It is a problem in the Gulf  of Mexico ``dead zone'' and is a growing problem along coastlines where  HABs persist.   The South Florida Clean Coastal Waters Act authorizes a scientific  assessment and action plan to help address the problem of HABs and  hypoxia in south Florida.   The assessment and action plan will be conducted by the interagency  Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research and Control Task Force, led by  NOAA and the EPA. This task force researches, monitors, addresses, and  mitigates HABs and hypoxia.   The assessment and action plan will help identify research gaps and  detailed methods for mitigating and controlling HABs and hypoxia in  south Florida. These documents will help serve as a blueprint for  Federal, State, and local decisionmakers and other stakeholders to  coordinate actions to reduce the HABs and hypoxia in the region.   Mr. Speaker, this bill takes an important step in helping address the  HABs and hypoxia issue in south Florida. I strongly support this good,  bipartisan bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   I simply urge the passage of H.R. 335, and I thank all the staff, as  well, for the bipartisan support of this bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.
