 Mr. Speaker, I couldn't be prouder of this House for  passing the American Rescue Plan, an aggressive response to the  pandemic, to pull us out of the doldrums in this country.   As a result, millions and millions of Americans are back in jobs;  millions and millions of American kids are back in schools; and so many  people are vaccinated. We are back on the road to recovery.   But we can't stop there. We have infrastructure to address. I have  been waiting for close to 10 years for us to pass an aggressive  infrastructure program. We have 7,500 miles of substandard roads in  Pennsylvania alone to fix.   China is investing in itself: its roads, its bridges, its rail  systems, its transit systems. What would make us think we don't have to  compete with China? What would make us think that our companies don't  need every advantage to compete on the world stage?   Let's get infrastructure done, and let's do it boldly and  aggressively to build up and invest in our own country.                            ____________________
