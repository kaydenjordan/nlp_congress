 The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Georgia (Mr. Isakson), the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. Kennedy),  the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran), the Senator from Alaska (Ms.  Murkowski), and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Toomey).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Moran) I  would have voted ``yea.''    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the Dakota  Alliance Soccer Club's 14U Girls soccer team.   On July 14, 2019, the Dakota Alliance Soccer Club, DASC, 14U Girls  won the U.S. Youth Soccer, USYS--National Presidents Cup in  Murfreesboro, TN. Their 1-0 overtime win over Century V East 05 from  Pennsylvania-West secured South Dakota's first ever USYS national  championship at any level or age group.   The DASC 14U Girls went undefeated during the 2019 National  Presidents Cup, with wins over teams from Pennsylvania, Texas, and  California. Impressively, the team did not surrender a single goal  throughout the tournament, while tallying 13 goals in just four games.   For their outstanding play throughout the tournament, DASC players  Tessa Van Overbeke, Elsie Odney, Mia Mullenmeister, and Hailee  Christensen were given Best 11 honors. Additionally, Cambell Fisher  received the Golden Glove award as outstanding goalkeeper, and  midfielder Hailee Christensen received the Golden Boot as the  competition's top goal scorer.   The DASC 14U Girls earned their spot at the National Presidents Cup  by winning the Midwest Presidents Cup, attaining wins over teams from  Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, and Wisconsin. In May, they won the South  Dakota Youth Soccer State Cup, with a pair of wins over the Black Hills  Rapids Soccer Club.   While a perfect postseason record of 11-0 is certainly notable, it is  also important to highlight this team's entire 42-member roster. As a  group, these ladies spent considerable hours together for practice  sessions, community service projects, and competitive tournaments  throughout their successful 2018-2019 season.   DASC 14U Girls Championship Team: Hailee Christensen, Chloe  Dondlinger, Addison Fawcett, Cambell Fischer, Torre Gulseth, Cassidy  Jennings, Ashlyn Kelliher, Mia Mullenmeister, Elsie Odney, Ella Ready,  Taite Scheafer, Anni Sjovold.
