 Mr. Speaker, our country faces a public health and  economic challenge unlike any we have experienced in 100 years. We must  protect the health of the American people while also ensuring our  economy is able to bounce back as the coronavirus subsides.   I urge at every opportunity that Congress assist Americans with  income support while also providing a critical lifeline to businesses,  especially small businesses. The CARES Act achieves those objectives  through direct checks to American households, improved unemployment  compensation, and federally backed loans to businesses.   This bill is certainly not perfect. Rarely do we see perfect in this  Chamber, and certainly not in these circumstances. However, we cannot  delay; we cannot waiver. We must ensure this aid is delivered to the  American people as soon as possible.   The American people are looking to us to lead at this moment, and we  must do so now, so I rise to support the CARES Act. I urge my  colleagues to do the same and move this to the President's desk.
