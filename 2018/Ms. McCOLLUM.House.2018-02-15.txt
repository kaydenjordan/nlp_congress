 Mr. Speaker, as Americans, we have a responsibility to  protect our environment and our public lands for today and for  tomorrow, and that is why we, Congress, passed clean air and clean  water laws. That is why we protected our public lands and treasured  spaces.   President Trump has a different set of priorities. With his dirty  budget and his infrastructure scam, President Trump is attacking basic  environmental safeguards. The Trump budget cuts environmental  protections and makes it impossible for the EPA to keep American  families safe and healthy.   The Trump budget stops essential research on climate change, slashes  clean energy development, and threatens endangered species. The Trump  infrastructure scam repeals basic environmental safeguards and sells  off our public lands to Big Oil. Once again, President Trump is putting  polluters and their profits first at the expense of America's families  being healthy.   Our air, water, and our land should never be partisan issues.  Congress must reject this dirty budget and infrastructure scam and work  to protect our environment and not destroy it.                            ____________________
