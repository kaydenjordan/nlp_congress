Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 629, providing for consideration of  H.R. 1815, the SEC Disclosure Effectiveness Testing Act. The rule  provides for consideration of the legislation under a structured rule.  It provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the  chair and ranking member on the Committee on Financial Services. It  self-executes a manager's amendment that makes technical changes. It  also makes in order four amendments, two Democratic and two Republican.  [[Page H8155]]    The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 3624, the  Outsourcing Accountability Act, under a structured rule. It provides 1  hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  member on the Committee on Financial Services. Finally, it makes in  order two Republican amendments to H.R. 3624.   Mr. Speaker, the bills before us this week are consumer protection  bills. Together, these bills make an effort to give everyday Americans  access to clear, digestible information that will help them make  informed investment decisions.   Mr. Speaker, inequality in this country is at a historic level. The  experience right now is on par with the Great Depression and the gilded  age. Without adjustments like the ones proposed in these bills, it can  only get worse.   The most visible indicator of wealth inequality in America today may  be the Forbes magazine list of the Nation's 400 richest Americans. In  2018, the three men at the top of this list--Amazon founder Jeff Bezos,  Microsoft founder Bill Gates, and investor Warren Buffett--held  combined fortunes worth more than the total wealth of the poorest half  of Americans. Three men had more wealth than 160 million Americans.                                time  1245    In 1989, the bottom 90 percent of the U.S. population held 33 percent  of all wealth. By 2016, the bottom 90 percent of the population held  only 23 percent of wealth. The wealth share of the top 1 percent  increased from about 30 percent to approximately 40 percent over the  same period of time. The tax bill just passed by the House last session  doubles down on this troubling trend.   In 2019, a person in the bottom 10 percent gets a $50 tax cut, and a  person in the top 1 percent gets a $34,000 tax cut. At the same time,  millions of poor and middle-class people are expected to see their  taxes either stay the same or actually increase in the long run.   Before us today, the Outsourcing Accountability Act makes one simple  but meaningful change to existing reporting requirements. It would add  a requirement for publicly traded companies to annually report foreign  and domestic employment statistics to the SEC: Are your employees  working in the United States or are they working overseas?   By publicly reporting this data that already is collected, companies  are providing important information to their investors, consumers, and  American workers, with no additional burden on their business.   As Heather Slavkin Corzo of the AFL-CIO said recently: ``What gets  measured gets paid attention to by a company''--and, I would add, their  investors.   As a former union member and a current member of the House Committee  on Education and Labor, I think we in Congress should do everything we  can to incentivize companies to invest in American workers and not to  offshore their work.   This administration has done everything in its power, in my view, to  give corporations even more power at the expense of their employees-- and these effects are being felt in households across this country.   Mr. Speaker, the other bill before us is the SEC Disclosure  Effectiveness Testing Act. All we are asking for in this bill is to  make sure that the data we are collecting for consumers is easy to  understand so it can be used in the way it was intended.   Field testing allows average investors to pilot a form that the SEC  is planning to use and be a focus group on whether it is user friendly  and the results are understandable.   A recent form that was field-tested revealed that everyday Americans  were ``deeply confused'' about the information the form was supposed to  be communicating. In this specific instance, we are talking about how a  company discloses any conflicts of interest it may have in providing  investment advice.   Close to 7 million people in my home State of California and 55  million people nationwide, most of them low and middle income, don't  have access to retirement benefits at work. We are talking about people  who work for small businesses, whose companies just cannot afford the  expense of financial products on the market.   In stark contrast, the financial sector takes around 25 percent of  all corporate profits in the United States, represents 7 percent of the  U.S. economy, and creates a mere 4 percent of jobs.   Mr. Speaker, this bill makes it easier for people who are trying to  build a secure retirement for themselves and their families to  understand the investment advice they are receiving and whether it is  in their best interest. We have an obligation to our workers who  sacrifice and provide so much for our country to give them something in  return.   These two bills, taken together, help put consumers in the driver's  seat. One requires information already collected by companies to be  shared, and the other makes sure that consumers understand the  information they are being given.   The only people who should be opposed to these bills are big  businesses who may be afraid of what the public will learn about their  practices.   The goal should be to give every American worker a secure retirement  and protect consumers. Why wouldn't we want to take every step to get  there?   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume to make a comment to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall),  my friend, as we do this.   I, first of all, express my respect and affection for him in the  short time I have gotten to serve with him, and I agree with almost  everything he said in his statement, with a possible exception of his  prediction on the next election.   But other than that, I, too, yearn to be part of this institution,  this marvelous institution that solves problems as a premium, where you  take a liberal perspective and a conservative perspective, where both  respect one another and understand that, by listening to both, we  actually get a product that is more reflective of the whole.   Having been someone who served at the city level, the county level-- county commissioner--at the State level, and now in Congress, it is  discouraging to be here and not be as engaged as I hoped to in problem- solving and respecting differences of opinion.    So we will get through this. The Speaker likes to quote Lincoln: With  public sentiment, anything is possible; without it, nothing is  possible.   I believe he continued on to say: No statute has real force.   So that is good for us to remember, that we have to go back to our  townhalls, as we all do, and sometimes some of the most difficult parts  of those townhalls is telling friends that you disagree with them, that  there is another side of the story.   So, with that, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall), my  good friend, for his reflections and his hopes for this institution,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend as well. It is always a  pleasure to hear the gentleman's words of wisdom.   I am reminded of a story that you will hear if the docent has the  time at Monticello, when somebody asked Jefferson when he first opened:  Mr. Jefferson, why do you have a bust of Mr. Hamilton opposite you? You  don't agree on anything with Hamilton.   Jefferson said: That is the point. That is why it is there.   So, I appreciate the comments. I look forward to further  conversations up in that room.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to thank my colleagues-- Congresswoman Axne, Congressman Casten, and Chairwoman Waters--for  their leadership on these commonsense bills to protect American  consumers and workers, and I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the  previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Woodall is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 629         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 3. Upon adoption of this resolution, the Committees on       the Judiciary, Ways and Means, Financial Services, Oversight       and Reform, and Foreign Affairs and the Permanent Select       Committee on Intelligence shall suspend pursuing matters       referred to by the Speaker in her announcement of September       24, 2019, until such time as bipartisan legislation to lower       prescription drug prices and limit patients' out of pocket       costs is signed into law.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
