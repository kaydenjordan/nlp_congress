 Madam Speaker, I rise today for Hadiya  Pendleton, taken by gun violence on January 23, 2013. She was 15.   I rise for Terrell Bosley, taken by gun violence on April 4, 2006. He  was 18 and unloading musical instruments from a car.   I rise for Blair Holt, taken by gun violence on May 7, 2007. He was  16 and died shielding others from bullets.   Today I rise for Gregory Shondale, killed yesterday. He was 41.   Madam Speaker, I rise for them and for all those taken from us by  senseless gun violence that continues unchecked in our Nation because  of inaction on the part of the Senate Majority Leader and the  President.   I rise today more than 100 days after this House, the people's House,  sent bipartisan universal background check legislation, H.R. 8, to the  Senate, which has failed to consider any legislation for more than 8  weeks.   I rise today for the 100 Americans who will lose their lives to gun  violence today and Americans who will be shot, survive, and face a  lifetime of recovery. That will be 210 Americans.   I rise because someone must--someone must--stand up to speak for  those who have had their voices silenced by gun violence. Someone must  speak for the mom of five who suffered domestic violence, found the  courage to leave her abusive relationship, and ended up dead because  her abuser had easy access to a gun.   Someone must speak up for the little girl playing in the park who was  gunned down because guns are more common than schools in her  neighborhood.   Someone must speak for the veteran and the farmer who face what seem  like insurmountable odds with no way out, who tragically end their own  life.   Someone must speak for those killed at Pulse and at supermarkets  because of who they are and whom they love.   Someone must speak for the person, often a young Black man, who will  be gunned down by a cop who shot first and asked questions later.   Someone must speak for the first responders who are taking their own  [[Page H4926]]  lives at alarming rates. Someone must speak for them.   Someone must tell the story of everyday gun violence that plagues our  communities from Chicago to Key West.   Too often, this House focuses on the mass shooting tragedies in this  Nation that have become more and more common since our Republican  colleagues allowed the assault weapons ban to expire in 2004. We hold  moments of silence. My colleagues run to their tweets with their  thoughts and prayers to justify their continued and negligent inaction.  But we forget gun violence happens every day in every community.   We cannot forget about those who died alone from gun violence in city  parks, in road rage incidents, and in their own homes, entrapped by  depression and despair. They, too, deserve to be remembered. Their  lives and stories should also challenge us to actions so we can say  ``not one more'' and then actually do something to prevent another  death, another funeral, and another life forever altered.   Madam Speaker, I am proud that this House finally acted. After the  American people sent a historic wave of new Members to Congress,  Members who understand that commonsense gun safety reform saves lives,  we voted to enact bipartisan universal background check legislation  that is supported by more than 90 percent of Americans and 70 percent  of NRA members.   We also voted to close the Charleston loophole, a clear gap in our  laws that allowed a known white supremacist to legally purchase a  weapon and use it to steal the lives of nine people seeking to better  know their God.   We know this is a problem. We passed legislation to close this  loophole, and yet the Senate, controlled by Republicans, have still  done nothing. My good colleagues in the Senate continue to do nothing  while people die every day in every State and in every community. Still  they do nothing. They refuse to act. Still they offer hollow thoughts  and prayers while rushing to the bank with pockets full of NRA  donations.                                time  0945    Perhaps that is the problem, Madam Speaker. Perhaps it is the money.   The American people should know that the President got $30 million  from the NRA in his 2016 campaign. What are they buying?   The American people deserve to know that the Senate majority leader  has taken more than $1 million from the NRA over his career. What were  they investing in?   The American people deserve to know that too many in the GOP are  bought and sold by the NRA or too often afraid of them to grow a spine  and stand up for their constituents.   It is a sad fact that just 8--that is right, just 8--of 198 Members,  or a mere 4 percent of the House Republican Conference, had the courage  to stand with gun violence victims and 90 percent of Americans. I thank  those courageous eight Republicans for voting to save lives.   Madam Speaker, to my colleagues still too afraid or too owned by the  NRA to act, I say good luck next year. They had their chance, and they  failed miserably. They are on the wrong side of history.   Next year, the American people will not forget.                            ____________________
