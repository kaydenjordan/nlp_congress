 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of my  bipartisan bill, H.R. 6168, the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living  Adjustment Act of 2020.   During these trying times, I continue to keep our Nation's veterans  at the top of my mind as they face unprecedented challenges due to the  coronavirus pandemic. This bill will provide the economic relief and  pay raise that our veterans have earned.   It is an honor to represent more than 102,000 veterans, the highest  total of any district in Virginia, and one of the highest in the  country. Our veterans put their lives on the line and deployed far from  home to keep America safe. As a 20-year Navy veteran myself, I am proud  to bring a bill to the floor that protects the benefits our veterans  have earned from their service to our country.   H.R. 6168 provides cost-of-living increases for wartime disability  compensation, compensation for dependents, clothing allowance,  dependency and indemnities compensation for spouses, and dependency and  indemnity compensation for surviving children.   Congress must honor our commitment to those American heroes who  served in harm's way so that we could live in peace at home. As we  continue to fight this pandemic, I ask that we all keep in mind those  who have kept us safe at home and abroad.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6168, and join me  and Ranking Member   Mike Bost in protecting the earned benefits for  our Nation's veterans.
