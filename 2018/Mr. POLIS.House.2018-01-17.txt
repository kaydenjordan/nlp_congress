 Mr. Speaker, the situation that so many DREAMers--aspired  Americans who know no other country--face is becoming more and more  urgent in the face of President Trump's cancellation of their legal  status in March.   I want to point out that over 100 are losing status every day and  losing their permission to be able to go to work--their legal status-- in our country. If we fail to act, one million aspired Americans will  be unable to work legally and live legally in the only country they  know, instantly creating over one million more people who are here  illegally--the opposite of what President Trump ran on and the opposite  of what the American people want.   I know that we can pass a solution through this body. I have heard so  many Republicans and Democrats talk passionately about providing  permanent status for the DREAMers. Let's pass the Dream Act, any of  these bills.  [[Page H423]]    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to cosponsor a new one yesterday that will  finally provide some certainty for young people who want to do nothing  more than work hard, play by the rules, and contribute to make our  country, the only country they know, the United States of America, even  greater.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, once again, Congress finds itself rushing to try to pass  legislation to keep the government open; ensure that our youngest, most  vulnerable Americans have access to health insurance; and protect  young, aspiring Americans from being deported from the only country  they have known as home. Yet here we are debating other things with the  clock running out in the eleventh hour--issues that, no doubt, have a  few people here and there who care about them, but zero people have  called my office on, Mr. Speaker.   My constituents are demanding that we address access to the childhood  healthcare insurance program and demanding that we act on the DREAMers  with the deadline approaching and 100-plus DREAMers every day losing  their status.   It sounds like, from all we are hearing, that the House is going to  consider yet another short-term spending bill to maybe keep the  government running for another 4 weeks or 6 weeks. It is actually the  fourth short-term spending bill for this year, not allowing the  Department of Defense to plan to keep our country safe and not allowing  any of the departments across the Federal Government to make any of the  investments they need or have any degree of certainty that contractors  will be paid.   It is no way to govern, Mr. Speaker. Part of the reason that we are  left doing this is we are using our precious floor time on all of these  other issues like the ones before us today.   It is not that these issues don't deserve their day in the sun, and  we will talk about them for the rest of the day today, apparently, but  we are facing the closure of the entire Federal Government in 3 days if  we don't act. We are doing the equivalent of fiddling while Rome burns.  This is an absurd exercise in doing some narrowly tailored special  interest bills rather than addressing what we all know to be the 1,000- pound gorillas in the room.   Seniors, military veterans, and people with disabilities shouldn't  have to question whether they will actually receive their benefits  month to month because we don't know whether the government will remain  open. In the meanwhile, Republicans, Democrats, and the White House are  all trying to put forward bipartisan solutions for the hundreds of  thousands of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients and  DREAMers, and we could be debating that on the floor and putting  together the final package now to do that by this Friday. But instead,  we are discussing these bills that my constituents aren't telling me  that they are sending me to Washington to pass.   A lot of my colleagues say that the deadline for DACA isn't until  March, but, in reality, over 100 deferred action DREAMers every day  lose their protected status as their benefits expire. Every day the  Republicans fail to act, they are creating over 100 more illegal  immigrants in this country. If Republicans fail to act by March, they  will have created over 800,000 more people here illegally in our  country.   We have about 18,000 DREAMers in Colorado able to work legally today.  They have come from countries near and far in search of a better life  for themselves and their families. They grew up in our schools, sports  teams, cheerleaders, don't know any other country, and many of them  don't speak any other language.   One DREAMer that I have gotten to know from Colorado is Anarely,  whose family stayed in Colorado to help take care of their grandmother.  Anarely is a triple major at Colorado State University, studying  political science, ethnic studies, and international relations. She has  built a life in Colorado--the only life she knows--and continues to  build a bright future in the U.S. if we can give her the certainty with  regard to her legal ability to work and, of course, take her place  alongside other American citizens.   What makes America so great is we are a country of immigrants made up  of people from all backgrounds, all quarters of the world. We embrace  people from different cultures and different countries. We value the  contributions based on the individual and the values of individual  responsibility and hard work. That is what makes our country and our  communities vibrant and our economy successful.   Mr. Speaker, a group of bipartisan House and Senate Members are  working together to find a solution to protect DREAMers and improve  border security. I am proud to cosponsor the USA Act, which we dropped  yesterday with Mr. Hurd and Mr. Aguilar which would provide DREAMers  long-term protections and improve our border security to prevent this  kind of situation from happening again.   But instead of legislation that addresses long-term funding or  protects aspiring Americans, here we are bringing bills to talk around  the fringes about consumer protections and, of course, a bill that  would chip away at reproductive health rights.   The rule we are debating today considers two pieces of legislation  that are not anything to do with the expiration at the end of this week  of government funding or the over 100 DREAMers who lose their status  every day--the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and the World Bank  Accountability Act.   The Home Mortgage Disclosure Act has long been a tool to monitor the  mortgage lending practices and patterns of financial institutions to  ensure equal and fair access to credit. The information that lenders  are required to report shows that they are meeting the housing  financing needs of their communities. HMDA data is very important in  fair lending assessments and helps make determinations of where to  target community development resources.   Congress has made changes to HMDA as a response to legitimate  concerns about the role that widespread predatory lending played in the  financial  [[Page H425]]  crisis. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was charged with  updating how lenders report HMDA.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau adopted a standard for the  new reporting requirements that took into account the burdens imposed  on banks by new standards to ensure that the data is being reported to  monitor fair lending practices to prevent another systemic meltdown  like we had in 2008 and 2009.   The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau even temporarily raised the  reporting threshold eliminating the need for low-volume banks to report  through 2019, in order to conduct research to determine the right way  to document open-ended loans. We should not codify this threshold,  removing the flexibility of the agency that we in Congress set up to  prevent another financial meltdown. It would literally tie their hands  and prevent them from acting, even if there was a need to, to prevent a  financial meltdown.   I strongly support regulatory relief for community banks and small  financial institutions. This bill would actually exempt 85 percent of  depository financial institutions and 48 percent of nondepository  lenders.   Congress should want to encourage increased access to housing finance  and combat unlawful practices that can prey on vulnerable home buyers  or lead to systemic risk which leads to people coming to this town  demanding another Republican taxpayer bailout.   This rule also considers debate for H.R. 3326, the World Bank  Accountability Act--another issue that does not relate to the  expiration of government funding at the end of the week, does not  relate to the illegal aliens that the Republicans are creating every  day, and does not relate to the Children's Health Insurance Program  expiring.   What it does is it places a restriction on funding to the World Bank  International Development Association--again, something I am not  hearing from my constituents on, that they are not sending me to  Washington and demanding that I take action on--and try to get them to  reform to improve their management accountability and fight extremism,  which I am sure is fine. It is true that, of course, they probably need  to improve accountability and oversight, and Congress can have this  discussion, but here we are, backs to the wall, the government is about  to close, DREAMers are facing deportation, children are going without  healthcare, and, yes, of course, World Bank accountability, great,  let's discuss it, but can't we do it next week after we get through  this?   In fact, I believe the Republicans are sending us all on vacation  next week. I think most Americans wish they had 10 days off at the end  of January. I don't understand this. It makes no sense. I think  Congress is about to do a last-minute funding bill and then send every  Member of Congress on a 10-day vacation saying: Good job, we dealt with  World Bank accountability. That is what the voters want. Forget about  government shutdowns, forget about Republicans creating more illegal  aliens, forget about Republicans plunging our Nation deeper into debt  with their tax-and-spend policies. That is where we are headed, Mr.  Speaker.                                time  1245    Of course, we should have a debate on the best way to make reforms in  the U.S. and engage the World Bank to encourage those reforms.   Again, fiddling while Rome burns, Mr. Speaker, it is a common theme  over here, and the American people are seeing through it, which is why  the approval rating of this institution is under 15 percent--no shock.   We can be debating World Bank accountability every day for the next  year if you want. That is why people think this body is out of touch.  We are just not addressing or dealing with the issues the American  people sent us here to deal with: skyrocketing debt; over 12 million  people who are here illegally, and yet this Congress fails to take up  comprehensive immigration reform; expiration of the Children's Health  Insurance Program; fixing the Affordable Care Act.   Withholding funds to the IDA has a lot of positives and negatives. We  could influence them to act. Others fear it could punish people in the  developing world. It could hamper their ability to fight famine. It  could force the necessary reforms.   Again, fine, we will have that discussion under this rule for an hour  or two and Congress will debate that. Congress will pass a bill, and we  will see whether the Senate even takes it up. They often don't.   But, again, it is backs to the wall, fiddling while Rome burns, the  eleventh hour, record debt, Republicans creating more illegal  immigrants every day, and here we are debating accountability for  different aid programs.   The 15 percent must be, like, the family members and cousins of the  Republican Members. I don't know anybody who is satisfied with this  Congress, Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, last week, President Trump tweeted: ``The Democrats are  all talk and no action. They are doing nothing to fix DACA.'' That is  deeply insulting to those of us who have worked so hard for years. I  was even here when the Democrats passed the DREAM Act in December of  2010.   This is the 18th time we have attempted to bring up the bipartisan  bill, H.R. 3440. We are about to do it again with my colleague, Mr.  Gomez. The Dream Act makes our position clear. We want immigration  policies that make America safer. We want to make sure that our  aspiring, de facto Americans can take their place alongside of us with  the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.   Unfortunately, President Trump made his position clear, as well. I am  not sure which position; he changes every other day. But at times, he  said he will sign whatever we do. At other times, he said:         My standard is very simple: America first, and Make America       Great Again.    That is an easy one. This bill we bring up if we defeat the previous  question will absolutely make America greater. According to the  conservative think tank CATO, repealing DACA would actually cost the  government over $60 billion, reduce economic growth by $280 billion,  and make us all poorer.   We just want to make America wealthier, make us better, and recognize  the aspiring Americans and let them work hard and play by the rules and  pay taxes and live the American Dream. That is an America first policy  that we can all get behind.   This is the 18th attempt here to do this. But I am a Jewish American,  and 18 is actually a lucky number. ``Chai'' means ``life,'' when you do  the numerology. Mr. Gomez is lucky to be here for number 18. For our  Jewish friends watching on C-SPAN, Mr. Speaker, they will recognize  that. It is kind of like seven. I don't know if seven is a Christian  lucky number or pagan or what, but I have heard seven is a lucky  number, too.   But 18 means life, and this is life for the DREAMers. That is what  Mr. Gomez's motion is all about: it is letting young people who have  that uncertainty and don't even know if they can go to their job and  work hard come March, or even come today or tomorrow for the over 100 a  day whose status is expiring.   I really hope that my Republican colleagues join Mr. Gomez and me in  defeating the previous question so we can bring up H.R. 3440, the Dream  Act, which would pass this body, Mr. Speaker. You and I know that. It  is bipartisan, bicameral. It would help thousands of young people who  are Americans in every single way--de facto Americans, aspiring  Americans--except on paper.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Gomez) to discuss our proposal for the 18th time: chai,  or life.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, here we go. We are finding ourselves staring down self- created deadlines, and I want to be clear about that. The deadline for  the expiration of the DREAMers in March and the fact that 100 are  expiring every day is self-created by President Trump. It is a  manufactured crisis. We, of course, could do immigration reform while  not having our backs to the wall on that issue.   This shutdown of the government is a construct of this body, this  House. They said that they would only fund the government through  January 19. So we are facing another deadline. Again, I believe, from  what I am hearing, that Congress will then create another artificial  crisis sometime in February, when we are going to be facing a  government shutdown again.   All in the face of record deficits and tax-and-spend Republican  policies, the American people have had enough.   Hundreds of thousands of DREAMers are at risk of deportation by this  administration.   Millions of children are at risk of losing their health insurance.   We are all being plunged deeper and deeper into debt, not just for  ourselves, but our future generations: my kids and many of our  grandkids, for those who have them.   We are facing another government shutdown of necessary, important  government services, including economic drivers in areas I represent,  like Rocky Mountain National Park, with over 3 million tourists a year.  It would close down if the government shuts down.   Air traffic controllers. So many other important parts of our  necessary infrastructure to succeed as a country faces an expiration  this Friday.   Even if somehow the Republicans say, ``Okay, here is another 2 or 3  weeks of funding,'' the uncertainty that that creates--meaning they  can't plan for short- to medium-term capital projects: a simple repair  that might take more than 3 weeks; knocking down a wall; fixing a  building; making a hire and an employee not knowing whether they are  going to have a job in 3 weeks, or contractors not knowing whether they  are going to be paid, and then having to reflect that in their pricing  and ultimately charging the taxpayers more for the work they are doing  because they don't know if the government will pay.   What kind of country are we running, Mr. Speaker?   I know we can do better, and that starts by defeating the previous  question so that we can just pass the Dream Act and move on. It will  pass. Sixty, seventy, or eighty percent of this body will probably vote  for it. I know there are people who don't like it. Let the people's  House work its will. Let us vote. That is what we are here to do, Mr.  Speaker--Republicans and Democrats. Let us work our will.   We have the votes on the Dream Act and we have the votes to keep the  government open, if you simply allow us to have an open process to do  it. That is what this floor time should be used for today. This is  precious floor time--the time that we are in session debating-- especially considering Republicans are sending Congress on a 10-day  vacation at the end of this week. Let's use this floor time to do what  matters.   Sure, there will be a day to discuss the finer points of World Bank  policies and the finer points of the threshold for regulatory  forbearance for mortgage cutoffs. Those things are fine, Mr. Speaker.  Those are fine to discuss, but not while the Republicans are creating  over 100 more illegal immigrants a day and they are going to create  800,000 more in just a couple of months; not when the Republicans are  plunging our Nation deeper and deeper into debt with their tax-and- spend policies; not when Republicans are forcing another government  shutdown, if not this week, then in 3 weeks or in 4 weeks.    Crisis to crisis to crisis, manufactured crisis to manufactured  crisis to manufactured crisis, the American people count on us to be  stewards of the greatest Republic that has ever been created on the  face of this Earth. Frankly, Mr. Speaker, Congress is letting them  down. Let's defeat the previous question and defeat this rule.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
