 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the worker. I  rise in support of the nearly 15,000 laid-off auto workers.   I rise in support of anyone who has ever been called a racial  epitaph. I stand with you.   I rise today for the American taxpayer. Your government is shut down.   I rise for every Federal employee.   I rise for Tim Mach of Waterford and all other aviation safety  specialists.   I rise for the TSA agent who was questioned about how he would put  gas in his car on Monday. It is now Thursday.   It is now day 27 of this unreasonable shutdown. The American worker  and the American taxpayer is wondering when their government will  reopen.   I rise today because this is unacceptable. I have acted and acted and  acted to reopen the government, and now, I, from this great body, this  U.S. House of Representatives, I implore my colleagues from the Senate  to do the same.                            ____________________
