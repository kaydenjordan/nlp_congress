 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, I yield myself 2\1/2\ minutes. The coauthor  of this amendment is Mrs. Beatty from Ohio.   Madam Chair, this amendment will allow consumers to obtain free  access to their credit scores. It directs the Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau to require that consumer reporting agencies disclose  free credit scores to consumers who make that request.   Federal law currently allows consumers to obtain one credit report  per year from each of the major credit bureaus that monitor consumer  credit information. These free reports include all the current data on  which a credit score would be based but don't include the credit score  itself.   For consumers, this is kind of like trying to figure out how well  their favorite baseball team is doing based on newly created analytics  for the modern sports fan and not for us who know just home runs, ERA,  and strikeouts. If not for the current win-loss record, would people be  able to know how their team is doing.   Good credit scores mean better interest rates on mortgages, bank  loans, and credit cards; smaller deposits for rent and utilities; and  even lower insurance premiums.   As important as credit scores are, they are still a mystery to most  Americans. While most understand the fundamentals, such as the  importance of  [[Page H4095]]  paying bills on time, there is a lot of uncertainty about how the  credit score is actually determined.   Many Americans don't know, for example, that maxing out your credit  card can be about as bad as making a late payment. Many people also  wrongly believe their credit scores reflect their income, age, marital  status, education, or even ethnicity.   A large majority of Americans are unable to define a good credit  score--700--and many don't know that small changes in behavior could  have a large impact on the interest rates that they will pay on loans.   With that in mind, this amendment directs the CFPB to determine if  agencies should also disclose other consumer information appropriate  with respect to consumer financial education.                                time  1430    People with poor or mediocre credit scores pay for them with higher  interest rates, bigger security deposits, and higher insurance  premiums.   The one number that can make or break someone's financial future more  than salary is their credit score. I believe consumers have a right to  obtain their credit score for free from the same source that supplies  it to other entities.   I would like to acknowledge my former staffer, Michael Fulton, now an  executive with the Memphis International Airport, who worked on the  original bill, the Fair Access to Credit Scores Act, which I introduced  9 years ago in the 111th Congress.   I look forward to working more on this important issue with  Chairwoman Waters and my partner on this amendment, Congresswoman  Beatty from Ohio.   I yield such time as she may consume to the distinguished gentlewoman  from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty).    Madam Chairwoman, in the minute that I have, I can't read  the bill to the gentleman, but what the gentleman talked about is not  the bill. It might be something somewhere up in the stratosphere, but  this has nothing to do with picking one company, or Venezuela, or some  other communist country. This has to do with giving consumers the fair  opportunity to see what their credit score is   That is America. That is fairness. That is justice.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chairwoman, this is a good bill. I appreciate the  idea of thoughtful. It is thoughtful and it is good. And maybe it  distinguishes the parties. One party is looking out for consumers to  have an opportunity to get a chance to see their score and  [[Page H4096]]  have a fair chance in the American economic system, to participate, and  the other doesn't care.   Madam Chairwoman, I ask that we pass the bill, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, today is the 200th anniversary of the city  of Memphis, Tennessee, the city of my birth, where I am a fourth- generation Memphian. I am proud of my city and honored to represent it  in the United States Congress.   Memphis is a city that is well known for the National Civil Rights  Museum that has turned like a phoenix the site of the assassination of  Dr. Martin Luther King into a shrine for civil rights history and civil  rights work in our country.   It is a home of music, Stax Museum of American Soul Music, Sun  Records, and Graceland. It is a city of great barbecue, real barbecue,  pork. It is a city of basketball, both the Memphis Grizzlies and the  Memphis Tigers. And it is a city of marvelous people.   It is a great city. Come celebrate with us the 200th birthday of  Memphis, the great city that it is.                            ____________________
