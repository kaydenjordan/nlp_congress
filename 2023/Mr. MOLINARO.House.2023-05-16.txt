 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize May as Mental  Health Awareness Month.   One in six students is experiencing childhood mental health  disorders. Among adults, that number jumps to one in five.   Our Nation is facing a mental health crisis, and it requires urgent  action. For too long, mental health has been a topic that people have  been afraid to openly discuss.   It carries with it a stigma that has prevented people from getting  the care they need. I know this firsthand. Having been raised by a  single mom with undiagnosed depression, I know the challenges that many  families face. While grateful for her love, I knew the struggles that  she lived with.   Talking about mental health simply isn't enough. We must work hard to  break down and break through barriers and encourage more people to seek  the help they need.   That requires us as a nation and as communities to invest more and to  help ensure anyone who needs mental health treatment can access it.   I spent much of the last 12 years as a local elected official  building up the most comprehensive community-based mental health model  in the country. It is now, today, the model that New York State uses,  and it is critically important that we expand the reach and the ability  of individuals to access community-based mental health treatment.   In upstate New York, we have incredible providers like the Mental  Health Association of the Southern Tier. Unfortunately, these providers  are stretched thin and face growing demand. They need our help.   That is why we must increase Federal commitment to mental health  programming and incentivize mental health education to boost the  pipeline of qualified practitioners.   As we recognize Mental Health Awareness Month, we must increase our  commitment to addressing the mental health crisis in our communities.   This is an issue that transcends party and politics. By working  together, we can build communities where everyone has the support they  need to live out a full, healthy, and fulfilling life.                        Honoring National Police Week     Mr. Speaker, I rise today with many of my colleagues in  honor of National Police Week. I join Members across this country in  recognizing the brave men and women who serve in Federal, State,  county, and local law enforcement.   I especially acknowledge and recognize the men and women of law  enforcement throughout upstate New York, the county, State, and local  men and women who put their lives on the line every day to protect our  communities.   Sadly, however, they don't get the recognition that they deserve, and  appreciation, while well deserved, is simply not enough.   New York State passed cashless bail reforms that have allowed  dangerous criminals to be released and remain in our communities and on  our streets, reoffending, creating new victims, undermining law  enforcement, and diminishing public safety.   These laws make it harder and more dangerous to be a law enforcement  official or a police officer. It is no wonder our police officers are  leaving the profession in record numbers.   Here in Congress, we are moving this week to pass bills to show our  support and appreciation for law enforcement and to prove again that we  have their backs. We defend those who defend us and vigorously oppose  the defund and defame the police movement, not just because it is the  right thing to do but because it will further protect our police  officers and enhance community safety.    Mr. Speaker, we recognize all of those men and women who serve and  sacrifice every day, and we are grateful to them and their families.   May they always come home to a family that loves them and a community  that supports them.                            ____________________
