 Mr. Speaker, this bill, or a bill  substantially like it, has come up before, and it enjoyed substantial  bipartisan support, and now that has changed. Why is that? It is  because it has become evident that the majority seeks, for political  reasons, to conflate the extraordinarily serious issue of domestic  terrorism with half of the country with their political opposition.   It is evident that the administration has pursued a concocted attack  on the credibility on the First Amendment activity of parents who were  engaging in First Amendment-protected activism in school boards. The  administration has engaged in a deceitful refusal to account for that  activity, and whistleblower accounts have now revealed that, indeed,  FBI agents went to interrogate parents over their activism.   When Members of the majority recite events in every one of their  comments today, they are selective and mischaracterized.                                time  1900    They do not mention the Brooklyn subway shooter. They do not mention  the Wisconsin fire bombing. They do not mention Waukesha, Wisconsin.  They do not mention Boulder, Colorado. Why do they not? Why is it so  consistent that those are not mentioned?   It is exactly the same issue in which there is always a focus on a  particular type of hate--white supremacy. Let me tell you something. I  have no hesitancy to say that the twisted butcher in Buffalo, New York,  was a white supremacist. More than that, it is evident that he was  mentally ill.   That does not mean that Republicans writ large are domestic  terrorists or white supremacists. It is a smear, and it is deliberate.  Worst of all, this preoccupation, to the exclusion of all else, that  smears the right, smears people center right, as racists, white  supremacists, is a device, a demagogic device to distract from abysmal  policy disasters led and created by advocacy and policy of Democrats.   The defund police debacle that led to a 30 percent increase in  homicides--not as tragic as 10 or 20 killings of people by domestic  terrorists on occasions--but 5,000 additional homicides a year. Do you  know what? Sixty-five percent of those are suffered by Black Americans.  There were 3,250 additional killings in 2020 and more in 2021.   The abandonment of the southern border that has resulted in a flood  of fentanyl into the country so that you see mass killings by exposure  to drugs laced with fentanyl; poison coming in and killing. The figure  of 100,000, they tell me, is not current. It is not even getting at the  essence of the problem.   Under those circumstances, and having committed that sort of policy  malpractice upon the American people with those abysmal results,  Democrats would bring a partisan bill to the floor and conflate the  egregious evil of domestic terrorism with some kind of a political  smear of your political opposition. What would it take to do that?   This bill should be bipartisan because it is promoted, it is brought,  it is worked out with the political opposition. This problem is too  significant to be cheapened as a political stunt.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, it is hard to overstate how concerning the problem is  that has so invaded our politics. We have seen in so many ways  institutional norms be trampled underfoot in this Congress. The metal  detectors at the door are one example, but they go on and on and on.   The hearing in the Judiciary Committee today aimed at intimidating  the United States Supreme Court while it is in the midst of a  particular decision is another one. Concepts about packing the Court,  ideas by Democrats to pack the Court by the chairman of the Judiciary  Committee, and they go on and on and on. This one might be the worst.   You wonder what in the world the majority may be thinking to turn the  issue of terrorism--any form of terrorism--into a partisan cudgel. It  is beyond belief. If this issue returned to a nonpartisan posture, you  would find that Republicans would be pleased to join it. It has been  grossly distorted and turned into a political weapon that should never  happen. It should never happen in this country. It should never happen  in this Congress. This bill should be defeated.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.
