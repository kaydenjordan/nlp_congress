 Mr. President, later this month our Nation will mark the  50th anniversary of the momentous uprising at the Stonewall Inn, an  occasion that led to June being designated as Pride Month. From parades  and celebrations to quiet remembrances, millions of Americans are  reflecting on the progress made in the last 50 years for LGBTQ rights,  but under the current administration, I fear some of that progress is  at risk.   President Trump, who once claimed to be an ally of the LGBTQ  community, has proven to be anything but that. His administration has  pursued a series of administrative rule changes that seek to undermine  the progress made by the LGBTQ community. That includes, at seemingly  every opportunity, attempting to make life more difficult for  transgender individuals, a community of people who already face daily  discrimination.   The Trump administration has worked to erase the gender identities of  Federal inmates; to restrict access to healthcare and allow homeless  shelters to freely discriminate against LGBTQ individuals under the  false guise of religious freedom; and to ban transgender servicemembers  from our Armed Services, many of whom have served this country for  years, including during times of war.   If discrimination by policy were not enough, President Trump also  nominated an unapologetic anti-LGBTQ zealot for a lifetime appointment  to the Federal bench, a nominee Senate Republicans are ready to confirm  on the floor this week.   Matthew Kacsmaryk has a long history of espousing uninformed,  offensive, and downright bigoted views of LGBTQ individuals. In 2016,  he wrote that the existence of transgender identity is a ``delusion''  and that treating transgender patients in accordance with their gender  identity is ``radicalism.'' He has repeatedly disparaged the LGBTQ  rights movement and described efforts to roll back progress as a ``Long  War Ahead.'' He has argued that discrimination against LGBTQ persons  should be legal in employment, public accommodations, and healthcare.  He has opposed equality in every possible arena, including anti- discrimination provisions in reauthorizations of the Violence Against  Women Act and the Runaway and Homeless Youth Trafficking and Prevention  Act, two pieces of legislation that I authored and care about deeply,  legislation that attempts to defend the most vulnerable in our society.   No one can credibly claim that an LGBTQ individual, seeking nothing  more than equality under the law, would receive a fair hearing from a  Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, a man who considers himself a warrior in the  effort to roll back LGBTQ rights. He is simply unfit to serve as a  judge. The fact that Senate Republicans would consider the nomination  of Matthew Kacsmaryk during Pride Month adds additional insult to the  LGBTQ community, which rightly speaks with a single voice in opposition  to this nominee.   Protecting LGBTQ rights need not be a partisan effort. Senator Ted  Kennedy and I worked with Republican partners to pass the Matthew  Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act into law, which  ensures that hate crimes motivated by sexual orientation or gender  identity are federally recognized and prosecuted. I also worked with  Senator Crapo when we authored the landmark reauthorization and  expansion of the Violence Against Women Act in 2013, which expanded  protections for LGBTQ victims. The Senate has an opportunity to come  together again in enacting much-needed reforms by passing the Equality  Act.   A most basic duty of government is to protect its citizens. By  allowing President Trump to repeatedly attack the LGBTQ community  without taking action or speaking out, the Senate is failing in our  duty. American citizens will suffer greatly from discriminatory  policies and judges with hostility toward the LGBTQ community. People  at their most desperate will be refused medical care and turned away  from shelters. Soldiers will be forced to hide who they are or risk  being discharged and prevented from serving the country they love.  Inmates will be housed with people of a different gender, opening the  door to abuse.   If the President is able to sanction overt discrimination against  marginalized members of society with impunity, the words ``all men are  created equal'' have little meaning. I implore each member of this body  to stand up for the rights of all our LGBTQ constituents and friends,  not just during Pride Month, but every month. I, for one, will stand  with them.                      nomination of allen cothrel winsor
