 Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Daines joining me to  clarify the intent of the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of  2019. This legislation, which Senator Daines has introduced with  Senator Leahy, would modify the McCarran-Ferguson Act by eliminating  the health insurance industry's exemption from Federal antitrust laws.  That sounds like a good idea, but it has implications for longstanding  State regulation of the insurance industry.   States have had the primary responsibility for the regulation of  health insurance since the 1940s. Given my past experience as  commissioner of Maine's Department of Professional and Financial  Regulation, I know firsthand that State insurance regulators do a good  job of responding to the needs and concerns of their insurance  consumers. To protect consumers, State insurance  [[Page S7967]]  regulators hold probing hearings on rate requests which often lead to  lower rates being approved. Most State insurance regulators have  consumer protection advocates who resolve disputes between insurers and  individual consumers. State regulators do not tolerate unfair or  anticompetitive practices. As the National Association of Insurance  Commissioners wrote to the leaders of the Senate and the Senate  Judiciary Committee, ``The potential for bid rigging, price-fixing and  market allocation is of great concern to state insurance regulators and  we share your view that such practices would be harmful to consumers  and should not be tolerated. However, we want to assure you that these  activities are not permitted under state law. Indeed, the state  insurance regulators in all states actively enforce their antitrust  rules and review rates to ensure they are actuarially justified,  sufficient for solvency and nondiscriminatory.''   Based on this experience, I have consistently raised concerns about  legislation that could interfere with the current State-level  regulation of insurance and could ultimately harm Maine consumers and  smaller insurers. These concerns extend to the Competitive Health  Insurance Reform Act.   While the bill does not directly modify the portion of McCarran- Ferguson that affirms State regulatory authority, it, however, does add  a layer of Federal review, and we need to ensure that in doing so we do  not create increased confusion, cost, and possible conflicts between  State and Federal efforts.   This is why it is very important to make clear Congress's intent that  along with the changes specified in the bill, it is Congress's  expectation that the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade  Commission must notify State bureaus of insurance and attorneys general  of any complaints or investigations they have received or are  performing that involve entities in their state. I appreciate Senator  Daines' willingness to join me today to ensure this intent is clearly  stated in the Congressional Record.   Given the agreement to provide formal clarification of the  expectation that DOJ and FTC shall provide notification to States  regarding complaints or investigations they have received or are  performing, I will withdraw my objection to passage of this  legislation.   Thank you.                            ____________________
