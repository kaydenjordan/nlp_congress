 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding  time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my good friend Congressman Jim  Clyburn's bill to reauthorize the Historically Black Colleges and  Universities Historic Preservation program.   I have known Jim Clyburn for more than 35 years, and this has been  his passion ever since I first met him many years ago. I thank Mr.  Clyburn for his passion and his leadership on this issue.    Since 1988, the HBCU Historic Preservation program has provided more  than $60 million to HBCUs all across the country to support  infrastructure and facilitate learning.   Both my undergraduate and law school alma mater, North Carolina  Central University in Durham, an institution that I am now proud to  represent in Congress, has greatly benefited from the program.   And I might say that my father graduated from Shaw University, which  is an HBCU, and later from Meharry Medical College. My mother attended  high school at Shaw University and graduated from college at Hampton  Institute, now called Hampton University.   Mr. Speaker, HBCUs fill a unique and important role in our Nation's  higher education system and in our country's narrative. Not only do  HBCUs train our workforce of the future by producing the most African- American students who can earn science and engineering doctoral  degrees, they are integral parts of our national identity.   The more than 100 HBCUs spread across the country house the books and  the memorabilia from freedmen and former slaves dating back many years.   Many of the historic buildings on the campuses of HBCUs were used as  meeting places during reconstruction and during the civil rights  movement.   HBCUs represent the past, the here and the now, and the future of our  country. By reauthorizing this important program through 2024, we can  honor the many important faculty and students that have helped HBCUs  endure, support people at those institutions today, and prepare our  workforce for the future.   I strongly support this bill. I commend my dear colleague,  Congressman Jim Clyburn, for his enormous leadership on this important  issue. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this legislation.                                time  1445
