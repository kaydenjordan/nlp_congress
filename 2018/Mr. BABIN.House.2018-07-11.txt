 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Strengthening  Fishing Communities and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management  Act.   Not only does this bill reauthorize the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery  Conservation and Management Act, which is long overdue, but it also  updates the language of the act to put more power in the hands of local  councils to manage their fisheries effectively. One-size-fits-all  approaches rarely work, so I am proud to cosponsor this bill which  allows local councils to tailor management plans to the needs of their  regions.   Further, this bill would lift burdens of outdated, arbitrary  scientific practices and data which limit the American people's access  to affordable domestically caught fish. The seafood industry is  economically booming and it is past time that we lift these restricting  regulations and allow a win for not only the recreational fishermen,  which I have been a lifelong proponent of and a participant, but also  of our commercial fishermen, the American people will be a winner as  well, so I urge a vote for this bill.
