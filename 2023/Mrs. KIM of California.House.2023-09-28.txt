 Mr. Chair, this amendment would have  catastrophic consequences for priorities our conference champions,  including elimination of religious freedom programming, gutting the  Counter China Influence Fund, and hamstringing international  cybersecurity capacity building at a time when each of those foreign  policy priorities is under great pressure.   The funds from the Economic Support Fund are available to protect  human rights and freedom of the press, combat human trafficking and  corruption, and increase public accountability.   This account goes to countries of strategic significance to the  United States and often intended to promote the political and economic  stability of our U.S. allies.   Mr. Chair, the fiscal year 2024 bill already marks a $2.4 billion  reduction from the President's request and a $1.3 billion reduction  from the fiscal year 2023 level.   The dramatic shift proposed in this amendment would be an absolute  whiplash for our partners and allies overseas and detrimental to many  of the GOP and bipartisan priorities funded through this account.   Mr. Chair, I would go on about the priorities that would be lost if  this amendment were adopted, like training for Taiwan and Cuba  democracy programs, but I will simply say this amendment is a  disservice to responsible and effective diplomacy.   I encourage my colleagues to oppose this amendment, with all due  respect.
