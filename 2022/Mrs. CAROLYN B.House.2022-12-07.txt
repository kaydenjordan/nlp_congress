 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentlewoman for yielding and for her leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the rule for the Respect for  Marriage Act.   In all my decades of public service, I have never wavered in my  support for the LGBTQ+ community. In 1990, I introduced the first  legislation in New York State history to grant legal recognition to  same-sex couples. When the Defense of Marriage Act was introduced in  1996, I was one of 67 House Members to vote against it. I knew then  what I know now: DOMA was a bigoted, discriminatory solution to a  problem that never existed.   It never made sense that I could get into a cab and meet someone that  I have never met before, a cab driver, and marry a complete stranger.  You could marry the driver that day. Yet a bold, brave New Yorker, and  a friend of mine, named Edie Windsor could not have her marriage  recognized. She took that fight to the Supreme Court and won.   Mr. Speaker, the Respect for Marriage Act will ensure LGBTQ equality,  but much more work needs to be done. I thank Chairman Nadler for this  bill.
