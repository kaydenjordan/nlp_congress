 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to remember the life of  Jennifer ``Jenny'' Parks. Jenny attended the Route 51 festival in Las  Vegas on October 1. Jenny was a remarkable kindergarten teacher at  Anaverde Hills Elementary School in Lancaster, California.   Jenny loved all of her students and their families but ensured to  leave a big place in her heart for her husband, Bobby, and their two  kids, Bryce and Lea.   Jenny was a loving person who always went out of her way to help  people. She is remembered by her family and friends as being a  beautiful and intelligent woman who had a wonderful sense of humor. I  would like to extend my condolences to Jenny Park's family and friends.  Please know that the city of Las Vegas, the State of Nevada, and the  whole country grieve with you.                            ____________________
