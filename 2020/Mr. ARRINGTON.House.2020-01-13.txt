 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from North  Carolina for yielding and for the opportunity to speak about a great  American hero and a wonderful family, a class act.  [[Page H201]]    I was privileged to serve under the great leadership of George W.  Bush as Governor of the Lone Star State and then President of this  great country. No doubt his parents, their character, their patriotism,  and love for their fellow man did not fall too far from the tree, as we  say in Texas.   I rise in support of the President George H.W. Bush and First Spouse  Barbara Bush Coin Act sponsored by friend and fellow Texan, Senator  John Cornyn.   George Herbert Walker Bush and his wife First Lady Barbara Bush were  exemplars of leadership and service to the country and an almost  perfect picture of a devoted and loving marriage. If there is a perfect  marriage, they certainly seemed to have it.   I think, Madam Speaker, it is right and good to honor and commemorate  the most noble and accomplished leaders and public servants, and no  doubt, at the top of that list is George Herbert Walker Bush and his  wife Barbara Bush, and I am grateful for the opportunity to honor the  legacy of President and First Lady Bush by supporting the issuance of  these coins.
