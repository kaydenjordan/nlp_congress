 Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from  Kentucky for his astute analysis on what the American people really  want. I thank the manager, the chairwoman of this bill, and I  acknowledge the position that they take.   But what America really wants is for Washington, for America, for the  government, to stand by them in their time of need.   I am very grateful to be part of a party that is not about politics  but is about values. We are the better choice party. We offer a better  deal on this project that we have worked so hard on called the American  budget.   The American budget, in contrast to our friends on the other side of  the aisle, recognizes, as I visited the National Institutes for Health,  that 80 percent of their budget that we are going to lose goes for  research and researchers--looking those researchers in the eyes when  they explain the research in medical science to help save lives, and to  know that the Republican budget cuts the NIH, the Centers for Disease  Control, and takes up the TrumpCare that cuts trillions in Medicaid and  $500 billion in Medicare. That is the story of this bill.   Then, as my good friend from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen) indicated, we  invest in infrastructure, and we help this young man, not only with his  healthcare but with education. Do we realize how many jobs go unable to  find individuals in this country? Hundreds of thousands because of the  lack of training.    So if my friends want growth, you know how you get growth? You invest  in the American people. Or you tell the American people when tragedies  strike, whether it is the Virgin Islands, or Puerto Rico, or Florida,  or Texas, or tragically, in Nevada, that you will stand by them. You  provide them with the infrastructure to be able to overcome.   Not the Republican budget, because the Republican budget is giving  trillions in tax cuts, and the distribution of those moneys will not  see the front door of low-income, moderate-income, middle class working  Americans.   That is the distinction between the Democratic budget. It increases  opportunity through a higher minimum wage. It believes in equal pay for  equal work. It knows that immigration reform will bring in billions of  dollars. It will create opportunities for work.   Then, of course, we know that the Democratic budget strengthens our  healthcare, and it provides that her Social Security, her Medicare,  will not be in jeopardy. The Medicare trust fund will not lose with a  Republican budget and the trillions of dollars of tax cuts, her life,  as she continues to seek some balance of good life will be lost.   We are the right direction. We are for the American people. We are  standing by the American people with the Democratic budget. I ask my  colleagues to vote for the Democratic alternative.    Mr. Speaker, many of us will be going home to our  districts, facing constituents who will be asking the question: Why?   It really is painful when fellow Americans lose their lives. It is  painful as we watch our soldiers go off into battle, and many of them  do not come home in any other way but as a fallen soldier.   This past week, Americans, who were not in battle but were enjoying  the life and the liberty of this Nation, fell by a murderous actor. I  think we will have to go home and comfort our constituents, and we will  also tell them what we are going to do.   I don't know why we have to climb this high mountain of understanding  that laws can make a difference; not end all violence, but make a  difference: legislation that says that guns have to be locked to save  the lives of children; gun legislation that deals with banning armor- piercing bullets that would harm and injure our first responders; and  then to get rid of the kits that this murderous individual utilized to  make a semiautomatic an automatic.   Mr. Speaker, I ask this Congress, together, to begin to do work on  gun safety that will save American lives. I go home to my district to  meet with my constituents, and I am going to tell them that I am going  to do something that makes sense for the American people.                            ____________________
