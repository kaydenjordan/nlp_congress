 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  and congratulate Ethan Knarr of DuBois, Pennsylvania. Ethan recently  accepted a fully qualified appointment to the United States Naval  Academy in Annapolis, Maryland.   Ethan is the son of Christopher and Danielle Knarr and the grandson  of Daniel and Linda Schaffer of DuBois, Leona Knarr of Troutville, and  Doug Grube and the late Elizabeth Ann Grube of DuBois.   As a student at DuBois Area High School, Ethan has been an active  member of the National Honor Society and the cross-country team, and he  served as captain of the tennis team.   Outside of school, Ethan has been heavily involved in the Boy Scouts  of America, having served as historian, assistant senior patrol leader,  and eventually senior patrol leader of his troop. Ethan became an Eagle  Scout in March 2020.   I would like to thank Ethan for his commitment to service and wish  him the very best as he embarks on this exciting new phase of life in  Annapolis.                           Recognizing Pete Rickard     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  and congratulate Pete Rickard of Strattanville, Pennsylvania, for  accepting a fully qualified appointment to the United States Air Force  Academy in Colorado.   Pete is a student at Clarion-Limestone High School. During his time  at Clarion-Limestone, Pete has been a member of the Academic Decathlon  team, lettered in basketball, and active in FFA, or Future Farmers of  America.   He is now a senior member of the Civil Air Patrol Clarion Composite  Squadron 504 and is active in the Greater Pennsylvania American Red  Cross.   Pete credits his success to the love and support he has received from  family and friends, including Rod and Debbie Frampton, as well as his  four sisters, Lucy, Ann, Katie, and Bonnie.   Undoubtedly, Pete's academic success and experience with the Civil  Air Patrol will serve him well as he starts this exciting new chapter  at the Air Force Academy.   Best wishes to Pete, and I look forward to seeing all that he  achieves.                           Recognizing Lisa Winger     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Lisa Winger of Oil City. Lisa was recently recognized by the Venango  Area Chamber of Commerce as the 2020 Citizen of the Year.   According to the chamber, nominees are those who, ``in the face of  danger, combat adversity through feats of ingenuity, courage, or  strength, and those who perform great deeds or selfless acts for the  common good.''   Susan Williams, executive director of the chamber, noted nominations  for Lisa mentioned her impeccable character and that she was highly  respected, a leader, and selfless.   Lisa works at the AseraCare Hospice, where she counsels residents and  their families by providing compassion, comfort, and advice.   She truly lives a life of service. Outside of her work with  AseraCare, Lisa has also established an Alzheimer's support group at  the Oil City YMCA, and she leads the county's Toys for Tots program.   A friend of Lisa's said in her nomination that Lisa ``works  tirelessly for Venango County and dedicates herself to everything she  does.''   I would like to congratulate Lisa on this much-deserved recognition  and thank her for her commitment to serving her community.

Marty Yachisko is the lifeblood of this operation. Marty has been  running the Meals on Wheels Program in Indiana County out of the local  American Legion kitchen since 1981. Five days a week, Marty and his  volunteers gather at the Legion to prepare meals for local senior  citizens. Currently, Meals on Wheels of Indiana County is serving 35  seniors but, in the past, volunteers have served up to 70 individuals  daily.   Before COVID-19, almost 10 million seniors were facing hunger  threats. Meals on Wheels provides an incredibly valuable service. It is  not just hot meals. For many seniors, their only social interaction of  the day may be their visit from a Meals on Wheels volunteer. That  connection is invaluable.   Meals on Wheels Indiana is always looking for more volunteers looking  to help seniors in their community.   Thank you to Marty and the team at Meals on Wheels Indiana County for  their dedication.                            ____________________
