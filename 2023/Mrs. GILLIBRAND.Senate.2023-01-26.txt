 Thank you so much, Mr. President. Thank you for your  leadership and your extraordinary stewardship of our State.   I rise today to thank and welcome my guest, Rev. A.R. Bernard, for  leading us in that beautiful prayer this morning--so heartfelt, so  purposeful, selected exactly for this moment in time. The wisdom that  you bring us is very welcome.   Through all the challenges that my constituents and Senator Schumer's  constituents in New York have faced over these last few years, Rev.  Bernard has been a steadfast and devoted leader, serving his flock  through faith and good works.   Not only does he lead one of New York's largest churches, Reverend  Bernard is tackling some of the most pressing issues that our  communities face: food insecurity, injustice, ensuring all of our  children receive high-quality education.   He truly embodies the Word and the grace of God, and I am proud to  welcome him as my guest for the summit that we are hosting today for  African-American faith leaders.   I hope we will be able to learn from his example.   I yield the floor.
