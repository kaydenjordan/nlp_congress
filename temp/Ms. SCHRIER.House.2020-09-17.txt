 Madam Speaker, I had a high-risk pregnancy, complicated  by both advanced maternal age and 24 years of type 1 diabetes. I worked  until 2 days before my C-section, and I am so grateful that my employer  allowed for minor accommodations which allowed me to continue to work.   Women are half of our workforce, and 75 percent of those women will  become pregnant at some point. Supporting women during their  pregnancies is just as important as prenatal care, immunizations,  affordable childcare, and public education. We can do that by passing  this bill, as well as supporting programs like WIC that help new and  expectant parents to provide the proper nutrition and developmental  supports to their babies.   We all benefit from healthy pregnancy outcomes.   It costs us all when a baby is born prematurely and requires months  in intensive care.   It costs us all when a fetus is exposed to toxins in utero because we  couldn't protect the mother from an unhealthy environment and that  child then suffers a lifetime of damage that will require public  support.   It costs us all when half of our workforce may lose or leave their  jobs because pregnant women and mothers are not welcomed or supported  in the workplace.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from over 40 public  health organizations, clinicians, and maternal health providers who  support this bill.                                                September 14, 2020.      Re Support the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.        Dear Representative: The undersigned public health       professionals, health care clinicians, and maternal health       organizations dedicated to the health and well-being of       mothers, infants, and families enthusiastically support the       Pregnant Workers Fairness Act (H.R. 2694). Modeled after the       Americans with Disabilities Act, the bill would require       employers to provide reasonable, temporary workplace       accommodations to pregnant workers as long as the       accommodation does not impose an undue hardship on the       employer. This bill is critically important because no one       should have to choose between having a healthy pregnancy and       a paycheck.        Three-quarters of women will be pregnant and employed at       some point in their lives. Most pregnant workers can expect a       routine pregnancy and healthy birth. However, health care       professionals have consistently recommended that some       pregnant individuals make adjustments in their work       activities to sustain a healthy pregnancy and prevent adverse       pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth or miscarriage.       These medically necessary workplace accommodations can       include allowing additional bathroom breaks, opportunities to       stay hydrated, lifting restrictions, or access to a chair or       stool to decrease time spent standing.        Unfortunately, too many pregnant workers, particularly       pregnant people of color, face barriers to incorporating even       these small changes to their workdays. Workplace       accommodations help safeguard a healthy pregnancy or prevent       harm to a higher-risk pregnancy. Across the country, pregnant       workers continue to be denied simple, no-cost or low-cost,       temporary adjustments in their work settings or activities       and instead risk being fired or forced to take unpaid leave       to preserve the health of their pregnancy. Low-wage pregnant       workers in physically demanding jobs, which are       disproportionately occupied by people of color, feel the       impact most acutely. This impossible choice forces many       pregnant workers to continue working without accommodations,       putting women and their pregnancies at risk of long-lasting       and severe health consequences.        The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act is a measured approach to       a serious problem. As public health professionals, health       care clinicians, and maternal health organizations, we       understand the importance of reasonable workplace       accommodations to ensure that pregnant persons can continue       to provide for their families and have safe and healthy       pregnancies. We collectively urge swift passage of the       Pregnant Workers Fairness Act.

Madam Speaker, the bipartisan Pregnant Workers Fairness  Act simply ensures that reasonable accommodations are made to help  pregnant women work safely, and, in turn, the economy is stronger,  family outcomes are better, and children can start life strong and  healthy. Everyone wins.                                time  1130
