 Mr. Chair, I rise today to express my strong  support for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2018.   As the most recently deployed veteran serving in Congress, serving in  Afghanistan just 2 years ago, I know the national security challenges  facing our country firsthand. While these challenges are not easily  solved, this legislation represents a significant step forward.   I want to take a moment and specifically thank Chairman Thornberry  for his leadership and assistance to myself and other freshman members  of the committee.   Working together with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, the  Armed Services Committee has crafted a bill focused on rebuilding and  reforming the Department of Defense. By procuring what we need, fixing  what we already have, and by being good stewards of the taxpayers'  dollars by proposing new contract audit reforms, this bill begins the  hard work of getting our Department back on the right track.   While we cannot control the existential threats facing our Nation, we  must ensure those in uniform are ready to address those threats when  necessary.   Moreover, as this week's tragic C-130 accident that claimed the lives  of 16 servicemembers reminded all Americans, our servicemembers place  their lives on the line each day.    From giving our troops a well-deserved raise to  funding our vital missile defense programs, I believe this legislation  begins the process of rebuilding and reforming our military so we are  ready for whatever comes next.
