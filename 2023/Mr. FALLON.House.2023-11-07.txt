 Mr. Speaker, I was sitting here not planning to speak at  all, then I heard words from the other side of the aisle. They were  flowery, they were eloquent, they had passion, they were articulate,  they were powerful, and even moving probably to some.   Nevertheless, were they true?   I heard about protecting speech, the First Amendment, and our beloved  Constitution.   Who is not for protecting speech, our beloved Constitution, and the  First Amendment?   So does the gentleman from Maryland and our friends across the aisle  really believe that?   Then when I heard about slippery slope and setting a precedent, on  February 4, 2021, Marjorie Taylor Greene was removed from her  committees for things that she said before she was a Member of  Congress.   On November 17, 2021, Paul Gosar was censured for a cartoon that his  staff posted. A tasteless cartoon though it be, it was speech.   So we are protecting speech, are we?   It is speech that we disagree with, calling the deliberate killing of  innocent civilians resistance, claiming a bombing of a Gaza hospital  was done by the Israelis that killed hundreds of people when we knew  that was not true, and yet Ms. Tlaib doubled and tripled down on that.  That was false, and that was a lie. And then repeating and celebrating  a genocidal chant ``from the river to the sea.'' That is not a cartoon,  and that is not saying some things, Mr. Speaker, that you said before  you were a Member of Congress.   Then we were accused of, oh, it is Islamophobic, or it was pointed  out that she was a woman of color or she was the only Palestinian.   What does any of that matter?   This is about words and actions, and we hold everyone to the same  standard. We are not trying to jail her. We are not trying to expel  her. We are not levying a civil fine. We are not even talking about  removing her from committees.   We are simply firmly and formally disagreeing with her and chastising  her for her words and her actions.   What she did was not leadership. It was demagoguery of the worst  kind, and it was beneath the dignity of this office, her office, and  the alleged commitment to peace she claims.                                time  1545
