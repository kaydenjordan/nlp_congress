 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R.  748, repealing the so-called Cadillac tax.   I believe that we in Congress should be incentivizing employer- sponsored insurance to be more generous, not less; and at a time when  the President is working to dismantle the Affordable Care Act and  pushing through regulations that allow junk plans to flourish, we need  to stand with American workers and fight for more generous health  plans.   The plans that are hit by this tax cover more female employees, more  workers with dependent children, more older workers, and employees at  small businesses. These are the people who are being hit by high  deductibles, rising premiums, and more cost sharing in the health  system than ever before.   A recent study showed that in 2018, 58 percent of Americans do not  have $1,000 of savings in case of an emergency, and yet the average  deductible in 2018 was $1,350.   We must pass this bill.   I include letters of support for H.R. 748 into the Congressional  Record from organizations such as the Alliance for Retired Americans,  the Alliance to Fight the 40, and the College and University  Professional Association for Human Resources.                                  Alliance for Retired Americans,                                      Washington, DC, July 15, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 4.4 million members       of the Alliance for Retired Americans, I am writing to urge       you to vote in favor of H.R. 748, the Middle Class Health       Benefits Tax Repeal Act, when it comes up for a vote on the       House floor this week.        As you know, approximately 181 million Americans rely on       employer-provided health insurance to pay for the medical       care that they need. The 40% excise tax, originally passed as       a part of the Affordable Care Act, is assessed on any health       plan that provides more than $10,200 for individual coverage       and $27,500 for family coverage.        While intended to target high-premium plans for the wealthy       to expand benefits and coverage for uninsured individuals,       the tax squarely affects middle class workers and their       families. Johns Hopkins University researchers projected that       75% of employer-sponsored plans will be affected by the tax.        Retirees are especially vulnerable to higher health care       costs and will be hurt if the tax goes into effect. Older       Americans' retiree insurance plans typically have higher       premiums. If not repealed, employers may reduce the benefits       provided to their retirees who are younger than 65 and       eliminate supplemental coverage altogether for Medicare       eligible retirees age 65 and over. In addition, the tax       disproportionately hurts women, low- to middle-class       individuals and families, people with disabilities, workers       with high-risk occupations, and those with chronic medical       conditions.        Many workers are already experiencing the effects of the       tax. Some employers are reducing health coverage for their       employees to avoid the tax. Others are increasing premiums       and deductibles to shift costs to workers. The Middle Class       Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act will eliminate this looming       danger facing millions of American workers.        I urge you to vote in favor of H.R. 748 to protect quality       health coverage for older Americans and millions of workers       and their families. The importance of this vote cannot be       overstated.            Sincerely,                                                 Richard J. Fiesta,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                         Alliance to Fight the 40,                                                      July 15, 2019.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Leader McConnell, Minority Leader Schumer, Speaker       Pelosi, and Minority Leader McCarthy: We are writing on       behalf of the 181 million Americans who receive health care       coverage through an employer. This coverage is threatened by       the looming 40% tax on employer-provided coverage. We applaud       the House for the bipartisan support and for bringing H.R.       748, a bill that fully repeals the ``Cadillac Tax,'' to the       floor for a vote this week. We urge the Senate to approve       quickly, and send this bill to the president before the end       of the year.        The tax is having a real impact, today, on the lives and       pocketbooks of American workers. A poll conducted July 12,       2019, found that 86% of voters oppose taxing employer-      provided health insurance.        The ``Cadillac Tax'' increases the health care cost burden       for working Americans, threatens patient access to care, and       targets vulnerable populations such as the families and sick       individuals most needing care. A significant majority of       voters--across party lines--oppose this tax because it       increases out-of-pocket costs for older, sicker and       underserved communities. Taxing workers trying to manage       chronic conditions fails to address our most urgent health       care challenges.        At 40%, the tax is twice the top corporate rate and will       have significant consequences. Waiting to address the tax       forces employers to adjust benefits now in anticipation of       the tax. Several studies have shown that the ``Cadillac Tax''       would have a direct and negative impact on the continued       affordability of employer-provided health insurance because       employers will be compelled to reduce benefits and increase       deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs to avoid the tax.        We need to protect the millions of American families with       employer-provided health care coverage from further benefit       losses and cost hikes. A healthy workforce drives a healthy       economy, but the so-called ``Cadillac Tax'' will drive       America's health care--and workforce--in the wrong direction.        There is strong support for repealing the 40% tax from both       sides of the aisle and both  [[Page H5968]]       sides of the Capitol--and all across the country. Currently,       there are more than 360 cosponsors in the House and 42       cosponsors in the Senate who support legislation to repeal       the tax. In addition, 665 organizations including,       businesses, nonprofits, cities, chambers of commerce,       insurers, brokers, unions, and patient advocacy groups       recently signed a letter supporting full repeal of the       ``Cadillac Tax.''        We urge you to keep health care affordable for working       families by including full repeal of the ``Cadillac Tax'' in       any package under consideration before the end of this year.        Thank you for your consideration of this request.

Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Charles Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Leader McConnell, Minority Leader Schumer, Speaker       Pelosi, and Minority Leader McCarthy: On behalf of the       College and University Professional Association for Human       Resources (CUPA-HR), I write in support of H.R. 748, a bill       that fully repeals the ``Cadillac Tax,'' and urge members of       the House to vote ``YES'' when the bill comes to the floor       for a vote this week. I also urge the Senate to approve this       bill quickly and send the bill to the President's desk before       the end of the year.        CUPA-HR serves as the voice of human resources (HR) in       higher education, representing more than 31,000 human       resources professionals and other higher education leaders at       over 2,000 colleges and universities across the country. Its       membership includes 93 percent of all U.S. doctoral       institutions, 79 percent of all master's institutions, 58       percent of all bachelor's institutions and over 500 two-year       and specialized institutions. Higher education employs over       3.9 million workers nationwide, with colleges and       universities in all 50 states.        CUPA-HR members collectively provide comprehensive health       benefits to millions of employees, retirees, students and       their families. As such, CUPA-HR supports and encourages       employer efforts to provide benefits that enhance employees'       health and wellness--including efforts to keep healthcare       affordable.        For these reasons we urge the full House to vote ``yes'' on       this legislation. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me       to discuss this issue further.            Sincerely,      Joshua A. Ulman,        Chief Government Relations Officer, College and University       Professional Association for Human Resources.                                   ____           SHRM,                                     Alexandria, VA, July 15, 2019.      Speaker Nancy Pelosi,      House of Representatives.      Leader Kevin McCarthy,      House of Representatives.      Leader Charles Schumer,      U.S. Senate.      Leader Mitch McConnell,      U.S. Senate.        Dear Speaker Pelosi, Leader McCarthy, Leader Schumer, and       Leader McConnell, For over seventy years the Society for       Human Resource Management (SHRM) has represented the       interests of our nation's Human Resources (HR) professionals.       Today, with more than 300,000 members who impact the lives of       115 million employees each day we use our voice to elevate       issues squarely at the intersection of work, workers and the       workplace. Workplace healthcare is one of those issues.        SHRM believes public policy must strengthen the employer-      based health care system, which provides coverage to more       than 181 million Americans. As the bedrock of the U.S. health       care system, employer-sponsored plans are the largest       providers of health insurance (66 percent of the workforce)       to individuals in the United States. Therefore, I write to       share SHRM's strong support of H.R. 748 and S. 684, the       Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act.        Although not effective until 2022, employers are already       restructuring their health care benefit offerings to avoid       the tax. According to a new analysis by the Kaiser Family       Foundation, the anticipated tax would affect one in five       (21%) employers offering health benefits when it takes effect       in 2022 unless employers change their health plans.        As 2022 approaches, more employers will have to closely       scrutinize their health benefit offerings and make the       necessary changes to avoid the tax, which may include       reducing benefits and/or altering wellness and chronic care       prevention programs. While the excise tax is only intended to       target high-value plans, modest plans will also be impacted,       meaning millions of Americans and their families could face       higher copays and deductibles, causing some to decline       employer-provided health care.        The Cadillac Tax must be dealt with well in advance of its       proposed implementation date, otherwise employees could see       further changes in their benefit options. For these reasons,       I urge you to support H.R. 748 when it is considered on the       House floor this week and encourage swift action in the       Senate.            Sincerely,                                   Johnny C. Taylor, Jr., SHRM-SCP,      President & CEO.                                   ____                                                     Partnership for                                     Employer-Sponsored Coverage,                                                      July 15, 2019.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: As members of the       Partnership for Employer-Sponsored Coverage, we write with       our strong support for passage of the Middle Class Health       Benefits Tax Repeal Act (H.R. 748), to repeal the 40 percent       excise tax on employer-sponsored health coverage and employee       benefits under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). This important       reform effort impacts the over 181 million Americans covered       through employment-based benefits plans.        The Partnership for Employer-Sponsored Coverage is       committed to ensuring that employer-sponsored coverage is       strengthened and remains a viable, affordable option for       decades to come. Employer-sponsored coverage has been the       backbone of our nation's health system for nearly eight       decades. Employers have a vested interest in health care       quality, value, and system viability.        The 40 percent excise tax, also known as the Cadillac tax,       would force employers to cut or limit employee benefits. The       tax is a blunt instrument that proponents envision will       address the demand side of rising health costs. While dubbed       the Cadillac tax because the provision was targeting ``high       cost'' employer-sponsored health coverage, it would impact       the vast majority of employee benefits plans.        While we appreciate prior delays of this tax, uncertainty       remains in the employer health market as the U.S. Treasury       Department begins to develop proposed rules for       implementation. Employers make plan decisions well in advance       of a coverage year beginning and looming proposed rules have       a direct impact on plan decisions that are being made now for       the 'next several coverage years.        Full repeal of the Cadillac tax is extremely timely. H.R.       748 will bring certainty to millions insured under an       employer plan.
