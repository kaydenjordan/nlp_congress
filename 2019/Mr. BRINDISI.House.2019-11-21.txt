 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the advanced  manufacturing that is happening in New York's medical device industry.   Medical device companies across New York employ nearly 20,000 people,  paying good wages, helping patients live healthier lives, and making  products here in the United States.   Companies like Welch Allyn and ConMed are expanding manufacturing  [[Page H9126]]  in upstate New York and creating hundreds of new jobs. But this growth  could be hurt if we see the return of the medical device tax.   The current suspension of the device tax expires on December 31.  Allowing this tax to return could erode gains in employment in the med- tech sector from the last 4 years, ultimately hurting innovation and  patient access to new technology.   Madam Speaker, I hope we can work together this year as Democrats and  Republicans to delay this tax and keep supporting American  manufacturing.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  O'Halleran), my friend, for yielding to me.   Madam Speaker, I rise in honor of National Rural Health Day.   I am proud to represent a rural district in upstate New York. These  are strong communities of hardworking men and women, but too often, I  hear about the challenges facing these families.   I recently heard from farmers at a roundtable about the stress of  losing a farm that has been in the family for generations and the  barriers to reaching out for help when you are in distress.   Rural Americans too often face long travel times to access healthcare  and a lack of adequate resources locally.   Tragically, the CDC reports that the suicide rate in rural America is  45 percent higher than in urban areas.   We need to do better.   That is why I am proud to work with my colleagues Representative  Katko and Representative Craig to introduce the Seeding Rural  Resilience Act. This bipartisan bill will direct more resources to  reduce the stigma around mental healthcare and help connect farmers  with available resources.   It shouldn't matter if you live in New Berlin or New York City: You  deserve access to quality, affordable healthcare.   It is time for Congress to act to deliver more access to affordable  healthcare across our rural communities.   Madam Speaker, I urge consideration and swift passage of my bill and  other actions to help address the specific needs of rural Americans.
