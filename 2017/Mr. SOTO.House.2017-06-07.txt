 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from the beautiful  State of Hawaii for yielding to me, and I thank her also for being a  champion of immigrants, both in her State and across the Nation.   It is Immigrant Heritage Month this month, and I think it is critical  that we take a few moments to talk about the state of immigration here  in the United States. I can't do that any better than by talking about  a few stories of what I have experienced over the past few months.   On January 27 of this year, we saw President Trump sign his executive  order, quite expeditiously, on a travel ban that specifically targeted  the Muslim community, with seven countries, where 90-plus percent of  the population practice Islam.   It was an interesting moment for me. My wife and I were having dinner  with a few friends of ours in the district, and one of them had asked  me: Well, how is this ban going to affect you? How is it going to  affect your district?   At the moment, I wasn't really sure, but then I got a call only a few  minutes later by my district director. Our first constituent was  identified as coming back on a United Arab Emirates flight back from  Iraq and was scheduled to land the next morning: a girl who had  graduated from the University of Central Florida and lived a very  productive life as a legal resident in central Florida for the last 6  years after her graduation.   So we went the next day--early the next morning because, if anything,  my legislative experience in the State legislature has told me: go to  where the action is, go to where the controversy is, and do what you  can to help.   First, we went to Customs and Border Protection, and we got no  response. We actually got surprise responses of what were we even doing  there, because this was not a matter they were prepared to handle.   So we went to the airport and were greeted by Greater Orlando  Aviation Authority officials who were very helpful and understood that  these were central Floridians who had been flying for 20 hours and were  just about to arrive back into Florida, where they lived.   That morning, I also met a young man who was a citizen from an area  just north of the district, who was waiting for his two parents to come  in on the same Emirates flight. We found out that the constituent and  the two parents were three people who were held back and questioned.   Throughout the day, we would get updates, but what we found out is  there was very little information because there was very little  understanding by Customs and Border Protection about how to implement  this very vague order. The court had just ruled that it was potentially  unconstitutional.   So working with our local officials after hours of building up, hours  of waiting with the families, hours of press starting to arrive, hours  of TV coverage, and hours of protest, right when we were in the middle  of doing interviews, that is when the families were finally released,  after 7 hours of being questioned without water, without food, after a  20-hour flight.   You could not have scripted this to make the point of how misguided  this ban was than what happened. Right in front of TV cameras from  across central Florida, first, the two parents came down--parents of a  citizen who hadn't seen his parents in over 5 years.   The scene was traumatic: crying, hugs, and welcomed by cameras  wondering what had happened to these two individuals. These were simply  two citizens of Iraq trying to come over to visit their son, who had  already been given visas to come on over.   A few minutes later, our constituent finally arrived as well. She  also had been held for 8 hours without water, without food, after a 20- hour flight, and a barrage of questions.   After that, we saw public opinion change sharply in central Florida  as people saw these were the alleged people that were getting extreme  vetting: people who were visiting their son in central Florida,  longtime residents, who only had productive lives in central Florida.   A few weeks later, we had the deportation force memo come down. I was  shocked. We sent out letters to our sheriffs, we sent out letters to  our schools, asking if they were planning on participating in this  deportation force that President Trump had called upon to help  implement and enforce our immigration laws.   We called immediately a round table, where we invited immigrant  groups, we invited law enforcement groups, and so many others to talk  about the issues that were happening.   Two of my three sheriffs immediately said they weren't planning on  participating, that this was a Federal issue. A third ended up going  from fully participating to, a day later, walking back that position,  to just picking up folks who had been accused of violent felonies.   Then our schools responded very quickly after they were posed with a  scenario--a situation that was going down the very same day: a citizen,  a young woman of Mexican descent, whose parents were also legal  immigrants, was asked in front of their classmates about her status.   Afterwards, there were a lot of finger-pointing and excuses that  these were questions that were being levied to determine whether she  needed to participate in the ESEA program. But at that moment, it was  just more of this anti-immigrant rhetoric that was coming out of so  many areas in central Florida.   But like that incident, which was covered at length, minds and hearts  changed in central Florida. There was an apology given to this young  woman who was a citizen, and they changed the policy so that no one  would be asked about immigration status in front of their peers, even  if it was for something as harmless as the ESEA program.   With our sheriffs clarifying their policies to not join this DHS call  for deportation force, we were proud once again to have an inclusive  society in central Florida where we welcome everybody. We are such an  international community, home to the best theme parks in the world, a  world-class convention center and hotels, and we welcome everybody from  across the globe.   Then, in addition, I just received a letter from a constituent. Her  daughter had grown up, gotten a job, fallen in love, and had a bright  future ahead of her. But she worried because her daughter's boyfriend  potentially could be deported because he is on an H-1 visa.   These types of policies breaking up families don't serve any interest  in helping people pursue the American Dream and don't serve any  interest in protecting our economy and protecting growth in central  Florida, where we have such a large cattle industry and where we have  such a large citrus industry.   Finally, we have so many DREAMers, young students, who live in  central Florida, who are working and striving, rising up in our  society, and helping people along the way, immigrants who potentially  could be one of 40 percent of creators of Fortune 500 companies that  have been created here in America, one of the 65,000 servicemen and - women who are immigrants, who serve in our United States military. And  we find that, with every 100 immigrants, we are creating 120 new jobs  because our country has been founded and created on growth and  equality.                                time  1745    So I would like to see a few things happen, things that I believe  Democrats and Republicans can agree on. First, let's make sure to  ratify the DREAMer program, the Deferred Action program. You have  bipartisan cosponsorship for this bill. This is something we could get  done, especially for  [[Page H4693]]  our veterans and those serving in our U.S. military.   In addition, I believe that we need to relook at the H-1 visa  program, the farmworker program. We need to acknowledge the reality  that we have had for the last 150 years of agriculture here in the  United States, which is that we rely on many of our immigrants coming  from Mexico and Central and South America to help with our agriculture.  This has been going on for over a century.   What we can do is simply go from a 1-year to maybe a 3-year or 5-year  program. I know our immigrants' rights community would support it. I  know our agriculture communities would support it; and we wouldn't have  people unwittingly not getting back to their country of origin after  the 1-year visa expires, when they just want to go back and come back  again to help out as seasonal labor.   Then thirdly, there is an arbitrary cap on highly skilled workers  here in this country. We train them in Ivy League schools, in brilliant  schools in Texas, California, Florida, and across this Nation. And  then, because of an arbitrary cap that no one wants to change because  of the hot-button issue of immigration, then we send them on their way,  back to their countries of origin, rather than keep them here and  harness their talent for the future of our economy.   Canada has even got word of this and welcomes these folks. When they  realize their visas are up, they beg them to come to Canada to help  start new businesses.   So these are some of the ideas that we can fix, that we could all  agree on, that both parties can agree on. And of course, in the end, we  need a comprehensive immigration reform. But, in the meantime, let's  get some things done that we all agree on and move our country forward.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Hawaii, one of the most  beautiful States of the Union, for her leadership.
