 Mr. Speaker, Biden and House Democrats  inherited a strong economy from President Donald Trump that worked for  American families.   Unfortunately, under a Federal Government controlled by Democrats,  inflation is at a 40-year high, illegal aliens are crossing the  southern border at record numbers, and strategic oil reserves are at  the lowest level since 1984, just to name a few of the serious  challenges facing the country.   Now, through the democratic process, voters supported a Republican  majority led by Kevin McCarthy to the House of Representatives which  will promote positive change.   House Republicans will immediately produce legislation reflecting the  commitment to America. Republicans are focused on: a Nation that is  safe; an economy that is strong; a future built on freedom; a  government accountable to the people.   In conclusion, God bless our troops. We will never forget September  the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Congratulations, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel.                            ____________________
