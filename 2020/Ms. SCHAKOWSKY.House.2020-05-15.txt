 Mr. Speaker, at least 84,000 people have died in the  United States from COVID-19, and almost 40 percent of those deaths are  nursing home residents and the valiant workers in those nursing homes.   We can and we must do better. The HEROES Act includes $150 million  for strike teams in nursing homes struggling with outbreaks, requires  public reporting of cases and deaths and PPE availability and testing  in nursing homes, prioritizes testing for older Americans.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
