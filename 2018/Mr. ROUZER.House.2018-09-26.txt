 Mr. Speaker, as everyone knows, southeastern North  Carolina has experienced one of the most devastating hurricanes to hit  our State in recent memory.   The eye of Hurricane Florence made landfall in Wrightsville Beach,  North Carolina, and then proceeded to slow walk down the coast before  turning inland, resulting in historic flooding, massive power outages,  and devastating destruction to homes, businesses, and farms. Sadly,  this storm has taken the lives of at least 35 North Carolinians to  date.   What has transpired in my district is truly heartbreaking. But in the  face of diversity, we have come together stronger than ever.   I want to make special mention and thank all the first responders;  linemen; emergency, military, and medical personnel; as well as the  elected officials at all levels, local business leaders, the news  media, and all the countless numbers of citizens who are volunteering  to help our communities by opening their hearts and wallets to those  who need it.   I also thank President Trump and his administration for their rapid  response and commitment to helping all those who have been affected.  Working together, we will build our communities back stronger than  ever, make no mistake about it.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman here, the  ranking member, and so many others who have worked so hard on this  legislation, which, I might add, could not be more timely for the State  of North Carolina.   I want to thank our leadership team in the House and so many who have  worked with me and the North Carolina delegation to include the  disaster relief funding specific to Hurricane Florence. This is a  critical first step of additional support from this body and Congress  as a whole, and I also want to commend my colleagues Senator Burr and  Senator Tillis on the other side of the Capitol for all their great  work to get us to this point today as well.
