 Madam Chair, I thank the chairman, Bruce Westerman, for  his work.   Madam Chair, the chairman mentioned something about our last speaker  from Pennsylvania. I am a little concerned. Maybe he didn't have time  to read the whole bill because the bill he described is not the bill  that is before us.   He said somehow this would harm the environment. He was concerned  about climate. If this bill passes, global emissions will be reduced.  The chairman pointed out that the gentleman before, from the other side  of the aisle, from Pennsylvania was criticizing this bill and he talked  about the natural gas. I am not sure if the gentleman on the other side  of the aisle has done any research or if he knows that American natural  gas is 41 percent cleaner than Russian natural gas.   It is an interesting little fact. If we had replaced for 1 year just  Russian natural gas to Europe, we would have reduced CO2  emissions by more than 200 million tons.   So, Madam Chair, it really begs the question: Who is the polluter?  Those who defend Russia and vote against this bill. It is interesting  the people opposing this bill, those I am hearing on the other side of  the aisle--China, Russia, and OPEC. It is interesting the friends you  keep.   Now, let's talk a little bit about this. If you go across this  country, Madam Chair, it costs too much to heat your home and fill up  your car. It cost less an administration ago.   Today, more than one-third of all Americans say they have skipped  buying food or medicine to pay an energy bill in the last 12 months. We  are going to have opportunity this week to make sure that they don't  have to do that again if you vote ``yes.'' This is neither affordable  nor sustainable.   In response, President Biden has paid lip service to the need of more  energy production, but this is a public relations stunt. Almost every  one of his policies involves penalizing America and empowering China.   Now, here are the facts: For years, President Biden and Democrats  have attacked energy producers, blocked new leases on Federal land, and  ground the permitting process to a halt. Their so-called Inflation  Reduction Act included a natural gas tax, a $27 billion climate slush  fund.   The gentleman on the other side of the aisle from Pennsylvania, he  supported taxing the natural gas that is  [[Page H1494]]  produced in his State and creating a slush fund.   Meanwhile, in my home State of California, burdensome environmental  laws have led to recurring blackouts and more red tape that raises  costs for everything. Rather than increasing production and providing  good-paying jobs, California imported more than half of its oil from  Ecuador in recent years.   The interesting fact here is, when the Democrats took control of  California under Governor Gavin Newsom, he reduced the amount of oil  produced in California by 20 percent. That was 80,000 barrels a day.  That doesn't mean California used 80,000 less barrels; it meant  California started paying Putin for 50,000 barrels. They get the  majority of their oil from Ecuador, from the Amazon.   Instead of producing it in an environmentally sound way in  California, we are harming the environment. That is exactly what this  bill is able to do--lower global emissions, lower the price of energy,  and make the world more secure and safe, because then Putin and Russia  is not controlling Europe.   Democrats have sent a clear message about their priorities. They are  the party of $5 gas, subsidizing Communist China and the never-ending  dependence on foreign dictators for minerals we have in America.   It was only a few short years ago where America produced more of the  critical minerals than China, but as the Democrats would shut down  leases, make it harder to open new mines, they moved it to other parts  of the world, and not in an environmentally sound way, but by  empowering China, making them stronger, and making the price in America  higher.   Luckily, Congress has the opportunity to change the behavior of  Washington by passing the Lower Energy Costs Act. Every Member of this  chamber should support it. I understand why Russia and China oppose  lower energy costs for America and making America stronger, but I don't  understand why Members in this Congress would stand with China and  Russia against America.   The Lower Energy Costs Act does two important things: One, it  restores American energy leadership by repealing unnecessary taxes and  overregulation on American energy producers so we can lead the world in  providing clean, affordable energy.   Two, it makes it easier to build things in America. For example, this  bill includes a 2-year time limit on environmental impact statements.  It also streamlines the process for lawsuits so that activists can't  use the courts to delay projects for years.   Ninety years ago, American workers built the Empire State Building in  400 days. That is 13 months. These days, however, even repairing  existing structures, just like Lake Isabella Dam in my district, has  taken 18 years, and that was only because we were lucky in pushing for  it.   That is exactly how the Big Government under the Biden administration  wants the system to work. Every time we need a pipeline, a road, or a  dam, it gets held up on an average of 5 to 7 years and adds millions of  dollars in costs for the project to comply with Washington's permitting  process.                                time  1530    It is too long. It is unaffordable. It is not based on science. It is  holding us back. It is time we speed up the time it takes for us to  build all kinds of things in America. We could streamline permitting,  stop abusive lawsuits, protect the environment, and, importantly, lower  the price of energy.   This is why the Lower Energy Costs Act is H.R. 1. It signals how  important the bill truly is.   Madam Chair, when the Democrats were in the majority, do you know  what their H.R. 1 bill was? Election. Why? They wanted to change the  election law to try to guarantee their right to be reelected. You see,  they looked after themselves.   When Republicans took the majority, our H.R. 1 is about lowering  energy costs for all Americans. We think it is important to serve  others, not yourself.   I get permitting reform isn't for everyone. If you like paying more  at the pump, you don't want to make it faster for American workers to  build more pipelines. If you are China, you would rather America sit  back and let others lead. If you are a bureaucrat, maybe you really do  enjoy reading the 600-page environmental impact studies.   The rest of America wants lower prices, more cash in their hands,  more good-paying jobs in America, and rules that are good for the  environment. That is exactly what the Lower Energy Costs Act does.   Madam Chair, America has the potential to become a true energy  superpower. God has blessed us with abundant energy, and we shouldn't  have to depend on other countries for our future. In fact, we should  make the world dependent on us for energy. The world would be cleaner  and safer, and America would be better off.   If you want to have a responsible energy policy where America  produces more energy, pays less for a gallon of gas, and never again  bows to foreign dictators, vote ``yes'' on the Lower Energy Costs Act.   Three things will happen when this bill becomes law.   Your energy costs will be reduced. You will have more cash to take  care of your family, to pay for your medicine, to take your family on  vacation.   It will reduce global emissions, so environmentally, the world will  be a better place.   It will make the world a safer place, so no longer does America pay  Putin for dirtier oil or gas, so no longer does China control other  nations because they control the critical minerals that America will  not produce. No longer will we watch, as we watched in the 1930s,  countries bound together to create an axis of power.   We have now watched China enter the Middle East to bring Saudi Arabia  and Iran together. That used to be the role of the American President  at Camp David. It is no longer.   We do not want to watch our President travel to the Middle East to  beg to produce something more when America can produce it here in an  environmentally sound way.   Madam Chair, I know why Russia and China fight this bill so hard. I  do not understand why those on the other side of the aisle join with  Russia and China. I ask them to join with Americans and make America  safe and environmentally sound and the world a more secure place.
