 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3043, the  Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017.   Mr. Chairman, while Members on both sides of the aisle support  hydropower, unfortunately, the bill before us today is deeply flawed  and will not modernize or improve the hydropower licensing process.  Instead, Mr. Chairman, H.R. 3043 would place private profits above the  public interest by giving priority of our public waterways to industry  in order to generate power and profits over and above the rights and  the interests of Native Tribes or farmers or fishermen, boaters, and  other stakeholders who also rely on these public rivers and streams.   Mr. Chairman, it is very important for us to remember that  hydroelectric licenses can span between 30 and 50 years, and, under  existing law, a license holder can be granted automatic yearly  extensions in perpetuity without even having to reapply.   Mr. Chairman, this issue is far too important for us not to get it  right this time. And what does H.R. 3043 actually do?   This bill will make the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC,  the lead agency over the licensing process and will require Native  Tribes, the States, and other Federal resource agencies to pay  deference to the Commission, even in areas where FERC has absolutely no  expertise or statutory authority, including on issues regarding  agricultural water use, drinking water protection, fisheries  management, and recreational river use. How absurd, Mr. Chairman.   Additionally, Mr. Chairman, H.R. 3043 would expand and alter the  trial-type hearing provisions on the Federal Power Act, essentially  rigging the process in favor of industry by providing multiple new  entry points to challenge conditions designed by Federal resource  agencies.   Mr. Chairman, the threat of these timely and costly hearings may be  used to coerce agencies to propose weaker conditions, and, at the same  time, this bill also shifts the venue for these hearings to FERC, which  is another very obvious handout and handover to industry.   Mr. Chairman, in testimony before the Energy and Commerce Committee,  we heard, repeatedly, that a major  [[Page H8616]]  cause for licensing delays was due to incomplete applications that do  not include all the pertinent information that is necessary to issue a  decision.   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 3043 does nothing, absolutely nothing, to address  this very, very serious issue. In fact, this bill will implement strict  timelines on Federal resource agencies, States, and Tribes, but does  not require applicants to submit all of their information to these  agencies before the clock actually starts ticking.   Mr. Chairman, FERC, itself, the very agency that will be charged with  implementing this grossly bad bill, FERC, itself, disputed claims that  this bill would streamline the licensing process, noting that the  legislation ``could increase the complexity and the length of the  licensing process.'' These are FERC's words, FERC's words before the  committee.   Mr. Chairman, we cannot allow hydropower facilities to claim a  monopoly over our public waterways without mitigating the negative  impacts of these facilities on others who rely on these resources and  without, at the same time, without complying with modern environmental  laws.   H.R. 3043, Mr. Chairman, is opposed by States, opposed by the Native  Tribes, opposed by the outdoor recreation industry and by more than 150  national and local environmental organizations.   Mr. Chairman, it is for all of these reasons that I, too, stand in  concert and side by side with Native Tribes, the outdoor recreation  industry, and the other 150 national and local environmental  organizations. It is for these reasons that I, too, must oppose this  bill, and I urge all of my colleagues to do the same.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), from the State that made such  a significant and giant step last night to making our Nation a better  nation, the ranking member of the full committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes), a very important member of the committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Tonko).  [[Page H8619]]         Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Garamendi).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ruiz).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Costa).    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to how much time is remaining  on both sides.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record letters from Confederated Tribes  and Bands of the Yakama Nation, Puyallup Tribe of Indians, Snoqualmie  Tribe, Skokomish Indian Tribe, and a copy of the resolution passed in  October 2017 by The National Congress of American Indians opposing the  proposed amendments to the Federal Power Act.                                             Confederated Tribes and                                      Bands of the Yakama Nation,                                    Toppenish, WA, November 7, 2017.      Re Hydro legislation still bad for Indian Tribes, States and           Users of Public Waterways.       Hon. Paul Ryan, Speaker,      Hon. Nancy Pelosi, Minority Leader,      Honorable Members of the House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan, Minority Leader Pelosi and Honorable       Members of Congress: Yesterday, when the Rules Committee       discussed HR 3043, the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of       2017, a number of members of the committee including Chairman       Sessions, Congressman Cole, Congressman Newhouse, Congressman       McGovern, Congresswoman Cheney as well as the Chairman Walden       and Ranking Subcommittee Member Rush (who were testifying),       all stressed the importance of ensuring that Indian tribes       have their treaty rights and natural resources protected by       any actions of the Congress relative to hydropower reform. We       greatly appreciate the concerns of these members and the       amount of time they spent discussing tribes and dam       relicensing. I think many of them were aware of the degree to       which the placement of dams has negatively affected a number       of reservations, flooding some and damaging salmon runs at       others. While there was universal agreement that the rights       of tribes and states must be protected, there was not       agreement on whether HR 3043 accomplishes that laudable       intent. I must tell you that the bill does not do so.        First understand what the Federal Power Act (FPA) now says.        Under provisions that have been in effect for decades,       state governments, pursuant to the Clean Water Act, are able       to set water quality standards at hydro dams. Such conditions       are mandatory. Allowing states to establish water quality       standards, a key aspect of Federalism that many in Congress       have always fought for, was a lynchpin of the grand bargain       reached when the Clean Water Act became law. While Federalism       has not really benefitted Indian tribes, we are surprised       that the Congress would weaken the ability of states to       protect the public in this fashion. We hope you will read       what many states have said in letters to the Committee, i.e.,       HR 3043 weakens their ability to ensure their standards are       met during the licensing process. Letters of this nature have       come from entities as varied as the Western Governors       Association and the Southern States Energy Board.        Also under the longstanding language of Section 4(e) of the       FPA, Cabinet Secretaries with authority over ``federal       reservations'' are directed to ensure that a proposed hydro       project doesn't negatively affect a reservation or interfere       with its congressionally designated use. These include all       lands and marine reserves in the Federal estate from Indian       reservations, to National Forests to Wildlife Refuges.       Section 18 of the FPA deals with the establishment or       modification of fishways to ensure fish can pass over these       dams. The Secretaries of Commerce (for NMFS) and Interior       (for USFWS) deal with fish passage and the Secretaries of       Interior (for BIA, BLM, USFWS and NPS) and Agriculture (for       USFS) deal with protecting federal reservations. They have       the authority to propose mandatory conditions on hydro dams       to ensure their operation protects these federal resources       that belong to all Americans.        The legislation weakens the conditioning authority for       protecting state water quality, for fishways and for federal       reservations by transferring significant decision-making       authority to FERC. Under the bill, FERC and the license       applicant can challenge the necessity of a condition and have       that challenge heard via a trial-type hearing only at FERC       before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) at that agency.       Under present law, decisions such as these are heard by ALJs       in the agency making the recommendation, where the expertise       resides. This provision in the bill is legislating forum       shopping and directing that the decision be made before an       entity whose expertise is in areas such as energy markets and       safety at power plants. FERC and its ALJs have no expertise       relative to Indian treaty rights or the Federal Land Policy       and Management Act among many bedrock laws and FERC testified       before the Committee that they do not want to be given this       newfound authority. While having trial-type hearings at FERC       and authorizing FERC to set all manner of schedules in the       permitting process will certainly create countless billable       hours for attorneys representing license applicants, it will       do nothing to protect the interest of Indian tribes or the       public at large, and as stated above, is directly contrary to       state authority under the Clean Water Act and Secretarial       authority now found in the Federal Power Act.        Yesterday we heard that this process will expedite       licensing but if that is the goal then wouldn't it make sense       to determine when an application for a license is complete?       Tribes repeatedly asked the hydropower industry to clarify       that matter in the bill but they refused. Why? Existing       hydropower dam licenses were issued decades ago before any       environmental statutes were on the books and many of those       dams are fish killers. Under the present law, when a license       expires the operator can automatically get annual extensions       allowing it to operate under 30-50 year old standards. These       extensions can go on for year after year with the operator       not having to spend any money to mitigate the damage to fish       or other resources. This is more than ironic considering that       the hydropower industry is telling Congress that they need       the legislation to ensure certainty and time frames in the       relicensing process. Additionally, the bill is drafted in       such a fashion that FERC can set schedules that are so       abbreviated that Tribes, Cabinet Secretaries or States who       wish to comment and perhaps undertake a fishery study when       necessary may not have the time to properly prepare suggested       or mandatory operating conditions. It is noteworthy that FERC       told the Committee that they don't see the legislation       actually streamlining the application process. Also, we       checked today and could find no tribes in support of this       bill.  [[Page H8622]]         We believe the Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute       (AINS) incorporates much of what the majority proposed in HR       3043 while incorporating many changes that are reflective of       the input that the Committee received from states and tribes       who took the time to relay views and concerns to the       Committee. A key part is the requirement for a negotiated       rule-making to improve and expedite the hydro licensing       process by bringing in states, local governments,       stakeholders and tribes to FERC to develop a process that       will enable FERC to make decisions on license applications       within a maximum of three years. We urge you to vote for the       AINS. Without such changes it is highly unlikely that the       bill will make it through the Senate. Thank you for       considering our views.            Sincerely,                                                     Jode L. Goudy,      Tribal Council Chairman.                                   ____                                        Puyallup Tribe of Indians,                                         Tacoma, WA, August 9, 2017.      Re Hydropower Policy Modernization Act, H.R. 3043.       Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Energy and Commerce Committee, Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Ranking Member, Energy and Commerce Committee, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone: I write to       express the Puyallup Tribe's strong objections to the       amendments to the Federal Power Act that are now being       considered as part of the Hydropower Policy Modernization       Act, H.R. 3043.        First, the bill would give FERC, an agency with no relevant       experience or capacity, the responsibility for determining       the scope of environmental review that Interior, Commerce,       States and even Tribes should undertake.        Second, H.R. 3043 would upset the careful balance that now       exists under federal law and let FERC set the timeline on       case-by-case basis for agencies to impose mandatory 4(e)       conditions and other requirements, including Section 18       (fishways) and Clean Water Act permits. The consideration of       hydropower licenses is a complicated process that must       consider the impact of a project on watersheds and numerous       species of fish and wildlife before giving operators 50-year       licenses to take power from these ecosystems. It takes time       to do the necessary studies to determine what types of       conditions can best protect these watersheds, including       sensitive fisheries habitat, and the resources not only for       Treaty-reserved Indian Reservations and resources, but also       for the multiple users of these watersheds, including       recreation, commercial fishing, and agriculture. If FERC's       past actions are any guidance, FERC will impose unrealistic       deadlines that the agencies will not meet. This bill will       return the Nation back to a time when hydropower projects       flooded Indian lands, extirpated entire species of salmon,       and destroyed critical cultural resources.        Third, this bill would allow FERC for the first time to       make a determination that a mandatory condition is       inconsistent with the Federal Power Act. This would undermine       the Supreme Court's decision in Escondido Mut. Water Co. v.       La Jolla Band of Mission Indians, 466 U.S. 765 (1984), which       held that the FPA provides no authority to FERC to impose       restrictions on the 4(e) conditions submitted by the       Secretary of Interior. The current process affords the       hydropower industry ample opportunity to consider and respond       to potential Sections 4(e), 18, and Clean Water Act       conditions. Hydropower licensees can (and in fact do)       actively participate in the process by which these conditions       are deliberated and set. And while these conditions are not       subject to modification by FERC, they are subject to judicial       review, and FERC is free to express its disagreement with the       conditions, so that FERC's views can also be considered by       the courts.        Finally, the bill requires the Agency imposing these       conditions to prepare a written statement that the Agency       gave equal consideration to power generating interests in       issuing its 4(e) conditions. Currently, if a hydroelectric       project is located on federal lands, including Indian       Reservations, the only consideration the Secretary has is to       impose conditions that protect those reservations. There is       no consideration of other interests. This has been the law       for almost ninety years.        We urge you to continue to work with Tribes and other       stakeholders to improve the hydropower licensing process for       all interests and not simply for the industry.            Sincerely,                                                    Bill Sterud,                                                           Chairman,      Puyallup Tribal Council.                                   ____                                                 Snoqualmie Tribe,                                                      June 21, 2017.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington,           DC.        Dear Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone: On behalf       of the Snoqualmie Indian Tribe, we write to express our       continued concerns regarding proposed changes to the federal       hydropower licensing approval process. The proposed changes       would abrogate the federal government's overarching trust       responsibility to Indian tribes and its ability to uphold       tribal treaty rights. Our Tribe is particularly concerned       that current legislative reform efforts to consolidate       hydropower approval authority within the Federal Energy       Regulatory Commission (FERC) unduly favor the interests of       private industry at the expense of tribes, local and state       governments, natural resources, and local citizens. As our       trustee, we urge you to ensure that any hydropower       legislation passed out of the Committee will only strengthen       Tribes' ability to give input on hydropower licensing       decisions at hydropower facilities.        The Snoqualmie Tribe is adamantly opposed to legislative       reforms efforts that seek to undermine current mechanisms       that ensure adequate consideration of the effects of a       proposed hydropower project on affected Indian lands and       natural resources. In particular, the proposed changes to       Sec. Sec. 4(e) and 18 of the Federal Power Act and Sec. 401       of the Clean Water Act would enable FERC to disregard       mandatory conditions imposed by federal and state land       management agencies. Disregarding the established expertise       and mission of such agencies to evaluate and mitigate impacts       to Indian lands and natural resources directly undermines the       federal government's ability to fulfill its trust and treaty       obligations to Indian tribes. For example, Sec. Sec. 34 and       37 of the draft legislation would allow FERC to effectively       waive conditions necessary to implement the Northwest Power       Act, Endangered Species Act, or the Clean Water Act if a       state, tribe, or federal agency cannot meet a FERC deadline.       Additionally, the proposed schedule of 120 days to complete       all ``federal authorizations'' is unworkable in practice and       will inevitably lead to such waivers.        It is imperative that any legislative reforms to the       hydropower permitting process adequately consider and       mitigate the impacts to Indian lands, Tribal sacred sites,       and natural resources. Historically, American Indian tribes       have experienced disproportionate negative effects when dams,       including hydroelectric projects, were approved without       adequate tribal consultation or consideration of the effects       on surrounding natural resources. For example, in the past,       hydropower dams have flooded Indian reservations resulting in       the permanent loss or damage to Tribal lands and sacred       sites.        Given the Snoqualmie Tribe is a signatory to the Treaty of       Point Elliot of 1855, the federal government has an       enforceable fiduciary obligation to act as trustee on the       Tribe's behalf. Of critical significance to our people is       Snoqualmie Falls, a 268-foot waterfall that is the place of       our creation history and our most sacred site. The Falls are       an essential part of our cultural and religious practices       where we pray, conduct sacred ceremonies, and traditionally       buried our dead. Our Tribe is all too familiar with the       negative impacts of inadequately planned hydroelectric dams       on our culture, lands, and very way of life. For more than       100 years, Snoqualmie Falls has been hampered by the       diversion of its water for a hydroelectric dam that       significantly reduces the strong flow of water and the mists       coming from the Falls. Without these, our religious practices       are severely limited and we cannot fully engage in our       cultural heritage.        The current draft hydropower reform legislation does not       appropriately balance various stakeholders' interests and,       instead, prioritizes private industry interests above the       federal governments' responsibility as trustee to Tribes.       Accordingly, we urge the Committee to ensure that legislation       passed out of the Committee strengthens Tribes' ability to       give input on hydropower decisions.        Thank you for your consideration on this very important       religious and cultural issue to our Tribe. We look forward to       working with the Committee to ensure any hydropower reform       efforts are suitably tailored to uphold the federal       government's trust responsibility to Indian peoples and       protect tribal treaty rights.            Sincerely,      Snoqualmie Tribal Council.                                   ____                                           Skokomish Indian Tribe,                                Skokomish Nation, WA, June 21, 2017.      Re Proposed Amendments to the Federal Power Act.       Hon. Fred Upton,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Upton and Ranking Member Pallone: I write to       again express the Skokomish Tribe's strong objections to the       amendments to the Federal Power Act that are now being       considered by the House Energy and Commerce Committee.        If this bill is enacted as approved by the Committee, it       would represent one of the most significant roll backs of the       federal trust responsibility since termination. For more than       ninety years the Federal Power Act directed Interior and       other land management agencies to impose conditions on       hydroelectric projects to protect federal lands including       federal Indian Reservations and Treaty protected resources.       However, in the first forty years, the federal land       management agencies largely ignored this responsibility. As a       consequence of this abdication to the Skokomish Tribe, our       Reservation and our resources paid a very high price.  [[Page H8623]]         Our story is but one of many across Indian country. In the       1920s Tacoma City and Light received a license for the       Cushman Dam on the North Fork of the Skokomish River. The       entire flow of the North Fork of the Skokomish River was       diverted from its channel and sent to a power house on Hood       Canal (a bay of the Puget Sound). The dewatering of the North       Fork completely destroyed a premier salmon run, with grievous       economic and cultural consequences for the Tribe. See       generally, City of Tacoma v. FERC, 460 F.3d 53, 62 (D.C. Cir.       2006); Skokomish Indian Tribe v. United States, 410 F.3d 506,       509-510 (9th Cir. 2005) (en banc revised). In terms of direct       impact on the Skokomish Reservation itself, the dewatering of       the North Fork resulted in an approximately 40% reduction in       the flow of the Skokomish River mainstem. This change in the       hydrology of the Skokomish River caused one-third of the       Reservation to be flooded. Skokomish v. United States, 410       F.3d at 509-510, see also id. at 521 (dissenting opinion of       Judge Graber). In short, this project almost completely       destroyed the Reservation and the fishery for which the       Reservation was established.        The original Cushman Dam license expired in 1974 and the       Skokomish Tribe spent significant time, energy and resources       to ensure that the United States would not once again       abdicate its responsibility to the Tribe and sought       conditions on the new license that would protect the       Skokomish Reservation. At every turn Tacoma and the       hydropower industry fought the Tribe. However, in 2006, the       Skokomish Tribe won the right for the Department of the       Interior to exercise its Federal Power Act 4(e) conditioning       authority to protect the Reservation and the Tribe. City of       Tacoma, Washington v. F.E.R.C., 460 F.3d 53, 59 (D.C. Cir.       2006) (``Cushman'')        As a result of this decision, the Cushman project is now       being operated in a manner meant to reverse the more than 80       years of damage to the Skokomish Reservation. These changes       are slow but, over time, there will be improvements to the       flow of the mainstem and flooding will lessen. Reservation       lands that are waterlogged and useless will be restored and       productive for the Tribe and our members again.        The bill now before the Committee would essentially reverse       the decision that my Tribe fought so hard for, and will let       FERC set the timeline for 4(e) mandatory conditions and other       conditions, including Section 18 (fishways) and Clean Water       Act Permits. The bill goes on to require the agency to       imposing these conditions to give equal weight to power       generating interests. Again, this would significantly       undermine the federal trust responsibility to my tribe and       others. If a hydroelectric project is located on Tribal       lands, then the only consideration the Secretary has is to       impose conditions that protect that Reservation. There is no       balance of other interests. This has been the law for almost       ninety years. The Tribe is at a loss for why Congress would       want to change this now.        Furthermore, the bill before the Committee seeks to have       FERC, an agency with no experience or capacity, the       responsibility for determining the scope of environmental       review that Interior, Commerce, States and even Tribes should       take.        A change to the Federal Power Act is not needed. First,       sections 4(e), 18 and the other related provisions of the       Federal Power Act, establish proper checks and balances in       the licensing process. While FERC is examining a broad range       of issues in connection with the license application or       renewal, the Interior Secretary can bring to bear Interior's       knowledge and expertise regarding the needs of Indian       country, the potential impact of the project on the Indian       reservation, and address measures to ensure the proper       protection of that reservation. Other sections of the Act       likewise establish appropriate checks and balances by       recognizing and giving effect to the responsibilities and       expertise that such other agencies have on natural resource       management--such as that provided by Interior's Fish &       Wildlife Service and the Department of Commerce on fisheries       and fish passage facilities as well as the vital and       longstanding authority exercised by States and Tribes in       setting water quality standards under the Clean Water Act.       While hydropower is clean energy, it is clean only because of       the important role that these other agencies, with the       necessary expertise, have in addressing terms and conditions       for hydropower licenses. FERC does not have the technical       capacity to make these decisions.        The current process affords the hydropower industry ample       opportunity to consider and respond to potential Section       4(e), 18 and Clean Water Act conditions. Hydropower licenses       can (and in fact do) actively participate in the process by       which these conditions are deliberated and set. And while       these conditions are not subject to modification by FERC,       they are subject to judicial review, and FERC is free to       express its disagreement with the conditions, so that FERC's       views can also be considered by the courts.        Finally, while the current process may take time to       complete necessary studies and vetting of potential       conditions, any delay in renewing licenses does not harm the       hydropower licensees. As a general matter, until the license       renewal process is completed, hydropower licenses are able to       operate under their existing licenses which, in our       experience, typically do not have many of the conditions       needed to protect Indian reservations or natural resources.        We urge you to oppose amendments to the Federal Power Act       that would undermine the federal trust responsibility to       protect Indian Reservations or that would alter the Interior       Secretary's authority under section 4(e), the provisions of       section 18, or the Clean Water Act.            Sincerely,      Charles ``Guy'' Miller.                                   ____                    National Congress of American Indians    The National Congress of American Indians Resolution No. MKE-17-005    title: to oppose proposed hydropower amendments to the federal power                                    act         Whereas, we, the members of the National Congress of       American Indians of the United States, invoking the divine       blessing of the Creator upon our efforts and purposes, in       order to preserve for ourselves and our descendants the       inherent sovereign rights of our Indian nations, rights       secured under Indian treaties and agreements with the United       States, and all other rights and benefits to which we are       entitled under the laws and Constitution of the United States       and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of       Indigenous Peoples, to enlighten the public toward a better       understanding of the Indian people, to preserve Indian       cultural values, and otherwise promote the health, safety and       welfare of the Indian people, do hereby establish and submit       the following resolution; and        Whereas, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI)       was established in 1944 and is the oldest and largest       national organization of American Indian and Alaska Native       tribal governments; and        Whereas, Indian Tribes are sovereigns that pre-date the       United States, with prior and treaty protected rights to       self-government and to our Indian and Alaska Native lands;       and        Whereas, the conservation and preservation of tribal land       and resources is a priority for all tribes and a critical       component of the federal trust responsibility; and        Whereas, fish are a sacred resource for many tribes; and        Whereas, the production of electricity through hydropower       dams includes impacts to water quality, waterways, wildlife,       recreation, livelihoods, customary and traditional       activities, and treaty resources within and outside Indian       and Alaska Native lands; and        Whereas, the impacts of hydropower projects located on       federal lands often extend far beyond the confines of the       specific lands on which the projects are sited; and        Whereas, some members of Congress and representatives from       the hydropower industry have proposed amendments to the       Federal Power Act that would (a) weaken the current       protections Indian tribes have through the Mandatory       Conditions requirements under Section 4(e) and Section 18 of       that Act, (b) roll back efforts to restore fish populations       through the requirement of fishways, and (c) unnecessarily       limit the available time and scientific information available       to federal agencies in deciding what Mandatory Conditions       should be included with a license; and        Whereas, these proposed amendments to the Federal Power Act       would not improve the federal hydropower licensing process,       which is an important source of protections for tribal lands       and resources, but rather weaken these critical protections.       Now therefore be it        Resolved, that the National Congress of American Indians       (NCAI), its leadership, and its executive staff shall call on       the U.S. Congress and the Administration to oppose all       proposed amendments to the hydropower provisions in the       Federal Power Act that would remove or lessen the protections       currently afforded tribal governments, tribal lands, inherent       reserved rights, treaty rights and other tribal resources       under the Federal Power Act; and be it further        Resolved, that this resolution shall be the policy of NCAI       until it is withdrawn or modified by subsequent resolution.                                certification         The foregoing resolution was adopted by the General       Assembly at the 2017 Annual Session of the National Congress       of American Indians, held at the Wisconsin Center in       Milwaukee, WI, Oct 15, 2017-Oct 20, 2017, with a quorum       present.      Jefferson Keel,        President.        Attest: Juana Majel Dixon, Recording Secretary.     Mr. Chair, the substitute amendment that we will consider  shortly provides Indian Tribes with authority to speak for themselves  with respect to the hydropower licensing process.   Currently, Mr. Chair, the agencies of the Departments of the Interior  and Commerce proposed conditions to protect Tribal reservations. If the  substitute is enacted, Tribes that have sufficient capacity can assume  responsibility for protecting their own reservations.                                time  1445    The Tribal authority provision is absolutely very important and long  overdue. As sovereign entities, Tribes have a status different from  that of States and Federal agencies. They should be negotiating on  their own behalf to protect their own interests.  [[Page H8624]]    Mr. Chair, hydropower projects, a number of which were designed and  built over the objections of Tribes, resulted in devastating losses of  Tribal lands and fisheries.   We can and must do better. Hydropower projects can be designed,  upgraded, and operated in ways that lower the environmental costs and  preserve other important uses of the river.   Current law and current regulations already provide for consultation  with Tribes. In fact, under the integrated license process, applicants  are required to consult with Tribes 5 years before the current license  expires if they plan to seek a renewed license.   The integrated license process was designed specifically for the more  complex, controversial hydropower projects, either new projects or  relicensing of existing projects.   Mr. Chair, many applicants, however, request and are allowed to  pursue their license under the traditional license process that  includes less opportunity for consultation. FERC should be denying some  of these requests, but each and every one of them are granted by FERC.   When this happens, controversial projects run into predictable  problems that bog down the license process. This is an administrative  change that FERC could make that would require no new legislation and  would improve the license process.   Mr. Chair, this bill does nothing--absolutely nothing--to speed up  this problem or fix the process that we have been discussing.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I include in the Record letters from: Vermont  Agency of Natural Resources, California State Water Resources Control  Board, Western Governors' Association, State of Washington Department  of Ecology, Environmental Council of the States, and Association of  State Wetland Managers.                                                   State of Vermont,                                     Agency of Natural Resources,                                 Montpelier, VT, September 12, 2017.      Re Comments in Opposition to Hydropower Policy Modernization           Act of 2017, H.R. 3043.       Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: The Vermont       Agency of Natural Resources (VTANR) would like to express       strong concerns over the proposed Hydropower Policy       Modernization Act of 2017, H.R. 3043. While VTANR supports       efforts to improve and streamline current hydroelectric       licensing processes, the Agency strongly opposes legislative       efforts to diminish States' ability to protect water quality.       Several provisions of H.R. 3043 would essential curtail the       State authority under Section 401 of the  [[Page H8625]]       federal Clean Water Act, effectively constraining State       agencies' ability to use their independent authority to set       license conditions, making it more difficult to protect       natural resources.        VTANR strenuously opposes provisions of H.R. 3043 that       eliminate or reduce States' delegated authority under Section       401 of the federal Clean Water Act to develop mandatory       licensing conditions protective of natural resources. State       agencies serve an essential role in the Federal Energy       Regulatory Commission (FERC) licensing process for       hydroelectric facilities. H.R. 3043 would designate FERC as       the lead agency over federal authorizations related to       applications of hydroelectric projects for a license, license       amendment, or exemptions. As the lead agency, FERC would       establish and control the timeline for licensing review and       process for hydroelectric projects. H.R. 3043 appears to give       FERC the authority to create a schedule reducing the time a       State would have to get necessary scientific studies       completed and reviewed to determine specific conditions       needed to protect water quality, as required under Section       401 of the federal Clean Water Act. This would effectively       permit FERC to license a facility before a thorough review of       the environmental impacts could be completed. Vermont uses       its Section 401 authority to issue water quality       certifications with conditions to ensure projects are built       and operated in a manner consistent with State environmental       laws and protective of the environment and public health.        In addition, a provision of H.R. 3043 provides applicants       with an opportunity to a trial-type hearing before a FERC       Administrative Law Judge whenever there is a dispute of       material fact. Under the provisions of H.R. 3043, the       decision of the FERC Administrative Law Judge would be final       and not subject to further administrative review. Currently,       conditions included in a Section 401 water quality       certification become mandatory license conditions and cannot       be altered or modified by FERC. Further matters of material       facts related to Section 401 water quality certifications for       hydroelectric facilities are heard at the State level by       courts or boards that are familiar with a State's water       quality standards and other environmental laws. The allowance       for the trial-type hearing before FERC could undermine the       States' authority granted under Section 401, making it more       challenging to protect water quality and natural resources.        Through decades of decisions, federal courts have affirmed       the authority of States to impose conditions in federal       licenses issued to hydroelectric projects under Section 401       of the Clean Water Act. These decisions recognize that States       have the primary responsibility to ensure State water quality       standards and other environmental laws are met. H.R. 3043       would undermine this authority by including a provision that       would allow FERC to seek resolution between it and States at       the federal level, elevating the dispute to the secretary       overseeing the federal statute. In the case of the federal       Clean Water Act, H.R. 3043 appears to allow FERC to negotiate       with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency       or Secretary of Army, who are responsible for Clean Water Act       on the federal level, to settle a dispute with between it and       a state, effectively cutting States out of the process.        Vermont's interest in protecting natural resources is as       important and relevant today as ever, particularly because a       large number of hydroelectric facilities in Vermont are       slated to begin the federal relicensing process over the next       five years. FERC issues licenses to hydroelectric projects       for a term of 30 to 50 years. As such, many of the projects       scheduled for relicensing will likely need significant       changes in operations to meet modern water quality standards       and to restore State water resources from impacts of project       operations. As drafted, H.R. 3043 would reduce VTANR       delegated authority under Section 401 of the federal Clean       Water Act, creating ways for project operators to circumvent       state regulations during the licensing process to allow them       to operate in a manner that would continue to degrade the       environment and resources of the State.        VTANR recognizes the importance of hydroelectric generation       in meeting renewable energy goals. We urge you to consider       how the federal process can be improved without undermining       the very checks and balances that have helped hydroelectric       generation be viewed as a sustainable and renewable energy       source.        We appreciate your consideration of these comments on H.R.       3043 and look forward to solutions that improve our energy       security and infrastructure while protecting the environment.            Sincerely,                                              Julia S. Moore, P.E.,      Secretary.                                   ____                                                    California State                                   Water Resources Control Board,                                       Sacramento, CA, May 17, 2017.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone:      comments in opposition to provisions of house of representatives  discussion drafts: (1) hydropower policy modernization act of 2017; (2)  promoting closed-loop pumped storage hydropower act; and (3) promoting          hydropower development at existing non-powered dams act         The California State Water Resources Control Board (State       Water Board) would like to express its concerns with the       following House of Representatives Legislative Discussion       Drafts: (1) Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017; (2)       Promoting Closed-Loop Pumped Storage Hydropower Act; and (3)       Promoting Hydropower Development at Existing Non-Powered Dams       Act (collectively Hydropower Discussion Drafts). While the       State Water Board supports the goals of energy infrastructure       modernization, it opposes several provisions as drafted       because the Hydropower Discussion Drafts would reduce or       eliminate essential protections for California's natural       resources.        The Hydropower Discussion Drafts would seriously impact the       mandatory conditioning authority of the State Water Board       under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, as well as similar       authorities of federal agencies. State and federal agencies       serve an essential role in the Federal Energy Regulatory       Commission's (Commission) hydropower licensing process. The       Hydropower Discussion Drafts designate the Commission as the       sole lead agency over federal authorizations related to an       application for a license, license amendment, or exemption       for a hydropower project. As the sole lead agency, the       Commission would establish and control the timeline for the       hydropower licensing process for all aspects of federal       authorization, including Section 401 of the Clean Water Act.       As such, the Commission could limit the State Water Board and       federal agencies' time to complete their respective actions       which could adversely impact the agencies' ability to comply       with necessary state and federal laws and may negatively       impact public and environmental health.        As noted in this letter, the State Water Board is       particularly concerned about provisions of the Hydropower       Discussion Drafts that would undermine states' authorities       under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. As former Chief       Justice Rehnquist observed, there has been a ``consistent       thread of purposeful and continued deference to state water       law by Congress.'' (California v. U.S. (1978) 438 U.S. 645,       653.) This ``cooperative federalism'' is epitomized by       Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which authorizes states       to set conditions to protect the waters of their states, and       provides that review of conditions of certification is in       state court, not by federal agencies. In so doing, Section       401 preserves both state authority and the integrity of state       procedures and state institutions in overseeing how state       agencies exercise that authority. Consistent with Congress'       usual respect for state rights in this area, this structure       must be preserved. The Hydropower Discussion Drafts       inappropriately place limitations on state rights in this       area by placing Section 401 of the Clean Water Act in the       definition of Federal Authorization and under the       Commission's jurisdiction.        The State Water Board recognizes the importance of       hydropower as a clean energy source that helps provide grid       reliability and supports the goal of promoting efficiencies       in the Commission's licensing of hydropower projects. To       promote such efficiencies, in 2013, the State Water Board       entered into a memorandum of understanding with the       Commission to coordinate pre-application procedures and       schedules between the two agencies. Since implementation, the       memorandum of understanding has improved coordination between       the State Water Board and the Commission, and is beginning to       streamline portions of the licensing process. The State Water       Board acknowledges that it has a pending backlog of water       quality certification applications, due in part to       California's recent drought, and we are committed to acting       upon these applications as expeditiously as possible. The       State Water Board opposes provisions of the Hydropower       Discussion Drafts because they may result in harm to       California's water quality and associated beneficial uses,       public lands, and fish and wildlife by removing key state and       federal authorities designed to protect the environment and       the public enjoyment of the environment. Specific comments       and concerns are provided in Attachment A. Key provisions of       the Hydropower Discussion Drafts are provided in Attachment B       for ease of reference in reviewing the State Water Board's       comments.        I appreciate your consideration of these comments and look       forward to solutions that improve our energy security and       infrastructure while protecting the environment.            Sincerely,                                                    Felicia Marcus,      Chair.                                   ____                                   Western Governors' Association,                                                        May 1, 2017.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Frank J. Pallone,      Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone: Western       Governors recognize the importance of renewable energy       sources, including hydropower, as critical components of an       all-of-the-above national energy portfolio. The West accounts       for nearly 70 percent of the nation's hydroelectric power       generation, and the Pacific  [[Page H8626]]       Northwest is the nation's largest hydropower-producing region       Western Governors support improving the efficiency of       existing hydropower systems and increasing the amount of       electricity generated from new, retrofitted, or relicensed       hydroelectric facilities.        States are vested with primary authority to manage water       within their borders, and they have the authority to develop,       use, control and distribute water resources within their       boundaries. As expressed in section B(1)(a) of WGA Policy       Resolution 2015-08, Water Resource Management in the West.        ``While the Western Governors acknowledge the important       role of federal laws such as the Clean Water Act, the       Endangered Species Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act,       nothing in any act of Congress or Executive Branch regulatory       action should be construed as affecting or intending to       affect states' primacy over the allocation and administration       of their water resources.''        Western Governors are concerned about provisions in Section       34, ``Hydropower Licensing and Process Improvement'' of the       proposed Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017.       Portions of the language included in the published discussion       draft of this proposal are identical to language of Subtitle       B, ``Hydropower Regulatory Modernization'' of the proposed       North American Energy Security and Infrastructure Act of 2015       (H.R. 8).        On July 18, 2016, Governor Steve Bullock and Governor       Dennis Daugaard provided correspondence (attached) to the       Committee, expressing the Western Governors' concerns over       the language included in Subtitle B of H.R. 8, which would       have designated the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission       (FERC) as lead agency fol all hydropower authorizations,       approvals, and requirements mandated by federal law,       including hydropower facility licenses and amendments, as       well as all permits, special use authorizations,       certifications, and opinions. The Governors requested that       this language be removed or amended so that existing state       hydropower licensing authorities are not replaced, or in any       way impeded, by FERC jurisdiction.        Western Governors request that the language in Section 34       of the proposed Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017       be removed or amended so that states' existing hydropower       licensing authorities are in no way usurped by FERC       jurisdiction. Thank you for your attention to this important       matter.            Sincerely,                                                  James D. Ogsbury,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                                State of Washington,                                           Department of Ecology,                                      Olympia, WA, November 3, 2017.      Re Hydropower Regulatory Modernization Act of 2017.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Greg Walden,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone: I am       writing to express my concerns with the Hydropower Regulatory       Modernization Act of 2017, H.R. 3043, which would amend the       Federal Power Act to modify certain requirements. The       Washington Department of Ecology (Ecology) supports the       ostensible intent of this bill to gain efficiency in the       licensing of hydropower projects. In addition, we support the       goal of improving the certainty and timeliness of the       hydropower licensing process. However, provisions in H.R.       3043 that modify the authorities of the Federal Energy       Regulatory Commission (FERC) would impede or invalidate       states' independent authority provided by Section 401 of the       Clean Water Act (CWA Sec. 401) to establish license       conditions that protect water quality.        Our residents and tribes harvest salmon from the Puget       Sound up through the Columbia River, and our farmers grow       hops in the Yakima River basin. They also depend on water as       a source of energy to power their homes and communities, and       our industries rely on abundant and consistent energy to       build aircraft in Everett, power data server farms in Quincy,       manufacture car bodies for electric vehicles in Moses Lake,       and process apples along the Wenatchee River basin. Balancing       the need for clean energy with the need for safe water       supplies begins with the proper management of water as a       resource, and it is one of the major focal points of this       legislation.        Decades of federal court decisions interpreting CWA       Sec. 401 have established the states' authority to require       conditions in FERC licenses that are necessary to protect       water quality. These decisions recognize and affirm the basic       principle of federalism embodied in the CWA that states have       a primary role and responsibility to ensure state water       quality standards are met.        Ecology implements the state's Water Pollution Control Act       (RCW 90.48). As the state water pollution control agency, we       are responsible for implementing federal water pollution       control laws and regulations, including state water quality       certifications required by CWA Sec. 401 for any federal       permit or license that result in a discharge to state waters.       Ecology has developed durable partnerships with the       hydropower industry in Washington State--the largest of any       state in the nation--and has a successful record of       accomplishment in expediting water quality certifications       that are incorporated as FERC license conditions.        In an effort to improve H.R. 3043, my team worked for       several weeks with two members of the National Hydropower       Association along with staff at the Chelan County Public       Utility District in Washington State. Our objective in these       discussions was to maintain the intent of this legislation       while also protecting states' authority provided in the CWA       Sec. 401. Although the group did not reach full consensus,       significant progress was made to put forth alternative       language that would remove ambiguity regarding FERC and state       authority. My team identified a number of changes in language       that are necessary to protect independent state authority to       condition and certify FERC licenses. If provided more time,       and engagement directly with your committee, I am confident       that all parties can reach a mutually-satisfactory policy.        Ecology appreciates Congress' effort to streamline the FERC       licensing process, however, the addition of SEC. 34(b)(2)       OTHER AGENCIES AND INDIAN TRIBES, would require states' water       quality certification process to follow a schedule under the       requirements of the FERC, rather than the schedule in CWA       Sec. 401. The timelines and independent state authorities       granted by CWA Sec. 401 must remain intact, as both are       essential for states to issue water quality certifications.       States must also retain the ability to practice a ``withdraw       and reapply'' process that has proven necessary for some       complex hydropower licenses. If FERC is provided authority to       oversee and set a timeline different than that provided under       CWA Sec. 401, it undermines states' ability to ensure       effectiveness and certainty for protection of water quality.        Meanwhile, SEC. 34. HYDROPOWER LICENSING AND PROCESS       IMPROVEMENTS (b) designates FERC as the lead agency for       federal authorizations related to a license application,       license amendment, or exemption for a hydropower license.       H.R. 3043 SEC. 34. HYDROPOWER LICENSING AND PROCESS       IMPROVEMENTS (d) also requires states to adhere to deadlines       established by FERC, effectively reducing the amount of time       a state would have to complete scientific studies necessary       to determine whether water quality standards and requirements       would be met in accordance with CWA Sec. 401. This will       likely create pressure on states to utilize existing       information (SEC 3 (b)) rather than new studies to make these       determinations.        In Washington State, work thus far to provide CWA Sec. 401       certifications for licensing of hydropower facilities have       been timely, responsive, efficient, and protective of the       state's water quality. While additional work remains, durable       partnerships and a strong track record form a solid       foundation to build upon.        In summary, Ecology opposes this bill in its current form       because:        FERC will have undue influence on the ability of states and       tribes to obtain environmental data and information via       studies that are necessary to write CWA Sec. 401       certifications to protect waters in their jurisdiction.        It would lock state and federal natural resource agencies       into a no-win situation. Agencies will be forced to make       regulatory decisions based on incomplete applications that       lack the necessary technical information, which would put       agencies at risk of missing new FERC deadlines resulting in       litigation.        We believe this bill provides enough ambiguity for       individuals to attempt to preempt state CWA Sec. 401       authority. The bill as written could result in legal       challenges and protracted litigation on how the extension of       FERC's authority conflicts with states' rights to protect       water quality and quantity.        Finally, Ecology views many elements of this modernization       bill as unnecessary. In July 2005, FERC restructured its       process and implementing the Integrated Licensing Process       (ILP) that effectively streamlined FERC's licensing process.       Over the course of 12 years, Washington State has provided       water quality certifications for 16 FERC issued licenses as       well as 10 license amendments. The ILP has proven to be a       predictable, efficient, and timely licensing process that       continues to ensure adequate resource protections. This bill       would eliminate the flexibility available in the current       system and return to a traditional approach that is less       responsive to environmental concerns and more susceptible to       litigation.        We urge that the provisions of H.R. 3043 that would have       the effect of curtailing state authority under CWA Sec. 401       be significantly improved or stricken from the bill.            Sincerely,                                                    Maia D. Bellon,                                                          Director.

Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members       and supporters nationwide, we are writing to urge you to       oppose H.R. 3043, the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act.       This bill is a devastating assault on our nation's rivers and       the people and wildlife that depend upon them. Its passage       would end 95 years of balance in hydropower licensing,       tipping the scales against taxpayers and in favor of huge       utilities.        Hydropower licenses are issued for up to 50 years. Many       hydropower facilities that are coming up for relicensing now       were first constructed before virtually all modern       environmental laws were in place. It is during relicensing       proceedings that the public gets the opportunity to ensure       that dam owners make the necessary changes to comply with       modern laws. The opportunity to mitigate for the damage to       the environment, while still providing reliable electricity,       only arises once in a generation or two.        The balance the Federal Power Act currently strikes between       power and non-power values has existed for almost a century.       Current law protects the public's right to enjoy its rivers,       a right which can and should be compatible with responsible       electricity production. However, H.R. 3043 upends that       balance. Simply put, the bill is a massive giveaway to       special interests at the expense of healthy rivers and the       fish, wildlife, and people that depend upon them. If H.R.       3043 passes, power company profits will go to the head of the       line, ahead of every other user.        We appreciate that the House Committee on Energy and       Commerce heard testimony from recreational and conservation       interests who raised serious concerns about its many       provisions. Unfortunately, the Committee  [[Page H8628]]       chose to make no changes to reflect the constructive       suggestions that the Hydropower Reform Coalition put forward       that would improve the licensing process while maintaining       environmental protections. The Committee also failed to       solicit testimony from states, tribes, and federal natural       resource agencies whose authorities will be usurped by the       Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) if H.R. 3043 is       enacted. You are now being asked to vote on a bill that no       state, tribe, or conservation organization publicly supports.       The bill under consideration today will only benefit power       companies at the expense of every other user of a waterway.        H.R. 3043 attempts to streamline the hydropower licensing       process by centralizing power and allowing FERC to set an       aggressive licensing schedule that all federal and state       agencies must adhere to throughout the licensing process.       There are no requirements that FERC or the licensee provide       the agencies with the information they deem necessary to       quickly and competently exercise their Clean Water Act or       Endangered Species Act authority. This creates a dynamic       where, unless every step of the process proceeds seamlessly,       agencies are faced with the impossible decision to either       exercise their authority without necessary information (which       exposes them to legal liability) or to fail to meet the       schedule. This change will constrain federal, state, and       tribal agencies use of their independent authorities and rush       decision making, potentially making it more difficult to       protect water quality, recover threatened and endangered       species, and manage tribal-trust resources and public lands.        Other provisions of H.R. 3043, such as the changes to the       Trial Type Hearing process for alternative conditions, the       requirement that federal natural resource agencies conduct       costly, wasteful and time consuming review of matters outside       of their scope of expertise and jurisdiction, and the       requirement that scientific decisions be made only by       political appointees in Washington, DC are all examples of       how H.R. 3043 tilts the balance toward the interests of       power companies.        In order to protect clean water, irrigation, meeting tribal       treaty and trust obligations, wildlife, recreational fishing,       commercial fishing, whitewater boating, water quality,       municipal water supply, fire safety, flood control, or any       other purpose other than generating power, we urge you to       vote NO on H.R. 3043.

Dear Representative: The National Wildlife Federation, with       over 6 million members and supporters and its affiliate       organizations from 51 states and territories across the       country, represents a broad diversity of political views,       mirroring the nation. Regardless of party affiliation, these       members want their families to be safe, their water to be       clean, and ecosystems to be healthy in order to support our       nation's wildlife. It is important, then, that any large-      scale energy project, including hydroelectric, uphold those       values as well. While NWF believes that the United States       should pursue a renewable energy future, the country should       do so while seeking to minimize harm to local ecosystems and       wildlife and gather input from those near hydroelectric       facility sites. This is especially important as hydropower is       not without environmental impacts, including greenhouse gases       released from reservoirs associated with dams. In order to       weigh all impacts as well as the benefits, proper review       processes should be followed and corners cannot be cut.       Because of these long-held standards, NWF opposes H.R. 3043,       the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017.        The National Wildlife Federation has long supported robust       environmental review processes. Federal and state governments       should approach projects with a genuine interest in       determining negative effects on the environment, wildlife,       and local communities. H.R. 3043 includes provisions that       place arbitrary deadlines on project reviews, even when it is       clear that a proper study will take longer. Unfortunately,       this bill would remove our experts in natural resources from       the review process and usurp states' rights to enforce their       own standards for hydropower projects. Additionally,       considerations of energy supply would be required alongside       protections for endangered species, fisheries, and cultural       sites, contradicting existing laws. If passed into law, H.R.       3043 would likely create confusion and litigation. We have       seen in the past how large-scale hydroelectric projects have       not always considered potential negative effects. We should       learn from our past mistakes, not repeat them.        While there was a hearing on this bill, only the Federal       Energy Regulatory Commission testified, leaving out important       voices. Among those voices left out were tribal leaders,       states, and local officials who will be required to abide by       these new rules. Not only does this legislation limit input       from those near proposed hydroelectric projects, but it also       does so for those who live near existing dams seeking a       permit renewal. This legislation would constrict the review       processes for dams approaching their 50-year review mark. It       is important to make sure that these projects, which were       built before our current rules were put in place, remain up       to the standards we set for human safety and minimal impact       to the environment, economically important fisheries, and       recreation sites.        In short, while this bill and its proponents claim to help       our nation move toward a more sustainable and climate-      friendly future, we need a system in place that can consider       our energy needs in addition to the economic, environmental       and cultural needs of our communities. Since climate change       is the most significant challenge of our time, we urge the       committee and supporters of this legislation to have a       transparent and robust discussion, not only of our energy       needs but also of potential impacts from hydropower such as       wildlife and greenhouse gases. For all of these reasons,       National Wildlife Federation recommends you oppose H.R. 3043.            Sincerely,                                                       Jim Lyon,                             Vice President for Conservation Policy,      National Wildlife Federation.                                   ____                                                 Outdoor Alliance,                                                   November 6, 2017.      Re H.R. 3043, Hydropower Policy Modernization Act.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: We are       writing to ask you to oppose H.R. 3043, the Hydropower Policy       Modernization Act. If enacted, this bill would have       significant negative impacts on outdoor recreation and its       associated local economic benefits and would remove       opportunities for meaningful local public involvement in       hydropower licensing.        Outdoor Alliance is a coalition of nine member-based       organizations representing the human powered outdoor       recreation community. The coalition includes Access Fund,       American Canoe Association, American Whitewater,       International Mountain Bicycling Association, Winter       Wildlands Alliance, The Mountaineers, the American Alpine       Club, the Mazamas, and Colorado Mountain Club and represents       the interests of the millions of Americans who climb, paddle,       mountain bike, and backcountry ski and snowshoe on our       nation's public lands, waters, and snowscapes.        Our members directly participate in licensing processes for       hydropower projects in partnership with state and federal       resource agencies. The authorities granted to federal       agencies under the Federal Power Act, Clean Water Act, and       Endangered Species Act have helped ensure that hydropower       operations balance our society's need for power with the       benefits of flowing rivers. These benefits include important       economic contributions generated through the outdoor       recreation economy, and outdoor recreation may be one benefit       of hydropower under certain circumstances.        Outdoor recreation powers a vast economic engine valued at       $887 billion annually with much of this activity focused       around water-based recreation, including rivers affected by  [[Page H8629]]       hydropower operations. The National Hydropower Association's       own website, which promotes the benefits of hydropower,       states that ``Swimming, boating, fishing, camping, skiing and       hiking are just some of the recreational activities that take       place year-round and across the country at sites developed       and supported by the hydropower industry.''        We are concerned that H.R. 3043 will severely limit the       ability of local communities to advocate for recreational       benefits in hydropower licensing. If passed, H.R. 3043 will       shift responsibilities away from states, federal land       managers with locally-based recreation staff, and affected       communities, and instead place exclusive authority within the       hands of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).       FERC is a regulatory agency with no local field staff,       frequently with only the ability to participate in one or two       site visits in all. As a result, FERC staff are unlikely to       have experience and familiarity with local resources and       values. The end result of H.R. 3043 would be outcomes that       are detrimental to outdoor recreation and local communities.        While hydropower provides certain benefits, it also always       comes with significant impacts. This legislation would upset       an important balance and the cooperative approach to       hydropower licensing that effectively ensures that the       interests of local communities and their interests in outdoor       recreation are represented. Outdoor Alliance finds the       hydropower provisions of H.R. 3043 to be deeply problematic,       and we oppose any effort to diminish the ability of citizens       and public resource agencies to ensure that hydropower       licenses include provisions to protect the public river       resources that are important to them.            Best regards,                                                  Louis Geltman,                                                    Policy Director,      Outdoor Alliance.                                   ____                                                  TROUT Unlimited,                                                   November 6, 2017.      Re Trout Unlimited opposes the ``Hydropower Policy           Modernization Act of 2017'' (H.R. 3043) and we urge           members of the House of Representatives to vote against           this legislation.        Dear Representative: H.R. 3043 is due for House floor       consideration this week. We urge you to reject the bill and       instead to develop a bill worthy of broad stakeholder       support.        Hydropower is an essential component of our nation's energy       mix. Hydropower produces energy with low hydrocarbon       emissions, but can and does cause massive impacts to       watershed health and fisheries habitats. Striking a balance       between power and nonpower values, such as fisheries habitat,       is essential.        To that end, the Federal Power Act assigns oversight and       conditioning roles for the natural resource agencies to       ensure adequate protections or conditions related to project       effects on underlying lands, waters and related resources.       These authorities, in particular sections 18 and 4e of the       Federal Power Act, and section 401 of the Clean Water Act,       contain some of the most useful fisheries conservation       provisions in state or federal statute and are critical to       minimize and mitigate impacts to trout and salmon habitats,       covering issues like fish passage, instream flow below the       project and water quality and quantity issues.        H.R. 3043 would significantly disrupt efforts to balance       power and nonpower values in the licensing process and for       all the wrong reasons. If the goal of the bill is to make the       licensing process more efficient and expeditious, Congress       should support the funding and information needs of the       resource agencies, not penalize or further constrain their       participation. H.R. 3043 instead would hamstring tribes,       states, and federal resource agencies from review and       conditioning of FERC licensed hydropower projects by imposing       overly restrictive timelines, adding new process hurdles for       debating agency requirements on applicants, and greatly       restricting the scope and basis on which resource agencies       can require conditions or investments to protect non-power       resources impacted by the project.        The harmful bill could not come at a worse time. Dozens of       projects coming up for relicensing soon. Many of them haven't       been reviewed since being originally licensed 30-50 years       ago. It is more imperative now than ever to ensure strong       review of these projects.        Instead of H.R. 3043 Congress should support smart process       improvements that will benefit applicants and operators while       supporting strong protections to balance nonpower values.       Smart improvements would include support for incremental       upgrades, promote ongoing investment and ongoing study during       the life of licenses so that we aren't starting from scratch       every 30 to 50 years. A smart approach would ensure that the       regulatory requirements for states, tribes and federal       resource agencies to permit and condition these projects is       fully supported early in the process to reduce conflict and       delay. H.R. 3043 misses these opportunities, focusing instead       placing arbitrary constraints on environmental review and       conditioning agency authorities that will result in increased       conflict during licensing.        As we have said a number of times before, Congress should       take adequate time to hear the views of the tribes, as well       as the state and federal resource agencies about existing       process hurdles and potential solutions before legislating       changes to hydropower project licensing procedures and       standards. Some in the industry blame delays and cost       overruns on agency inaction and bad decisions, yet the       committee has so far not called them to testify. If the       committee wants to have a thoughtful legislative process, it       needs to hear from the agencies who some claim to be the root       of the problem. Although the Energy and Commerce committee       and its subcommittee on Energy and Power held hearings on       this bill and related hydropower legislation, those hearings       did not include these constituencies. Again, we urge the       committee and the House to take the time to do the       deliberative process in the right way, and build broad       support for bipartisan legislation.        The most balanced and efficient way to bring new hydropower       online, is to ensure that the development is well-sited and       appropriately mitigated from the start and to support and       encourage early and often investment in evaluating and       improving operations over time.        This bill fails the test of carefully balancing power and       non-power values, such as trout and salmon fisheries and       river restoration. Specifically, we urge the House to support       and defend--and not weaken as this bill does--resource agency       authorities and mandates--including the Clean Water Act,       Endangered Species Act and Federal Power Act.        We urge you to vote against H.R. 3043.            Sincerely,                                                       Steve Moyer,      Vice President of Government Affairs.                                   ____                                                   November 7, 2017.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members       and supporters nationwide, we are writing to urge you to       oppose H.R. 3043, the Hydropower Policy Modernization Act.       This bill is a devastating assault on our nation's rivers and       the people and wildlife that depend upon them. Its passage       would end 95 years of balance in hydropower licensing,       tipping the scales against taxpayers and in favor of huge       utilities.        Hydropower licenses are issued for up to 50 years. Many       hydropower facilities that are coming up for relicensing now       were first constructed before virtually all modern       environmental laws were in place. It is during relicensing       proceedings that the public gets the opportunity to ensure       that dam owners make the necessary changes to comply with       modern laws. The opportunity to mitigate for the damage to       the environment, while still providing reliable electricity,       only arises once in a generation or two.        The balance the Federal Power Act currently strikes between       power and non-power values has existed for almost a century.       Current law protects the public's right to enjoy its rivers,       a right which can and should be compatible with responsible       electricity production. However, H.R. 3043 upends that       balance. Simply put, the bill is a massive giveaway to       special interests at the expense of healthy rivers and the       fish, wildlife, and people that depend upon them. If H.R.       3043 passes, power company profits will go to the head of the       line, ahead of every other user.        We appreciate that the House Committee on Energy and       Commerce heard testimony from recreational and conservation       interests who raised serious concerns about its many       provisions. Unfortunately, the Committee chose to make no       changes to reflect the constructive suggestions that the       Hydropower Reform Coalition put forward that would improve       the licensing process while maintaining environmental       protections. The Committee also failed to solicit testimony       from states, tribes, and federal natural resource agencies       whose authorities will be usurped by the Federal Energy       Regulatory Commission (FERC) if H.R. 3043 is enacted. You are       now being asked to vote on a bill that no state, tribe, or       conservation organization publicly supports. The bill under       consideration today will only benefit power companies at the       expense of every other user of a waterway.        H.R. 3043 attempts to streamline the hydropower licensing       process by centralizing power and allowing FERC to set an       aggressive licensing schedule that all federal and state       agencies must adhere to throughout the licensing process.       There are no requirements that FERC or the licensee provide       the agencies with the information they deem necessary to       quickly and competently exercise their Clean Water Act or       Endangered Species Act authority. This creates a dynamic       where, unless every step of the process proceeds seamlessly,       agencies are faced with the impossible decision to either       exercise their authority without necessary information (which       exposes them to legal liability) or to fail to meet the       schedule. This change will constrain federal, state, and       tribal agencies use of their independent authorities and rush       decision making, potentially making it more difficult to       protect water quality, recover threatened and endangered       species, and manage tribal-trust resources and public lands.        Other provisions of H.R. 3043, such as the changes to the       Trial Type Hearing process for alternative conditions, the       requirement that federal natural resource agencies conduct       costly, wasteful and time consuming review of matters outside       of their scope of expertise and jurisdiction, and the       requirement that scientific decisions be made only by       political appointees in Washington, DC are all examples of       how H.R. 3043 tilts the balance toward the interests of power       companies.        In order to protect clean water, irrigation, meeting tribal       treaty and trust obligations, wildlife, recreational fishing,       commercial  [[Page H8630]]       fishing, whitewater boating, water quality, municipal water       supply, fire safety, flood control, or any other purpose       other than generating power, we urge you to vote NO on H.R.       3043.

Kalispel Tribe of Indians,                                          Usk, WA, November 8, 2017.      Re Opposition to H.R. 3043, the Hydropower Policy           Modernization Acts.       Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, House Energy and Commerce Committee, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Frank Pallone,      Ranking Member, House Energy and Commerce Committee,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone: On behalf       of the Kalispel Tribe of Indians, we write to once again       voice our opposition to H.R. 3043, the Hydropower Policy       Modernization Act. As stated by Kalispel Vice Chairman       Raymond Pierre during testimony before the House Natural       Resources Committee in April, H.R. 3043 goes much too far in       trying to address inefficiencies in the federal hydropower       licensing process and will create more problems than it       resolves. If enacted, H.R. 3043 will allow hydropower       operations to undermine the purposes of Indian reservations       and destroy with impunity tribal trust resources. We       respectfully call on you to oppose this legislation.        The Kalispel Tribe resides on a 5,000-acre reservation on       the Pend Oreille River in northeast Washington. Our       reservation was created to provide our people with a       permanent home, including the ability to use our river and       its resources like we have since time immemorial. This       purpose has been undermined by the construction and operation       of the Albeni Falls, Box Canyon, and Boundary hydropower       projects on the Pend Oreille River. The Box Canyon Reservoir       flooded ten percent of our reservation. In addition, these       facilities have combined to transform our free-flowing river       into a fragmented system of reservoirs in which native fish       struggle to survive while invasive species thrive. Many       Kalispel no longer trust or use the river because of its       altered ecology.        One of the Tribe's highest priorities is limiting any       additional loss of reservation lands and remedying the       cultural disconnection to the Pend Oreille River. The Federal       Power Act (``FPA'') offers the Tribe its most potent tool in       achieving these objectives. No other federal statute affords       the same degree of protection to the tribal nations whose       reservations are occupied by a Federal Energy Regulatory       Commission (``FERC'')-licensed hydroelectric project.        Section 4 (e) of the FPA authorizes the Secretary of the       Interior to develop mandatory conditions for the approval of       FERC licenses that impact Indian reservations. In our case,       these conditions are the only way to mitigate longstanding       and otherwise unaddressed environmental and cultural impacts       caused by FERC-licensed projects. The Pend Oreille Basin will       be the recipient of significant conservation investments to       restore connectivity and other habitat characteristics that       make those projects consistent with the purposes of the       Kalispel Indian Reservation because of the 4(e) conditions       and Section 18 fishway prescriptions in the Box Canyon and       Boundary FERC licenses. This conditioning authority also       makes it much more difficult for hydroelectric projects to       further flood Indian lands, which is a recurring problem       across the United States.        H.R. 3043 does not improve the federal hydropower licensing       process, but instead weakens its protections for impacted       tribal nations. H.R. 3043 detrimentally impacts the Section       4(e) conditioning regime and undermines its effectiveness in       protecting Indian Country. H.R. 3043 would overturn the D.C.       Circuit Court of Appeals decisions in Tacoma v. FERC, which       held that the Department of the Interior has mandatory       authority to develop appropriate conditions to protect Indian       reservations under the FPA and that FERC has no authority to       reject these conditions because Interior did not meet FERC's       truncated schedule. H.R. 3043 would force the Department of       the Interior to comply with FERC's schedule. This change will       impair the Department of the Interior's ability to fully       examine each project and if it misses a deadline, tribal       interests will not be considered until the next relicensing,       often fifty years later.        H.R. 3043 would empower FERC to determine the scope of the       environmental review for 4(e) conditions. This change creates       a new burden for FERC in an area in which it lacks expertise.       It also would require the Department of the Interior to       consider the balance of energy production against its trust       responsibility to Indian lands. Interior's only interest in       the current process is the protection of Indian lands and       that should remain its focus--it is not an arm of FERC.        Finally, H.R. 3043 would overturn the Supreme Court's       decision in Escondido v. FERC, 466 U.S. 765 (1984) by giving       FERC the authority to make a determination that a 4(e)       condition or fishway prescription is inconsistent with the       FPA. This fundamentally changes the FPA and undermines the       Department of the Interior's ability to protect Indian lands       and tribal resources.        The Kalispel Tribe urges the House of Representatives to       reject H.R. 3043. The bill elevates hydropower interests at       the expense of tribal rights. If this bill is enacted the       Kalispel Tribe will suffer so that hydropower licensing may       proceed without protecting tribal lands and trust resources.            Sincerely,                                                       Glen Nenema,                               Chairman, Kalispel Tribe of Indians.  [[Page H8639]]                                          ____                                          House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                     Washington, DC, April 27, 2017.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Fred Upton,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Energy,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden and Chairman Upton: As Members of the       Subcommittee on Energy with strong interest in facilitating       improvements in hydropower operations, development, and       licensing, we write to urge you to schedule another hearing       on this critical topic. We believe a hearing with       representatives of states, resource agencies, and Native       American Tribes is vital to having a full understanding of       how the 2005 hydropower license process reforms are working       and what changes may be necessary to further improve the       licensing and relicensing process to reduce delays and costs       for all parties involved.        Hydroelectric power provides substantial, virtually carbon-      free, baseload energy at low cost to our manufacturing sector       and to residential and commercial consumers. It is an       important asset that we believe is essential to maintain.        At the same time, however, it is clear that while       hydroelectric generation is essentially free of air emissions       relative to fossil generation, it is not impact-free. Absent       mitigation, hydropower has major negative impacts on fish and       wildlife populations, water quality and other important       physical and cultural resources, particularly if it is poorly       operated or sited. In addition, increased demands for water       creates significant challenges of water supply management in       some regions. All of these competing interests must be       balanced in issuing a license. The Federal Power Act (FPA)       respects states' authorities to manage water resources       according to state laws allocating water rights. And, the FPA       authorizes states and federal natural resource agencies to       place conditions on hydroelectric licenses to preserve water       quality, protect public lands and Native American       reservations, and ensure proper fish passage to preserve       healthy ecosystems and fisheries.        We were very encouraged by the substance and tone of the       Subcommittee's March 15, 2017 hearing entitled ``Modernizing       Energy Infrastructure: Challenges and Opportunities to       Expanding Hydropower Generation.'' The comments and       contributions from witnesses and Members on both sides of the       aisle were constructive, measured, and thoughtful, leading us       to believe that great potential exists to develop legislation       to improve the process for licensing hydroelectric generation       and pumped storage in this country.        However, the hearing provided an incomplete record with       regard to the process of hydroelectric licensing. In order to       move forward on considering any legislative changes to       current law in a knowledgeable manner, the Committee must       hear from those who propose the conditions included in       licenses: states, federal resource agencies, and Native       American Tribes. Each of these entities has a unique role in       the licensing process stemming from its equally unique       responsibility for overseeing water rights and managing the       many demands on a river and its use. Neither power       generation, nor any other single use of a river, should       dominate the decision making process.        We look forward to working with you on this matter and       respectfully urge you to hold a second hearing with these       witnesses prior to consideration of any legislative proposal.       Thank you for your attention and consideration.            Sincerely,          Frank Pallone, Jr., Ranking Member, Committee on Energy             and Commerce; Bobby L. Rush, Ranking Member,             Subcommittee on Energy; Jerry McNerney, Member of             Congress; Scott Peters, Member of Congress; Gene Green,             Member of Congress; Michael F.

Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: We are       writing you on behalf of the members of The Association of       Clean Water Administrators (ACWA), Environmental Council of       States (ECOS), and The Association of State Wetland Managers       (ASWM) to express our concern with provisions of H.R. 3043--      Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017. If enacted as       written, the draft bill would modify Federal Energy       Regulatory Commission (FERC) licensing requirements under the       Federal Power Act, and may conflict with the states'       authority under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act to protect       water quality and provide critical input on federal dredge       and fill permits to wetlands and other waters under Sec. 404.        Under the CWA and a state's own laws and regulations,       states are responsible for advancing the attainment of clean       and healthy waters. Section 401 of the CWA requires states to       certify that projects impacting navigable waters will comply       with applicable water quality standards and other state       requirements. Additionally, 401 certification is required for       federal dredge and fill permits to wetlands and other waters       under Section 404. Under this framework, states and       permittees have efficiently been able to balance       certification of hydropower facilities while ensuring that       water quality standards are met initially or through remedial       actions. By weakening Sec. 401 authority, H.R. 3043 would       harm the ability of the governmental entity with primary       responsibility for water quality protection.        Additionally, H.R. 3043 places FERC in control of       permitting timetables and limits time extensions. This could       restrict states' abilities to gather necessary data and       scientific studies for permitting, which are crucial to       reaching collaborative, science-based conclusions. Rushing       scientific studies and data gathering would result in federal       agencies making regulatory decisions without sufficient       technical information, and may lead to litigation and less       effective oversight of hydropower facilities.        H.R. 3043 needlessly impairs state authority granted under       the CWA, and undermines ``cooperative federalism,'' a core       principle of the Act and the Administration's approach to       environmental law. The bill will not improve permitting       efficiency, and will likely result in water quality standards       being even harder to achieve. ACWA, ECOS and ASWM welcome the       opportunity to discuss revisions that would better preserve       states' rights under CWA Section 401 and ensure the       protection of state water resources.

Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Minority Leader Pelosi: The State of       Maryland (``Maryland'') provides the following comments on       the House of Representatives Bill 3043 (H.R. 3043)--      Hydropower Policy Modernization Act of 2017. Although       Maryland generally welcomes reforms that streamline the       Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) licensing       process, Maryland strenuously opposes any provisions in H.R.       3043 that would have the effect of curtailing State authority       under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act to establish license       conditions to protect water quality. Several provisions of       H.R. 3043 essentially serve to constrain state agencies use       of their independent authorities, making it more difficult to       protect water quality.        States serve an essential role in the FERC hydropower       licensing process when they review applications under Section       401 of the Clean Water Act in order to determine whether the       construction and/or operation of the facility will meet state       water quality standards and requirements. These reviews often       result in applicants conducting additional scientific studies       and states putting in place requirements (conditions) to       ensure that State water quality standards and requirement are       met. These types of conditions are essential for ensuring       that existing and new hydropower projects are built and       operated in a manner that is consistent with state and       federal environmental laws and are protective of the       environment. These conditions then become conditions of the       FERC license.        H.R. 3043 designates FERC as the lead agency over federal       authorizations related to an application for a license,       license amendment, or exemption for a hydropower project.       This bill requires states to meet deadlines established by       FERC in a schedule that FERC develops for the licensing       action. Further, this bill places limits on FERC's ability to       easily grant extensions to the deadlines. As the lead agency,       FERC would establish and control the timeline for the       hydropower licensing process and it appears that H.R. 3043       gives FERC the authority to create a schedule that would       reduce the amount of time a state would have to get necessary       scientific studies completed and to assess whether water       quality standards and requirements will be met as required       under Section 401 of the Clean Water Act. Further, not only       does this legislation likely place pressure on states to       complete their water quality reviews more quickly using       existing information, it also provides applicants with an       entitlement to a trial-type hearing before a FERC       Administrative Law Judge whenever there is a dispute of       material fact. Moreover, this legislation declares the       decision of the FERC Administrative Law Judge to be final and       not subject to further administrative review. This allowance       for a trial-like hearing  [[Page H8640]]       combined with pressure to use existing science and meet       strict deadlines together makes it even more challenging for       states to protect water quality.        Finally, applications for amendments to existing licenses       which qualify as a project ``upgrade'' (which is determined       by FERC as to whether a proposed amendment qualifies as an       upgrade) obtain even more expedited processing by FERC. In       these cases, it appears that FERC would be the decision       maker, not the state, with regard to whether the desired       amendment to project operations would affect water quality.        Decades of federal court decisions interpreting Section 401       have established the states' authority to require conditions       in FERC licenses necessary to protect water quality. These       decisions recognize and affirm the basic principle of       federalism embodied in the Clean Water Act that states have       the primary role and responsibility to ensure state water       quality standards are met.        Maryland's interest in protecting water quality is as       important and relevant today as ever, particularly now as       FERC considers the relicensing of the Conowingo hydroelectric       dam on the Susquehanna River in Maryland. The Susquehanna       River provides approximately 50 percent of the fresh water to       the Chesapeake Bay and is an important driver of the Bay's       water quality. A joint study funded by Maryland and the Army       Corps of Engineers concluded that the Dam's loss of capacity       to trap sediment and associated nitrogen and phosphorus       pollution (nutrients) adversely affects the health of the       Bay. The precise nature of the Dam's adverse impacts on the       health of the Bay and the circumstances under which they       occur are currently the subject of additional study. What is       clear, however, is that any new FERC license for the Dam will       have to contain appropriate conditions to address sediment       and associated nutrient transport and ensure that Maryland's       water quality standards are maintained. Without appropriate       conditions Maryland may not be able to meet its commitment to       achieve EPA's Total Maximum Daily Loads (``TMDL'') for the       Bay.        In impairing the states' primary roles and responsibilities       under Section 401 to fashion conditions in FERC licenses,       H.R. 3043 relegates the states--the entities with the       greatest interest and expertise in protecting state water       quality--to bystander or second-class status. Maryland       strenuously objects to the provisions in H.R. 3043 that would       make it more difficult for Maryland to ensure water quality       through the Clean Water Act Section 401 water quality       certification process.        Maryland's concerns with the legislation's impact on the       Conowingo hydroelectric dam relicensing process could be       addressed by making clear that nothing in the legislation       alters Section 401 of the Clean Water Act with regard to       State authority, role, responsibilities, process and       timeline. Further, the legislation should clearly indicate       that state actions associated with Section 401 requirements,       including the assessment of water quality standard       achievement and resulting conditions, are not eligible for a       trial type hearing by a FERC Administrative Law Judge for       purposes of resolving disputes of material fact. Maryland       urges that the provisions of H.R. 3043 that would have the       effect of curtailing State authority under Section 401 of the       Clean Water Act be stricken from the bill.        We thank you for your time and attention to this matter.            Respectfully,      Ben Grumbles,        Secretary, Maryland Department of the Environment.      Mark Belton,        Secretary, Maryland Department of Natural Resources.     Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Rush  amendment in the nature of a substitute, and I urge all of my  colleagues to support it as well.   Mr. Chairman, hydropower is backed by Members on both sides of the  aisle. We all support hydropower, but the process for how we license  these projects is far too important for us to get it wrong.   While many Members on the minority side have objections to the  underlying bill, H.R. 3043, due to its negative impact on States'  rights and States' prerogatives under the Clean Water Act, my  substitute amendment addresses these issues in a more responsible way.   Mr. Chairman, H.R. 3043 will not modernize or improve the hydropower  licensing process, but, rather, it simply places private profits for  industry over the public interest.   Mr. Chairman, we certainly need a more balanced approach, such as the  one provided in my substitute amendment, which contains bipartisan  provisions that were included in the hydropower package that both sides  agreed to in a fit of bipartisanship last December in committee.   Mr. Chairman, my amendment contains several provisions to improve the  licensing process while also offering incentives to the hydropower  industry.   This substitute contains a requirement to set up a new licensing  process, but, unlike H.R. 3043, it protects the rights of Federal  resource agencies, States, and Indian Tribes to impose conditions in  accordance with modern environmental laws.   My substitute also amends the definition of renewable energy to  include all hydropower, just as H.R. 3043 does; however, it expands the  goals for Federal purchasing of renewable power beyond the 15 percent  included in H.R. 3043 as an objective, not a mandate.   Mr. Chairman, my amendment also contains a ``reward for early  action'' provision that authorizes FERC to take into account a  licensee's investments made over the course of their license in order  to improve the efficiency or environmental performance of their  hydropower facility when setting the term of their new license.   Mr. Chairman, in testimony before the Energy and Commerce Committee,  we heard, repeatedly, that a major cause for licensing delays was due  to incomplete applications that do not include all the pertinent  information necessary to issue a decision.   While H.R. 3043 does nothing to address this issue, my substitute  does so by directing FERC and other Federal resource agencies to  convene a negotiating rulemaking with all the stakeholders to develop a  process in which a completed license application will be evaluated and  issued or denied within a period of not more than 3 years.                                time  1515    Mr. Chairman, my amendment preserves States' and Tribal authorities  by directing FERC and the Secretary of the Interior to issue guidance  on best practices for engagement with Indian Tribes in the hydropower  licensing process.   Mr. Chairman, we cannot allow industry profits to supersede the  interests of Native Tribes, States, and other important stakeholders.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
