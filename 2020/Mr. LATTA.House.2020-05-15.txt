 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H. Res. 965, which is a flagrant  disregard to the Constitution and House traditions.   Proxy voting has previously been deliberated in this body. In 1970,  an amendment was offered to ban all forms of proxy voting in  committees. It argued committee members should be present in person to  listen to debate, discuss, and vote. Proxy voting tends to add to the  cloud of suspicion hanging over Congress.   The use of proxy voting on important bills gives up a Member's voice  and adds to the appearance of secrecy. In 1974, an amendment was  offered to entirely ban proxy voting. It was adopted by this House but  later overturned by the Democratic Caucus. A CRS report gave the  opponents' views to proxy voting by stating that it contributes to the  domination of committee chairs, contributes to absenteeism, and  detracts from the care necessary to formulate sound legislation.   A history maxim states that he who forgets the past is condemned to  repeat it. Learn from our past and vote ``no.''
