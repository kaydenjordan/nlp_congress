 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed  in the Record a copy of the transmittal and commitment letters from the  Secretary of Health and Human Services to the chair and ranking member  of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the  Senate and the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Energy and  Commerce of the House of Representatives regarding reauthorization of  the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, Medical Device User Fee Amendments,  Generic Drug User Fee Amendments, and Biosimilar User Fee Act.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                            The Secretary of Health                                              and Human Services,                                   Washington, DC, January 12, 2022.      Hon. Patty Murray,      Chair, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions,           U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Murray: The Prescription Drug User Fee Act       [PDUFA] as reauthorized by the Food and Drug Administration       Reauthorization Act [FDARA P.L. 115-52], expires at the end       of Fiscal Year 2022. With this letter the Administration is       providing our recommendations for the reauthorization of       PDUFA for the Fiscal Years 2023-2027 [PDUFA VII].        Under PDUFA, the revenues generated from fees paid by the       pharmaceutical industry have been used to expedite the       process for the review of new prescription drugs and to       support and augment regulatory science and drug development.       The expenditure of these funds is in accordance with the       statute and provides resources to meet the performance goals       and procedures that were developed by the Food and Drug       Administration [FDA] in consultation with representatives of       regulated industry. FDA estimates that the fees negotiated in       PDUFA VII will average approximately $1.4 billion per year.       PDUFA has proven to be an extremely effective program that       has transformed the U.S. drug review to be the fastest in the       world, while setting the global gold standard for quality,       efficacy, and safety.        Throughout this process, the FDA has solicited input and       worked with various stakeholders, including representatives       from consumer and patient advocates, academic research, and       health provider groups, and negotiated with the       pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, to develop       reauthorization recommendations for PDUFA that would build       upon and enhance the success of the program. In addition, we       have complied with the statutory requirements to solicit       public comments on our recommendations, and the summary of       public comments is posted on the agency web site and enclosed       with this letter.        Our recommendations build upon the successes of existing       programs and performance goals with improvements and       expansions to address areas of emerging regulatory science       and drug development. For example, this includes, but is not       limited to:        Investing critical resources in the Center for Biologics       Evaluation and Research to support development, review, and       approval of cell and gene therapy products;        Introducing new pilot programs to expedite patient access       to novel uses for existing therapies, advance rare diseases       development through efficacy endpoint development, and       improve the quality and acceptability of real-world evidence;        Enhancing the drug safety system through optimizing the       Sentinel Initiative capabilities and improving Risk       Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) assessments;        Introducing new enhancements related to product quality       reviews, chemistry, manufacturing, and control approaches,       and advancing the utilization of innovative manufacturing       technologies;        Enhancing the use of digital health technologies to support       drug development and review, along with leveraging modem       technology to accelerate FDA's data and technology       modernization;        Improving management of user fee resources through       advancing FDA's Resource Capacity Planning function and       continuing activities to enhance financial transparency.        The following five enclosures are provided for your       consideration: The proposed PDUFA VII statutory language; a       redline of current law; the Justifications of Proposed       Statutory Changes for Reauthorization of PDUFA in Fiscal       Years 2023 through 2027; the PDUFA Reauthorization       Performance Goals and Procedures in Fiscal Years 2023 through       2027; and the summary of public comments.        Thank you for the opportunity to present our       recommendations to reauthorize this vital program. We would       be pleased to brief your staff on the details and want to       work closely with Congress to reauthorize the program in a       timely manner. The Office of Management and Budget has       advised that the bill and the enclosed performance goals are       in accord with the Administration's program.

Hon. Patty Murray,      Chair, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions,           U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Murray: The Medical Device User Fee Amendments       of 2017 (MDUFA IV), as reauthorized by the Food and Drug       Administration Reauthorization Act (P.L. 115-52), expires at       the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2022. With this letter, the       Administration is providing our recommendations for the       reauthorization of MDUFA for FY 2023-2027 (MDUFA V).        Under MDUFA, the revenues generated from fees paid by the       medical device industry have been used to expedite the       process for the review of device applications and to support       and augment regulatory science and medical device       development. The expenditure of these funds is in accordance       with the statute and provides resources to meet the       performance goals and procedures that were developed by the       U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in consultation with       representatives of regulated industry.        FDA estimates that the fees negotiated in MDUFA V provide       for the following five-year total revenue, prior to       adjustments for inflation. They provide a minimum total       revenue of approximately $1.784 billion. In addition, if       specific performance goals are met in FY 2023-2025, FDA may       collect up to an additional total of approximately $116       million in FY 2025-2027, for a maximum potential total of       approximately $1.9 billion.        The MDUFA V package also reflects use of an additional $118       million in funding from the current MDUFA IV carryover       balance to support MDUFA V activities.        Throughout this process, FDA negotiated with the regulated       industry and has solicited input and worked with various       stakeholders, including representatives from patient,       consumer, academic research, and health provider groups, to       develop reauthorization recommendations for MDUFA that would       build upon and enhance the success of the program. In       addition, FDA complied with the statutory requirements to       solicit public comments on the draft recommendations, and the       summary of public comments is posted on the agency web site.        Now pending its fourth reauthorization, MDUFA has proven to       be a highly effective program for supporting the device       review process. The program is designed to help ensure       patient access to safe, effective, and high-quality medical       devices. During the current reauthorization cycle,       negotiations with industry primarily focused on: enhancements       to certain performance goals; filling funding needs that had       not been adequately addressed in MDUFA IV; the launch of a       pilot program designed to speed patient access to certain       innovative medical devices; programs to advance the       development of regulatory science and to advance       opportunities for patient input and collaboration in the       device development process; and proposals to enhance FDA's       accountability and transparency in its use of fees.        The following enclosures are provided for your       consideration: the MDUFA Reauthorization Performance Goals       and Procedures--Fiscal Years 2023 through 2027 (the MDUFA V       Commitment Letter); a redline showing the proposed MDUFA V       statutory changes compared to the current law; the       Justifications of Proposed Statutory Changes for       reauthorization of MDUFA in FY 2023-2027; and the summary of       public comments.        Thank you for the opportunity to present our       recommendations to reauthorize this vital program. We were       pleased to brief your staff on the details of the Commitment       Letter and hope to continue working closely with Congress to       reauthorize the program in a timely manner. The Office of       Management and Budget has advised that the bill and the       enclosed performance goals are in accordance with the       Administration's program.

Now pending its fourth reauthorization, MDUFA has proven to       be a highly effective program for supporting the device       review process. The program is designed to help ensure       patient access to safe, effective, and high-quality medical       devices. During the current reauthorization cycle,       negotiations with industry primarily focused on: enhancements       to certain performance goals; filling funding needs that had       not been adequately addressed in MDUFA IV; the launch of a       pilot program designed to speed patient access to certain       innovative medical devices; programs to advance the       development of regulatory science and to advance       opportunities for patient input and collaboration in the       device development process; and proposals to enhance FDA's       accountability and transparency in its use of fees.        The following enclosures are provided for your       consideration: the MDUFA Reauthorization Performance Goals       and Procedures--Fiscal Years 2023 through 2027 (the MDUFA V       Commitment Letter); a redline showing the proposed MDUFA V       statutory changes compared to the current law; the       Justifications of Proposed Statutory Changes for       reauthorization of MDUFA in FY 2023-2027; and the summary of       public comments.        Thank you for the opportunity to present our       recommendations to reauthorize this vital program. We were       pleased to brief your staff on the details of the Commitment       Letter and hope to continue working closely with Congress to       reauthorize the program in a timely manner. The Office of       Management and Budget has advised that the bill and the       enclosed performance goals are in accordance with the       Administration's program.            Sincerely,      Xavier Becerra.                                   ____                                         The Secretary of Health and                                                  Human Services,                                       Washington, DC, May 10, 2022.      Hon. Frank Pallone, Jr.      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Pallone: The Medical Device User Fee Amendments       of 2017 (MDUFA IV), as reauthorized by the Food and Drug       Administration Reauthorization Act (P.L. 115-52), expires at       the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2022. With this letter, the       Administration is providing our recommendations for the       reauthorization of MDUFA for FY 2023-2027 (MDUFA V).        Under MDUFA, the revenues generated from fees paid by the       medical device industry have been used to expedite the       process for the review of device applications and to support       and augment regulatory science and medical device       development. The expenditure of these funds is in accordance       with the  [[Page S5174]]       statute and provides resources to meet the performance goals       and procedures that were developed by the U.S. Food and Drug       Administration (FDA) in consultation with representatives of       regulated industry.        FDA estimates that the fees negotiated in MDUFA V provide       for the following five-year total revenue, prior to       adjustments for inflation. They provide a minimum total       revenue of approximately $1.784 billion. In addition, if       specific performance goals are met in FY 2023-2025, FDA may       collect up to an additional total of approximately $116       million in FY 2025-2027, for a maximum potential total of       approximately $1.9 billion.        The MDUFA V package also reflects use of an additional $118       million in funding from the current MDUFA IV carryover       balance to support MDUFA V activities.        Throughout this process, FDA negotiated with the regulated       industry and has solicited input and worked with various       stakeholders, including representatives from patient,       consumer, academic research, and health provider groups, to       develop reauthorization recommendations for MDUFA that would       build upon and enhance the success of the program. In       addition, FDA complied with the statutory requirements to       solicit public comments on the draft recommendations, and the       summary of public comments is posted on the agency web site.

Dear Representative McMorris Rodgers: The Medical Device       User Fee Amendments of 2017 (MDUFA IV), as reauthorized by       the Food and Drug Administration Reauthorization Act (P.L.       115-52), expires at the end of Fiscal Year (FY) 2022.

Hon. Patty Murray,      Chair, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Murray: The Generic Drug User Fee Amendments of       2017 [GDUFA II], as reauthorized by the Food and Drug       Administration Reauthorization Act [FDARA P. L. 115-52],       expires at the end of Fiscal Year 2022. With this letter, the       Administration is providing our recommendations for the       reauthorization of GDUFA for the Fiscal Years 2023-2027       [GDUFA III].        Under GDUFA, the revenues generated from fees paid by the       generic pharmaceutical industry have been used to expedite       the process for the review of generic drugs and to support       and augment regulatory science and generic drug development.       The expenditure of these funds is in accordance with the       statute and provides resources to meet the performance goals       and procedures that were developed by the Food and Drug       Administration [FDA] in consultation with representatives of       regulated industry. FDA estimates that the fees negotiated in       GDUFA III will be over $600 million per year, adjusted       annually for inflation.        Throughout this process, FDA has solicited input and worked       with various stakeholders, including representatives from       consumer, patient, academic research, and health provider       groups, and negotiated with the regulated industry, to       develop reauthorization recommendations for GDUFA that would       build upon and enhance the success of the program. In       addition, we have complied with the statutory requirements to       solicit public comments on our recommendations, and the       summary of public comments is posted on the agency web site.        Our recommendations build upon the successes of existing       programs and performance goals with enhancements to advance       approvals in fewer review cycles, proposals to enhance       regulatory science and expedite complex generic drug       development, and financial proposals to support the generic       drug program as it evolves. For example, minimizing the       issuance of complete response letters through the use of       ``imminent actions'' to approve an application within 60 days       after the goal date will reduce the number of review cycles.       The pre-ANDA program, which was initiated as part of GDUFA       II, has several enhancements, including new goal dates for       Product-Specific Guidances [PSGs] that expedite complex       generic drug development. The proposals also include       improvements for FDA to enhance the operational agility of       the GDUFA program through maturation of the Resource Capacity       Planning (RCP) capability and the proposed implementation of       a Capacity Planning Adjustment (CPA) in fee-setting to       generally allow for up to a three percent increase in       inflation-adjusted target revenue for the upcoming fiscal       year if sustained increases in the workload are predicted,       using a methodology developed and evaluated during GDUFA II.        The following five enclosures are provided for your       consideration: the proposed GDUFA III statutory language; a       redline of these changes compared to the current law; the       Justifications of Proposed Statutory Changes for       reauthorization of GDUFA in Fiscal Years 2023 through 2027;       the GDUFA Reauthorization Performance Goals and Procedures--      Fiscal Years 2023 through 2027 [the GDUFA III Commitment       Letter]; and the summary of public comments.

Our recommendations build upon the successes of existing       programs and performance goals with enhancements to advance       approvals in fewer review cycles, proposals to enhance       regulatory science and expedite complex generic drug       development, and financial proposals to support the generic       drug program as it evolves. For example, minimizing the       issuance of complete response letters through the use of       ''imminent actions'' to approve an application within 60 days       after the goal date will reduce the number of review cycles.       The pre-ANDA program, which was initiated as part of GDUFA       II, has several enhancements, including new goal dates for       Product-Specific Guidances [PSGs] that expedite complex       generic drug development. The proposals also include       improvements for FDA to enhance the operational agility of  [[Page S5176]]       the GDUFA program through maturation of the Resource Capacity       Planning (RCP) capability and the proposed implementation of       a Capacity Planning Adjustment (CPA) in fee-setting to       generally allow for up to a three percent increase in       inflation-adjusted target revenue for the upcoming fiscal       year if sustained increases in the workload are predicted,       using a methodology developed and evaluated during GDUFA II.        The following five enclosures are provided for your       consideration: the proposed GDUFA III statutory language; a       redline of these changes compared to the current law; the       Justifications of Proposed Statutory Changes for       reauthorization of GDUFA in Fiscal Years 2023 through 2027;       the GDUFA Reauthorization Performance Goals and Procedures--      Fiscal Years 2023 through 2027 [the GDUFA III Commitment       Letter]; and the summary of public comments.        Thank you for the opportunity to present our       recommendations to reauthorize this vital program. We were       pleased to brief your staff on the details of the Commitment       Letter and hope to continue working closely with Congress to       reauthorize the program in a timely manner. The Office of       Management and Budget has advised that the bill and the       enclosed performance goals are in accordance with the       Administration's program.            Sincerely,      Xavier Becerra.                                   ____                                           The Secretary of Health                                             and Human Services,                                   Washington, DC, January 12, 2022.      Hon. Patty Murray,      Chair, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chair Murray: The Biosimilar User Fee Act [BsUFA] as       reauthorized by the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 [Pub. L.       115-52], expires at the end of Fiscal Year 2022. With this       letter the Administration is providing our recommendations       for the reauthorization of BsUFA for the Fiscal Years 2023-      2027 [BsUFA III].        Under BsUFA, the revenues generated from fees paid by the       pharmaceutical industry have been used to support the process       for the review of biosimilar biological products. The       expenditure of these funds is in accordance with the statute       and provides resources to meet the performance goals and       procedures that were developed by the Food and Drug       Administration [FDA] in consultation with representatives of       regulated industry. FDA estimates that the fees negotiated in       BsUFA III will average approximately $51 million per year.        As part this process, the FDA has negotiated with the       pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to develop       reauthorization recommendations for BsUFA that would build       upon and enhance the success of the program. In addition, we       have complied with the statutory requirements to solicit       public comments on our recommendations, and the summary of       public comments is posted on the agency web site and enclosed       with this letter.        Our recommendations build upon the successes of the BsUFA       program by refining elements of the existing program and       including new enhancements where appropriate. For example,       these recommendations include, but are not limited to:        Introducing new supplement categories, review timelines,       and performance goals to expedite the review of certain       supplements, including safety labeling updates        Advancing the development of safe and effective       interchangeable biosimilar biological products through       foundational guidance development, stakeholder engagement,       and other activities        Piloting a regulatory science program focused on enhancing       regulatory decision-making and facilitating science-based       recommendations in areas foundational to biosimilar and       interchangeable biological product development        Improving management of user fee resources through       advancing FDA's Resource Capacity Planning function and       continuation of activities to enhance financial transparency        The following five enclosures are provided for your       consideration: The proposed BsUFA III statutory language; a       redline of current law; the Justifications ofProposed       Statutory Changes for Reauthorization of BsUFA in Fiscal       Years 2023 through 2027; the BsUFA Reauthorization       Performance Goals and Procedures in Fiscal Years 2023 through       2027; and the summary of public comments.

Definitions and Explanation of Terms    PDUFA REAUTHORIZATION PERFORMANCE GOALS AND PROCEDURES FISCAL YEARS                             2023 THROUGH 2027         This document contains the performance goals and procedures       for the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA)       reauthorization for fiscal years (FYs) 2023-2027, known as       PDUFA VII. It is commonly referred to as the ``goals letter''       or ``commitment letter.'' The goals letter represents the       product of FDA's discussions with the regulated industry and       public stakeholders, as mandated by Congress. The performance       and procedural goals and other commitments specified in this       letter apply to aspects of the human drug review program that       are important for facilitating timely access to safe,       effective, and innovative new medicines for patients. While       much of FDA's work is associated with formal tracked       performance goals, the Agency and industry mutually agree       that it is appropriate to manage some areas of the human drug       review program with internally tracked timeframes. This       provides FDA the flexibility needed to respond to a highly       diverse workload, including unanticipated public health       needs. FDA is committed to meeting the performance goals       specified in this letter and to continuous improvement of its       performance regarding other important areas specified in       relevant published documents that relate to preapproval drug       development and post-approval activities for marketed       products. FDA and the regulated industry will periodically       and regularly assess the progress of the human drug review       program throughout PDUFA VII. This will allow FDA and the       regulated industry to identify emerging challenges and       develop strategies to address these challenges to ensure the       efficiency and effectiveness of the human drug review       program.        Unless otherwise stated, goals apply to cohorts of each       fiscal year (FY).        I. ENSURING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE HUMAN DRUG REVIEW PROGRAM       A. REVIEW PERFORMANCE GOALS        1. NDA/BLA Submissions and Resubmissions        a. Review and act on 90 percent of standard NME NDA and       original BLA submissions within 10 months of the 60-day       filing date.        b. Review and act on 90 percent of priority NME NDA and       original BLA submissions within 6 months of the 60-day filing       date.        c. Review and act on 90 percent of standard non-NME       original NDA submissions within 10 months of receipt.        d. Review and act on 90 percent of priority non-NME       original NDA submissions within 6 months of receipt.        e. Review and act on 90 percent of Class 1 resubmitted       original applications within 2 months of receipt.        f. Review and act on 90 percent of Class 2 resubmitted       original applications within 6 months of receipt.        2. Original Efficacy Supplements        a. Review and act on 90 percent of standard efficacy       supplements within 10 months of receipt.        b. Review and act on 90 percent of priority efficacy       supplements within 6 months of receipt.        3. Resubmitted Efficacy Supplements        a. Review and act on 90 percent of Class 1 resubmitted       efficacy supplements within 2 months of receipt.        b. Review and act on 90 percent of Class 2 resubmitted       efficacy supplements within 6 months of receipt.        4. Original Manufacturing Supplements        a. Review and act on 90 percent of manufacturing       supplements requiring prior approval within 4 months of       receipt.        b. Review and act on 90 percent of all other manufacturing       supplements within 6 months of receipt.        5. Review Performance Goal Extensions        a. Major Amendments        i. A major amendment to an original application, efficacy       supplement, or resubmission  [[Page S5178]]       of any of these applications, submitted at any time during       the review cycle, may extend the goal date by three months.        ii. A major amendment may include, for example, a major new       clinical safety/efficacy study report; major re-analysis of       previously submitted study(ies); submission of a Risk       Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) with Element to       Assure Safe Use (ETASU) not included in the original       application; or significant amendment to a previously       submitted REMS with ETASU. Generally, changes to REMS that do       not include ETASU and minor changes to REMS with ETASU will       not be considered major amendments.        iii. A major amendment to a manufacturing supplement       submitted at any time during the review cycle may extend the       goal date by two months.        iv. Only one extension can be given per review cycle.        v. Consistent with the underlying principles articulated in       the GRMP guidance, FDA's decision to extend the review clock       should, except in rare circumstances, be limited to occasions       where review of the new information could address outstanding       deficiencies in the application and lead to approval in the       current review cycle.        b. Inspection of Facilities Not Adequately Identified in an       Original Application or Supplement        i. All original applications, including those in the       ``Program,'' (see Section I.B.2) and supplements are expected       to include a comprehensive and readily located list of all       manufacturing facilities included or referenced in the       application or supplement. This list provides FDA with       information needed to schedule inspections of manufacturing       facilities that may be necessary before approval of the       original application or supplement.        ii. If, during FDA's review of an original application or       supplement, the Agency identifies a manufacturing facility       that was not included in the comprehensive and readily       located list, the goal date may be extended.        1) If FDA identifies the need to inspect a manufacturing       facility that is not included as part of the comprehensive       and readily located list in an original application or       efficacy supplement, the goal date may be extended by three       months.        2) If FDA identifies the need to inspect a manufacturing       facility that is not included as part of the comprehensive       and readily located list in a manufacturing supplement, the       goal date may be extended by two months.        6. These review goals are summarized in the following       tables:                                   TABLE 1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------         Submission Cohort              Standard            Priority ------------------------------------------------------------------------ NME NDAs and original BLAs......  90% in 10 months    90% in 6 months of                                    of the 60-day       the 60-day filing                                    filing date.        date Non NME NDAs....................  90% in 10 months    90% in 6 months of                                    of the receipt      the receipt date                                    date.

Program for Enhanced Review Transparency and Communication           for NME NDAs and Original BLAs        To promote transparency and communication between the FDA       review team and the applicant, FDA will apply the following       model (``the Program'') to the review of all New Molecular       Entity New Drug Applications (NME NDAs) and original       Biologics License Applications (BLAs), including applications       that are resubmitted following a Refuse-to-File decision,       received from October 1, 2022, through September 30, 2027.       The goal of the Program is to promote the efficiency and       effectiveness of the first cycle review process and minimize       the number of review cycles necessary for approval, ensuring       that patients have timely access to safe, effective, and high       quality new drugs and biologics.        Approach to Application Review. The standard approach for       the review of NME NDAs and original BLAs is described in this       section. However, the FDA review team and the applicant may       discuss and reach mutual agreement on an alternative approach       to the timing and nature of interactions and information       exchange between the applicant and FDA, i.e., a Formal       Communication Plan for the review of the NME NDA or original       BLA. The Formal Communication Plan may include elements of       the standard approach (e.g., a mid-cycle communication or a       late-cycle meeting) as well as other interactions that       sometimes occur during the review process (e.g., a meeting       during the filing period to discuss the application, i.e., an       ``application orientation meeting''). If appropriate, the       Formal Communication Plan should specify those elements of       the Program that FDA and the applicant agree are unnecessary       for the application under review. If the review team and the       applicant anticipate developing a Formal Communication Plan,       the elements of the plan should be discussed and agreed to at       the pre-submission meeting (see Section I.B.1) and reflected       in the meeting minutes. The Formal Communication Plan may be       reviewed and amended at any time based on the progress of the       review and the mutual agreement of the review team and the       applicant. For example, the review team and the applicant may       mutually agree at any time to cancel future specified       interactions in the Program (e.g., the late-cycle meeting)       that become unnecessary (e.g., because previous       communications between the review team and the applicant are       sufficient). Any amendments made to the Formal Communication       Plan should be consistent with the goal of an efficient and       timely first cycle review process and not impede the review       team's ability to conduct its review.        The remainder of Section I.B describes the parameters that       will apply to FDA's review of applications in the Program.        1. Pre-submission meeting: The applicant is strongly       encouraged to discuss the planned content of the application       with the appropriate FDA review division at a pre-NDA/BLA       meeting. This meeting will be attended by the FDA review       team, including appropriate senior FDA staff.        a. The pre-NDA/BLA meeting should be held sufficiently in       advance of the planned submission of the application to allow       for meaningful response to FDA feedback and should generally       occur not less than 2 months prior to the planned submission       of the application.        b. In addition to FDA's preliminary responses to the       applicant's questions, other potential discussion topics       include preliminary discussions on the need for REMS or other       risk management actions, and, where applicable, the       development of a Formal Communication Plan and a timeline for       review activities associated with a scheduling recommendation       under the Controlled Substances Act for drugs with abuse       potential. These discussions will be summarized at the       conclusion of the meeting and reflected in the FDA meeting       minutes.        c. The FDA and the applicant will agree on the content of a       complete application for the proposed indication(s) at the       pre-submission meeting. The FDA and the applicant may also       reach agreement on submission of a limited number of       application components not later than 30 calendar days after       the submission of the original application. These submissions       must be of a type that would not be expected to materially       impact the ability of the review team to begin its review.       These agreements will be summarized at the conclusion of the       meeting and reflected in the FDA meeting minutes.        i. Examples of application components that may be       appropriate for delayed submission include updated stability       data (e.g., 15-month data to update 12-month data submitted       with the original submission) or the final audited report of       a preclinical study (e.g., carcinogenicity) where the final       draft report is submitted with the original application.        ii. Major components of the application (e.g., the complete       study report of a Phase 3 clinical trial or the full study       report of required long-term safety data) are expected to be       submitted with the original application and are not subject       to agreement for late submission.        2. Original application submission: Applications are       expected to be complete, as agreed between the FDA review       team and the applicant at the pre-NDA/BLA meeting, at the       time of original submission of the application. If the       applicant does not have a pre-NDA/BLA meeting with FDA, and       no agreement exists between FDA and the applicant on the       contents of a complete application or delayed submission of       certain components of the application, the applicant's       submission is expected to be complete at the time of original       submission.        a. All applications are expected to include a comprehensive       and readily located list of all clinical sites and       manufacturing facilities included or referenced in the       application.        b. Any components of the application that FDA agreed at the       pre-submission meeting could be submitted after the original       application are expected to be received not later than 30       calendar days after receipt of the original application.  [[Page S5179]]         c. Incomplete applications, including applications with       components that are not received within 30 calendar days       after receipt of the original submission, will be subject to       a Refuse-to-File decision.        d. The following parameters will apply to applications that       are subject to a Refuse-to-File decision and are subsequently       filed over protest:        i. The original submission of the application will be       subject to the review performance goal as described in       Section I.B.4.        ii. The application will not be eligible for the other       parameters of the Program (e.g., mid-cycle communication,       late-cycle meeting).        iii. FDA generally will not review amendments to the       application during any review cycle. FDA also generally will       not issue information requests to the applicant during the       agency's review.        iv. The resubmission goals described in Sections I.A.1.e       and I.A.1.f will not apply to any resubmission of the       application following an FDA complete response action. Any       such resubmission will be reviewed as available resources       permit.        e. Since applications are expected to be complete at the       time of submission, unsolicited amendments are expected to be       rare and not to contain major new information or analyses.       Review of unsolicited amendments, including those submitted       in response to an FDA communication of deficiencies, will be       handled in accordance with the GRMP guidance. This guidance       includes the underlying principle that FDA will consider the       most efficient path toward completion of a comprehensive       review that addresses application deficiencies and leads       toward a first cycle approval when possible.        3. Day 74 Letter: FDA will follow existing procedures       regarding identification and communication of filing review       issues in the ``Day 74 letter.'' For applications subject to       the Program, the timeline for this communication will be       within 74 calendar days from the date of FDA receipt of the       original submission. The planned review timeline included in       the Day 74 letter for applications in the Program will       include the planned date for the internal mid-cycle review       meeting. The letter will also include preliminary plans on       whether to hold an Advisory Committee (AC) meeting to discuss       the application. If applicable, the Day 74 letter will serve       as notification to the applicant that the review division       intends to conduct an expedited review (See Section I.E).        4. Review performance goals: For NME NDA and original BLA       submissions that are filed by FDA under the Program, the       PDUFA review clock will begin at the conclusion of the 60-day       filing review period that begins on the date of FDA receipt       of the original submission. The review performance goals for       these applications are as follows:        a. Review and act on 90 percent of standard NME NDA and       original BLA submissions within 10 months of the 60-day       filing date.        b. Review and act on 90 percent of priority NME NDA and       original BLA submissions within 6 months of the 60-day filing       date.        5. Mid-Cycle Communication: The FDA Regulatory Project       Manager (RPM), and other appropriate members of the FDA       review team (e.g., Cross Discipline Team Leader (CDTL)), will       call the applicant, generally within 2 weeks following the       Agency's internal mid-cycle review meeting, to provide the       applicant with an update on the status of the review of their       application. An agenda will be sent to the applicant prior to       the mid-cycle communication. Scheduling of the internal mid-      cycle review meeting will be handled in accordance with the       GRMP guidance. The RPM will coordinate the specific date and       time of the telephone call with the applicant.        a. The update should include any significant issues       identified by the review team to date, any information       requests, information regarding major safety concerns and       preliminary review team thinking and rationale regarding:        1. risk management,        2. the potential need for any post-marketing requirement(s)       (PMRs), and        3. the ability of adverse event reporting and FDA's Active       Risk Identification and Analysis (ARIA) system under the       Sentinel Initiative to provide sufficient information about       product risk.        b. The update should also include proposed date(s) for the       late-cycle meeting, updates regarding plans for the AC       meeting (if an AC meeting is anticipated), an update       regarding FDA's review activities associated with a       scheduling recommendation under the Controlled Substances Act       (if applicable), and other projected milestone dates for the       remainder of the review cycle.        c. In the case of an expedited review, FDA will communicate       the timelines for the Late-Cycle Meeting and the Late-Cycle       Meeting background package (see Section I.B.6) which may       occur earlier with more condensed timeframes compared to a       review that is not expedited.        6. Late-Cycle and Advisory Committee Meetings: A meeting       will be held between the FDA review team and the applicant to       discuss the status of the review of the application late in       the review cycle. Late-cycle meetings will generally be face-      to-face meetings; however, the meeting may be held by       teleconference if FDA and the applicant agree. Since the       application is expected to be complete at the time of       submission, FDA intends to complete primary and secondary       reviews of the application in advance of the planned late-      cycle meeting.        a. FDA representatives at the late-cycle meeting are       expected to include the signatory authority for the       application, review team members from appropriate       disciplines, and appropriate team leaders and/or supervisors       from disciplines for which substantive issues have been       identified in the review to date.        b. For applications that will be discussed at an AC       meeting, the following parameters apply:        1. FDA intends to convene AC meetings no later than 2       months (standard review) or no later than 6 weeks (priority       review) prior to the PDUFA goal date. The late-cycle meeting       will occur not less than 12 calendar days before the date of       the AC meeting.        2. FDA intends to provide final questions for the AC to the       applicant and the AC not less than 2 calendar days before the       AC meeting.        3. Following an AC Meeting, FDA and the applicant may agree       on the need to discuss feedback from the AC for the purpose       of facilitating the remainder of the review. Such a meeting       will generally be held by teleconference without a commitment       for formal meeting minutes issued by the agency.        c. For applications that will not be discussed at an AC       meeting, the late-cycle meeting will generally occur not       later than 3 months (standard review) or two months (priority       review) prior to the PDUFA goal date.        d. Late-Cycle Meeting Background Packages: The Agency       background package for the late-cycle meeting will be sent to       the applicant not less than 10 calendar days (or 2 calendar       days for an expedited review) before the late-cycle meeting.       The package will consist of a brief memorandum from the       review team outlining substantive application issues (e.g.,       deficiencies identified by primary and secondary reviews),       the Agency's background package for the AC meeting       (incorporated by reference if previously sent to the       applicant), potential questions and/or points for discussion       for the AC meeting (if planned) and the current assessment of       the need for REMS or other risk management actions. If the       application is subject to an expedited review, the background       package may be streamlined using a bulleted list to identify       issues to be discussed.        e. Late-Cycle Meeting Discussion Topics: Potential topics       for discussion at the late-cycle meeting include major       deficiencies identified to date; issues to be discussed at       the AC meeting (if planned); current assessment of the need       for REMS and current assessment of the sufficiency of adverse       event reporting and the ARIA system to provide information on       product risk and the rationale for potential need for a PMR       to characterize product risk or other risk management       actions; status update of FDA's review activities associated       with a scheduling recommendation under the Controlled       Substances Act, if applicable; information requests from the       review team to the applicant; and additional data or analyses       the applicant may wish to submit.        i. With regard to submission of additional data or       analyses, the FDA review team and the applicant will discuss       whether such data will be reviewed by the Agency in the       current review cycle and, if so, whether the submission will       be considered a major amendment and trigger an extension of       the PDUFA goal date.        7. Inspections: FDA's goal is to complete all GCP, GLP, and       GMP inspections for applications in the Program within 6       months of the date of original receipt for priority       applications and within 10 months of the date of original       receipt for standard applications. This will allow 2 months       at the end of the review cycle to attempt to address any       deficiencies identified by the inspections.      C. New Molecular Entity (NME) Milestones and Postmarketing           Requirements (PMRs)        FDA will continue to review, oversee, track, and       communicate postmarketing drug safety issues.        1. Pre-approval review of PMRs: The Agency recognizes the       importance of PMRs to ensure the timely availability of       information on the safety and efficacy of therapies to the       United States public. Therefore, FDA will establish processes       to support consistency and predictability for both the Agency       and applicants throughout the identification, determination,       and evaluation of postmarketing studies.        FDA will establish the following pre-approval process       enhancements and guidelines in PDUFA VII:        a. For standard NME NDAs and original BLAs, FDA will       communicate details on anticipated PMRs required under       Section 505(o)(3), PREA, Accelerated Approval, and the Animal       Rule to the applicant no later than 8 weeks prior to the       PDUFA action goal date.        b. For priority NME NDAs and original BLAs, FDA will       communicate details on anticipated PMRs required under       Section 505(o)(3), PREA, Accelerated Approval, and the Animal       Rule to the applicant no later than 6 weeks prior to the       PDUFA action goal date.        c. The communications described above in clauses (a) and       (b) will summarize FDA's preliminary evaluation of required       postmarketing studies, including the study purpose, critical       study design elements including type of study and study       population, timelines for discussions and engagement on the       PMR for the remainder of the review cycle, and for 505(o)(3)       PMRs the specific serious risk.        d. If a major safety issue which requires a PMR is       identified based on data submitted  [[Page S5180]]       subsequent to submission of the application these timelines       may not apply.        FDA's performance goals for standard NME NDAs and original       BLAs will be phased in, starting in FY 2023 as follows:        a. In FY 2023, communicate anticipated PMRs to the       applicant no later than 8 weeks prior to the PDUFA action       goal date for 60% of standard NME NDAs and original BLAs.        b. In FY 2024, communicate anticipated PMRs to the       applicant no later than 8 weeks prior to the PDUFA action       goal date for 70% of standard NME NDAs and original BLAs.        c. In FY 2025, communicate anticipated PMRs to the       applicant no later than 8 weeks prior to the PDUFA action       goal date for 80% of standard NME NDAs and original BLAs.        d. In FY 2026, communicate anticipated PMRs to the       applicant no later than 8 weeks prior to the PDUFA action       goal date for 80% of standard NME NDAs and original BLAs.        e. In FY 2027, communicate anticipated PMRs to the       applicant no later than 8 weeks prior to the PDUFA action       goal date for 80% of standard NME NDAs and original BLAs.        FDA's performance goals for priority NME NDAs and original       BLAs will be phased in, starting in FY 2023 as follows:        a. In FY 2023, communicate anticipated PMRs to the       applicant no later than 6 weeks prior to the PDUFA action       goal date for 60% of priority NME NDAs and original BLAs.        b. In FY 2024, communicate anticipated PMRs to the       applicant no later than 6 weeks prior to the PDUFA action       goal date for 70% of priority NME NDAs and original BLAs.        c. In FY 2025, communicate anticipated PMRs to the       applicant no later than 6 weeks prior to the PDUFA action       goal date for 80% of priority NME NDAs and original BLAs.        d. In FY 2026, communicate anticipated PMRs to the       applicant no later than 6 weeks prior to the PDUFA action       goal date for 80% of priority NME NDAs and original BLAs.        e. In FY 2027, communicate anticipated PMRs to the       applicant no later than 6 weeks prior to the PDUFA action       goal date for 80% of priority NME NDAs and original BLAs.        For the purposes of tracking and reporting metrics on all       PMR goals described above, FDA will calculate metrics based       on all NME and original BLA applications with issued PMRs,       including Section 505(o)(3), PREA, Accelerated Approval, and       the Animal Rule.        In addition, FDA will enhance clarity and transparency for       the NME Review Program by updating all relevant Manuals of       Policies and Procedures (MAPPs), Standard Operating       Procedures and Policies (SOPPs), and guidances regarding the       pre-approval processes for establishing PMRs beginning FY       2023 and finalizing by the end of FY 2027. The Agency will       also conduct training for all relevant review and program       support staff on updated processes related to postmarketing       studies beginning FY 2023, including:        a. Preliminary communication with applicants at mid-cycle       for PMRs, PMCs, and REMS.        b. Processes and procedures for ARIA sufficiency       determination.        2. Post-approval review of existing PMRs: In addition to       mechanisms currently in place for FDA to review existing PMRs       (e.g., Annual Status Reports (ASRs), protocol submissions),       applicants may also request review of existing PMRs for       release. FDA will establish an additional process for       reviewing sponsor-initiated requests as summarized below:        a. The applicant will submit a request summarizing their       rationale for why an existing PMR is no longer needed,       including all necessary supporting data and information.        b. The relevant FDA review division/office and discipline       will initiate review of the request. FDA will notify the       applicant of any additional information considered necessary       to evaluate the request within 45 days of receipt.        c. FDA will respond to the applicant with a decision within       60 days of receipt of the original request or within 60 days       of receipt of the additional information requested by FDA       described in the previous step, whichever is later. FDA's       response can be an agreement letter or a non-agreement       letter. In a case of a non-agreement letter, the FDA will       provide a rationale for their decision.        d. If FDA's response is a non-agreement letter, the       applicant may submit a request to the review division for       reconsideration by the appropriate committee(s) described in       (e) below with justification, and any additional information,       and/or data if appropriate.        e. Upon receipt of a reconsideration request, the review       division/office will discuss with the appropriate internal       committee that includes senior Agency leadership (e.g.,       Medical Policy and Program Review Committee, Medical Policy       Coordinating Committee, and Pediatric Review Committee).        f. The review division/office will issue a written response       within 45 days of receipt of the reconsideration request.       FDA's response can be an agreement letter or a non-agreement       letter. In a case of a non-agreement letter, the FDA will       provide a rationale for their decision.        The process and timelines described above will be       incorporated into all relevant MAPPs, SOPPs, and guidances       beginning FY 2023 and finalizing by the end of FY 2027 and       will not be PDUFA-tracked metrics or subject to performance       goals.      D. Split Real Time Application Review (STAR) Pilot Program        FDA will establish a STAR pilot program, which has the goal       of shortening the time from the date of complete submission       to the action date, in order to allow earlier patient access       to therapies that address an unmet medical need. The STAR       pilot program will apply to efficacy supplements across all       therapeutic areas and review disciplines that meet specific       criteria. Accepted STAR applications will be submitted in a       ``split'' fashion, specifically in two parts (with the       components submitted approximately 2 months apart).        1. Scope: The STAR program will seek to expedite patient       access to novel uses for existing therapies by supporting       initiation of review earlier than would otherwise occur and       therefore allowing earlier approval for qualified efficacy       supplements. This program will apply across all therapeutic       areas and review disciplines for applications that meet       specific criteria. An application will be considered eligible       for STAR if each of the following criteria are met:        a. Clinical evidence from adequate and well-controlled       investigation(s) indicates that the drug may demonstrate       substantial improvement on a clinically relevant endpoint(s)       over available therapies.        i. Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) or Regenerative       Medicine Advanced Therapy Designation (RMAT) is not required,       but above criteria must be met.        b. The application is for a drug intended to treat a       serious condition with an unmet medical need.        c. No aspect of the submission is likely to require a       longer review time (e.g., requirement for new REMS, etc.).        d. There is no chemistry, manufacturing, or control       information that would require a foreign manufacturing site       inspection (i.e., domestic site inspections may be allowed if       it does not affect the expedited timeframe).        2. Process and Timeline: The following steps summarize the       process for applying to and participating in the STAR       program:        a. An applicant who believes an efficacy supplement       qualifies for review under the STAR program will request an       informal pre-submission teleconference with FDA and provide       FDA with topline trial results and proposed labeling.        i. Alternatively, the preliminary discussion may take place       as part of a pre-sNDA/sBLA meeting.        b. If FDA agrees that the pre-submission request meets the       STAR program eligibility criteria, the application will be       accepted into the STAR program, and the applicant will agree       to provide the complete application in two parts (these two       parts are described in the Split Submission Components       section below or as agreed to with the Review Division).        c. FDA will initiate review of the data upon receipt of the       Part 1 submission.        d. The PDUFA timeline will begin upon receipt of the Part 2       submission (which completes the application). FDA intends to       follow the expedited review timelines (as described in       Section I.E below). These timelines target taking an action       at least 1 month earlier than the applicable PDUFA goal date.        e. The filing meeting will be scheduled within 30 days of       FDA's receipt of the Part 2 submission. During the filing       meeting, FDA will determine an action date at least 1 month       in advance of the priority 6-month PDUFA goal date.        i. FDA will notify the applicant of the intended action       date in the filing letter. The PDUFA goal date will remain       unchanged.        3. Split Submission Components: Applications reviewed under       the STAR program will comprise two separate submissions.        a. The Part 1 submission initiates FDA's review and will       contain:        i. All components of the NDA/BLA efficacy supplement (e.g.,       complete datasets, proposed labeling, clinical protocols and       amendments, topline efficacy and safety results), except for       final clinical study reports for the adequate and well-      controlled investigation(s) supporting the proposed claim and       the eCTD module 2 clinical summaries, and        ii. A document providing topline results for each of the       adequate and well-controlled investigations will also be       provided in the Part 1 submission.        Any modifications to submission content are at the       discretion of the OND/CDER clinical division or CBER review       office and must be agreed to in advance.        b. The Part 2 submission initiates the PDUFA timeline and       will contain:        i. The clinical study reports for the adequate and well-      controlled investigation(s) (e.g., Phase 3 studies) intended       to support the proposed indication, and        ii. The eCTD module 2 clinical summaries not included in       the Part 1 submission.        Part 1 will be submitted approximately 2 months, and not       longer than 3 months, in advance of Part 2. If the Part 1       submission is incomplete (i.e., it does not include every       component described in Section D.3.a. above, except for       easily correctable minor deficiencies of components not       essential to initiating review, as determined by the OND/CDER       division or CBER review office), the review will not be       initiated until the application is complete and the       application will no longer be considered within the STAR       program.        4. Transparency: The Agency will develop a public-facing       webpage outlining detailed criteria for potential acceptance       and participation in the STAR program by October 1, 2022. FDA       will conduct an interim assessment that includes internal       activities related to STAR by the end of FY 2025. FDA will       also conduct a public workshop by the end of Q2 in FY 2026 to       discuss the potential value and feasibility of expanding the       pilot program to select NME NDAs and BLAs and solicit       feedback on experiences with the pilot program  [[Page S5181]]       from industry stakeholders. Outputs from the assessment and       workshop will be published in a publicly available report       summarizing both overall metrics for the pilot program and       external stakeholder feedback, including the percentage of       applications accepted into the program based on the number of       requests and the percentage of applications that had an       action date at least 1 month in advance of the priority 6-      month PDUFA goal date. FDA will also commit to training       review staff on STAR processes and providing a publicly       available report summarizing training activities conducted.        5. Implementation: The STAR program will be available to       applicants beginning in FY 2023. Expediting reviews will be       fully implemented by FY 2024 to allow time for FDA to hire       necessary staff to support the expedited timeline.      E. Expedited Reviews        The term ``expedited review'' in this letter refers to       FDA's review of either 1) a human drug application in the       Program that has received priority review designation and the       FDA review team identifies as meeting an important public       health need, or 2) an efficacy supplement in the STAR pilot       program, where the review team plans to act at least 1 month       before the PDUFA goal date provided that no significant       application deficiencies prevent an early action. In such       cases the FDA review team intends to make every effort to       conduct an expedited review and act early on the application.       FDA conducts expedited reviews to promote timely access to       critically needed therapies for patients without compromising       FDA's high standards for demonstrating the safety, efficacy,       and quality of new medicines. If significant application       deficiencies are identified by the review team at any time       during an expedited review, FDA intends to revert, for the       remainder of the review, to the normal priority review       approach, and will inform the applicant accordingly.      F. Review of Proprietary Names to Reduce Medication Errors        To enhance patient safety, FDA is committed to various       measures to reduce medication errors related to look-alike       and sound-alike proprietary names and such factors as unclear       label abbreviations, acronyms, dose designations, and error-      prone label and packaging design. The following performance       goals apply to FDA's review of drug and biological product       proprietary names during development (as early as end-of-      phase 2) and during FDA's review of a marketing application:        1. Proprietary Name Review Performance Goals During Drug       Development        a. Review 90% of proprietary name submissions filed within       180 days of receipt. Notify sponsor of tentative acceptance       or non-acceptance.        b. In the proprietary name is found to be unacceptable, the       sponsor can request reconsideration by submitting a written       rebuttal with supporting data or request a meeting within 60       days to discuss the initial decision (meeting package       required).        c. In the proprietary name is found to be unacceptable, the       above review performance goals also would apply to the       written request for reconsideration with supporting data or       the submission of a new proprietary name.        d. A complete submission is required to begin the review       clock.        2. Proprietary Name Review Performance Goals During       Application Review        a. Review 90% of NDA/BLA proprietary name submissions filed       within 90 days of receipt. Notify applicant of tentative       acceptance/non-acceptance.        b. A supplemental review will be done meeting the above       review performance goals if the proprietary name has been       submitted previously (investigational new drug (IND) phase       after end-of-phase 2) and has received tentative acceptance.        c. In the proprietary name is found to be unacceptable, the       applicant can request reconsideration by submitting a written       rebuttal with supporting data or request a meeting within 60       days to discuss the initial decision (meeting package       required).        d. In the proprietary name is found to be unacceptable, the       above review performance goals apply to the written request       for reconsideration with supporting data or the submission of       a new proprietary name.        e. A complete submission is required to begin the review       clock.      G. Major Dispute Resolution        1. Procedure:        For procedural or scientific matters involving the review       of human drug applications and supplements (as defined in       PDUFA) that cannot be resolved at the signatory authority       level (including a request for reconsideration by the       signatory authority after reviewing any materials that are       planned to be forwarded with an appeal to the next level),       the response to appeals of decisions will occur within 30       calendar days of the Center's receipt of the written appeal.        2. Performance goal:        90% of such answers are provided within 30 calendar days of       the Center's receipt of the written appeal.        3. Conditions:        a. Sponsors should first try to resolve the procedural or       scientific issue at the signatory authority level. If it       cannot be resolved at that level, it should be appealed to       the next higher organizational level (with a copy to the       signatory authority) and then, if necessary, to the next       higher organizational level.        b. Responses should be either verbal (followed by a written       confirmation within 14 calendar days of the verbal       notification) or written and should ordinarily be to either       grant or deny the appeal.        c. If the decision is to deny the appeal, the response       should include reasons for the denial and any actions the       sponsor might take to persuade the Agency to reverse its       decision.        d. In some cases, further data or further input from others       might be needed to reach a decision on the appeal. In these       cases, the ``response'' should be the plan for obtaining that       information (e.g., requesting further information from the       sponsor, scheduling a meeting with the sponsor, scheduling       the issue for discussion at the next scheduled available       advisory committee (AC)).        e. In these cases, once the required information is       received by the Agency (including any advice from an AC), the       person to whom the appeal was made again has 30 calendar days       from the receipt of the required information in which to       either grant or deny the appeal.        f. Again, if the decision is to deny the appeal, the       response should include the reasons for the denial and any       actions the sponsor might take to persuade the Agency to       reverse its decision.        g. N.B. If the Agency decides to present the issue to an AC       and there are not 30 days before the next scheduled AC, the       issue will be presented at the following scheduled committee       meeting to allow conformance with AC administrative       procedures.      H. Clinical Holds        1. Procedure:        The Center should respond to a sponsor's complete response       to a clinical hold within 30 days of the Agency's receipt of       the submission of such sponsor response.        2. Performance goal:        90% of such responses are provided within 30 calendar days       of the Agency's receipt of the sponsor's response.      I. Special Protocol Question Assessment and Agreement        1. Procedure:        Upon specific request by a sponsor (including specific       questions that the sponsor desires to be answered), the       Agency will evaluate certain protocols and issues to assess       whether the design is adequate to meet scientific and       regulatory requirements identified by the sponsor.        a. The sponsor should submit a limited number of specific       questions about the protocol design and scientific and       regulatory requirements for which the sponsor seeks agreement       (e.g., is the dose range in the carcinogenicity study       adequate, considering the intended clinical dosage; are the       clinical endpoints adequate to support a specific efficacy       claim).        b. Within 45 days of Agency receipt of the protocol and       specific questions, the Agency will provide a written       response to the sponsor that includes a succinct assessment       of the protocol and answers to the questions posed by the       sponsor. If the Agency does not agree that the protocol       design, execution plans, and data analyses are adequate to       achieve the goals of the sponsor, the reasons for the       disagreement will be explained in the response.        c. Protocols that qualify for this program include:       carcinogenicity protocols, stability protocols, and Phase 3       protocols for clinical trials that will form the primary       basis of an efficacy claim. For such Phase 3 protocols to       qualify for this comprehensive protocol assessment, the       sponsor must have had an end-of-Phase 2/pre-Phase 3 meeting       with the review division so that the division is aware of the       developmental context in which the protocol is being reviewed       and the questions being answered.        d. N.B. For products that will be using Subpart E or       Subpart H development schemes, the Phase 3 protocols       mentioned in this paragraph should be construed to mean those       protocols for trials that will form the primary basis of an       efficacy claim no matter what phase of drug development in       which they happen to be conducted.        e. If a protocol is reviewed under the process outlined       above and agreement with the Agency is reached on design,       execution, and analyses and if the results of the trial       conducted under the protocol substantiate the hypothesis of       the protocol, the Agency agrees that the data from the       protocol can be used as part of the primary basis for       approval of the product. The fundamental agreement here is       that having agreed to the design, execution, and analyses       proposed in protocols reviewed under this process, the Agency       will not later alter its perspective on the issues of design,       execution, or analyses unless public health concerns       unrecognized at the time of protocol assessment under this       process are evident.        2. Performance goal:        90% of special protocol assessments and agreement requests       completed and returned to sponsor within the timeframe.        3. Reporting:        The Agency will track and report the number of original       special protocol assessments and resubmissions per original       special protocol assessment.      J. Meeting Management Goals        Formal PDUFA meetings between sponsors and FDA consist of       Type A, B, B(EOP), C, Type D and INTERACT meetings. FDA plays       an active role during drug development by providing advice       and feedback to sponsors on the overall drug development       programs during meetings conducted between sponsors  [[Page S5182]]       and FDA. In general, FDA's guidance provided at these       meetings describe the Agency's current thinking on a topic       and should be viewed only as recommendations, unless specific       regulatory or statutory requirements are cited. These       meetings are further described below.        Type A meetings are those meetings that are necessary for       an otherwise stalled drug development program to proceed       (i.e., a ``critical path'' meeting) or to address an       important safety issue. Post-action meetings requested within       three months after an FDA regulatory action other than       approval (i.e., issuance of a complete response letter) will       also generally be considered Type A meetings.        Type B meetings include pre-IND meetings and pre-NDA/BLA       meetings, while Type B(EOP) meetings are reserved for certain       End-of-Phase 1 meetings (i.e., for 21 CFR Part 312 Subpart E       or 21 CFR Part 314 Subpart H or similar products) and End-of-      Phase 2/pre-Phase 3 meetings. Meetings regarding REMS or       postmarketing requirements that occur outside the context of       the review of a marketing application will also generally be       considered Type B meetings.        A Type C meeting is any type of meeting other than Type A,       B, B(EOP), D, or INTERACT.        A Type D meeting is focused on a narrow set of issues       (e.g., often one, but typically not more than two issues and       associated questions). Requests could include:        A follow-up question that raises a new issue after a formal       meeting (i.e., more than just a clarifying question about an       FDA response from a prior meeting);        A narrow issue on which the sponsor is seeking Agency input       with only a few associated questions; or        A general question about an innovative development approach       that does not require extensive, detailed advice.        Type D meetings should be limited to no more than 2 focused       topics. If the sponsor has several issues or a complex single       issue with multiple questions, a Type C meeting should be       requested rather than requesting several Type D meetings. In       addition, the issue should not require input from more than 3       disciplines or Divisions. If the scope of the meeting is       broad or includes complex questions/issues that require input       from more than 3 disciplines or Divisions, then FDA will       inform the sponsor that the Agency will be converting the       meeting to the appropriate meeting type (Type B or C) and the       sponsor can either withdraw their request or accept the FDA's       meeting-type conversion without re-submitting a new meeting       request.        1. INitial Targeted Engagement for Regulatory Advice on       CBER/CDER ProducTs (INTERACT) meetings are intended for novel       questions and unique challenges in early development (i.e.,       prior to filing of an IND). The issues typically relate to       IND requirements for example: questions regarding design of       IND-enabling toxicity studies (e.g., species, endpoints),       complex manufacturing technologies or processes, development       of innovative devices used with a drug or biologic, or the       use of cuttingedge testing methodologies. INTERACT meetings       are intended to facilitate IND-enabling efforts where the       sponsor is facing a novel, challenging issue that might       otherwise delay progress of the product towards entry into       the clinic in the absence of this early FDA input. Typically,       the issue is early in a development program--prior to when a       pre-IND meeting might be requested--and the issue may delay       initiation of, or progress of, IND-enabling studies. The       sponsor needs to have selected a specific investigational       product or a product-derivation strategy to evaluate in a       clinical study before requesting an INTERACT meeting.        a. Questions and topics within the scope of an INTERACT       meeting include:        i. Novel questions for all CDER and CBER products (i.e.,       questions where there is no existing guidance or other       information in writing the company could reference from FDA).        ii. These meetings are intended to provide FDA input on       issues that a sponsor needs to address prior to a pre-IND       meeting, including issues such as:        1) Choice of appropriate preclinical models or necessary       toxicology studies for novel drug platforms or drug       candidates;        2) CMC issues or testing strategies aimed to demonstrate       product safety, adequate to support first-in-human study;        3) Overall advice related to the design of proof-of-concept       or other pilot safety/biodistribution studies necessary to       support administration of an investigational product in a       first-in-human clinical trial;        4) General recommendations regarding a future first-in-      human trial in a target clinical population where the       population is novel and there is no prior precedent or       guidance;        5) Recommendations on approach for further development of       an early-stage product with limited CMC, pharmacology/      toxicology, and/or clinical data that were collected outside       of a US IND; and        6) Other topics that would be agreed upon by FDA.        2. Responses to Meeting Requests        a. Procedure: FDA will notify the requester in writing of       the date, time, and place for the meeting, as well as       expected Center participants following receipt of a formal       meeting request. Table 3 below indicates the timeframes for       FDA's response to a meeting request.                                   TABLE 3 ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                Response                                                                  Time                         Meeting Type                          (calendar                                                                 days) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A..........................................................           14 B..........................................................           21 B(EOP).....................................................           14 C..........................................................           21 D..........................................................           14 INTERACT...................................................           21 ------------------------------------------------------------------------         i. For any type of meeting, the sponsor may request a       written response to its questions rather than a face-to-face       or teleconference meeting. FDA will review the request and       make a determination on whether a written response is       appropriate or whether a face-to-face or teleconference       meeting is necessary. If a written response is deemed       appropriate, FDA will notify the requester of the date it       intends to send the written response in the Agency's response       to the meeting request. This date will be consistent with the       timeframes specified in Table 4 below for the specific       meeting type.        ii. For pre-IND, Type C, Type D, and INTERACT meetings,       while the sponsor may request a face-to-face meeting, the       Agency may determine that a written response to the sponsor's       questions would be the most appropriate means for providing       feedback and advice to the sponsor. When it is determined       that the meeting request can be appropriately addressed       through a written response, FDA will notify the requester of       the date it intends to send the written response in the       Agency's response to the meeting request. This date will be       consistent with the timeframes specified in Table 4 below for       the specific meeting type. If the sponsor believes a face-to-      face Pre-IND meeting is valuable and warranted, then the       sponsor may provide a rationale in a follow-up correspondence       explaining why a face-to-face meeting is valuable and       warranted, and FDA will convert where possible WRO to a face-      to-face meeting for requests that includes novel approaches       to clinical development and/or where precedents are not well       established.        b. Performance Goal: FDA will respond to meeting requests       and provide notification within the response times noted in       Table 3 for 90% of each meeting type.        3. Scheduling Meetings        a. Procedure: FDA will schedule the meeting on the next       available date at which all applicable Center personnel are       available to attend, consistent with the component's other       business; however, the meeting should be scheduled consistent       with the type of meeting requested. Table 4 below indicates       the timeframes for the scheduled meeting date following       receipt of a formal meeting request, or in the case of a       written response, the timeframes for the Agency to send the       written response. If the requested date for any meeting type       is greater than the specified timeframe, the meeting date       should be within 14 calendar days of the requested date.                                   Table 4 ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 Meeting Scheduling or                Meeting Type                     Written Response Time ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A.........................................  30 calendar days from                                              receipt of meeting request B.........................................  60 calendar days from                                              receipt of meeting request B(EOP)....................................  70 calendar days from                                              receipt of meeting request C.........................................  75 calendar days from                                              receipt of meeting request D.........................................  50 calendar days from                                              receipt of meeting request INTERACT..................................  75 calendar days from                                              receipt of meeting request ------------------------------------------------------------------------         b. Performance goal:        i. Type A, B, B(EOP) and C meetings: 90% of meetings are       held within the timeframe for each meeting type, and 90% of       written responses are sent within the timeframe for each       meeting type.        ii. Type D meeting: performance goals for FDA will be       phased in, starting in FY 2023 as follows:        1) By FY 2023, hold 50% of Type D meetings, or send written       response, within 50 calendar days from receipt of meeting       request.        2) By FY 2024, hold 60% of Type D meetings, or send written       response, within 50 calendar days from receipt of meeting       request.        3) By FY 2025, hold 70% of Type D meetings, or send written       response, within 50 calendar days from receipt of meeting       request.        4) By FY 2026, hold 80% of Type D meetings, or send written       response, within 50 calendar days from receipt of meeting       request.        5) By FY 2027, hold 90% of Type D meetings, or send written       response, within 50 calendar days from receipt of meeting       request.        INTERACT meeting: performance goals for FDA will be phased       in, starting in FY 2023 as follows:        1) By FY 2023, hold 50% of INTERACT meetings, or send       written response, within 75 calendar days from receipt of       meeting request.        2) By FY 2024, hold 60% of INTERACT meetings, or send       written response, within 75 calendar days from receipt of       meeting request.        3) By FY 2025, hold 70% of INTERACT meetings, or send       written response, within 75 calendar days from receipt of       meeting request.        4) By FY 2026, hold 80% of INTERACT meetings, or send       written response, within 75 calendar days from receipt of       meeting request.        5) By FY 2027, hold 90% of INTERACT meetings, or send       written response, within 75 calendar days from receipt of       meeting request.        4. Meeting Background Packages        The timing of the Agency's receipt of the sponsor       background package for each meeting type (including those       meetings for which a written response will be provided) is       specified in Table 5 below.  [[Page S5183]]                                     TABLE 5 ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 Receipt of Background                Meeting Type                            Package ------------------------------------------------------------------------ A.........................................  At the time of the meeting                                              request B.........................................  30 calendar days before the                                              date of the meeting or                                              expected written response B(EOP)....................................  50 calendar days before the                                              date of the meeting or                                              expected written response* C.........................................  47 calendar days before the                                              date of the meeting or                                              expected written response* D.........................................  At the time of the meeting                                              request INTERACT..................................  At the time of the meeting                                              request ------------------------------------------------------------------------ * If the scheduled date of a Type B(EOP) or C meeting is earlier than   the timeframes specified in Table 4, the meeting background package   will be due no sooner than 6 calendar days and 7 calendar days   following the response time for Type B(EOP) and C meetings specified   in Table 3, respectively.         5. Preliminary Responses to Sponsor Questions        a. Procedure: The Agency will send preliminary responses to       the sponsor's questions contained in the background package       no later than five calendar days before the meeting date for       Type B(EOP), C, D, and INTERACT meetings. For all other       meeting types, the FDA intends to send the requester its       preliminary responses no later than 2 calendar days before       the meeting.        b. Performance goal: 90% of preliminary responses to       questions for Type B(EOP), D, and INTERACT meetings are       issued by FDA no later than five calendar days before the       meeting date.        6. Sponsor Notification to FDA        Not later than three calendar days following the sponsor's       receipt of FDA's preliminary responses for a Type B(EOP), D,       INTERACT, or C meeting, the sponsor will notify FDA of       whether the meeting is still needed, and if it is, the       anticipated agenda of the meeting given the sponsor's review       of the preliminary responses.        7. Meeting Minutes        a. Procedure: The Agency will prepare minutes that will be       available to the sponsor 30 calendar days after the meeting       for Type A, B, B(EOP), C, and D. The minutes will clearly       outline the important agreements, disagreements, issues for       further discussion, and action items from the meeting in       bulleted form and need not be in great detail. Meeting       minutes are not required if the Agency transmits a written       response for any meeting type. For INTERACT meetings,       preliminary responses will be annotated and resent within 30       calendar days if advice provided changes as a result of the       meeting. In cases of a WRO, the WRO will serve as meeting       minutes from FDA.        b. Performance goal: 90% of minutes are issued within 30       calendar days of the date of the meeting.        8. Conditions        For a meeting to qualify for these performance goals:a.        A written request must be submitted to the review division.        b. The written request must provide:        i. A brief statement of the purpose of the meeting and the       sponsor's proposal for either a face-to-face/virtual/      teleconference meeting or a written response from the Agency;        ii. A listing of the specific objectives/outcomes the       requester expects from the meeting;        iii. A proposed agenda, including estimated times needed       for each agenda item;        iv. A listing of planned external attendees;        v. A listing of requested participants/disciplines       representative(s) from the Center with an explanation for the       request as appropriate; and        vi. The date that the meeting background package will be       sent to the Center. Refer to Table 5 for timeframes for the       Agency's receipt of background packages.        c. The Agency concurs that the meeting will serve a useful       purpose (i.e., it is not premature or clearly unnecessary).       However, requests for a Type B or B(EOP) meeting will be       honored except in the most unusual circumstances.        9. Guidance, Clarity, and Transparency        a. By September 30, 2023, FDA will issue a revised draft of       the existing draft guidance on ``Formal Meetings Between the       FDA and Sponsors or Applicants of PDUFA Products'' with       information pertaining to INTERACT, Type D meetings, and the       follow-up opportunity described below. In addition, FDA will       update relevant MAPPs and SOPPs.        b. Follow-up opportunity: For all meeting types, to ensure       the sponsor's understanding of FDA feedback from meeting       discussions or a WRO, sponsors may submit clarifying       questions to the agency. Only questions of a clarifying       nature will be permitted, i.e., to confirm something in       minutes or a WRO issued by FDA, rather than raising new       issues or new proposals. FDA will develop criteria and       parameters for permissible requests, and FDA may exercise       discretion about whether requests are in-scope. The       clarifying questions should be sent in writing as a ``Request       for Clarification'' to the FDA within 20 calendar days       following receipt of meeting minutes or a WRO. For questions       that meet the criteria, FDA will issue a response in writing       within 20 calendar days of receipt of the clarifying       questions. FDA's response will reference the original meeting       minutes or WRO.        c. Training: FDA will conduct external training to ensure       the best practices outlined in the draft guidances are       communicated to Industry.      K. Enhancing Regulatory Science and Expediting Drug           Development        To ensure that new and innovative products are developed       and available to patients in a timely manner, FDA will       continue to advance the use of biomarkers and       pharmacogenomics, enhancing communications between FDA and       sponsors during drug development, and advancing the       development of drugs for rare diseases. The extension and       continuation of this work will encompass further evaluation       and enhancement of FDA-sponsor communications, ensuring the       sustained success of the breakthrough therapy program,       continuing early consultations between FDA and sponsors on       the use of new surrogate endpoints as the primary basis for       product approval, advancing rare disease drug development,       advancing the development of combination products, and       exploring the use of real world evidence for use in       regulatory decision-making.        1. Promoting Innovation Through Enhanced Communication       Between FDA and Sponsors During Drug Development        FDA's philosophy is that timely interactive communication       with sponsors during drug development is a core Agency       activity to help achieve the Agency's mission to facilitate       the conduct of efficient and effective drug development       programs, which can enhance public health by making new safe       and effective drugs available to the American public in a       timely manner. Accordingly, FDA will maintain dedicated drug       development communication and training staffs in CDER and       CBER, focused on enhancing communication between FDA and       sponsors during drug development.        One function of the staff is to serve as a liaison that       will facilitate general and, in some cases, specific       interactions between sponsors and each Center. The liaison       will serve as a point of contact for sponsors who have       general questions about drug development or who need       clarification on which review division to contact with their       questions. The liaison will also serve as a secondary point       of contact in each Center for sponsors who are encountering       challenges in communication with the review team for their       IND (e.g., in instances when they have not received a       response from the review team to a simple or clarifying       question or referral to the formal meeting process within       30 days of the sponsor's initial request). In such cases,       the liaison will work with the review team and the sponsor       to facilitate resolution of the issue.        The second function of the staff is to provide ongoing       training to the review organizations on best practices in       communication with sponsors. The content of training       includes, but is not limited to, FDA's philosophy regarding       timely interactive communication with sponsors during drug       development as a core Agency activity, best practices for       addressing sponsor requests for advice and timely       communication of responses through appropriate mechanisms       (e.g., teleconferences, secure email, or when questions are       best addressed through the formal meetings process), and the       role of the liaison staff in each Center in facilitating       communication between the review staff and sponsor community,       including the staff's role in facilitating resolution of       individual communication requests. The staff will also       collaborate with sponsor stakeholders (e.g., through       participation in workshops, webinars, and other meetings) to       communicate FDA's philosophy and best practices regarding       communication with sponsors during drug development.        Best Practices for meetings are the responsibility of both       Industry and FDA. Efforts from both Industry and FDA are       needed in order to continue advancement, improvement, and       updating of best practices. To continue to enhance timely       interactive communication with sponsors during drug       development in PDUFA VII, FDA will do the following:        a. Public Workshop. FDA will hold a public meeting to       discuss best practices for meeting management by July 30,       2024, including issues related to submission of meeting       requests, efficient time management, coordinating meeting       agenda, development and submission of meeting background       packages and lessons learned from the Coronavirus Disease       2019 (``COVID-19'') pandemic including virtual meeting       platforms. Learnings from the public meeting could inform       FDA's internal process improvement efforts and, as       appropriate, be reflected in updating guidances, as noted       below. This public workshop will also discuss and share       experience and metrics related to all PDUFA meeting       activities, including Type D and INTERACT meetings. FDA will       discuss the number of meeting requests granted and denied for       INTERACT meetings, including a summary of rationales for       denied meeting requests. Reported metrics will include the       number of requests granted and denied for in-person pre-IND,       Type C, Type D, and INTERACT meetings. FDA and Industry will       agree on the information that FDA may share publicly in this       meeting.        b. Guidance. Based on the discussion at the public meeting       mentioned above in paragraph (a), and FDA's experience with       conducting meetings effectively, FDA will update public       documents, as appropriate, including publishing revised draft       or final version of the Best Practices for Communication       Between IND Sponsors and FDA During Drug Development guidance       mentioned below, 18 months after the public meeting is held.        c. Training. FDA will conduct external training to ensure       the best practices outlined in the guidances are communicated       to Industry.        2. Ensuring Sustained Success of Breakthrough Therapy       Program  [[Page S5184]]         Breakthrough therapy designation is intended to expedite       the development and review of drug and biological products,       alone or in combination, for serious or life-threatening       diseases or conditions when preliminary clinical evidence       indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial       improvement over existing therapies. A breakthrough therapy       designation includes the features of the fast track program,       intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development       program, and an organizational commitment by FDA involving       senior managers. FDA will continue to retain current       resources to enable the Agency to continue to work closely       with sponsors throughout the breakthrough therapy       designation, development, and review processes. Both FDA and       the regulated industry are committed to ensuring the       expedited development and review of innovative therapies for       serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions by       investing additional resources into the breakthrough therapy       program.        3. Early Consultation on the Use of New Surrogate Endpoints        FDA and industry believe that early consultation between       review teams and sponsors is important for development       programs where the sponsor intends to use a biomarker as a       new surrogate endpoint that has never been previously used as       the primary basis for product approval in the proposed       context of use. Early consultation in the drug development       program allows the review team to consult with FDA senior       management to evaluate the sponsor's proposal before       providing advice regarding the proposed biomarker as a new       surrogate endpoint to support accelerated or traditional       approval. Requests to engage with FDA on this topic will be       considered a Type C meeting request. The purpose of this       meeting is to discuss the feasibility of the surrogate as a       primary endpoint and identify any gaps in knowledge and how       they might be addressed. The outcome of this meeting may       require further investigation by the sponsor and discussion       and agreement with the agency before the surrogate endpoint       could be used as the primary basis for product approval. To       qualify for this consultation, these Type C meeting requests       must be accompanied by the complete meeting background       package at the time the request is made that includes       preliminary human data indicating impact of the drug on the       biomarker at a dose that appears to be generally tolerable.       The remaining meeting procedures as described in Section I.J       of this document will apply.        4. Advancing Development of Drugs for Rare Diseases        FDA will build on the success of rare disease programs in       CDER and CBER by continuing to advance and facilitate the       development and timely approval of drugs and biologics for       rare diseases, including rare diseases in children. The Rare       Diseases Team staff in CDER will continue to be integrated       into review teams for rare disease development programs and       application review to provide their unique expertise on       flexible and feasible approaches to studying and reviewing       such drugs to include, for example, innovative use of       biomarkers, consideration of non-traditional clinical       development programs, use of adaptive study designs,       evaluation of novel endpoints, application of new approaches       to statistical analysis, and appropriate use of FDA's       expedited development and review programs (i.e., Fast Track,       Breakthrough, Priority Review, and Accelerated Approval).       CBER, through its Rare Disease Program Staff, will also       ensure that its review offices consider such flexible and       feasible approaches in review.        The rare disease staff will also continue to provide       training to all CDER and CBER review staff related to       development, review, and approval of drugs for rare diseases       as part of the reviewer training core curriculum. The       objective of the training will be to familiarize review staff       with the challenges associated with rare disease applications       and strategies to address these challenges; to promote best       practices for review and regulation of rare disease       applications; and to encourage flexibility and scientific       judgment among reviewers in the review and regulation of rare       disease drug development and application review. The training       will also emphasize the important role of the rare disease       staff as members of the core review team to help ensure       consistency of scientific and regulatory approaches across       applications and review teams.        Rare disease staff will continue to engage in outreach to       industry, patient groups, and other stakeholders to provide       training on FDA's rare disease programs. The staff will       continue to foster collaborations in the development of tools       (e.g., patient reported outcome measures) and data (e.g.,       natural history studies) to support development of drugs for       rare diseases. In addition, the staff will also facilitate       interactions between stakeholders and FDA review divisions to       increase awareness of FDA regulatory programs and engagement       of patients in FDA's regulatory decision-making.        FDA will include updates on the activities and success of       the rare disease programs in the PDUFA annual performance       report to include, for example, the number of training       courses offered and staff trained, the number of review       programs where rare disease staff participated as core team       members, and metrics related to engagement with external       stakeholders. FDA will also continue to include information       on rare disease approvals in its annual reports on innovative       drug approvals, including utilization of expedited programs       and regulatory flexibility and appropriate comparative       metrics to non-rare disease innovative approvals.        a. Rare Disease Endpoint Advancement (RDEA) Pilot Program        The lack of regulatory precedent, small trial populations,       and/or limited understanding of disease natural history       associated with rare diseases creates unique challenges when       determining the appropriate efficacy endpoint(s) for clinical       trials intended to evaluate the effectiveness of rare disease       therapies.        Though difficult to establish, well-developed efficacy       endpoints, especially those that could apply to other rare       diseases with similar manifestations, drive the general       advancement of rare disease drug development. In addition to       challenges associated with developing endpoints that       appropriately capture key signs and symptoms of a rare       disease and directly measure how patients feel, function,       or survive, surrogate endpoint development is also       challenging in diseases with slow progression, small       patient populations, or other challenges commonly       associated with drug development in rare diseases.        Current mechanisms for sponsors of rare disease drug       development programs to collaborate with FDA are not       structured to provide repeated, intensive interactions with       the Agency. To support the advancement of rare disease       treatments, FDA will establish a pilot program for supporting       efficacy endpoint development for drugs that treat rare       diseases by offering additional engagement opportunities with       the Agency to sponsors of development programs that meet       specific criteria. In addition, FDA will develop the staff       capacity to enable and facilitate appropriate development and       use of these types of novel endpoints. This staff will       support the complex and intensive review work necessary to       evaluate novel endpoint development with a focus on the       challenges of trial designs utilizing small populations.        Scope. The RDEA pilot program will seek to advance rare       disease drug development programs by providing a mechanism       for sponsors to collaborate with FDA throughout the efficacy       endpoint development process. An endpoint, or endpoints, will       be considered eligible for proposal submission to RDEA if       each of the following criteria are met:        (1) The associated development program should be active and       address a rare disease, with an active IND or pre-IND for the       rare disease.        (a) Sponsors who do not yet have an active development       program but have, or are initiating, a natural history study       where the proposed endpoint is intended to be studied are       also eligible to apply.        (b) The FDA may also consider accepting a proposal for a       development program for a common disease that includes       innovative or novel endpoint elements, including the specific       endpoint and/or the methodology being developed, if there is       sufficient justification that the proposal could be       applicable to a rare disease.        (2) The proposed endpoint is a novel efficacy endpoint       intended to establish substantial evidence of effectiveness       for a rare disease treatment.        (a) An endpoint is considered novel if it has never been       used to support drug approval or if it has been substantially       modified from previous use to support drug approval.        (b) Preference will be given to proposals that have the       potential to impact drug development more broadly, such as       one that uses a novel approach to develop an efficacy       endpoint or an endpoint that could potentially be relevant to       other diseases. Preference will also be given to accepting       proposals that reflect a range of different types of       endpoints.        (c) For surrogate endpoint proposals, preference will be       given to those with novel approaches for collecting       additional clinical data in the pre-market stage to advance       the validation of these endpoints. If the sponsor is       proposing to develop a surrogate endpoint as part of a rare       disease application, participation in a prior Type C       Surrogate Endpoint meeting is encouraged.        (3) FDA will select a limited number of qualified proposals       for admission into RDEA that increases after the first year       of PDUFA VII:        (a) FY 2023: Sponsors may submit proposals beginning in Q4,       and FDA will accept a maximum of 1 proposal.        (b) FY 2024-FY 2027: FDA will accept up to 1 proposal per       quarter with a maximum of 3 proposals per year.        (c) Expansion of the program may be dependent on FDA       staffing.        Process and Timeline. The following steps summarize the       process for applying to and participating in the RDEA pilot       program:        (1) A sponsor who believes a development program qualifies       for participation in RDEA will submit a proposal to FDA that       includes a justification addressing each of the criteria       described above, including scientific justification for why       the endpoint is being explored to measure meaningful clinical       benefit in the disease/condition, relevant summaries of       pertinent information related to the endpoint from prior       studies, as well as a statement indicating if the company is       willing to allow disclosure of information for broader       development and educational purposes.        (2) FDA will confirm receipt of the sponsor's proposal       within 14 days of receipt.        (3) FDA will notify the sponsor with a final selection       decision no later than 60 days following the end of the FY       quarter during which it is submitted.  [[Page S5185]]         (4) Before FDA grants the initial meeting, FDA and the       sponsor will agree on the information that FDA may share       publicly. When feasible, FDA will notify a sponsor in advance       when the sponsor's program is the planned focus of a public       discussion. Participation in the pilot program, including       such agreement on information disclosure, will be voluntary       and at the discretion of the sponsor. If FDA and the sponsor       of an accepted proposal are unable to reach agreement on       elements for public disclosure, however, that proposal will       no longer be part of the RDEA pilot program and the Agency       will proceed with an alternate submission.        (5) Sponsors admitted to the RDEA pilot may participate in       up to 4 focused meetings with relevant FDA staff to discuss       endpoint development.        (a) The sponsor will provide a briefing document upon       submission of each meeting request.        (b) Each meeting will be scheduled within 45 days following       FDA's receipt of the sponsor's meeting request and complete       briefing document.        (c) The scheduling timeline may be shortened for meeting       requests to discuss narrow issues and/or questions at FDA's       discretion.        (d) The timing between each meeting is flexible and depends       on how much time the sponsor needs to identify new issues       and/or questions and prepare required materials for the next       meeting.        (6) Sponsors who have completed the maximum of 4 RDEA       meetings or do not have additional endpoint-focused questions       or issues to discuss with FDA may proceed with the standard       regulatory submission process.        (a) FDA's advice provided during and between RDEA meetings       does not constitute a regulatory decision and is considered       non-binding. Completing the 4 RDEA meetings does not       guarantee approval for a regulatory submission that includes       efficacy endpoints discussed during RDEA meetings.        (b) After completion of 4 RDEA meetings, the sponsor can       request additional input from FDA, as needed, through other       formal meeting mechanisms, such as Type B, Type C, Type C       Surrogate Endpoint, or Type D meetings.        (7) Sponsors who do not participate in the pilot will have       an opportunity to interact with the Agency through       traditional channels.        iii. Transparency and Endpoint Advancement. As part of       RDEA, FDA will conduct up to 3 public workshops by the end of       FY 2027 to discuss various topics relevant to endpoint       development for rare diseases, such as the use of multidomain       analysis methods. To promote innovation and evolving science,       novel endpoints developed through RDEA may be presented by       FDA, such as in guidance documents, on a public-facing       website, or at public workshops as case studies, including       prior to FDA's approval for the drug studied in the trial.       However, as noted above, before FDA grants the initial RDEA       meeting the Agency and the sponsor will agree on the       information that FDA may share publicly in these case       studies. When feasible, FDA will notify a sponsor in       advance when the sponsor's program is the planned focus of       a public discussion.        5. Advancing Development of Drug-Device and Biologic-Device       Combination Products Regulated by CBER and CDER        a. For Use-Related Risk Analysis (URRA)        Sponsors employ URRA to identify the need for risk       mitigation strategies and to design a human factors (HF)       validation study. Based on a URRA, a sponsor may propose that       a HF validation study is not needed to be submitted to       support the safe and effective use of a drug-device or       biologic-device combination product. FDA will establish the       following procedures for review of URRAs for combination       products:        i. The sponsor should submit a request for review of their       URRA to their IND. The submission should include specific       questions, justification that a HF validation study is not       needed to be submitted including any supporting information,       and scientific and regulatory requirements for which the       sponsor seeks agreement.        ii. Within 60 days of Agency receipt of the URRA and       specific questions, the Agency will provide a written       response to the sponsor that includes a succinct assessment       of the URRA and answers to the questions posed by the       sponsor. If the Agency does not agree that either the URRA or       the sponsor's justification are adequate to support the       absence of a HF validation study, the reasons for the       disagreement will be explained in the response.        iii. URRA submission: performance goals for FDA will be       phased in, starting FY 2024 as follows:        1) By FY 2024, review and notify sponsor of agreement or       non-agreement with comments for 50% of filed submissions,       within 60 days of receipt of submission.        2) By FY 2025, review and notify sponsor of agreement or       non-agreement with comments for 70% of filed submissions,       within 60 days of receipt of submission.        3) By FY 2026, review and notify sponsor of agreement or       non-agreement with comments for 90% of filed submissions,       within 60 days of receipt of submission.        4) By FY 2027, review and notify sponsor of agreement or       non-agreement with comments for 90% of filed submissions,       within 60 days of receipt of submission.        iv. By the end of FY 2024, FDA will publish new draft or       revised guidance for review staff and industry describing       considerations related to drug-device and biologic-device       combination products on the topics noted below.        Guidance that will convey FDA's current thinking regarding       how a URRA along with other information can be used to inform       when the results from an HF validation study may need to be       submitted to a marketing application. The guidance will       provide a comprehensive, systematic and stepwise approach       with examples, when applicable, to illustrate how to make       this determination.        v. Sponsors may still elect to submit a URRA with a HF       validation protocol and will only be subject to timelines in       Section I.K.5.b, For Human Factor Validation Study Protocols.        b. For Human Factor Validation Study Protocols        Human factors studies are conducted to evaluate the user       interface of a drug-device or biologic-device combination       product to eliminate or mitigate use-related hazards that may       affect the safe and effective use of the combination product.       Over the past decade, more combination products have been       developed to deliver therapeutics via different routes of       administration (e.g., parenteral, inhalation) with complex       engineering designs. HF validation protocols are reviewed       during the IND stage with the goal towards developing a final       finished combination product that supports the marketing       application. To achieve this objective, FDA will establish       the following procedures for review of HF validation study       protocols:        i. The sponsor should submit a human factors protocol to       the IND with specific questions, including scientific and       regulatory requirements for which the sponsor seeks agreement       (e.g., are the study participant groups appropriate to       represent intended users, is the study endpoint adequate, are       the critical tasks that should be evaluated appropriately       identified).        ii. Within 60 days of Agency receipt of the protocol and       specific questions, the Agency will provide a written       response to the sponsor that includes a succinct assessment       of the protocol and answers to the questions posed by the       sponsor. If the Agency does not agree that the protocol       design, execution plans, and data analyses are adequate to       achieve the goals of the sponsor, the reasons for the       disagreement will be explained in the response.        Performance goals for FDA will be as follows:        i. Beginning in FY 2023, review and provide sponsor with       written comments for 90% of human factors validation protocol       submissions within 60 days of receipt of protocol submission.        6. Advancing Real-World Evidence for Use in Regulatory       Decision-Making        In accordance with Section 3022 of the 21st Century Cures       Act, and by providing earlier and increased Agency advice,       the Advancing RWE Program seeks to improve the quality and       acceptability of RWE-based approaches in support of new       intended labeling claims, including approval of new       indications of approved medical products or to satisfy post-      approval study requirements. Specifically, FDA will do the       following:        a. By no later than December 31, 2022, FDA will establish       and communicate publicly a pilot Advancing RWE Program       intended to:        i. Identify approaches for generating RWE that meet       regulatory requirements in support of labeling for       effectiveness (e.g., new indications, populations, dosing       information) or for meeting post-approval study requirements;        ii. Develop agency processes that promote consistent       decision-making and shared learning regarding RWE;        iii. Promote awareness of characteristics of RWE that can       support regulatory decisions by allowing FDA to discuss study       designs considered in the Advancing RWE Program in a public       forum.        b. The Advancing RWE Program will include but not be       limited to the following activities and components:        i. FDA will solicit applications for the Advancing RWE       Program twice (i.e., two cycles) each year, asking sponsors       to describe--before protocol development or study       initiation--the regulatory question(s) they seek to address       with RWE, the proposed RWE study design, and the potential       real-world data (RWD) source(s) to support that design;        ii. FDA will use a structured review process to evaluate       and rank applications, based on the information they present       that the data may be fit-for-use, the study design will be       adequate, and the proposed study conduct can be anticipated       to meet regulatory requirements. Consideration will be given       to promoting diversity of data sources, study designs,       analytical methodologies and regulatory indications, as well       as to diversity of diseases under study and FDA Centers and       Offices involved;        iii. FDA will accept one to two eligible and appropriate       proposals each cycle in the first and second year (FY 2023-      2024) of the Advancing RWE Program and one to four eligible       and appropriate proposals each cycle thereafter (FY 2025-      2027);        iv. FDA will notify sponsors regarding acceptance or non-      acceptance of their submission within 45 days of the       application deadline;        v. FDA will convene the first of up to four dedicated       Advancing RWE Program meetings within 75 days of the       application deadline, with subsequent meetings to be       scheduled within 45 days after receiving a request for such       meetings from the sponsor;        vi. The Advancing RWE Program represents an optional       pathway for sponsors  [[Page S5186]]       submitting RWE proposals to an IND with CDER or CBER.       Regardless of whether an Advancing RWE application is       accepted, not accepted, or was never submitted to the       Advancing RWE Program, established procedures (e.g., formal       PDUFA meetings with the review division) will continue to be       available;        vii. Before FDA grants the initial meeting, FDA and the       sponsor will agree on the information that FDA may share       publicly. When feasible, FDA will notify a sponsor in advance       when the sponsor's program is the planned focus of a public       discussion. Participation in the pilot program, including       such agreement on information disclosure, will be voluntary       and at the discretion of the sponsor;        viii. If FDA and the sponsor of an accepted proposal are       unable to reach agreement on elements for public disclosure,       however, that proposal will no longer be part of the       Advancing RWE Program and the Agency will proceed with an       alternate submission (The timelines for meetings described       above would shift based on the dates of accepting alternate       submissions, if applicable.);        ix. Discussions at Advancing RWE program-related meetings       will focus on data, design, and regulatory issues that have       the potential to generate RWE in support of a proposed       regulatory decision;        x. FDA participation in the Advancing RWE Program,       including the selection process and program-related meetings,       will include representatives from relevant review divisions,       other offices with RWE expertise, and senior leadership with       expertise in RWE;        xi. Sponsors and FDA can decide that four meetings may not       be necessary if an agreed-upon protocol is identified.       Conversely, if FDA determines that key data- or design-      related problems make the protocol unlikely to support the       intended regulatory decision, then subsequent meetings within       the Advancing RWE Program may not be conducted;        xii. FDA and sponsors agree that the goal of the Advancing       RWE Program is general agreement on key design elements. The       acceptability of evidence generated from any completed study       is a subsequent review issue;        xiii. Sponsors who do not participate in the pilot will       have an opportunity to interact with the Agency through       traditional channels.        c. By no later than June 30, 2024, FDA will report       aggregate and anonymized information, on at least an annual       basis and based on available sources (e.g., information       provided by review divisions), describing RWE submissions to       CDER and CBER. The reports will describe application type       (e.g., primary focus on safety or effectiveness), data       sources used (e.g., medical claims, electronic health       records, registries, digital health technologies), study       design employed (e.g., randomized trial, externally       controlled trial, observational study), and regulatory       request (e.g., new indication, population, dosing       information, post-approval study requirement for a marketed       product). This reporting will include but not be limited to       protocols emerging from the Advancing RWE Program.        d. By no later than December 31, 2025, FDA will convene a       public workshop or meeting to discuss RWE case studies with a       particular focus on approaches for generating RWE that can       potentially meet regulatory requirements in support of       labeling for effectiveness (e.g., new indications,       populations, dosing information) or for meeting post-approval       study requirements.        e. By no later than December 31, 2026, experience gained       with the Advancing RWE Program, as well as CDER's and CBER's       RWE program in general, will be used to update existing RWE-      related guidance documents or generate new draft guidance, as       appropriate.      L. Enhancing Regulatory Decision Tools to Support Drug           Development and Review        Delivering new medicines to patients through biomedical       innovation requires advances in regulatory decision tools to       support drug development and review. FDA will build on the       successes of its efforts on Patient Focused Drug Development       (PFDD), benefit-risk assessment in regulatory decision-      making, and the drug development tools qualification pathway       for biomarkers. FDA will also continue to advance modern       approaches to enhance the efficiency of the drug development       and review processes, such as complex adaptive, Bayesian, and       other novel clinical trial designs and model-informed drug       development (MIDD).        1. Enhancing the Incorporation of the Patient's Voice in       Drug Development and Decision-Making        To facilitate the advancement and use of systematic       approaches to collect and utilize robust and meaningful       patient and caregiver input that can more consistently inform       drug development and, as appropriate, regulatory decision       making, FDA will conduct the following activities during       PDUFA VII:        a. FDA will continue to strengthen capacity to facilitate       development and use of Patient-Focused methods to inform drug       development and regulatory decisions. This includes expanded       internal staff training and external outreach to industry       sponsors and other involved stakeholders with emphasis on       patient-focused drug development (PFDD) methods and tools-      related guidance and practice to achieve broad acceptance and       integration into regulatory decision making across review       divisions and industry development programs. FDA will also       engage external experts, through a mechanism called the       Intergovernmental Personnel Act, to support the review of       patient experience data. These external methodological       experts will possess extensive knowledge in methods and       approaches related to patient experience data and will       augment existing internal expertise.        i. FDA will undertake a broad-based effort to conduct       outreach and training across review divisions, with follow-up       consultation as these methods gain broad acceptance and       integration, including development of methodology training       courses for review staff that will be conducted at least two       times per year.        ii. FDA will conduct targeted outreach to industry and       methodological consulting organizations to provide       presentations, sessions, and resources to increase       understanding, acceptance, and integration into development       programs.        b. FDA will issue a Request for Information (RFI) to elicit       public input on methodological issues, including the       submission and evaluation of patient experience data in the       context of the benefit-risk assessment and product labeling,       and other areas of greatest interest or concern to public       stakeholders. This RFI will be issued by no later than the       end of June 2023.        i. FDA will issue a Federal Register Notice summarizing the       input to the RFI by no later than the end of December 2023       and, based on the input received in response to the RFI, FDA       will plan to conduct at least 2 public workshops focused on       methodological issues.        ii. The first workshop will be held no later than the end       of FY 2024.        iii. The second workshop will be held no later than the end       of FY 2025.        iv. Based on the RFI and the learnings from the workshops,       FDA will produce a written summary with identified priorities       for future work no later than the end of FY 2026.        c. FDA will continue to work to develop a virtual catalog       of standard core sets of Clinical Outcome Assessments (COAs)       and Related Endpoints, pursuing non-user fee funding for the       work to develop standard core sets, which will be available       for public use. FDA will also work to enhance understanding       of how patient preference informs meaningful benefit or       benefit-risk tradeoffs in therapeutic areas.        d. A public input process through either the Federal       Register or Public Meetings will allow FDA to understand       stakeholder's perspectives on diseases and domains of       greatest need or highest priority for development of Standard       Core COAs and Endpoints as well as priority areas where       decisions are preference-sensitive and patient preference       information (PPI) data can inform regulatory decision-making.        e. By September 30, 2026, FDA will publish draft guidance       on use and submission of patient preference information to       support regulatory decision making. FDA will work towards the       goal of publishing final guidance within 18 months after the       close of the public comment period on the draft guidance. If,       after receiving comments on the draft guidance, FDA       determines that the guidance requires substantive changes on       which further public comments are warranted, FDA will issue a       revised draft guidance within those 18 months instead. It       then will work towards publishing a final guidance within 18       months after the close of the public comment period on the       revised draft guidance.        2. Benefit-Risk Assessment in Regulatory Decision-Making        Benefit-risk assessment is a foundation of FDA's regulatory       review of marketing applications for new human drugs and       biologics. FDA currently includes the Benefit-Risk Framework       in its NDA and BLA review training, processes, and templates       to support the conduct and communication of its benefit-risk       assessment. CBER incorporates benefit-risk assessment through       interdisciplinary review and has integrated the Benefit-Risk       Framework into its clinical review template for its new BLA       and supplement assessments. CDER has similarly integrated the       Benefit-Risk Framework into its clinical review and       decisional memo templates.        FDA is committed to continuing its implementation and       application of structured benefit-risk assessment in its       regulatory review processes and documentation. FDA will       continue to explore additional opportunities to enhance its       use and communication of its benefit-risk assessments for new       drug and biological review.        3. Advancing Model-Informed Drug Development        FDA will build on the success of the ``model-informed drug       development'' (MIDD) approaches by continuing to advance and       integrate the development and application of exposure-based,       biological, and statistical models derived from preclinical       and clinical data sources in drug development and regulatory       review. FDA will conduct the following activities during       PDUFA VII:        a. By no later than the end of 1st Quarter of FY 2023, FDA       will publish a Federal Register Notice announcing the       continuation of the MIDD paired meeting program, outlining       program eligibility, and describing the proposal submission       and selection process.        b. For sponsors participating in the MIDD paired meeting       program, FDA will grant a pair of meetings specifically       designed for this program, consisting of an initial and a       follow-up meeting on the same drug development issues. The       second meeting will occur within approximately 60 days of       receiving the briefing materials. These meetings will be led       by the clinical pharmacology or biostatistical review       components within CDER  [[Page S5187]]       or CBER in partnership with clinical staff at the relevant       center to ensure alignment with decision makers.        c. Starting in FY 2023, FDA will select 1-2 eligible and       appropriate proposals per quarter each year (i.e. up to 8 per       year). Additional proposals that meet the eligibility       criteria may be selected depending upon the availability of       resources. The internal review group instituted by FDA will       continue to review proposals on a quarterly basis and provide       recommendations on prioritization and selection of proposals       and share knowledge and experience.        d. Sponsors who do not participate in the MIDD paired       meeting program will have an opportunity to interact with the       Agency through traditional channels.        e. FDA will issue a Request for Information (RFI) to elicit       public input for identifying priority focus areas for future       policy or guidance development and stakeholder engagement.       This RFI will be issued by no later than the end of FY 2024.        4. Enhancing Capacity to Review Complex Innovative Designs        To facilitate the advancement and use of complex adaptive,       Bayesian, and other novel clinical trial designs, FDA will       conduct the following activities during PDUFA VII:        a. FDA will continue to develop CDER and CBER staff       capacity to enable processes to facilitate appropriate use of       these types of methods. This staff will support the       computationally intensive review work necessary to evaluate       complex adaptive, Bayesian, and other novel clinical trial       designs, with a particular focus on clinical trial designs       for which simulations are necessary to evaluate the operating       characteristics. FDA will also engage external experts       through existing FDA mechanisms (e.g., Intergovernmental       Personnel Act assignment) to support the review of complex       innovative designs. These methodological experts will possess       extensive knowledge in the aforementioned topics and will       augment existing internal expertise.        b. FDA will maintain the paired meeting program, selecting       1-2 eligible and appropriate proposals per quarter each year       (i.e. up to 8 per year) for highly innovative trial designs       for which analytically derived properties (e.g., Type I       error) may not be feasible, and simulations are necessary to       determine trial operating characteristics. Additional       proposals that meet the eligibility criteria may be selected       depending upon the availability of resources. For INDs in the       program, FDA will grant a pair of meetings, consisting of an       initial and follow-up meeting on the same design. The second       meeting will occur within approximately 90 days of receiving       the briefing materials. Management of the overall program as       well as specific meetings to discuss innovative designs will       be led by the biostatistical review components within CDER or       CBER in partnership with clinical staff at each center. The       opportunity for increased interaction with the agency will       provide better understanding of the agency's requirements for       trial simulations involved in the use of the pilot study       design and allow for iteration of design modifications, if       needed. In return, FDA's ability to publicly discuss example       designs as agreed upon with participating sponsors will       provide better clarity on the acceptance of different types       of trial designs that should facilitate their use in future       development programs.        i. By no later than the end of 1st Quarter of FY 2023, FDA       will publish a Federal Register Notice announcing the       continuation of the paired meeting program, outlining program       eligibility, and describing the proposal submission,       selection process, and example topics that will advance the       use of complex innovative designs and inform the development       of a guidance document.        ii. FDA will select up to 8 proposals each year from       proposals submitted to either CDER or CBER. The selections       are expected to be made on a quarterly basis. Program       selection will be prioritized based on trial design features       and therapeutic areas of high unmet need.        iii. To promote innovation in this area, trial designs       developed through the paired meeting program may be presented       by FDA (e.g., in a guidance, at public workshops and       conferences, on the Complex Innovative Design website) as       case studies, including while the drug studied in the trial       has not yet been approved by FDA. Before FDA grants the       initial meeting, FDA and the sponsor will agree on the       information that FDA may share publicly in these case       studies. When feasible, FDA will notify a sponsor in advance       when the sponsor's program is the planned focus of a public       discussion. Participation in the paired meeting program,       including such agreement on information disclosure, will be       voluntary and at the discretion of the sponsor.        c. In order to encourage increased submissions by CBER-      regulated sponsors to the complex innovative design (CID)       paired meeting program, CBER staff will continue to engage in       outreach to industry and other stakeholders. Such outreach       will include providing information on the paired meeting       program and its benefits, such as enhanced attention       regarding CID proposals and advancing the leveraging and       sharing of knowledge to support efficient product       development; clarifying policies and procedures for       submitting CID proposals for review; and presenting FDA's       current thinking on CID-related technical topics.        d. Sponsors who do not participate in this paired meeting       program will have an opportunity to interact with the Agency       through traditional channels. This program will not affect       FDA's existing procedures for providing advice on trial       designs.        e. By the end of 2nd Quarter FY 2024, FDA will convene a       public workshop to discuss aspects of complex adaptive,       Bayesian, and other novel clinical trial designs. Discussion       topics will include considerations for external data sources,       Bayesian statistical methods, simulations, and clinical trial       implementation (e.g. examples of defining and mitigating bias       when using select trial design methods) and will be based on       FDA accumulated experience both within and outside of the       paired meeting program.        f. By the end of FY 2025, FDA will publish draft guidance       on the Use of Bayesian Methodology in Clinical Trials of       Drugs and Biologics. FDA will work towards the goal of       publishing final guidance within 18 months after the close of       the public comment period on the draft guidance. If, after       receiving comments on the draft guidance, FDA determines that       the guidance requires substantive changes on which further       public comments are warranted, FDA will issue a revised draft       guidance within those 18 months instead. It then will work       towards publishing a final guidance within 18 months after       the close of the public comment period on the revised draft       guidance.        5. Enhancing Drug Development Tools Qualification Pathway       for Biomarkers        To facilitate the enhancement of the drug development tools       qualification pathway for biomarkers, FDA will conduct the       following activities during PDUFA VII:        a. FDA will continue to retain and enhance the staff       capacity to enhance biomarker qualification review by       increasing base capacity. FDA will also pilot processes to       engage external experts to support review of biomarker       qualification submissions.        b. FDA will continue to publish information on its website       regarding biomarker qualification submissions under section       507 of the FD&C Act, consistent with the requirements in       section 507(c), and to update the website quarterly.        c. Sponsors who do not use this qualification pathway will       have an opportunity to interact with the Agency through       traditional channels.      M. Enhancement and Modernization of the FDA Drug Safety           System        FDA will continue to use user fees to enhance the drug       safety system, including adopting new scientific approaches,       improving the utility of existing tools for the detection,       evaluation, prevention, and mitigation of adverse events,       modernizing REMS assessments, and coordinating regulatory       activity in the pre-market and post-market settings.       Enhancements to the drug safety system will improve public       health by increasing patient protection while continuing to       enable access to needed medical products.        User fees will provide support for 1) modernization and       improvement of REMS assessments and 2) optimization of the       Sentinel Initiative through a) maintenance of Sentinel       Initiative capabilities and continued integration into FDA       drug safety activities and b) enhancement of the analytic       capabilities of the Sentinel Initiative to address questions       of product safety and advance the understanding of how real-      world evidence can be used for studying effectiveness.        1. Modernization and Improvement of REMS Assessments        FDA will use user fee funds to modernize and improve REMS       assessments by incorporating REMS assessment planning into       the design of REMS, clarifying its expectations regarding       methods to evaluate the performance of REMS, increasing the       efficiency of FDA's review of REMS assessment reports, and       establishing FDA performance goals for review of REMS       assessment methods and study protocols.        a. By March 31, 2024, update relevant guidances to       incorporate REMS assessment planning into the design of the       REMS by providing recommendations regarding: 1) linking the       design with the assessments 2) ensuring sufficient and       appropriate data collection, and 3) identifying key metrics       for success (e.g., primary and secondary).        b. By March 31, 2024, FDA will issue new or update existing       policies and procedures for reviewing methodological       approaches and study protocols used to assess a REMS program.        c. Improve the efficiency of FDA's review of REMS       assessment reports.        i. By March 31, 2024, FDA will issue new or update existing       policies and procedures to systematically determine, as part       of the review of REMS assessment reports, if modifications to       the REMS or revisions to the REMS assessment plan are needed,       including the timing of the REMS assessments and to determine       whether the REMS is still necessary to ensure the benefits       outweigh the risks of the drug.        ii. By March 31, 2026, FDA will develop draft guidance       regarding the format and content of a REMS assessment report,       including the type of data that can support elimination of a       REMS. FDA will work towards the goal of publishing final       guidance within 18 months after the close of the public       comment period on the draft guidance. If, after receiving       comments on the draft guidance, FDA determines that the       guidance requires substantive changes on which further public       comments are warranted, FDA will issue a revised draft       guidance within those 18 months instead. It then will work       towards publishing a final guidance within 18 months  [[Page S5188]]       after the close of the public comment period on the revised       draft guidance.        d. Establish FDA review performance goals and provide       feedback and comments on REMS methodological approaches and       study protocols used to assess a REMS program for products       within 90 days of receipt. FDA proposes the following staged       implementation of review performance goals for review of       methodological approaches and study protocols for REMS       assessments in PDUFA VII:        i. FY 2024, review and notify sponsor with concurrence or       comments within 90 days of receipt for 50% of REMS assessment       methods and protocols        ii. FY 2025, review and notify sponsor with concurrence or       comments within 90 days of receipt for 70% of REMS assessment       methods and protocols        iii. FY 2026 and FY 2027, review and notify sponsor with       concurrence or comments within 90 days of receipt for 90% of       REMS assessment methods and protocols        2. Optimization of the Sentinel Initiative        The user fee funds initially provided in PDUFA VI to expand       the Sentinel program will continue to systematically       implement and integrate Sentinel and BEST (Biologics       Effectiveness and Safety) Systems in FDA drug safety       activities by sustaining the high quality and large quantity       of data available, allowing continued application of advanced       methods for determining when and how those data are utilized,       and ensuring comprehensive training of review staff on the       use of Sentinel and BEST. These capabilities will support the       use of the Sentinel Initiative for regulatory decision making       to address questions of product safety and advance our       understanding of how real-world evidence can be used for       studying effectiveness.        a. Maintenance of the Sentinel Initiative Capabilities and       Continued Integration into FDA Drug Safety Activities        FDA will use user fee funds to maintain the quality and       quantity of data available through the Sentinel Initiative       (Sentinel and BEST), to maintain the processes and tools for       determining when and how those data are utilized, and to       support comprehensive training of review staff on the use of       Sentinel.        i. FDA will maintain the Sentinel's sources of data and       core capabilities for the safety surveillance of drugs and       biologics, including the multisite ARIA system.        ii. FDA will continue its communication with sponsors and       the public regarding general methodologies for Sentinel       queries, including what the Agency has learned regarding the       most appropriate ways to query and use Sentinel data.        iii. By the end of FY 2025, FDA will publish on its website       an update on facilitation of public and sponsor access to       Sentinel's distributed data network to conduct safety       surveillance.        iv. FDA will continue to post study results, study       parameters and analysis code online and maintain a strong       Sentinel web presence to host this information.        v. FDA will continue to maintain a comprehensive FDA       Sentinel training program for all relevant staff (e.g.,       epidemiologists, statisticians, project managers, medical       officers, clinical analysts, and other review team members)       to ensure that staff have a working knowledge of Sentinel,       can identify when Sentinel can inform important regulatory       questions and decisions, and are able to consistently       participate in use of Sentinel to evaluate safety issues.        vi. By the end of FY 2025, FDA will analyze, and report on       the use of Sentinel for regulatory purposes, e.g., in the       contexts of labeling changes, PMRs, or PMCs.        vii. For FY 2023-2027, FDA will report its obligations for       updated PDUFA VI commitments for PDUFA VII Sentinel       Initiative annually in the PDUFA Financial Report. This       reporting will provide detail for spending categories (e.g.,       data infrastructure, analytical capabilities, safety issue       analyses, dissemination of relevant product and safety       information, and Sentinel system development).        b. Enhancement of the Analytic Capabilities of the Sentinel       Initiative to Address Questions of Product Safety and Advance       the Understanding of How Real-World Evidence Can Be Used for       Studying Effectiveness        FDA will use user fee funds to advance the analytic       capabilities of the Sentinel Initiative by i) developing a       consistent approach to post-market requirements and       commitments during NDA and BLA review related to assessing       the outcomes of pregnancies in women exposed to drugs and       biological products and clarifying the optimal use and value       of pregnancy registries and electronic healthcare data for       assessing pregnancy safety and ii) supporting the use of       real-world evidence to address questions of product safety       and advancing our understanding of how real-world evidence       may be used for studying effectiveness.        i. Pregnancy Safety        The goal of pregnancy safety post-market requirements and       commitments studies is to inform labeling on the safety of       use in pregnancy and to detect or evaluate safety signals in       a timely manner.        (1) FDA will develop a framework describing how data from       different types of post-market pregnancy safety studies might       optimally be used, incorporating knowledge of how different       types of postmarket studies have been used by FDA and       industry and identifying gaps in knowledge needed to be       filled by demonstration projects. The framework would       consider factors such as, but not limited to, purpose of       study, types of post-market studies, anticipated exposure in       females of reproductive potential (FRP) and pregnant women,       potential toxicity of the drug and proposed risk mitigation,       benefits of the drug, and magnitude and type of risk to be       detected. The framework would specifically address the use of       pregnancy registries and electronic healthcare data sources       including Sentinel, with a goal of ensuring the most       efficient means of obtaining highest quality safety data       available.        (a) FDA will review published literature and conduct a       review of types of post-market pregnancy data that have been       included in pregnancy labeling.        (b) By September 30, 2023, FDA will hold a public workshop       on post-market safety studies in pregnant women to facilitate       determination of the ideal post-market study design(s),       including industry experience and use of Sentinel Initiative       and other real-world data resources.        (c) By September 30, 2024, FDA will publish a workshop       report describing the proposed framework.        (2) Incorporating feedback from (1), conduct 5       demonstration projects to address gaps in knowledge about       performance characteristics of different study designs. FDA       will initiate the following demonstration projects which may       be modified as needed, before September 30, 2024:        (a) Assess the performance of pregnancy registries versus       electronic healthcare database studies to detect a signal       when the exposure to medication in pregnancy is relatively       common.        (b) Assess the performance of single arm safety studies       versus signal identification methods using electronic       healthcare data to detect a signal when the exposure to       medication in pregnancy is anticipated to be low.        (c) Assess the performance of pregnancy registries versus       electronic healthcare database studies to evaluate a signal       when the exposure to medication in pregnancy is relatively       common.        (d) Assess the performance of major congenital       malformations        (MCM) as a composite outcome in signal detection and       evaluation when there is true risk for some but not all       specific malformations.        (e) Assess the performance of an algorithm using electronic       health record (EHR) and claims-linked healthcare data for a       pregnancy-related outcome, or composite of outcomes (e.g.,       spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, congenital malformations),       after use of vaccines in pregnant women. The parameters of       the pregnancy-outcome algorithm will be developed to have       general usability with therapeutic products.        (3) By September 30, 2027, based on the results of       demonstration projects in (2) update the proposed framework       and develop a guidance or MAPP/SOPP as appropriate to       implement a standardized process for determining necessity       and type of pregnancy postmarketing studies including PMRs.        ii. Use of Real-World Evidence--Negative Controls        FDA is building Sentinel/BEST methodology to improve       understanding of robustness evaluations used to address the       consistency of RWE with respect to study design, analysis, or       variable measurement. FDA will develop new methods to support       causal inference in Sentinel/BEST that could address product       safety questions and advance our understanding of how RWE may       be used for studying effectiveness.        (1) By September 30, 2023, FDA will hold a public workshop       on use of negative controls for assessing the validity of       non-interventional studies of treatment and the proposed       Sentinel Initiative projects.        (2) FDA will initiate two methods development projects by       September 30, 2024 to 1) develop an empirical method to       automate the negative control identification process in       Sentinel and integrate it into the Sentinel System tools; and       2) develop a method to use a double negative control       adjustment to reduce unmeasured confounding in studying       effectiveness of vaccines.        (3) By September 30, 2027, FDA will publish a report on the       results of the development projects.      N. Enhancements Related to Product Quality Reviews,           Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Approaches, and           Advancing the Utilization of Innovative Manufacturing           Technologies        To ensure new and innovative products are developed and       available to patients in a timely manner, FDA and industry       will focus on enhancing communications during drug       development and application review, enhancing support for CMC       development and facilitating the CMC readiness of products       with accelerated clinical development timelines, and       advancing the implementation of innovative manufacturing       technologies.        1. Enhancing Communication Between FDA and Sponsors During       Application Review        To promote an efficient and effective application review       process, FDA will conduct the following activities during       PDUFA VII to enhance communication between the FDA review       teams and sponsors:        a. The four essential components of CMC information       requests (referred to as Four-Part Harmony) are intended to       ensure that the FDA requests information that is appropriate       to address the question or issue, in an efficient manner, and       at the appropriate timepoint within the review cycle or       product lifecycle, as applicable. Use of Four-Part Harmony       includes acknowledging what was  [[Page S5189]]       provided and where (e.g., modules, page numbers, as       applicable), identifying the issue or deficiency, clearly       identifying the information needed to achieve resolution and       make a regulatory decision, and identifying specific       references or other information to support FDA's request.       These four essential components of Four-Part Harmony are:        i. What was provided        ii.What is the issue or deficiency        iii. What is needed        v. Why it is needed        By the end of FY 2023, to promote FDA reviewers' use of       Four-Part Harmony, FDA will update and conduct training on       CDER MAPP 5016.8, ``Communication Guidelines for Quality-      Related Information Request and Deficiencies'' and CBER SOPP       8401.1, ``Issuance of and Review of Responses to Information       Request Communications to Pending Applications'' describing       the guidelines for the content of information requests, based       on the principles of Four-Part Harmony.        b. By the end of FY 2023, FDA will update and conduct       training on CMC assessment processes associated with mid-      cycle and late-cycle review meetings with the goal of       ensuring that mid-cycle and late-cycle meeting expectations       are met, including communicating the status of the NDA and       BLA CMC assessment and any identified issues that would       preclude approval.        c. FDA will contract with an independent third party to       assess current practices of FDA (CDER and CBER) and sponsors       in communicating through product quality information requests       (IRs) during application review, not including supplements.        The assessment will focus on the application of Four-Part       Harmony as described in the MAPPs and SOPPs (e.g., did FDA       state why the information is needed for the review of the       application) as well as seek to identify trends across IRs.       The statement of work for this effort will be published for       public comment prior to beginning the assessment. The third       party will be expected to separately engage both FDA staff       and individual sponsors through contractor-led interviews as       part of the assessment. The contractor-led interviews will be       designed to provide feedback from individual sponsors on the       effectiveness of Four-Part Harmony. Due to the significant       volume of IRs in a given year, the assessment will be based       on a subset of drug and biologic applications, not including       supplements, balanced across CDER and CBER, proportional to       the number of applications received by each Center. The third       party will identify best practices and areas for improvement       in communication between FDA review staff and sponsors       through IRs. FDA will publish the final report of the       assessment on FDA's website no later than June 30, 2025, for       public comment.        2. Enhancing Inspection Communication for Applications, not       Including Supplements        FDA and industry believe enhanced communication between       review teams and industry on certain pre-license inspections       and pre-approval inspections can facilitate an efficient       application review process.        When FDA determines for an application, not including       supplements, that it is necessary to conduct the inspection       at a time when the product identified in the application is       being manufactured, FDA's goal is to communicate its intent       to inspect a manufacturing facility at least 60 days in       advance of BLA Pre-license Inspections and NDA Pre-approval       Inspections and no later than mid-cycle. FDA reserves the       right to conduct manufacturing facility inspections at any       time during the review cycle, whether or not FDA has       communicated to the facility the intent to inspect.        3. Alternative Tools to Assess Manufacturing Facilities       Named in Pending Applications        During the COVID-19 public health emergency, the FDA       expanded its use of alternate tools for assessing facilities       named in applications, including exercising its authority to       request records and other information in advance of or in       lieu of an inspection, granted per section 704(a)(4) of the       Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21 U.S.C.       374(a)). Where appropriate, the agency also increased the use       of information, including inspection reports, shared by       trusted foreign regulatory partners through mutual       recognition agreements and other confidentiality agreements.       As FDA continues to gain experience and lessons learned from       the use of these tools, FDA will communicate its thinking on       the use of such methods beyond the pandemic.        By September 30, 2023, FDA will issue draft guidance on the       use of alternative tools to assess manufacturing facilities       named in pending applications (e.g., requesting existing       inspection reports from other trusted foreign regulatory       partners through mutual recognition and confidentiality       agreements, requesting information from applicants,       requesting records and other information directly from       facilities and other inspected entities, and, as appropriate,       utilizing new or existing technology platforms to assess       manufacturing facilities). The guidance will incorporate best       practices, including those in existing published documents,       from the use of such tools during the COVID-19 pandemic. FDA       will work towards the goal of publishing final guidance       within 18 months after the close of the public comment period       on the draft guidance. If, after receiving comments on the       draft guidance, FDA determines that the guidance requires       substantive changes on which further public comments are       warranted, FDA will issue a revised draft guidance within       those 18 months instead. It then will work towards publishing       a final guidance within 18 months after the close of the       public comment period on the revised draft guidance.        4. Facilitating Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls       Readiness for Products with Accelerated Clinical Development        Development programs for CDER- and CBER-regulated drugs and       biologics intended to diagnose, treat, or prevent a serious       disease or condition where there is an unmet medical need may       have accelerated clinical development timelines. Products       with accelerated clinical development activities often face       challenges in expediting CMC development activities to align       with the accelerated clinical timelines. Overcoming these CMC       challenges often requires additional interaction with FDA       during product development and the use of science-and risk-      based regulatory approaches so that the clinical benefits of       earlier patient access to these products can be realized.        a. MAPP: By December 31, 2022, FDA will issue a new MAPP on       approaches to address CMC challenges for CDER-regulated       products (drugs, biologics) with accelerated clinical       development timelines (e.g., products used to diagnose,       treat, or prevent a serious disease or condition where there       is unmet medical need). To address the CMC challenges, the       MAPP will describe early engagement with sponsors of such       products and the different science-and risk-based approaches,       including those described in the FDA Guidance for Industry:       Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions-Drugs and       Biologics, that may be warranted and utilized in CMC       development based upon the anticipated clinical benefit of       earlier patient access to the product. The MAPP will       incorporate modern pharmaceutical principles as well as       modern regulatory tools, such as those detailed in ICH Q12.        b. Pilot: Starting in FY 2023, FDA (CDER and CBER) will       conduct a CMC Development and Readiness Pilot (CDRP) to       facilitate the expedited CMC development of products under an       IND application, where warranted, based upon the anticipated       clinical benefit of earlier patient access to the products.       The goal of the Pilot will be to facilitate CMC readiness for       CBER- and CDER-regulated products with accelerated clinical       development timelines. Due to the differences in product       complexity between CBER- and CDER-regulated products, Pilot       selection criteria may differ between the Centers. In order       to accelerate CMC development and facilitate CMC readiness,       the Pilot will incorporate, as applicable, contemporary       learnings and the use of science- and risk-based approaches       and submission strategies, such as those described in the FDA       Guidance for Industry: Expedited Programs for Serious       Conditions-Drugs and Biologics.        For sponsors participating in the CMC Development and       Readiness Pilot, FDA will provide specific CMC advice during       product development by providing two additional CMC-focused       Type B meetings and an additional limited number of CMC-      focused discussions based on readiness and defined CMC       milestones. The increased communication between FDA review       staff and applicants is intended to ensure a mutual       understanding of what activities must be completed, and what       information should be provided at the appropriate timepoint       (i.e., at the time of NDA or BLA submission, prior to the end       of the review cycle, or post-approval), to ensure CMC       readiness of the product.        i. By December 31, 2022, FDA will publish a Federal       Register Notice (FRN) announcing the Pilot and outlining the       eligibility criteria and process for submitting a request to       participate in the Pilot. For CDER, the eligibility criteria       will focus on the selection of products with accelerated       clinical development timelines that could expand or enhance       the approaches in the CDER MAPP described above. For CBER,       the eligibility criteria will include considerations for       products with accelerated clinical development timelines       (e.g., vaccines and cell and gene therapies).        The FRN will give more specifics on products to be included       in the Pilot and will consider Industry's interest in CBER-      regulated products such as cell and gene therapies. FDA will       select between 8-10 proposals per fiscal year over a 4-year       period.        ii. To promote innovation and understanding in this area,       lessons learned through the Pilot may be presented by FDA       (e.g., in a public workshop) as case studies, including when       the product studied in the Pilot has not yet been approved by       FDA. To be eligible for the Pilot, the sponsor and FDA will       reach an agreement on the information to be publicly       disclosed. When feasible, FDA will notify a sponsor in       advance when the sponsor's program is the planned focus of a       public discussion. Participation in the pilot program,       including such agreement on information disclosure, will be       voluntary and at the discretion of the sponsor.        iii. Sponsors who do not participate in the Pilot will have       an opportunity to interact with the Agency through existing       channels.        c. Public Workshop: By July 31, 2025, FDA will conduct a       public workshop, potentially through a qualified third party,       focused on CMC aspects of expedited development including       case studies, lessons learned, and stakeholder input       regarding the CMC Development and Readiness Pilot. The       workshop will solicit and include industry and public       feedback.        Topics for the workshop will include, but are not limited       to, the use of science and risk-based approaches and       submission strategies to accelerate CMC development,       including predictive stability modeling, risk-based       approaches to product specification setting,  [[Page S5190]]       and alternate process validation approaches, as well as       experiences related to quality by design and platform       technologies.        d.

The strategy document may       include updating or creating new procedures, MAPPs, SOPPs,       guidances, and scientific/other relevant programs related to       the topics discussed in the workshop. The strategy document       will also include proposed timeframes for the specific       actions outlined in the document.        FDA will consider public input and finalize the strategy       document within 9 months after the close of the public       comment period on the draft strategy document.      O. Enhancing CBER's Capacity to Support Development, Review,           and Approval of Cell and Gene Therapy Products        To ensure that new and innovative cell and gene therapy       products are developed and available to patients in a timely       manner, FDA will build on the success of the Cell and Gene       Therapy Program (CGTP) in CBER to further support and advance       a balanced approach to product development and regulation. To       this end, FDA will substantially strengthen staff capacity       and capability in order to meet the increasing challenges and       demands in this growing field. Increasing staff capacity will       overcome existing resource limitations, allowing staff to       spend additional time on meetings and submission reviews       including those with breakthrough or regenerative medicine       advanced therapy designations, expand stakeholder outreach,       invest in new policy and guidance, and facilitate development       and use of regulatory tools and scientific technologies.        The CGTP will be augmented with additional resources to       sustain and expand the program. Staff will be hired for       direct review activities, indirect activities (e.g., policy,       external outreach, postmarket safety), and supporting       activities in the CGTP, with a focus on hiring staff with       technical, scientific, clinical, or other specialized       expertise necessary to understand and advance cell and gene       therapies. Recruiting and hiring of staff will be actively       pursued as a CBER priority and be facilitated by support       staff whose dedicated focus will be attracting and retaining       talent for the CGTP. CBER recognizes the importance of       integration of new staff into the CGTP and will effectively       facilitate growth in staffing using external consultants when       appropriate. For PDUFA VII, resources will also support       onboarding and integration of new staff, regulatory support       and outreach (e.g., webinars, recorded training) to       facilitate industry and stakeholder education and       interaction.        CBER will continue to maintain a highly trained and       experienced CGTP staff, with an emphasis on remaining current       in regulatory science, and the latest scientific,       manufacturing, and clinical advances. The current staff       training will be reviewed, with input from external       consultants, and modified as needed to accommodate and       facilitate training of new staff and maintain the competency       of existing staff.        CBER will continue to organize and manage the CGTP for       optimal performance, leveraging and implementing best       practices from relevant sources. The current CGTP       organization will be evaluated, with input from external       consultants, to determine the optimal organization to       effectively integrate new staff and facilitate operations and       customer service. As part of CBER's modernization program,       CBER will evaluate, streamline, and harmonize CGTP       procedures, processes, and interactions to facilitate       communications, enhance regulatory consistency and review       standards, reduce regulatory burden, optimize operational       efficiency, and update relevant SOPPS and documents as       needed. Change management will be tailored to ensure success       of organizational changes and business modernization.        The CGTP staff will enhance communications with       stakeholders, on an individual and collective level, by       refining and improving best practices for communication,       through public meetings and workshops, and issuance of       guidance, updating relevant SOPPS, and other mechanisms. CBER       will continue to issue new guidance on current cell and gene       therapy topics and update existing guidance to be current       with evolving science and approaches. Staff will increase       awareness of FDA's regulatory programs through on-demand       training (e.g., recorded webcast), to facilitate navigation       by industry through the phases of product development and       approval. CGTP staff will continue to engage in outreach to       industry, patient groups, and other stakeholders in several       areas soliciting views on specific topics and proposals.        Staff will continue to participate in external       collaborations, including public-private partnerships and       international organizations in a variety of areas, including       development of tools (e.g., standards), technologies, and       approaches that support development of cell and gene       therapies. Interactions will also focus on advancing       manufacturing and testing, including facilitating       implementation of new technologies. With stakeholders, staff       will continue discussing use of existing approaches (e.g.,       surrogate endpoints, real world evidence, complex innovative       designs, natural histories) and explore new approaches for       obtaining efficacy and safety information with specific       consideration and attention to rare and ultra-rare diseases.        To advance the field and support the next generation of       cell and gene therapy products, CBER will conduct the       following activities during PDUFA VII.        1.

By the end of FY 2025, FDA will issue a draft guidance       on the evaluation of efficacy in small patient populations       using novel trial designs and statistical methods, and how       these concepts can be applied to more common diseases. FDA       will work towards the goal of publishing final guidance       within 18 months after the close of the public comment period       on the draft guidance. If, after receiving comments on the       draft guidance, FDA determines that the guidance requires       substantive changes on which further public comments are       warranted, FDA will issue a revised draft guidance within       those 18 months instead. It then will work towards publishing       a final guidance within 18 months after the close of the       public comment period on the revised draft guidance.        c. In order to promote development of cell and gene therapy       products, FDA will issue a Questions and Answers draft       guidance by the end of FY 2024 based on frequently asked       questions, and commonly faced-issues identified by sponsors       or by public-private partnerships. FDA will work towards the       goal of publishing final guidance within 18 months  [[Page S5191]]       after the close of the public comment period on the draft       guidance. If, after receiving comments on the draft guidance,       FDA determines that the guidance requires substantive changes       on which further public comments are warranted, FDA will       issue a revised draft guidance within those 18 months       instead. It then will work towards publishing a final       guidance within 18 months after the close of the public       comment period on the revised draft guidance.        d. By the end of FY 2024, FDA will convene a public meeting       to solicit input on methods and approaches (e.g., use of RWE,       registries) for capturing post-approval safety and efficacy       data for cell and gene therapy products. Within 6 months of       the public meeting, FDA will issue a summary report or a       transcript of the meeting. Input from this meeting will be       used to inform development of a draft guidance on this topic.       FDA will issue a draft guidance on this topic by the end of       FY 2025. FDA will work towards the goal of publishing final       guidance within 18 months after the close of the public       comment period on the draft guidance. If, after receiving       comments on the draft guidance, FDA determines that the       guidance requires substantive changes on which further public       comments are warranted, FDA will issue a revised draft       guidance within those 18 months instead. It then will work       towards publishing a final guidance within 18 months after       the close of the public comment period on the revised draft       guidance.        3. Expedited Programs for the Development of Regenerative       Medicine Therapies:        a.

FDA will confirm progress in the hiring of PDUFA VI new       staff. FDA will also report on progress against the hiring       goals for FY 2023-2027 on a quarterly basis posting updates       to the FDA website PDUFA Performance webpage.      B. Assessment of Hiring and Retention        The Directors of CDER and CBER will utilize a qualified,       independent contractor with expertise in assessing HR       operations to conduct a targeted assessment of the hiring and       retention of staff for the human drug review program. The       contractor will assess the factors that contribute to HR       successes and challenges, including factors outside of FDA's       control. The assessment will build upon the findings of       previous evaluations conducted under PDUFA VI with a focus on       the changes and adjustments that have improved FDA's hiring       and retention outcomes and which challenges remain. In       addition to evaluating the outcomes of various hiring       changes, the assessment will include metrics related to       recruiting and retention in the human drug review program,       including, but not limited to, specific targeted scientific       disciplines, attrition, and utilization of pay authorities.       The report will include the contractor's findings and       recommendations on further enhancements to hiring and       retention of staff for the human drug review program, if       warranted.        The assessment will be published on FDA's website no later       than the June 30th, 2025 for public comment. FDA will also       hold a public meeting no later than the September 30th, 2025       to discuss the report, its findings, and the Agency's       specific plans to address the report recommendations.             IV. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND BIOINFORMATICS GOALS       A. Enhancing Transparency and Leveraging Modern Technology        Under PDUFA VII, FDA will:        1. Enhance Transparency        FDA will further enhance transparency of its IT activities       and modernization plans, as well as continue to ensure the       usability and improvement of the electronic submissions       gateway (ESG):        a. Quarterly, FDA and industry will jointly plan and       conduct meetings on challenges, emerging needs, and progress       on initiatives relevant to PDUFA, including continued       sustainability of initiatives after completion in PDUFA VII,       progress or activities on harmonization and convergence,       where appropriate, across Center systems for streamlined       compatibility, interoperability, and extensibility. Agendas       and meeting materials will be shared prior to each meeting.        b. Annually, appropriate FDA and industry IT leadership       (e.g., enterprise IT leadership, Center IT leadership) will       participate in a review of PDUFA IT initiatives and provide       an opportunity for industry input.        c. FDA will engage industry to provide feedback and/or       participate in pilot testing in advance of implementing       significant changes that impact industry's interaction with       the enterprise-wide systems.        d. FDA will maintain a current published FDA Data Standards       Catalog, and quarterly publish an updated data standards       action plan.        2. Develop Data and Technology Modernization Strategy        FDA will progress a Data and Technology Modernization       Strategy (``Strategy'') that provides FDA's strategic       direction for current and future state data-driven regulatory       initiatives.        a. No later than Q4 FY 2023, FDA will establish a Data and       Technology Modernization Strategy that reflects the vision in       FDA's Technology and Data Modernization Action Plans,       including:        i. outlining key areas of focus and approach including       leveraging cloud technologies to support Applicant-FDA       regulatory interaction;        ii. articulating enterprise-wide approaches for both       technology and data governance; and        iii. aligning strategic initiatives in support of PDUFA       review goals, drawing a line of sight between initiatives and       the enterprise strategy (i.e. the agency-wide strategy also       supporting components outside PDUFA).        b. The Strategy will be shared and annually updated to       reflect progress and any needed adjustments. Milestones and       metrics for PDUFA initiatives will be included in the       updates.        3. Promote Convergence        As appropriate, FDA will engage with stakeholders and       international consortia (e.g., ICH, ICMRA) on technology and       innovation initiatives that promote convergence in data       interoperability and interpretability for current and future       FDA initiatives throughout the regulatory lifecycle.        a. FDA will seek to adopt international standards where       feasible and appropriate, giving considerations to       cybersecurity risk, international commitments, legal       constraints, and other relevant factors.        4. Accelerate CBER Modernization        During PDUFA VII, CBER will retire its older IT systems and       capabilities, leverage capabilities in other Centers where       feasible, and utilize new data management tools and       technologies in line with Agency strategic plans and       effective use of resources.        In coordination with CDER and CDRH, CBER will accelerate       its data and IT modernization in order to leverage or develop       state-of the art IT technology to provide cloud-based, agile,       and stable integrated platforms, to streamline and improve       its ability to perform complex reviews, access, utilize and       protect data, and redirect IT spending from maintenance of       older IT systems to improving the reviewer experience.       Modernization efforts will enable new capabilities such as       knowledge management, data and analytic reporting, decision       tools, and, workflow and workload management to be developed       sooner. CBER will share its experience and new capabilities       with other Centers.        b. By the end of Q4 FY 2022, CBER will have established a       multi-year modernization roadmap, including concrete       implementation phases and milestones with defined success and       performance criteria and anticipated costs.        i. Criteria may include, for example, retiring a minimum       25% of CBER legacy systems and capabilities by the end of       PDUFA VII; leveraging existing adverse events reporting       capabilities for CBER adverse event reporting; transitioning       regulatory data and analytics to a new shared environment;       using a new electronic review management tool and knowledge       management system.        ii. These and other modernization efforts will allow for       measurable improved review and internal management of novel       and scientifically complex PDUFA biologics, leading to       enhanced review efficiency, effectiveness and quality.        iii. Modernization outcomes will facilitate external       interactions with developers, manufacturers, and other       stakeholders--resulting in faster information exchange, data       analysis, and dissemination of safety information; and better       consistency of advice and decisions to guide and foster       product development and review.        c. Annually and at key milestones, CBER will share its       roadmap, provide updates on its progress including successes,       issues, performance metrics, accomplishments and any issues       or necessary adjustments to accommodate unexpected events       (e.g., contracting, delays outside of CBER control) or       reasonable deviations from its modernization roadmap. This       information will be shared at regularly scheduled FDA-      industry meetings.        d. In order to ensure successful modernization, CBER       maintains active management and oversight of its IT and Data       projects through a structured system of controls that covers       all phases of projects. CBER will not progress to the next       phase of implementation for an IT modernization project       without successful completion of the previous phase.        e. CBER will scope and plan its IT modernization activities       to conclude by the end of FY 2027 with no expectation of       continued additional direct costs funding to support the       effort beyond PDUFA VII.        5. Monitor and Modernize ESG        FDA will continue to ensure the usability and improvement       of the ESG.        a. Annually, FDA will provide on the ESG website historic       and current metrics on ESG performance in relation to       published targets, characterizations and volume of       submissions, and standards adoption and conformance.        FDA will advance the ESG cloud-based modernization with an       improved architecture that supports greatly expanding data       submission bandwidth and storage, while continuing to ensure       its stable operation.        a. By the end of FY 2025, FDA will complete ESG transition       to the cloud, including set-up and integration of an       enterprise Identity and Access Management solution that will       streamline applicant access to FDA resources.        b. Annually, FDA will share progress against the       implementation project plan.        c. FDA will engage industry to provide feedback and/or       participate in pilot testing in advance of implementing       significant changes that impact industry's interaction with       the enterprise-wide systems.        6. Leverage Cloud Technology to Progress Regulatory Digital       Transformation        Cloud and cloud-based technology offer significant       advantages over traditional on-premise data repositories and       analytics. Combined with interoperable information exchange       mechanisms, these advantages open a host of new opportunities       to explore, promote and implement innovation in the drug       development and regulatory review process.  [[Page S5193]]         The outcomes of demonstration projects in PDUFA VII will be       the building blocks, informing and positioning FDA and       regulated industry to take best advantage of third-party       hosted capabilities in conjunction with their own       infrastructure, as well as investigating the potential for       such capabilities to be jointly leveraged by other regulatory       authorities and applicants.        a. FDA will engage with external parties to develop and       test reusable and portable core capabilities that can be       supported both with FDA's environment and in trusted third-      party environments. This engagement will be through       mechanisms such as, but not limited to, cooperative       agreements, contracts, Cooperative Research and Development       Agreements (CRADAs) and public-private partnerships.        b. By the end of Q3 FY 2023, FDA will assess challenges or       barriers in FDA's adoption of cloud-based technologies in       applicant-regulator interactions and within 6 months will       publish the findings of this assessment.        c. In FY 2023, FDA, in consultation with industry, will       prioritize and initiate the first of at least 3 demonstration       projects to explore application of cloud-based technologies       to streamline, improve and enable a variety of applicant-      regulator interactions.        i. In support of the use of DHT-derived data in       applications, FDA will enhance its capability to effectively       receive, aggregate, store, and process large volumes of       static or continuously updated DHT-derived data captured as       part of a clinical trial.        ii. Projects will demonstrate applications of cloud       technology to applicant-regulator interactions and secure       shared environments for specific regulatory activities (e.g.,       support labeling negotiations between FDA and applicants,       develop a standard protocol template to accelerate review and       provide usable archive, improve statistical analysis plan       between FDA and applicants).        iii. Projects will develop increasingly rich and flexible       technical capabilities that can be leveraged for multiple       purposes by regulators and industry, either internally within       a regulator's or industry's environment, or through a trusted       third-party, thus promoting convergence through common       components such as Cloud-hosted Individualized Secure       Collaboration Hubs (ISCH) which provide secure and effective       environments for various cloud-based collaboration       initiatives;        1) An example might be to utilize an ISCH for applicant-      regulator label negotiations; another might be to hold       continuously updated DHT-derived data for analysis.        d. Within 6 months of completion of a demonstration       project, a summary of outcomes and next steps will be       compiled and shared with industry at the regularly scheduled       FDA-industry meetings. A description of the project and       summary of outcomes will be posted on the FDA website.        e. FDA will engage industry to provide feedback and/or       participate in testing in advance of implementing significant       changes that impact industry's interaction with the       enterprise-wide systems.        i. FDA will review progress and plans at quarterly meetings       with industry.        f. Demonstration projects and associated capabilities       development will be completed by the end of FY 2027 with no       expectation of additional funding for those activities beyond       PDUFA VII.        7. Provide Bioinformatics IT Support        CDER and CBER are seeing increasing volume and diversity of       bioinformatics and computational biology information and       data, such as Next Generation Sequencing, in sponsor-      regulator interactions. Bioinformaticists play an essential       and expanding role in new drug and biologic application       reviews, providing in-depth independent analysis of submitted       data to support review decisions in close coordination with       clinical and product experts. To be effective entails       appropriate IT support.        a. FDA will assess its bioinformatics capabilities, and       annually, ensure that IT resources are provided to support       bioinformatics activities, including software licensing,       cloud-based storage and computing capacity, operations       support and maintenance.        b. Outcomes will be shared at regularly scheduled FDA-      industry meetings.      B. Expanding and Enhancing Bioinformatics Support        Bioinformatics and computational biology are increasingly       being used to assess product quality, safety and efficacy and       facilitate the development, characterization and manufacture       of human drugs and biologics. Recognizing the substantial       increase in the volume and diversity of bioinformatics and       computational biology information and data, such as Next       Generation Sequencing, in regulatory submissions, FDA will       develop additional expertise and staff capacity in both CDER       and CBER to efficiently review and provide technical and       timely feedback on information and accompanying data in       submissions and meet performance goals, especially for those       submitted early in development. FDA will hire technical       expertise necessary to assess the approaches and evaluate       data as appropriate, validating the results and/or analytic       process using existing tools or through independent analysis       when necessary. Staff with specialized expertise in specific       product/therapeutic areas will also be developed to       facilitate translation of bioinformatic information to       subject matter review experts. FDA will also assess and       strengthen its computational infrastructure to support and       advance its informatics platforms, allowing FDA to remain       current with the most recent technology in the field. To       facilitate submission and review of bioinformatics and       computational biology information, FDA will continue to       develop data standards and revise guidance or issue draft       guidance on this topic including how to submit, and format       submissions, and technical validation criteria. FDA will work       globally to advance harmonization of these standards and       methodologies.      C. Enhancing use of Digital Health Technologies to Support           Drug Development and Review        A Digital Health Technology (DHT) in the context of this       commitment may be considered as a system that uses computing       platforms, connectivity, software, and sensors for healthcare       and related uses. These technologies may span a wide range of       uses, from applications in general wellness to applications       as a medical device to applications generating data that may       be used in the evaluation of drug or biologic products.        DHTs can allow for remote data acquisition from patients       and clinical trial participants to measure a wide range of       activities, behaviors, and functioning in real life settings       that can inform important clinical endpoints. DHTs may       include wearable, implantable, ingestible, and environmental       sensors or software applications on mobile devices, among       other approaches. The use of DHTs can support and enable the       conduct of decentralized clinical trials (DCTs), the clinical       investigations in which some or all trial-related procedures       and data acquisition take place at locations remote from the       investigator.        While the biomedical field has experienced rapid       development and implementation of DHTs, FDA has limited       experience evaluating novel DHT-based measurements in human       drug development. FDA recognizes the potential for DHTs to       provide scientific and practical advantages in supporting the       assessment of patients by generating information outside of       the traditional clinic visit and needs to build capacity and       expertise to advise the biopharmaceutical industry in their       development and implementation and to evaluate DHT outputs       including the impact of regulatory initiatives (or regulatory       science). To support new drug registration, label expansion,       and safety monitoring, DHT-based data need to be fit for the       intended purpose. Toward these ends, FDA will do the       following:        1. By the end of Q2 FY 2023, FDA will establish a DHT       framework document guide the use of DHT-derived data in       regulatory decision-makings for drugs and biological       products. The framework will guide activities such as to:        a. Define objectives for workshops and demonstration       projects;        b. Develop methodologies for evaluating DHTs proposed as       measuring key (primary or important secondary) endpoints or       other important measures (e.g., for safety monitoring, or       baseline characterization) in clinical trials;        c. Manage submissions with extensive and continuous data,       e.g., in order to develop acceptable approaches to capture       adverse events; and        d. Develop a standardized process for data management and       analysis of large datasets from DHTs.        2. By the end of Q2 FY 2023, FDA will establish a committee       including members from CDER and CBER to support       implementation of the commitments in this section. The       establishment of the committee and its purpose will be made       public on the FDA website. Responsibilities will include, but       not be limited to:        a. Oversee the design and implementation of the DHT       framework;        b. Promote consistency across centers regarding DHT-based       policy, procedure, and analytic tool development;        c. Work with the FDA Digital Health Center of Excellence       (DHCoE) to increase consistency across regulatory programs,       to incorporate relevant learnings from review of digital       tools and devices by CDRH, and to consider cross-center       topics;        d. Gather information about the present state of DHTs,       including specific challenges in their use; and        e. Engage with external stakeholders on DHT-related issues.        3. By the end of Q2 FY 2023, FDA will convene the first of       a series of 5 public meetings or workshops with key       stakeholders including patients, biopharmaceutical companies,       DHT companies, and academia to gather input into issues       related to the use of DHTs in regulatory decision-making. The       meetings and workshops will be designed with objectives such       as to:        a. Understand priorities for development of DHTs to support       clinical trials, including the potential for DHTs to increase       diverse patient populations in clinical trials;        b. Identify approaches to DHT validation;        c. Gain understanding of DHT data processing and analysis       and inform need for novel analytical techniques; and        d. Address the regulatory acceptance of safety monitoring       tools.that utilize artificial intelligence/machine learning-      based algorithms for pharmacovigilance purposes, e.g.,       continuous data streams from DHT.        4. FDA will identify at least 3 issue-focused demonstration       projects to inform methodologies for efficient DHT       evaluation. These projects may include engagement with       researchers from academia, biopharmaceutical industry,       patient groups and other stakeholders, and will:  [[Page S5194]]         a. Cover key issues to inform regulatory policy development       and regulatory advice. E.g.,. the projects may examine such       areas as validation methods, analytic approaches to missing       data, the use of multi-channel inputs to characterize an       endpoint, evaluation of continuous data vs discrete       measurements, use and limitations of use of DHTs in DCTs, and       other related efforts.        5. By the end of Q1 FY 2023, FDA will publish draft,       revised or final guidance on the use of DHTs in traditional       and decentralized clinical trials, addressing the validation       of measurements made by DHTs, the development of novel       endpoints using DHTs, the use of DHTs as new ways to measure       existing endpoints, approaches to using the patients' own       DHTs such as cell phones or smart watches, usability       considerations for patients, detection of safety signals       during continuous data acquisition, and issues related to       security and confidentiality of data.        a. Beginning in FY 2024, FDA will publish additional draft       guidances in identified areas of need informed by stakeholder       engagement.        i. For example, acceptable approaches to capturing and       reporting adverse events in clinical trials using DHTs.        b. FDA will work towards the goal of publishing final       guidance within 18 months after the close of the public       comment period on the draft guidance. If, after receiving       comments on the draft guidance, FDA determines that the       guidance requires substantive changes on which further public       comments are warranted, FDA will issue a revised draft       guidance within those 18 months instead. It then will work       towards publishing a final guidance within 18 months after       the close of the public comment period on the revised draft       guidance.        6. By the end of FY 2023, FDA will publish draft, revised       or final guidance on regulatory considerations for       Prescription Drug Use-Related Software that includes       information about software that is disseminated by a drug       applicant for use with a prescription drug or biologic       product that may be described in labeling, including       prescribing information. This guidance will cover software       that is distributed with a drug or integrated as part of a       drug- or biologic-led combination product, as well as       software that is distributed by an applicant independent of       an approved product.        7. FDA will expand its capacity to achieve its stated       objectives in this section and to enhance consistency across       the human drugs and biologics program (and as appropriate       with the medical devices program) with regards to       development, use, and review of DHT's and associated       endpoints. Through a combination of expanded staff and       contract support, FDA will:        a. Build technical expertise within the human drugs and       biologics program to enhance internal knowledge, capabilities       for review of IND-and NDA/BLA submissions including DHT       derived endpoints, policy, standards and guidance       development;        b. Train FDA staff in evaluation of DHTs;        c. Develop statistical methodology for the design,       analysis, and interpretation of DHT-derived clinical trial       endpoints;        d. Build review capacity and expertise to respond to DHT       developers and biopharmaceutical applicants who want to use       DHTs; and        e. Apply a consistent approach to review of DHTs across       CDER, CBER, and CDRH as appropriate.        8. FDA will enhance its IT capabilities to support the       review of DHT-generated data:        a. By end of Q2 FY 2023, FDA will enhance its internal       systems to support review of DHT-related submissions       including capturing key information about clinical trials       utilizing DHTs to support tracking the number and rate of       change of DHT-related submissions.        b. In FY 2023, FDA will establish a secure cloud technology       to enhance its infrastructure and analytics environment that       will enable FDA to effectively receive, aggregate, store, and       process large volumes of data from trials conducted using       DHTs.        c. After establishing the cloud environment, FDA will pilot       a secure cloud-based mechanism to support submission and       review of DHT-generated data sets.        d. FDA will work to enhance, recommend and implement       standards that reduce the handling necessary to make data       analyzable.                   V. IMPROVING FDA PERFORMANCE MANAGEMENT       A.

Assessment of challenges or barriers in FDA's adoption       of cloud-based technologies as described in Section IV.A.6.b.        VI. PROGRESS REPORTING FOR PDUFA VII AND CONTINUING PDUFA VI                                INITIATIVES         A. FDA will include in the annual PDUFA Performance Report       information on the Agency's progress in meeting the specific       commitments identified in this document as prescribed in       statute.        B. FDA will include in the annual PDUFA Financial Report       information identified in Section II in this document and as       prescribed in statute.                APPENDIX. DEFINITIONS AND EXPLANATION OF TERMS         1. ``Human drug applications'' refers to new drug       applications submitted under section 505(b) of the Federal       Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and biologics license       applications submitted under section 351(a) of the Public       Health Service Act, as defined in the Prescription Drug User       Fee Act.        2. ``Human drug review program'' refers to the activities       to conduct ``the process for the review of human drug       applications,'' as defined in the Prescription Drug User Fee       Act.        3. The term ``review and act on'' means the issuance of a       complete action letter after the complete review of a filed       complete application. The action letter, if it is not an       approval, will set forth in detail the specific deficiencies       and, where appropriate, the actions necessary to place the       application in condition for approval.        4. A resubmitted original application is a complete       response to an action letter addressing all identified       deficiencies.        5. Class 1 resubmitted applications are applications       resubmitted after a complete response letter (or a not       approvable or approvable letter) that include the following       items only (or combinations of these items):        a. Final printed labeling        b. Draft labeling        c. Safety updates submitted in the same format, including       tabulations, as the original safety submission with new data       and changes highlighted (except when large amounts of new       information including important new adverse experiences not       previously reported with the product are presented in the       resubmission)        d. Stability updates to support provisional or final dating       periods        e. Commitments to perform Phase 4 studies, including       proposals for such studies        f. Assay validation data        g. Final release testing on the last 1-2 lots used to       support approval        h. A minor reanalysis of data previously submitted to the       application        i. Other minor clarifying information (determined by the       Agency as fitting the Class 1 category)        j. Other specific items may be added later as the Agency       gains experience with the scheme and will be communicated via       guidance documents to industry        6. Class 2 resubmissions are resubmissions that include any       other items, including any items that would require       presentation to an advisory committee.        7. The performance goals and procedures also apply to       original applications and supplements for human drugs       initially marketed on an over-the-counter (OTC) basis through       an NDA or switched from prescription to OTC status through an       NDA or supplement.        8. As used in this commitment letter, ``regulatory decision       making'' may include, for example, FDA's process for making a       regulatory decision regarding a drug or biological product       throughout the product lifecycle, such as during drug       development, following FDA's review of a marketing       application, including review of proposed labeling for the       product, or in the post-approval period (e.g., FDA's decision       regarding a supplement to an approved application).        9. ``Serious disease or condition,'' ``available therapy,''       ``unmet medical need,'' and ``may demonstrate substantial       improvement on clinically significant endpoint(s)'' have the       meanings given in FDA's Guidance for Industry: Expedited       Programs for Serious Conditions, Drugs and Biologics (May       2014).   MDUFA Performance Goals and Procedures, Fiscal Years 2023 Through 2027                                   General         The performance goals and procedures agreed to by the       Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) and the       Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) of the       United States Food and Drug Administration (``FDA'' or ``the       Agency'') for the medical device user fee program in the       Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2022, are summarized       below.        FDA and the industry are committed to protecting and       promoting public health by providing timely access to safe       and effective medical devices. Nothing in this letter       precludes the Agency from protecting the public health by       exercising its authority to provide a reasonable assurance of       the safety and effectiveness of medical devices. Both FDA and       the industry are committed to the spirit and intent of the       goals described in this letter.                           I. Shared Outcome Goals         The program and initiatives outlined in this document are       predicated on significant interaction between the Agency and       applicants. FDA and representatives of the industry agree       that the process improvements outlined in this letter, when       implemented by all parties as intended, should reduce the       average Total Time to Decision for premarket approval       applications (PMAs) and premarket notification (510(k))       submissions, provided that the total funding of the device       review program adheres to the assumptions underlying this       agreement. FDA and applicants share the responsibility for       achieving this objective of reducing the average Total Time       to Decision, while maintaining standards for safety and       effectiveness. Success of this program will require the       cooperation and dedicated efforts of FDA and applicants to       reduce their respective portions of the Total Time to       Decision.  [[Page S5195]]         FDA will be reporting Total Time to Decision performance as       described in Section VII. FDA and industry will participate       in the independent assessment of progress toward this       outcome, as described in Section VI below. As appropriate,       key findings and recommendations from this assessment will be       implemented by FDA.      A. PMA        PMA Shared Outcome Total Time to Decision goal: FDA will       report on an annual basis the average Total Time to Decision       as defined in Section VIII.G for the three most recent closed       receipt cohorts. The following PMA Shared Outcome Total Time       to Decision goals are subject to adjustment per Section III       below:        For Original PMA and Panel Track Supplement submissions       received in Fiscal Years (FY) 2023 through 2024, the average       shared outcome Total Time to Decision goal for FDA and       industry is 290 calendar days.        For Original PMA and Panel Track Supplement submissions       received in FYs 2025 through 2027, the average shared outcome       Total Time to Decision goal for FDA and industry is 285       calendar days.      B. 510(k)        510(k) Shared Outcome Total Time to Decision goal: FDA will       report on an annual basis the average Total Time to Decision       as defined in Section VIII.G for the most recent closed       receipt cohort. The following 510(k) Shared Outcome Total       Time to Decision goals are subject to adjustment per Section       III below:        For 510(k) submissions received in FY 2023, the average       Total Time to Decision goal for FDA and industry is 128       calendar days.        For 510(k) submissions received in FY 2024, the average       Total Time to Decision goal for FDA and industry is 124       calendar days.        For 510(k) submissions received in FY 2025, the average       Total Time to Decision goal for FDA and industry is 112       calendar days.        For 510(k) submissions received in FY 2026, the average       Total Time to Decision goal for FDA and industry is 112       calendar days.        For 510(k) submissions received in FY 2027, the average       Total Time to Decision goal for FDA and industry is 112       calendar days.   II. Review Performance Goals--Fiscal Years 2023 Through 2027 As Applied                              to MDUFA Cohorts         The overall objective of the review performance goals       stated herein is to assure more timely access to safe and       effective medical devices.      A. Pre-Submissions        FDA will continue the Pre-Submission program as described       in the guidance on ``Requests for Feedback and Meetings for       Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program'' with       process improvements and performance goals as noted in this       section.        For all Pre-Submissions in which the applicant requests a       meeting or teleconference, the applicant will provide a       minimum of three proposed meeting dates in the initial       submission.        Within 15 calendar days of receipt of a Pre-Submission, FDA       will communicate with the applicant regarding whether the       application has been accepted and, if applicable, regarding       scheduling of the meeting or teleconference. Acceptance will       be determined based on the definition of Pre-Submission in       Section VIII.E below and an acceptance checklist in published       guidance. This communication consists of a written       communication that a) identifies the reviewer assigned to the       submission, b) acknowledges acceptance/rejection of the       submission, and c) if the submission included a request for a       meeting or teleconference and is accepted, either confirms       one of the applicant's requested meeting dates or provides       two alternative dates prior to day 75 from receipt of       accepted submission. A determination that the request does       not qualify as a Pre-Submission will require the concurrence       of the appropriate management or designee and the reason for       this determination will be provided to the applicant in the       above written communication. FDA intends to reach agreement       with the applicant regarding a meeting date within 30 days       from receipt of accepted submission. For all requests for       meetings or teleconferences that do not have such a meeting       or teleconference scheduled by 30 days from receipt of an       accepted submission, a FDA manager will contact the applicant       to resolve scheduling issues by the 40th day.        Pre-Submission Written Feedback goal: FDA will provide       written feedback that addresses the issues raised in the Pre-      Submission request within 70 calendar days of receipt date or       five calendar days prior to a scheduled meeting, whichever       comes sooner, for:        In FY 2023, 90% of Pre-Submissions in the MDUFA Cohort if       the MDUFA Cohort is fewer than 3585, or 75% of Pre-      Submissions in the MDUFA Cohort if the MDUFA Cohort is 3585       or more, up to 4300 submissions.        In FY 2024, 90% of Pre-Submissions in the MDUFA Cohort if       the MDUFA Cohort is fewer than 4060, or 80% of Pre-      Submissions in the MDUFA Cohort if the MDUFA Cohort is 4060       or more, up to 4300 submissions.        In FY 2025-2027, 90% of Pre-Submissions in the MDUFA Cohort       up to 4300 submissions.        These Pre-Submission Written Feedback goals are subject to       adjustment per Section III below.        The MDUFA Cohort will only include Pre-Submissions (as       defined in Section VIII.E below) for devices that are       accepted for review up to a maximum number of accepted       submissions subject to the goal. Pre-Submissions will be       accepted in accordance with the Pre-Submission acceptance       checklist described in FDA's guidance ``Requests for Feedback       and Meetings for Medical Device Submissions: The Q-      Submission Program.''. In addition, the following types of       requests for feedback available to Breakthrough-designated       products and/or products included in the Safer       Technologies Program (STeP) are considered accepted for       review upon receipt:        Sprint discussions;        Requests for review of a data development plan; and        Requests for review of a clinical protocol agreement.        The MDUFA Cohort will not include Pre-Submissions that are       withdrawn at request of applicant or closed due to lack of       applicant response.        For any Pre-Submissions in the MDUFA Cohort for which FDA       does not meet the Pre-Submission Written Feedback goal, FDA       will communicate with the applicant in a timely manner       regarding a timeline for providing written feedback.        After the Pre-Submission MDUFA Cohort reaches the maximum       number of submissions subject to the goal in a fiscal year,       FDA still intends to provide timely feedback for Pre-      Submissions for Breakthrough-designated products and products       included in the Safer Technologies Program (STeP). After the       Pre-Submission MDUFA Cohort reaches the maximum number of       submissions subject to the goal, FDA intends to provide       feedback for other Pre-Submissions as resources permit, but       not to the detriment of meeting quantitative review timelines       and statutory obligations.        Written feedback provided to the applicant will include:       written responses to the applicant's questions; FDA's       suggestions for additional topics for the meeting or       teleconference, if applicable; or, a combination of both. If       all of the applicant's questions are addressed through       written responses to the applicant's satisfaction, FDA and       the applicant can agree that a meeting or teleconference is       no longer necessary, and the written responses will be       considered the final written feedback to the Pre-Submission.        Applicants will be responsible for developing draft minutes       for a Pre-Submission meeting or teleconference, and providing       the draft minutes to FDA within 15 calendar days of the       meeting. At the beginning and end of each meeting, the       applicant will affirmatively state that they will draft       minutes and provide them to FDA within 15 calendar days. The       minutes will summarize the meeting discussions and include       agreements and any action items. FDA will provide any edits       to the draft minutes to the applicant via email within a       timely manner. These minutes will become final 15 calendar       days after the applicant receives FDA's edits, unless the       applicant indicates that there is a disagreement with how a       significant issue or action item has been documented. In this       case, within a timely manner, the applicant and FDA will       conduct a teleconference to discuss that issue with FDA. At       the conclusion of that teleconference, within 15 days FDA       will finalize the minutes either to reflect the resolution of       the issue or note that this issue remains a point of       disagreement.        FDA intends that feedback the Agency provides in a Pre-      Submission will not change, provided the information       submitted in a future IDE or marketing application is       consistent with that provided in the Pre-Submission and       documented in the Pre-Submission, and that the data in the       future submission, changes in the science, or changes in the       standards of care do not raise any important new issues       materially affecting safety or effectiveness. The minutes       described above will serve as the record of the Agency's Pre-      Submission feedback. Modifications to FDA's feedback will be       limited to situations in which FDA concludes that the       feedback does not adequately address important new issues       materially relevant to a determination of safety and/or       effectiveness or substantial equivalence. Such a       determination will be supported by the appropriate management       concurrence consistent with applicable guidance and SOPs.        By March 31, 2024, the Agency will issue draft guidance to       update the guidance on ``Requests for Feedback and Meetings       for Medical Device Submissions: The Q-Submission Program'' to       include additional information to assist applicants and       review staff in identifying the circumstances in which an       applicant's question is most appropriate for informal       communication instead of a Pre-Submission. FDA will provide       an opportunity for the public to comment on the updated       guidance. No later than 18 months after the close of the       public comment period, the Agency will issue a final       guidance. FDA will implement this guidance once final. FDA       will train staff and managers on the updated guidance.      B. Original PMAs, Product Development Protocols, Panel-Track           Supplements, and Premarket Reports        The performance goals in this section apply to all Original       PMAs, Product Development Protocols (PDPs), Panel-Track       Supplements, and Premarket Reports.        FDA will communicate with the applicant regarding whether       the application has been accepted for filing review within 15       calendar days of receipt of the application. This       communication consists of a written communication that a)       identifies the reviewer assigned to the submission, and b)       acknowledges acceptance/rejection of the submission based       upon the review of the submission  [[Page S5196]]       against objective acceptance criteria outlined in a published       guidance document and consistent with the statute and its       implementing regulations.        If the application is not accepted for filing review, FDA       will notify the applicant of those items necessary for the       application to be considered accepted for filing review.        For those applications that are accepted for filing review,       FDA will communicate the filing status within 45 calendar       days of receipt of the application.        For those applications that are not filed, FDA will       communicate to the applicant the specific reasons for       rejection and the information necessary for filing.        If the application is filed, FDA will communicate with the       applicant through a Substantive Interaction within 90       calendar days of the filing date of the application for 95%       of submissions.        When FDA issues a major deficiency letter, that letter will       be based upon a complete review of the application and will       include all deficiencies. Deficiency letters will include a       statement of the basis for the deficiencies, as provided in       Section V.B below. Deficiency letters will undergo       supervisory review prior to issuance to ensure the       deficiencies cited are relevant to a determination of safety       and effectiveness. Any subsequent deficiencies will be       limited to issues raised by the information provided by the       applicant in its response, unless FDA concludes that the       initial deficiencies identified do not adequately address       important new issues materially relevant to a determination       of safety or effectiveness. Such a determination will be       supported by the appropriate management concurrence       consistent with applicable guidance and SOPs. Issues related       to post-approval studies, if applicable, and revisions to       draft labeling will typically be addressed through       interactive review once major deficiencies have been       adequately addressed.        PMA decision goal: For Original PMAs, PDPs, Panel-Track       Supplements, and Premarket Reports that do not require       Advisory Committee input, FDA will issue a MDUFA decision       within 180 FDA Days for 90% of submissions. This PMA decision       goal is relevant for purposes of Section III below.        For submissions that require Advisory Committee input, FDA       will issue a MDUFA decision within 320 FDA Days for 90% of       submissions. FDA will issue a MDUFA decision within 60 days       of the Advisory Committee recommendation, as resources       permit, but not to the detriment of meeting the quantitative       review timelines and statutory obligations. The Office       Director shall review each request for Advisory Committee       input for appropriateness and need for this input.        If in any one fiscal year, the number of submissions that       require Advisory Committee input is less than 10, then it is       acceptable to combine such submissions with the submissions       for the following year(s) in order to form a cohort of 10 or       more submissions, upon which the combined years' submissions       will be subject to the performance goal. If the number of       submissions that require Advisory Committee input is less       than 10 for FY 2027, it is acceptable to combine such       submissions in the prior year(s) to form a cohort of 10 or       more submissions: in such cases, FDA will be held to the FY       2027 performance goal for the combined years' submissions.        To facilitate an efficient review prior to the Substantive       Interaction, and to incentivize submission of a complete       application, submission of an unsolicited major amendment       prior to the Substantive Interaction extends the FDA Day       review clock by the number of FDA Days that have elapsed.       Submission of an unsolicited major amendment after the       Substantive Interaction extends the FDA Day goal by the       number of FDA Days equal to 75% of the difference between the       filing date and the date of receipt of the amendment.       Requests from FDA that a submission be made will not be       considered unsolicited.        For all PMA submissions that do not reach a MDUFA decision       by 20 days after the applicable FDA Day goal, FDA will       provide written feedback to the applicant to be discussed in       a meeting or teleconference, including all outstanding issues       with the application preventing FDA from reaching a decision.       The information provided will reflect appropriate management       input and approval and will include action items for FDA and/      or the applicant, as appropriate, with an estimated date of       completion for each party to complete their respective tasks.       Issues should be resolved through interactive review. If all       of the outstanding issues are adequately presented through       written correspondence, FDA and the applicant can agree that       a meeting or teleconference is not necessary.        For PMA submissions that receive a MDUFA decision of       Approvable, FDA will issue a decision within 60 days of the       sponsor's response to the Approvable letter, as resources       permit, but not to the detriment of meeting the quantitative       review timelines and statutory obligations.        In addition, information about submissions that miss the       FDA Day goal will be provided as part of FDA's Performance       Reports, as described in Section VII.      C. 180-Day PMA Supplements        FDA will communicate with the applicant through a       Substantive Interaction within 90 calendar days of receipt of       95% of submissions.        FDA will issue a MDUFA decision within 180 FDA Days for 95%       of submissions.      D. Real-Time PMA Supplements        FDA will issue a MDUFA decision within 90 FDA Days for 95%       of submissions.      E. De Novo Requests        De Novo decision goal: FDA will issue a MDUFA decision       within 150 FDA Days for 70% of De Novo requests. This De Novo       decision goal is subject to adjustment per Section III below.        Deficiencies identified will be based upon a complete       review of the submission and will include all deficiencies.       Deficiency letters will include a statement of the basis for       the deficiencies, as provided in Section V.B below.       Deficiency letters will undergo supervisory review prior to       issuance to ensure the deficiencies cited are relevant to a       classification determination. Any subsequent deficiencies       will be limited to issues raised by the information provided       by the applicant in its response, unless FDA concludes that       the initial deficiencies identified do not adequately address       important new issues materially relevant to a classification       determination. Such a determination will be supported by the       appropriate management concurrence consistent with applicable       guidance and SOPs. Issues related to revisions to draft       labeling will typically be addressed through interactive       review once major deficiencies have been adequately       addressed.        At the applicant's request and as resources permit, but not       to the detriment of meeting the quantitative review       timelines, if a final decision has not been rendered within       180 FDA days, FDA will discuss with the applicant all       outstanding issues with the submission preventing FDA from       reaching a decision. This discussion will reflect appropriate       management input and approval and will include action items       for FDA and/or the applicant, as appropriate, with an       estimated date of completion for each party to complete their       respective tasks.      F. 510(k) Submissions        FDA will communicate with the applicant regarding whether       the submission has been accepted for review within 15       calendar days of receipt of the submission. For those       submissions that are not accepted for review, FDA will notify       the applicant of those items necessary for the submission to       be considered accepted.        FDA will provide written communication that a) identifies       the reviewer assigned to the submission, and b) acknowledges       acceptance/rejection of the submission based upon the review       of the submission against objective acceptance criteria       outlined in a published guidance document. This communication       represents a preliminary review of the submission and is not       indicative of deficiencies that may be identified later in       the review cycle.        For 510(k) submissions received under the eSTAR program, a       submission that passes the initial technical screening will       be considered accepted for review as of the date the       submission was received.        FDA will communicate with the applicant through a       Substantive Interaction within 60 calendar days of receipt of       the submission for 95% of submissions.        Deficiencies identified in a Substantive Interaction, such       as a telephone/email hold or Additional Information Letter,       will be based upon a complete review of the submission and       will include all deficiencies. Deficiency letters will       include a statement of the basis for the deficiencies, as       provided in section V.B below. Deficiency letters will       undergo supervisory review prior to issuance to ensure the       deficiencies cited are relevant to a determination of       substantial equivalence. Any subsequent deficiencies will be       limited to issues raised by the information provided by the       applicant in its response, unless FDA concludes that the       initial deficiencies identified do not adequately address       important new issues materially relevant to a determination       of substantial equivalence. Such a determination will be       supported by the appropriate management concurrence       consistent with applicable guidance and SOPs.        510(k) decision goal: FDA will issue a MDUFA decision for       95% of 510(k) submissions within 90 FDA Days. This 510(k)       decision goal is relevant for purposes of Section III below.        For all 510(k) submissions that do not reach a MDUFA       decision within 100 FDA Days, FDA will provide written       feedback to the applicant to be discussed in a meeting or       teleconference, including all outstanding issues with the       application preventing FDA from reaching a decision. The       information provided will reflect appropriate management       input and approval and will include action items for FDA and/      or the applicant, as appropriate, with an estimated date of       completion for each party to complete their respective tasks.       Issues should be resolved through interactive review. If all       of the outstanding issues are adequately presented through       written correspondence, FDA and the applicant can agree that       a meeting or teleconference is not necessary.        In addition, information about submissions that miss the       510(k) decision goal will be provided as part of FDA's       Performance Reports, as described in Section VII.      G. CLIA Waiver by Application        FDA will engage in a Substantive Interaction with the       applicant within 90 days for 90% of the applications.        Pre-Submission review timeframes in Section II.A apply to       Pre-Submissions for CLIA Waiver by Application and Dual       submission 510(k)/CLIA Waiver applications.        Industry will inform FDA that it plans to submit a dual       submission (510(k) and CLIA Waiver application) during the       Pre-Submission process. FDA will issue a decision for 90% of       dual submission applications within 180 FDA days.  [[Page S5197]]         For ``CLIA Waiver by application'' submissions FDA will       issue a MDUFA decision for 90% of the applications that do       not require Advisory Committee input within 150 FDA days.        For ``CLIA Waiver by application'' submissions FDA will       issue a MDUFA decision for 90% of the applications that       require Advisory Committee input within 320 FDA days.        If in any one fiscal year, the number of submissions in any       CLIA Waiver by Application category is less than 10, then it       is acceptable to combine such submissions with the       submissions for the following year(s) in order to form a       cohort of 10 or more submissions, upon which the combined       years' submissions will be subject to the performance goal.        For all CLIA waiver by application submissions and dual       submissions that do not reach a decision by 20 days after the       applicable FDA Day goal, FDA will provide written feedback to       the applicant to be discussed in a meeting or teleconference,       including all outstanding issues with the application       preventing FDA from reaching a decision. The information       provided will reflect appropriate management input and       approval, and will include action items for FDA and/or the       applicant, as appropriate, with an estimated date of       completion for each party to complete their respective tasks.       Issues should be resolved through interactive review. If all       of the outstanding issues are adequately presented through       written correspondence, FDA and the applicant can agree that       a meeting or teleconference is not necessary.        In addition, information about submissions that miss the       FDA Day goal will be provided as part of FDA's Performance       Reports, as described in Section VII.      H. Original Biologics Licensing Applications (BLAs)        FDA will review and act on standard original BLA       submissions within 10 months of receipt for 90% of       submissions.        FDA will review and act on priority original BLA       submissions within 6 months of receipt for 90% of       submissions.      I. BLA Efficacy Supplements        FDA will review and act on standard BLA efficacy supplement       submissions within 10 months of receipt for 90% of       submissions.        FDA will review and act on priority BLA efficacy supplement       submissions within 6 months of receipt for 90% of       submissions.      J. Original BLA and BLA Efficacy Supplement Resubmissions        FDA will review and act on Class 1 original BLA and BLA       efficacy supplement resubmissions within 2 months of receipt       for 90% of submissions.        FDA will review and act on Class 2 original BLA and BLA       efficacy supplement resubmissions within 6 months of receipt       for 90% of submissions.      K. BLA Manufacturing Supplements Requiring Prior Approval        FDA will review and act on BLA manufacturing supplements       requiring prior approval within 4 months of receipt for 90%       of submissions.                III. Opportunity for Performance Improvements         MDUFA V will provide for increases in fee revenue above the       annual total revenue amount to support performance       improvements in FY 2025, FY 2026, and/or FY 2027, as detailed       below. If such fee revenue adjustments are not made, the       performance goals in Section II apply.        For the purpose of fee revenue adjustments, performance of       all goals in this section, except for the Pre-Submission       Written Feedback goal, will be determined based on data       available as of 18 months following the close of the fiscal       year at issue. Thus, for a FY 2023 goal, the performance will       be determined based on data available as of March 31, 2025.       For a FY 2024 goal, the performance will be determined based       on data available as of March 31, 2026. For the Pre-      Submission Written Feedback goal, performance will be       determined based on data available as of 6 months following       the close of the fiscal year at issue. Thus, for example, for       the Pre-Submission Written Feedback goal for FY 2023,       performance will be determined based on data available as of       March 31, 2024.      A. PMA and 510(k): Decision Goals and Shared Outcome Total           Time to Decision Goals        I. FDA's 510(k) decision goal, the FDA/Industry 510(k)       Shared Outcome Total Time to Decision goal, FDA's PMA       decision goal, and the FDA/Industry PMA Shared Outcome Total       Time to Decision goal are met for FY 2023, and fee revenue       above the annual total revenue amount is provided in FY 2026       and FY 2027 to support performance improvements, the 510(k)       Shared Outcome Total Time to Decision goal will be adjusted       to 108 days for FY 2026 and FY 2027 and the PMA Shared       Outcome Total Time to Decision goal will be adjusted to 275       days for FY 2026 and FY 2027.        If FDA's 510(k) decision goal, the FDA/Industry 510(k)       Shared Outcome Total Time to Decision goal, FDA's PMA       decision goal, and the FDA/Industry PMA Shared Outcome Total       Time to Decision goal are met in FY 2024, and fee revenues       above the annual total revenue amount are provided in FY 2027       to support performance improvements, the 510(k) Shared       Outcome Total Time to Decision goal will be adjusted to 108       days and the PMA Shared Outcome Total Time to Decision goal       will be adjusted to 270 days for FY 2027.      B. De Novo Requests        If the De Novo decision goal is met for FY 2023, and fee       revenue above the annual total revenue amount is provided in       FY 2026 and FY 2027 to support performance improvements, the       goal will be adjusted to 80% of De Novo requests receiving a       MDUFA decision within 150 FDA days for FY 2026 and 2027.        If the De Novo decision goal is met for FY 2024, and fee       revenue above the annual total revenue amount is provided in       FY 2027 to support performance improvements, the goal will be       adjusted to 90% of De Novo requests receiving a MDUFA       decision within 150 FDA days in FY 2027.      C. Pre-Submissions        If the Pre-Submission Written Feedback goal is met for FY       2023, and fee revenue above the annual total revenue amount       is provided to support performance improvements, the maximum       number of submissions subject to the goal will escalate to       4700 Pre-Submissions in FYs 2025, 2026 and 2027.        If the Pre-Submission Written Feedback goal is met for FY       2024, and fee revenue above the annual total revenue amount       is provided to support performance improvements, the maximum       number of submissions subject to the goal will escalate to       4800 Pre-Submissions in FY 2026 and FY 2027.        If the Pre-Submission Written Feedback goal is met for FY       2025, and fee revenue above the annual total revenue amount       is provided to support performance improvements, the goal       will not be subject to a maximum number of submissions in FY       2027.        The goal for percent of Pre-Submissions in the MDUFA Cohort       receiving timely feedback, as described in Section II.A, will       remain at 90% for FYs 2025, 2026, and 2027.                              IV. Infrastructure       A. Quality Management        The CDRH Quality Management and Organizational Excellence       (QMOE) Program is comprised of a team of certified quality       management staff who report to the Center Director. This QMOE       staff are focused on meeting customers' needs by improving       consistency, efficiency, timeliness, and effectiveness of       operations. The QMOE Program establishes and leads the CDRH       Quality Management System (QMS) activities, facilitates       process improvements, independently audits CDRH processes and       activities, and assesses the effectiveness of actions taken       to prevent potential (risk management) and resolve existing       issues (nonconformity management).        At least once per year, the Agency will discuss with       industry the specific areas it intends to incorporate in its       ongoing audit plan with the QMOE Program. FDA will identify,       with industry input, areas to audit, which will include the       effectiveness of CDRH's nonconformity management process. FDA       will continue to expand the scope of its annual audits as it       implements and builds up its auditing capability, as       resources permit. At a minimum, FDA audits in the following       areas will be completed: Pre-Submissions and Third Party       Review Program.        As part of these ongoing audits, high-performing premarket       review best practices utilized in one Office of Health       Technology (OHT) will be identified and shared accordingly       with other OHTs to improve efficiencies and effectiveness.        At least once per year, FDA will report on the results of       the audits, best practices identified and shared across OHTs,       and the actions taken in response to nonconformities       associated with the nonconformity management process.      B. Financial Transparency and Hiring        1. Financial Transparency        FDA will publish a MDUFA 5-year financial plan no later       than the end of the 2nd quarter of FY 2023. The financial       plan will include the Agency's annual hiring targets. No       later than the end of the 2nd quarter of each subsequent       fiscal year, FDA will publish updates to the 5-year plan as       of the end of the prior fiscal year. The annual updates will       include information concerning:        The number of new MDUFA V hires by Office;        The number of new MDUFA V hires made from outside the       Center, as well as the number of new MDUFA V hires made from       current Center employees (if any);        The number of unfilled new MDUFA V hires;        The changes in the personnel compensation and benefit costs       for the process for the review of medical device applications       that exceed the amounts provided by the personnel       compensation and benefit costs portion of the inflation       adjustment;        An accounting of appropriated user fee funds included in       the operating reserves at the end of each fiscal year, as       well as the carryover balance of user fee funds that are       considered unappropriated or unearned and therefore not       included in the operating reserves; and        An accounting of the amount excluded from the designated       amount within the operating reserves, which is intended to       support the Third Party Review program and the Total Product       Life Cycle Advisory Program Pilot.        2. Carryover Balance        MDUFA V will provide for FDA to decrease registration fees       if the Agency has more than 13 weeks of operating reserves in       the carryover balance. In addition, during MDUFA V FDA will       use funds in the carryover balance to support the Third Party       Review program and the Total Product Life Cycle Advisory       Program Pilot. The amount of carryover balance funds intended       to support these programs will be excluded when  [[Page S5198]]       calculating the amount of operating reserves to determine if       registration fees will be decreased. The current statutory       one-month reserve will also be excluded when calculating the       amount of operating reserves to determine if registration       fees will be decreased. User fee funds in the carryover       balance that are considered unappropriated or unearned are       not included in the operating reserves.        No less than annually, FDA and industry will work together       to seek alignment on how best to utilize available funds in       the carryover balance to improve the process for the review       of device applications--e.g., performance on submission types       with performance goals and/or quality management programs.       FDA and industry will use, as input for the discussion,       workload information, performance objectives, and ongoing       reported performance.        3. Hiring Goals        Enhancements to the medical device review program require       that FDA recruit, hire and retain sufficient numbers and       types of technical, scientific, and other program experts to       support the process for the review of device applications.       MDUFA V provides significant new resources to FDA to support       these activities.        To help ensure that FDA accomplishes hiring in accordance       with the assumptions underlying the agreement, FDA will       establish annual hiring goals for each year of MDUFA V.        The minimum hiring goals for FY 2023-2025 are:        FY 2023: 144 hires        FY 2024: 42 hires        FY 2025: 24 hires        As described in Section III, the MDUFA V agreement provides       for enhancements to the shared outcome total time to decision       goals and to specified review performance goals, provided       that specified goals were met in prior years. These enhanced       goals will be applicable in FY 2025 (for the Pre-Submission       Written Feedback goal) and FY 2026-2027 (for the Pre-      Submission Written Feedback goal, the PMA Shared Outcome       Total Time to Decision goal, the 510(k) Shared Outcome Total       Time to Decision goal, and the De Novo Decision goal).        FDA and Industry have agreed that, if performance       improvement adjustments are triggered for each year per       Section III, the Agency will increase hiring to support the       enhanced goals.        FY 2025        In FY 2025, if performance improvement adjustments are made       to the Pre-Submission Written Feedback goal per Section III,       FDA will increase the hiring goal by 59 hires to a total of       83 hires. As part of the process for establishing the user       fee rates for FY 2025, FDA will also calculate the hiring       goal for that year and include the goal in the associated       Federal Register fee-setting notice.        FY 2026 and FY 2027        In FY 2026 and FY 2027, the number of hires will depend on       (1) which performance improvement adjustments are triggered       for that year, and (2) whether the hiring goal was increased       the prior year. For FY 2026 and FY 2027, as part of the       process for establishing the user fee rates for that year,       FDA will also calculate the hiring goal for that year and       include the goal in the associated Federal Register fee-      setting notice.        Pre-hires        For purposes of determining whether the hiring goal is met       for FY 2023, FDA will include ``pre-hires'' that are made in       FY 2022 for MDUFA V positions. In addition, for subsequent       fiscal years, if FDA exceeds the hiring goal, the additional       hires made above the goal will be counted towards the       following fiscal year goal.        4. Fee Adjustment Related to Hiring        For FY 2023, if the hiring goal is missed by more than 15%       at the end of the fiscal year (i.e., if fewer than 123 hires       are made in FY 2023, including FY 2022 pre-hires), unused       fees that were projected to support these hires for FY 2023       will be used to decrease registration fees for FY 2025.        For FY 2024 or FY 2025, if the hiring goal is missed by       more than 10% at the end of the fiscal year (i.e., if fewer       than 38 hires are made in FY 2024), unused fees that were       projected to support these positions for the applicable       fiscal year will be used to decrease registration fees for FY       2026 and FY 2027, respectively.        The amount of the hiring adjustment fee decrease will be       the product of the number of hires by which the hiring goal       was missed and one-quarter of the inflation-adjusted cost per       full-time equivalent (FTE).        For the purpose of calculating progress toward meeting       these hiring goals, a hire is defined as someone who has been       confirmed as on board by the date indicated in a full-time       position. Hires may be recruited from outside the FDA, or, in       some cases, a hire can also be a current FDA employee who is       changing positions within the agency.      C. IT Infrastructure for Submission Management        FDA will continue to enhance IT infrastructure to support       the process for the review of device applications.        FDA will maintain and improve on the Customer Collaboration       Portal, including the submission progress tracking system       that provides near real-time submission status. By the end of       MDUFA V, the progress tracking system will include 510(k),       Original PMA and Panel-Track Supplements, De Novo, Pre-      Submissions, and IDEs.        FDA will continue to develop electronic submission       templates that will serve as guided submission preparation       tools for industry to improve submission consistency and       enhance efficiency in the review process. Templates for       Original PMA and Panel-Track Supplements, De Novo, Pre-      Submissions, and IDEs will be completed and made available       for voluntary use by the end of MDUFA V.      D. Training        FDA will continue to evaluate and improve training for new       and existing reviewers under this agreement. FDA training       efforts will also be closely coordinated with the QMOE       Program to provide more targeted and personalized training to       staff.      E. Time Reporting        FDA will continue to perform complete time reporting such       that data from time reporting can be used to conduct workload       analysis and capacity planning.                           v. process improvements       A. Interactive Review        The Agency will continue to incorporate an interactive       review process to provide for, and encourage, informal       communication between FDA and applicants to facilitate timely       completion of the review process based on accurate and       complete information. Interactive review entails       responsibilities for both FDA and applicants. As described in       the 2014 guidance document, ``Types of Communication During       the Review of Medical Devices Submissions,'' both FDA and       industry believe that an interactive review process for       premarket medical device submissions should help facilitate       timely completion of the review based on accurate and       complete information. Interactive review is intended to       facilitate the efficient and timely review and evaluation by       FDA of premarket submissions and is expected to support       reductions in total time to decision. The interactive review       process contemplates increased informal interaction between       FDA and applicants, including the exchange of scientific and       regulatory information.      B. Deficiency Letters        By January 1, 2023, the Agency will update the 2017       guidance ``Developing and Responding to Deficiencies in       Accordance with the Least Burdensome Provisions; Guidance for       Industry and FDA Staff'' to clarify what constitutes a       statement of the basis for the deficiency and continue       alignment with the following:        Deficiency letters should include a statement of the basis       for the deficiencies (e.g., a specific reference to       applicable section of a rule, final guidance, recognized       standard unless the entire or most of document is       applicable). In the instance when the deficiency cannot be       traced in the manner above and relates to a scientific or       regulatory issue pertinent to the determination, FDA will       cite the specific scientific issue and the information to       support its position.        Deficiency letters will undergo supervisory review prior to       issuance to ensure the deficiencies cited are relevant to a       marketing authorization decision (e.g., 510(k) clearance, PMA       approval, and de novo classification).        FDA will train staff and managers on the updated guidance       and work to make improvements (including incorporating best       practices), as appropriate, to address findings from audits       and consistent with the guidance.        FDA will provide a statement of the basis for the       deficiency, consistent with the updated guidance, in       deficiency letters as follows: 75% of deficiencies in FY       2023, 80% of deficiencies in FY 2024, 85% of deficiencies in       FY 2025, 90% of deficiencies in FY 2026, and 95% of       deficiencies in FY 2027 for Original PMA, Panel-Track       Supplement, 510(k) and De Novo request submissions.       Performance will be determined by means of annual audit       conducted by QMOE. Sampling procedures will incorporate ISO       2859-1:1999 (``Sampling Procedures for inspection by       attributes--Part 1: Sampling schemes indexed by acceptance       quality limit (AQL) for lot-by-lot inspection''). FDA will       review each fiscal year's audit results with industry no       later than the first quarterly meeting of the following       fiscal year.      C. Enhanced Use of Consensus Standards        The voluntary Accreditation Scheme for Conformity       Assessment (ASCA) Pilot is intended to enhance product       reviewers' and device manufacturers' confidence in medical       device testing when manufacturers rely on testing completed       by ASCA-accredited testing laboratories. This should       generally decrease the need for the FDA to request additional       information regarding testing methodologies when a premarket       submission includes ASCA testing. ASCA also incorporates       existing international conformity assessment standards and       practices where practical.        FDA will use lessons learned from implementation of the       ASCA Pilot Program during MDUFA IV to transition from a pilot       to a sustainable and expanded program. Specifically, the       Agency will:        1. By the end of FY 2023, FDA will complete the pilot. In       Q2 of FY 2024, FDA will provide a report on the performance       of the ASCA Pilot Program (to replace the report specified in       the MDUFA IV Commitment Letter, Commitment IV.D.8.a). In the       report, FDA will provide at least the following information:        a. Adequacy of the standards selected to support confidence       by FDA and industry in the methods used and results reported       by ASCA-accredited testing laboratories;        b. Testing laboratory participation in the training and       ASCA program, and areas where any nonconformities were       observed;  [[Page S5199]]         c. Number of submissions containing the ASCA Summary       Report;        d. Summary Report acceptance rate by FDA reviewers; and        e. Summary of commonly cited deficiencies regarding the       Summary Report.        2. FDA will train staff and supervisors so that specific       deficiencies are relevant to the requirements of the Summary       Report.        3. FDA will continue to provide adequate training to       testing laboratories and reviewers to accurately execute the       ASCA process.        4. FDA will report annually on the progress of the ASCA       program.        5. FDA will work with stakeholders for further input on       programmatic improvements and/or consideration for expansion.      D. Third Party Review        The Agency will continue to support the Third Party Review       program, with the objective of eliminating routine re-review       by FDA of Third Party reviews through continuation of the       following activities:        1. Provide training for Third Parties seeking accreditation       by FDA. This training shall include the opportunity for Third       Parties to have access to redacted review memos and other       information as appropriate.        2. When FDA's expectations for a particular device type       change, FDA will maintain a process to convey this       information to the Third Parties and to industry.        3. Audit and provide tailored re-training to accredited       Third Parties based on the results of audits.        4. Publish performance of individual accredited Third       Parties with at least five completed submissions on FDA's       website (e.g., rate of NSE, average number of holds, average       time to SE).        FDA will consider the factors described in the guidance,       ``510(k) Third Party Review Program,'' in determining device       type eligibility for the Third Party Review       program. Consistent with that guidance, some device types       that rely on clinical data to demonstrate substantial       equivalence may be eligible for Third Party Review.      E. Patient Science and Engagement        The Agency will take the following actions to continue       engaging patients and incorporating their perspectives in the       regulatory process. Where appropriate, the Agency will       leverage collaborations and partnerships with patients,       healthcare providers, industry, and others, as well as       collaborations across FDA Centers, to advance these actions.        1. Expand clinical, statistical, and other scientific       expertise and staff capacity to respond to submissions       containing applicant-proposed use of voluntary patient       preference information (PPI), voluntary patient reported       outcomes (PROs), and/or patient generated health data (PGHD).       These staff will provide submission review and early       consultation/advice to industry during study planning.        2. Issue a draft guidance providing best practices on       incorporating into premarket studies clinical outcome       assessments including their use as primary or co-primary       endpoints. A clinical outcome assessment (COA) describes or       reflects how a person feels, functions, or survives and can       be reported by a health care provider or a non-clinical       observer (such as a parent), through performance of an       activity or task, or by the patient.        3. Support the use of innovative technologies to capture       patient input and reduce patient burden to inform clinical       study design and conduct, with a goal of reducing barriers to       patient participation and facilitating recruitment and       retention.        4. By the end of FY 2024, hold a public meeting to explore       ways to use patient-generated health data to help advance       remote clinical trial data collection and support clinical       outcome assessments.        5. FDA will undertake the following activities to improve       the regulatory predictability and impact of patient science:        a. Develop case examples of modified or adapted PRO       instruments to make efficient use of existing validated PRO       instruments which may be improved or adapted to other       subpopulations or other regulatory uses in a more streamlined       and expeditious manner than creating novel PROs.        b. Strengthen efforts to expand staff understanding of       Patient Science and Engagement (PSE) topics, and consistent       evaluation in submissions through training curriculum and       internal infrastructure to improve consistency (e.g., Focal       Point Program).        c. Update FDA's existing guidance, ``Patient Preference       Information--Voluntary Submission, Review in Premarket       Approval Applications, Humanitarian Device Exemption       Applications, and De Novo Requests, and Inclusion in Decision       Summaries and Device Labeling,'' with pragmatic insights and       to address common questions for those interested in the       voluntary use of PPI in regulatory submissions.        d. Explore opportunities to improve patient science tools       for medical devices and advance health equity through       targeted incorporation of diverse patient perspectives and       integration of data from diverse patients.        e. Identify high impact opportunities to incorporate       patient perspectives.        6. Facilitate industry efforts to collaborate with patients       in key areas by generating patient-friendly educational       modules on device trials, real-world data, device development       tools, and regulatory frameworks. FDA will also make these       educational modules publicly available, as appropriate.        7. The existing dispute resolution process should be used       in the event of disagreement between the applicant and the       Agency on the need for PPI, PRO and/or other tools to capture       PGHD.      F. Real World Evidence (RWE)        The Agency will use user fee revenue for the continued       development of Real-World Data (RWD) and RWE methods and       policies to advance regulatory acceptance for premarket       submissions, including expanded indications for use and new       clearance/approval of new devices, and clarify related       reporting requirements.        1. FDA will update the 2017 guidance document Use of Real-      World Evidence to Support Regulatory Decision-Making for       Medical Devices to provide more clarity on:        a. Least burdensome general expectations on what is needed       to demonstrate the ``Fit-for-Purpose of RWD'' for premarket       regulatory purposes, including expanded indications for use       and new clearance/approval of new devices;        b. More information, including generalized examples, on       previously used and accepted methodologies; and        c. Best practices for RWE review.        2. FDA will continue to advance CDRH's RWD/RWE Training       program for FDA review teams including the medical review       staff. Topics will include best practices for RWE review and       when to engage with CDRH RWE subject matter experts.        3. FDA will provide transparent program development updates       and financial accounting of User Fee revenue specifically       intended for the activities in this section.        a. FDA will update stakeholders on the RWE program       activities at two or more open public meetings during the       course of MDUFA V.        b. FDA hiring of internal experts to support the review of       RWD/RWE-related submissions will be tracked.        c. In any portion of the user fee funding is distributed to       the National Evaluation System for health Technology (NEST),       the funding should be used to transparently:        i. Support the development of RWD resources to facilitate       appropriate access for research studies;        ii. Convene experts to develop best practices and, advance       innovative methodology approaches with respect to RWE       development and analysis;        iii. Include, on the organization's governing board, no       fewer than 4 representatives of the trade associations that       participated in the MDUFA V negotiations (AdvaMed, MDMA,       MITA, and ACLA), with each association appointing an       individual to serve. Industry representation on the governing       board, if applicable, will make up at least 25% of the       governing board membership at all times, and shall be       selected by the industry associations. The representative       from each trade association may be part of the staff of the       association or appointed from a member company. If any of the       trade associations elects not to participate on the governing       board or for any additional seats allocated to industry, the       participating trade associations will determine how to fill       any vacant Industry positions.        d. By the end of FY 2023, FDA will publish a document       requesting public comment on how FDA should use any portion       of the user fee funding that may be distributed to any       external organization(s) other than NEST to support premarket       RWE.        e. If any portion of the user fee funding is distributed to       an external organization(s) other than NEST, the funding will       be accounted for in FDA's quarterly MDUFA report.      G. Digital Health        The Agency will continue to build its digital health       expertise and continue working to streamline and align FDA       review processes with software lifecycles for digital health       products. Specifically, the Agency will:        1. Continue to develop software and digital health       technical expertise to provide assistance for premarket       submissions that include software, interoperable devices, or       otherwise incorporate digital health technologies, such as       artificial intelligence or machine learning (AI/ML), Virtual,       Mixed, and Augmented Reality (VR/MR/AR) and wearables.        2. Strengthen efforts to expand staff understanding of       digital health topics and enhance consistent evaluation in       submissions through training and internal infrastructure       (e.g., Focal Point Program).        3. Continue to participate in international harmonization       efforts related to digital health, including work on       developing software and other digital health convergence       efforts.        4. Finalize the draft guidance, ``Content of Premarket       Submissions for Device Software Functions,'' by 18 months       from close of the comment period.        5. Publish draft guidance describing a process to evaluate       a predetermined change control plan for digital health       devices.        6. Engage with stakeholders, including patients, users, and       industry, through roundtables, informal meetings, and       teleconferences to explore regulatory approaches to digital       health technologies.      H. Guidance Document Development        FDA will apply user fee revenues to ensure timely       completion of Draft Guidance documents. The Agency will       strive to finalize, withdraw, reopen the comment period, or       issue a new draft guidance for 80% of draft guidance       documents within 3 years of the close of the comment periods       as resources permit. The Agency will strive to finalize,  [[Page S5200]]       withdraw, reopen the comment period, or issue a new draft       guidance for 100% of draft guidance documents within 5 years       of the close of the comment periods as resources permit. The       Agency will continue to develop guidance documents and       improve the development process as resources permit, but not       to the detriment of meeting quantitative review timelines and       statutory obligations.      I. International Harmonization        FDA is committed to improving the efficiency of the global       regulatory systems for medical devices through international       harmonization and convergence of regulatory requirements. The       Agency will take the following actions to advance such       international harmonization. Specifically, the Agency will:        1. Expand engagement in international harmonization and       convergence efforts through participation with international       regulators and other key stakeholders in forums, working       groups, projects, and committees to promote alignment with       international best practices and internationally developed       policies, including exploring the development of harmonized       premarket review processes.        2. Further support regulatory convergence by creating a       mechanism for FDA to work with regulatory partners with whom       we have appropriate confidentiality commitments to inform and       align international regulatory strategy. This may include,       for example, sharing of scientific, clinical, or other       technical information, or policies and practices, as needed       and consistent with applicable disclosure law and policy.        3. Commencing in FY 2023, assess the extent of CDRH       implementation of International Medical Device Regulators       Forum (IMDRF) technical documents and make this information       publicly available to enhance clarity and transparency.        4. Support the creation of a forum to engage with relevant       stakeholders, including industry representatives and other       regulators, to identify opportunities for regulators to       leverage one another's approach to decision making.        5. Participate in outreach activities to other regulatory       authorities that encourage harmonization and may also       encourage such authorities to rely in whole or in part on FDA       marketing authorizations.        6. By the end of FY 2023, issue for public comment a draft       strategic plan with additional details and timelines       associated with achieving the international harmonization       objectives described above.        7. Commencing with FY 2024, publish an annual assessment of       the international harmonization activities described the       strategic plan above, including the progress assessment       described in subparagraph 3 above.      J. Total Product Life Cycle (TPLC) Advisory Program        FDA will establish a pilot of the Total Product Life Cycle       (TPLC) Advisory Program (TAP Pilot) during the course of       MDUFA V.        1. Vision: The long-term vision for a successful TPLC       Advisory Program (TAP) is to help spur more rapid development       as well as more rapid and widespread patient access to safe,       effective, high-quality medical devices of public health       importance. A mature TAP will also help ensure the sustained       success of the Breakthrough devices program.        2. TAP Pilot Objective: The TAP Pilot is intended to       demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of process       improvements to FDA's early interactions with participants       and FDA's facilitation of interactions between participants       and stakeholders that support the vision for TAP. Through the       TAP Pilot, the FDA will provide the following types of       strategic engagement for innovative devices of public health       importance:        Improving participants' experiences with FDA by providing       for more timely premarket interactions;        Enhancing the experience of all participants throughout the       device development and review process, including FDA staff;        Facilitating improved strategic decision-making during       product development, including earlier identification,       assessment, and mitigation of product development risk;        Facilitating regular, solutions-focused engagement between       FDA review teams, participants, and other stakeholders such       as patients, providers, and payers, beginning early in device       development; and        Collaborating to better align expectations regarding       evidence generation, improve submission quality, and improve       the efficiency of the premarket review process        3. Goals: To achieve the above TAP Pilot objective, FDA       will:        a. Begin and support a TAP Pilot, scoped to include the       following:        In FY 2023, enroll up to 15 products in a ``soft launch''       in one Office of Health Technology (OHT); selection of the       OHT will include consideration of the OHT's historical number       of granted Breakthrough designations, workload, and available       staffing and expertise;        In FY 2024, continue to support products enrolled in the       previous fiscal year and expand to enroll up to 45 additional       products in at least two OHTs (i.e., up to 60 total products       enrolled through FY 2024);        In FY 2025, continue to support products enrolled in       previous fiscal years and expand to enroll up to 65       additional products in at least four OHTs (i.e., up to 125       total products enrolled through FY 2025); and        In FY 2026-FY 2027, continue to support products enrolled       in previous fiscal years and expand to enroll up to 100       additional products each fiscal year within existing OHTs or       expand to additional OHTs, depending on lessons learned from       FY 2023-FY 2025 experience (i.e., up to 225 total products       enrolled through FY 2026 and up to 325 total products       enrolled through FY 2027).        For FY 2024-FY 2027, in addition to the considerations       above, selection of the OHTs will include consideration of       experience from prior years and input from industry and other       stakeholders.        b. Beginning in FY 2024, implement and track the following       quantitative performance metrics:        FDA will engage in a teleconference with the participant on       requested topic(s) pertaining to the TAP device within 14       days of the request for 90% of requests for interaction.        FDA will provide written feedback on requested       biocompatibility and sterility topics(s) pertaining to the       TAP device within 21 days of the request for 90% of such       requests for written feedback.        FDA will provide written feedback on requested topic(s)       pertaining to the TAP device other than biocompatibility and       sterility within 40 days of the request for 90% of requests       for written feedback.        c. Regularly review TAP pilot progress with industry, share       feedback, and assess the impact of the TAP Pilot and       opportunities for improvement.        d. Publish an assessment of the TAP Pilot on the FDA web       site no later than January 30, 2026.        For purposes of the annual performance report and       corrective action report, the goals of the TAP pilot are set       forth in Section V.J.3 above.        4. Enrollment. FDA intends to enroll participants in the       pilot using the following criteria:        a. Participation in the pilot will be voluntary.        b. For FY 2023-FY 2025, products will be those with a       granted Breakthrough designation. For FY 2026-FY 2027,       products will be those with a granted Breakthrough       designation or request for inclusion in the Safer       Technologies Program (STeP).        c. Participants have not submitted a Pre-Submission about       the product after granted Breakthrough designation or request       for inclusion in STeP.        d. Products will be early in their product development       process (e.g., have not yet initiated a pivotal study) at       time of pilot enrollment.        e. Each participant will have a maximum of one product       enrolled in the pilot per fiscal year.        f. Participants will be enrolled on first-come, first-      served basis.        FDA will inform potential participants of the TAP Pilot as       part of the Breakthrough designation process or request for       inclusion in STeP process.        If spaces remain available in a participating OHT or if       resources permit, FDA may consider enrolling devices from       additional OHT(s).        5. TAP Pilot Assessment. For informational purposes, FDA       will conduct an assessment of the TAP Pilot using an       independent third party (or parties) to assess the TAP pilot.       This assessment will include a participant survey and       quantitative and qualitative success metrics, starting in FY       2024, that include but are not limited to:        a. The extent to which FDA is successful at meeting the       quantitative goals described in V.J.3.b. above.        b. Participant satisfaction with the timeliness, frequency,       quality, and efficiency of interactions with and written       feedback from FDA.        c. Participant satisfaction with the timeliness, frequency,       quality, and efficiency of voluntary interactions with non-      FDA stakeholders facilitated by FDA (if utilized).        d. An overall assessment of the outcomes of the Pilot and       opportunities for improvement.        6. Other Measures. For informational purposes, FDA will       begin to track other measures of program success, which will       include:        Time from granting of Breakthrough designation or request       for inclusion in the Safer Technologies Program (STeP) to       receipt of marketing submission;        Time from receipt of marketing submission to marketing       authorization; and        Requests for additional information during submission       review.                         VI. Independent Assessments       A. Independent Assessment of MDUFA Workforce Metrics        FDA will retain a qualified, independent contractor with       expertise in assessing public sector workforce data analysis       and reporting to conduct an assessment of current       methodologies and data/metrics available to represent the       MDUFA workforce. This will include assessment of positions       (filled/vacant) and MDUFA process FTEs, including the subset       funded by user fees, for each applicable FDA Center and       Office.        The report will include the contractor's findings from the       assessment and recommendations for improved methodologies to       represent MDUFA FTE resources, including the subset funded by       user fees. The assessment will be published on FDA's website       by March 31, 2025.      B. Independent Assessment of Review Process Management        FDA and the industry will participate in a targeted       assessment of the process for the review of device       applications. The assessment  [[Page S5201]]       will include consultation with both FDA and industry at the       start of the assessment and prior to issuance of the final       report. The assessment shall be conducted under contract to       FDA by a private, independent consulting firm capable of       performing the technical analysis, management assessment, and       program evaluation tasks required to address the assessment       scope described below within the budget provided under this       user fee agreement.

VIII. Definitions and Explanations of Terms       A. Applicant        Applicant means a person who makes any of the following       submissions to FDA:        an application for premarket approval under section 515 of       the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act);        a premarket notification under section 510(k) of the FD&C       Act;        an application for investigational device exemption under       section 520(g) of the FD&C Act;        a Pre-Submission;        a De Novo classification request (De Novo request) under       section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act;        a CLIA Waiver by application.      B. eSTAR (electronic Submission Template And Resource)        An electronic submission template built within a structured       dynamic PDF that guides a user through construction of an       eSubmission. eSTAR is the only type of electronic submission       template that is currently available to facilitate the       preparation of 510(k) submissions as eSubmissions. For       simplicity, the electronic submission created with this       electronic submission template is often referred to as an       eSTAR.      C. FDA Days        FDA Days are those calendar days when a submission is       considered to be under review at the Agency for submissions       that have been accepted (510(k) or De Novo request), filed       (PMA) or submitted (CLIA Waiver by application). FDA Days       begin on the date of receipt of the submission or of the       amendment to the submission that enables the submission to be       accepted (510(k) or De Novo request) or filed (PMA).      D. MDUFA Decisions        Original PMAs, Product Development Protocols, Panel-Track       Supplements, and Premarket Report Applications: Decisions are       approval, approvable, approvable pending GMP inspection, not       approvable, withdrawal, and denial.        180-Day PMA Supplements: Decisions for 180-Day PMA       Supplements are approval, approvable, and not approvable.        Real-Time PMA Supplements: Decisions for Real-Time PMA       supplements are approval, approvable, and not approvable.        510(k)s: Decisions for 510(k)s are substantially equivalent       (SE) or not substantially equivalent (NSE).        De Novo Requests: Decisions for De Novo requests are grant,       withdrawal, and decline.        CLIA Waiver by Application Submissions: Decisions for CLIA       Waiver by Application Submissions are approval, withdrawal,       and denial.        Submissions placed on Application Integrity Hold will be       removed from the MDUFA cohort.      E. Pre-Submission        A Pre-Submission includes a formal written request from an       applicant for feedback from FDA that is provided in the form       of a formal written response or, if the manufacturer chooses,       formal written feedback followed by a meeting or       teleconference in which any additional feedback or       clarifications are documented in meeting minutes.        A Pre-Submission provides the opportunity for an applicant       to obtain FDA feedback prior to intended submission of an       investigational device exemption or marketing application.       The request must include specific questions regarding review       issues relevant to a planned investigational device exemption       (IDE), CLIA Waiver by Application, Accessory Classification       Request, or marketing application (e.g., questions regarding       pre-clinical testing protocols or data requirements; design       and performance of clinical studies and acceptance criteria).       A Pre-Submission is appropriate when FDA's feedback on       specific questions is necessary to guide product development       and/or submission preparation.        The following forms of FDA feedback to applicants are not       considered Pre-Submissions.        Interactions requested by either the applicant or FDA       during the review of a marketing application (i.e., following       submission of a marketing application, but prior to reaching       an FDA Decision).        TPLC Advisory Program Pilot interactions.        General information requests initiated through the Division       of Industry and Consumer Assistance (DICE).        General questions regarding FDA policy or procedures.        Meetings or teleconferences that are intended to be       informational only, including, but not limited to, those       intended to educate the review team on new device(s) with       significant differences in technology from currently       available devices, or to update FDA about ongoing or future       product development, without a request for FDA feedback on       specific questions related to a planned submission.        Requests for clarification on technical guidance documents,       especially where contact is recommended by FDA in the       guidance document. However, the following requests will       generally need to be submitted as a Pre-Submission in order       to ensure appropriate input from multiple reviewers and       management: recommendations for device types not specifically       addressed in the guidance document; recommendations for       nonclinical or clinical studies not addressed in the guidance       document; requests regarding use of alternative means to       address recommendations specified in a guidance document.        Phone calls or email messages to reviewers that can be       readily answered based on a reviewer's experience and       knowledge and do not require the involvement of a broader       number of FDA staff beyond the routine involvement of the       reviewer's supervisor and more experienced mentors.      F. Substantive Interaction        Substantive Interaction is an email, letter,       teleconference, video conference, or other form of       communication such as a request for Additional Information or       Major Deficiency letters by FDA notifying the applicant of       substantive deficiencies identified in initial submission       review, or a communication stating that FDA has not       identified any deficiencies in the initial submission review       and any further minor deficiencies will be communicated       through interactive review. An approval or clearance letter       issued prior to the Substantive Interaction goal date will       qualify as a Substantive Interaction.        If substantive issues warranting issuance of an Additional       Information or Major Deficiency letter are not identified,       interactive review should be used to resolve any minor issues       and facilitate an FDA decision. In addition, interactive       review will be used, where, in FDA's estimation, it leads to       a more efficient review process during the initial review       cycle (i.e., prior to a Substantive Interaction) to resolve       minor issues such as revisions to administrative items (e.g.,       510(k) Summary/Statement, Indications for Use statement,       environmental impact assessment, financial disclosure       statements); a more detailed device description; omitted       engineering drawings; revisions to labeling; or clarification       regarding nonclinical or clinical study methods or data.        Minor issues may still be included in an Additional       Information or Major Deficiency letter where related to the       resolution of the substantive issues (e.g., modification of       the proposed Indications for Use may lead to revisions in       labeling and administrative items), or if they were still       unresolved following interactive review attempts. Both       interactive review and Substantive Interactions will occur on       the review clock except upon the issuance of an Additional       Information or Major Deficiency Letter which stops the review       clock.      G. Total Time to Decision        Total Time to Decision is the number of calendar days from       the date of receipt of an accepted (with respect to 510(k)s)       or filed (with respect to Original PMAs and Panel Track       Supplements) submission to a MDUFA decision.        For the purpose of calculating and reporting on 510(k)       shared outcome Total Time to Decision goals in section II,       the average Total Time to Decision for 510(k) submissions is       calculated as the average of Total Times to Decision for       510(k) submissions within a 99% closed cohort, with the       following provisions:        FY 2023, the cohort excludes submissions with any one hold       greater than 180 days and excluding the highest 5% of Total       Time to Decision on the remaining cohort.        FY 2024-2027, the cohort excludes the highest 2% and lowest       2% of values and includes all 510(k)s with a MDUFA decision.        In the number of submissions in any MDUFA V receipt cohort       exceeds the number of submissions in the FY 2021 or FY 2022       receipt cohort (whichever is higher) by 5% or more, a 1%       increase in the trim will be applied to the highest values.        A cohort for a FY is closed when 99% of the MDUFA cohort       has reached a MDUFA decision. For the purpose of determining       whether improved performance and fee revenue adjustments in       Section III are applicable, the 510(k) Shared Outcome Total       Time to Decision goal is calculated in the same manner except       that the calculation is conducted based on data available as       of 18 months following the close of the fiscal year to which       the goal applies, and the cohort does not need to be 99%       closed. See Section III.        For the purpose of calculating and reporting on PMA shared       outcome Total Time to Decision goals in Section II, the       average Total Time to Decision for PMAs is calculated as the       three-year rolling average of the annual Total Times to       Decision for Original PMAs and Panel Track supplements (for       example, for FY 2024, the average PMA Total Time to Decision       would be the average of FY 2022 through FY 2024) within a       closed cohort, excluding the highest 5% and the lowest 5% of       values. A cohort for a FY is closed when 95% of the MDUFA V       cohort has reached a MDUFA decision. For the purpose of       determining whether increased performance and fee revenue       adjustments in Section III are applicable, the PMA shared       outcome Total Time to Decision goal is calculated in the same       manner except that the calculation is conducted based on data       available as of 18 months following the close of the fiscal       year to which the goal applies and the cohort does not need       to be 95% closed.      H. Application Types        Original PMA means an application for an approval of a       device submitted under section 515(c) of the FD&C Act. It       does not include a  [[Page S5203]]       supplement to such an application after it has been approved       or a Premarket Report.        Premarket Report means a report submitted under section       515(c)(2) of the FD&C Act seeking premarket approval for a       class III reprocessed single use device.        Panel-Track Supplement means a supplement to an approved       Original PMA or Premarket Report that requests a significant       change in design or performance of the device, or a new       indication for use of the device, and for which substantial       clinical data are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance       of safety and effectiveness.        180-Day PMA Supplement means a supplement to an approved       Original PMA or Premarket Report that is not a panel-track       supplement and requests a significant change in components,       materials, design, specification, software, color additives,       or labeling.        Real-Time PMA Supplement means a supplement to an approved       Original PMA or Premarket Report that requests a minor change       to the device, such as a minor change to the design of the       device, software, sterilization, or labeling, and for which       the applicant has requested and the agency has granted a       meeting or similar forum to jointly review and determine the       status of the supplement.        De Novo Classification Request (De Novo Request) means a       request made under section 513(f)(2) of the FD&C Act with       respect to the classification of a device.        Premarket Notification (510(k)) Submission means a report       submitted under section 510(k) of the FD&C Act.      I. BLA-related Definitions        Review and act on--the issuance of a complete action letter       after the complete review of a filed complete application.       The action letter, if it is not an approval, will set forth       in detail the specific deficiencies and, where appropriate,       the actions necessary to place the application in condition       for approval.        Class 1 resubmitted applications applications resubmitted       after a complete response letter that includes the following       items only (or combinations of these items):        (a) Final printed labeling        (b) Draft labeling        (c) Safety updates submitted in the same format, including       tabulations, as the original safety submission with new data       and changes highlighted (except when large amounts of new       information including important new adverse experiences not       previously reported with the product are presented in the       resubmission)        (d) Stability updates to support provisional or final       dating periods        (e) Commitments to perform Phase 4 studies, including       proposals for such studies        (f) Assay validation data        (g) Final release testing on the last 1-2 lots used to       support approval        (h) A minor reanalysis of data previously submitted to the       application (determined by the Agency as fitting the Class 1       category)        (i) Other minor clarifying information (determined by the       Agency as fitting the Class 1 category)        (j) Other specific items may be added later as the Agency       gains experience with the scheme and will be communicated via       guidance documents to industry        Class 2 resubmitted applications resubmissions that include       any other items, including any item that would require       presentation to an advisory committee.

Definitions  GDUFA Reauthorization Performance Goals and Program Enhancements Fiscal                              Years 2023-2027         This document contains the performance goals and program       enhancements for the Generic Drug User Fee Amendments (GDUFA)       reauthorization for fiscal years (FYs) 2023-2027, known as       GDUFA III. It is commonly referred to as the ``Goals Letter''       or ``Commitment Letter.'' The Goals Letter represents the       product of the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA or the       Agency) discussions with the regulated industry and public       stakeholders, as mandated by Congress. The performance goals       and program enhancements specified in this letter apply to       aspects of the generic drug assessment program and build on       the GDUFA program established and enhanced through previous       authorizations. New enhancements to the program are designed       to maximize the efficiency and utility of each assessment       cycle, with the intent to reduce the number of assessment       cycles for abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs) and       facilitate timely access to quality, affordable, safe and       effective generic medicines. Certain new enhancements are       specifically designed to foster the development, assessment,       and approval of Complex Generic Products. FDA is committed to       meeting the performance goals specified in this letter and to       continuous improvement of the Agency's performance.    GDUFA Reauthorization Performance Goals and Procedures Fiscal Years                                 2023-2027         The performance goals and procedures of FDA, as agreed to       under the third authorization of the generic drug user fee       program, are summarized below.        Unless otherwise stated, goals apply to cohorts of each       fiscal year. For the purposes of calculating all time periods       in this Commitment Letter, FDA will calculate the goal date       from the day after a submission, to be consistent with FDA's       other user fee programs.                  I. SUBMISSION ASSESSMENT PERFORMANCE GOALS       A. Original ANDAs and Amendments        1. Assess and act on 90 percent of standard original ANDAs       within 10 months of the date of ANDA submission, subject to       any adjustments to the goal dates described in section       I(A)(3).        2. Assess and act on 90 percent of priority original ANDAs       within the applicable assessment goal, subject to any       adjustments to the goal dates described in section I(A)(3).        a. Assess and act on priority original ANDAs within 8       months of the date of ANDA submission if the applicant       submits a Pre-Submission Facility Correspondence (PFC) not       later than 60 days prior to the date of ANDA submission, and       the PFC is found to be complete and accurate, subject to the       limitations set forth in section I(A)(2)(b).        b. Assess and act on priority original ANDAs within 10       months of the date of ANDA submission if:        i. the applicant submits a PFC later than 60 days prior to       the date of ANDA submission, or does not submit a PFC;        ii. information in a PFC is found to be incomplete or       inaccurate;        iii. the information submitted in the ANDA differs       significantly from what was submitted in the PFC; or        iv. FDA, upon assessment of a final bioequivalence study       report submitted in the ANDA, determines that an inspection       of the relevant site or sites is necessary.        3. If, upon initial submission, a standard or priority       original ANDA contains a certification that a site/facility       listed on the Form FDA 356h is not ready for inspection       (i.e., the box ``no'' is checked in response to ``is the site       ready for inspection?'' in section 28), FDA will set a goal       date that is 15 months from the date of submission. FDA will       conduct a filing review of such an ANDA but will not commence       substantive assessment of the application until an amendment       described in subsection I(A)(3)(a) is submitted, or the goal       date is reset pursuant to I(A)(3)(b).        a. During the initial 15-month review period, if the       applicant submits an amendment with a Form FDA 356h that       certifies all facilities are ready for inspection, FDA will       set a new goal date that is 8 months from the  [[Page S5204]]       date of submission for priority amendments (if a PFC was       submitted per I(A)(2)(a)), or 10 months from the date of       submission for other amendments.        b. If the applicant does not submit an amendment described       in I(A)(3)(a) by 30 days before the goal date, FDA will reset       the goal date for an additional 15 months, i.e., 30 months       from the date of original ANDA submission. FDA will assess       and act on 90 percent of such ANDAs within 30 months of the       date of the original submission as applicable.        4. Assess and act on 90 percent of standard Major       Amendments within the applicable assessment goal.        a. Assess and act on standard Major Amendments within 8       months of the date of amendment submission if preapproval       inspection is not required.        b.

II. ORIGINAL ANDA ASSESSMENT PROGRAM ENHANCEMENTS       A. ANDA Receipt        1. FDA will strive to determine whether to receive ANDAs       within 60 days of the date of ANDA submission.        2. To enable FDA to rapidly determine whether to receive an       ANDA pursuant to 21 CFR 314.101, and with consideration of       final Agency guidances that address ANDA receipt       determinations, FDA will communicate minor technical       deficiencies (e.g., document legibility) and deficiencies       potentially resolved with information in the ANDA at original       submission within 10 days of original ANDA submission. If a       deficiency is resolved within 10 days, that deficiency will       not be a basis for a refuse-to-receive decision.        3. At the time of receipt, FDA will notify the applicant in       the acceptance letter whether the ANDA or PAS is subject to       priority or standard assessment.      B. ANDA Assessment Transparency and Communications           Enhancements        To promote transparency and communication between FDA and       ANDA applicants, FDA will apply the assessment program       enhancements below to the assessment of all ANDAs. The goal       of these program enhancements is to improve predictability       and transparency, promote the efficiency and effectiveness of       the review process, minimize the number of assessment cycles       necessary for approval, increase the overall rate of       approval, and facilitate greater access to generic drug       products.        1. Information Requests (IRs) and Discipline Review Letters       (DRLs):        a. IRs and DRLs do not stop the assessment clock.        b. In the first assessment cycle, FDA will issue the       appropriate IR(s) and/or DRL(s) from each assessment       discipline by the mid-point of the assessment, with the       exception of the Labeling discipline as described in       subsection II(B)(2) below.        i. In a Mid-Cycle DRL, the assessment discipline will       assign a due date for response and identify major and minor       deficiencies.        ii. If an applicant responds by the response due date, FDA       will assess a response to minor deficiencies within the       originally assigned goal date for the submission, subject to       the exceptions described in II(B)(1)(iii).        iii. Responses to any major deficiencies, or to minor       deficiencies that include data and information that require       comparable FDA assessment resources to those required for       major deficiencies, for example, a consult, will be       considered Major Amendments. FDA will extend the goal date       consistent with the number of months needed to assess a       comparable standard or priority Major Amendment (see section       I(A)(4)-(6)).        c. FDA will issue IRs and DRLs after the midpoint of the       first assessment cycle and at any time in subsequent       assessment cycles, when, in FDA's judgment, there are one or       more minor deficiencies in a discipline that, if resolved       using an IR or DRL, could lead to approval or tentative       approval of an ANDA in the current assessment cycle. FDA will       issue the IR or DRL and provide a due date for the       applicant's response before the goal date.        i. If the applicant responds to the minor deficiencies in       the IR or DRL by the due date, and FDA finds the amendment to       satisfactorily address all of the issues identified in the IR       or DRL, and the response does not contain unsolicited       information, FDA may extend the goal date by 90 days from the       date of the applicant's response.        ii. FDA's decision to extend the goal date will be       communicated in an amendment acknowledgement letter.        iii. FDA will continue to issue IRs and/or DRLs late in the       assessment cycle for original submissions and amendments       until it is no longer feasible within the current assessment       cycle for the applicant to develop and FDA to assess a       response to the IR and/or DRL. For IRs and DRLs issued past       the mid-point of the assessment cycle, the assessment       discipline generally will assign a due date for response and       identify major and minor deficiencies. DRLs issued without a       response due date likely will signify a forthcoming CRL.        d. If the applicant does not provide a complete response to       an IR and/or DRL by the response due date (or any agreed-upon       extension), FDA may include the same deficiencies from the IR       or DRL in a CRL and assess the response during the next       assessment cycle.        e. If a discipline identifies a Significant Major       deficiency, that deficiency will be communicated in a CRL as       soon as is feasible.        2. Specific commitments related to IRs and DRLs for       labeling:        a. In the first assessment cycle, the Labeling Discipline       will:        i. upon receiving an ANDA for assessment, make an initial       determination whether there is a need for a consult to be       issued to another review discipline, including for a consult       regarding an applicant's request to ``carve out'' language in       the proposed labeling protected by patents or exclusivities,       and will initiate such consults;        ii. strive to issue any DRL at approximately months 6-7 of       the assessment for those ANDAs with a 10-month goal date, or       months 5-6 of the assessment for those ANDAs with an 8-month       goal date, with the exception that there may be a delay of       the issuance of any labeling deficiencies that result from       changes to the labeling of the reference listed drug (RLD) or       a new exclusivity or patent listing;        iii. limit the assessment of labeling to one IR/DRL if       other disciplines will not be acceptable during the first       cycle; and        iv. continue to assess labeling to enable an action within       the assessment cycle if other disciplines are acceptable.        b. Labeling IRs and DRLs in all assessment cycles:        FDA will minimize issuing CRLs that contain only labeling       deficiencies by, for example, utilizing later-cycle IRs and       the imminent action process.        3. Imminent Actions:        a. FDA will continue assessment of an ANDA past the goal       date if, in FDA's judgment, it may be possible to approve or       tentatively approve an ANDA within 60 days after the goal       date. Such circumstances may include:        i. When the application meets the requirements for       tentative approval by the goal date, but the legally       permissible ANDA approval date is within 60 days after the       goal date, and FDA may be able to approve the ANDA when it       becomes legally permissible to do so.        ii. When FDA may be able to approve or tentatively approve       an application submitted by a first applicant by the 30-month       forfeiture date described in section 505(j)(5)(D)(i)(IV) of       the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) (21       U.S.C. 355(j)(5)(D)(i)(IV)).        iii. When, at the sole discretion of FDA, and subject to       resources, one or more small issues remain from one or more       disciplines that in FDA's judgment may be resolved within 60       days after the goal date.        b. If an ANDA is approved or tentatively approved within 60       days after the goal date, the goal date will be considered to       have been met.        4. FDA will strive to act prior to a goal date, or the 60-      day period for an imminent action, when the assessment is       complete and there are no outstanding deficiencies.        5. To facilitate the labeling assessment, an applicant will       clearly state in the cover letter to an ANDA, amendment, PAS,       or PAS Amendment that the submission includes a proposed       labeling carve-out.        6. Communication regarding Deficiencies and Actions:        a. With respect to imminent actions, applicants may inquire       and FDA will promptly respond to an applicant inquiry seeking       information as to whether FDA intends to work through the       goal date in accordance with section II(B)(3). This       communication will be preliminary and subject to change.        b. If a regulatory project manager (RPM) learns that a       major deficiency is likely forthcoming, the RPM will notify       the applicant. The RPM will not be expected to discuss the       nature of the specific forthcoming deficiencies prior to       issuance of the CRL.        c. If an RPM learns that FDA is likely to miss the goal       date for an ANDA, the RPM will notify the applicant of the       delay in taking an action, identify the general reason for       the delay including the outstanding discipline(s), if any,       and the estimated time for FDA's action on the application.        d. The applicant may periodically request a Review Status       Update for each discipline. In response to the applicant's       request, the RPM will timely provide a Review Status Update       for each discipline.        7. FDA will indicate the assessment classification for a       responding amendment in a CRL and include FDA's basis for       classifying a responding amendment as Major.        8. Applicants who receive a CRL have the following options       with respect to engaging with FDA prior to responding to the       CRL:        a. A post-CRL teleconference to seek clarification       concerning deficiencies identified in a CRL. FDA will grant       appropriate requests for teleconferences requested by       applicants upon receiving first-cycle CRLs and upon receiving       subsequent CRLs. An appropriate request is one that clearly       identifies the specific deficiencies to be discussed and the       reason why such deficiencies are not clear. FDA will provide       a scheduled date for 90 percent of post-CRL teleconferences       within 14 days of the request for a teleconference and       conduct 90 percent of such post-CRL teleconferences, if       granted, within 30 days of receipt of the written request;        b. Submission of a Controlled Correspondence as described       in section I(E); or        c. A post-CRL Scientific Meeting to request scientific       advice on possible approaches to address deficiencies       identified in  [[Page S5206]]       a CRL related to establishing equivalence, subject to the       conditions described in section IV(C).      C. Assessment Classification Changes During the Assessment           Cycle        1. If during the assessment of an ANDA, ANDA amendment,       PAS, or PAS amendment, the assessment classification changes       from Standard to Priority, FDA will notify the applicant       within 14 days of the date of the change.        2. An applicant may request a change in the assessment       classification at any time during the assessment.        3. Once an ANDA or PAS submission is classified as being       subject to priority assessment, the application will retain       such priority assessment classification status for the       duration of that assessment cycle.        4. FDA will include an explanation of the reasons for any       denial of an assessment status reclassification request.        5. If an applicant requests a teleconference as part of its       request to reclassify a Major Amendment or standard       assessment status, FDA will schedule and conduct the       teleconference and decide 90 percent of such reclassification       requests within 30 days of the date of FDA's receipt of the       request for a teleconference. This goal only applies when the       applicant accepts the first scheduled teleconference date       offered by FDA. This goal does not apply to a Major Amendment       in response to a CRL that was deemed major only due to a       facility deficiency (``Facility-Based Major CRL Amendment'')       described in section II(C)(7).        6. An amendment in response to a CRL classified by FDA as       Minor that is submitted more than one year after the date FDA       issued the CRL will be reclassified as a Major Amendment,       except for ANDAs for products that are on the drug shortage       list under section 506E of the FD&C Act (21 U.S.C. 356e), or       are the subject of a response to a Public Health Emergency as       declared by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health       and Human Services under section 319 of the Public Health       Service Act (PHS Act) (42 U.S.C. 247d), or are anticipated to       be subject to the same criteria as apply to such a       declaration, at the time of submission.        7. Reclassification of Facility-Based Major CRL Amendments        a. Upon submission of a Facility-Based Major CRL Amendment,       an applicant can request that FDA reclassify the Major       Amendment to minor.        b. A request for reclassification must be made at the time       of amendment submission and include supporting information       detailing why the facility deficiency has been resolved and       no additional facility assessment is needed.        c. FDA will grant the request to reclassify the Facility-      Based Major CRL Amendment if FDA determines that none of the       following are necessary to complete the assessment of the       amendment:        i. A facility inspection        ii. Use of alternate tools for facility assessment        iii. Continued assessment of inspection deficiency       responses        d. If FDA denies the request, the Agency will communicate       the substantive basis of the denial to the applicant and the       ANDA amendment will be assigned a 6-, 8- or 10-month goal       date, as applicable, from the original date of the amendment       submission.        e. FDA will make a decision on a request for       reclassification of a Facility-Based Major CRL Amendment       within 30 days from the date of submission for priority       amendments, and within 60 days from the date of submission       for standard amendments. If the Facility-Based Major CRL       Amendment is reclassified as minor, the goal date will be 3       months from the end of the 30- or 60-day decisional period,       as applicable.        f. The goal dates for decisions on requests for       reclassification and amendment assessment for which a request       for reclassification is submitted are as follows:    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                       FDA Response Regarding   New ANDA Goal Date if           Submission Type                 Major to Minor         Reclassification          ANDA Goal Date if                                          Reclassification             Granted           Reclassification Denied ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Standard Major Amendment...........  Within 60 days of        Within 5 months of      Within 8 months of                                       submission date.         submission date.        submission date if                                                                                        preapproval inspection is                                                                                        not required.                                                                                       Within 10 months of                                                                                        submission date if                                                                                        preapproval inspection is                                                                                        required. Priority Major Amendment...........  Within 30 days of        Within 4 months of      Within 6 months of                                       submission date.         submission date.        submission date if                                                                                        preapproval inspection is                                                                                        not required.                                                                                       Within 8 months of                                                                                        submission date if                                                                                        preapproval inspection                                                                                        required and applicant                                                                                        meets the requirements                                                                                        under section I(A)(5)(b).                                                                                       Within 10 months of                                                                                        submission date if                                                                                        preapproval inspection                                                                                        required and applicant                                                                                        meets any limitations as                                                                                        described under section                                                                                        I(A)(6). ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------       D. ANDA Approval and Tentative Approval        If applicants submit and maintain ANDAs consistent with the       statutory requirements for approval under 505(j) of the FD&C       Act; respond to IRs and DRLs completely and within the time       frames requested by FDA; and timely submit all required       information under 21 CFR parts 314 and 210, including       information concerning notice (21 CFR 314.95), litigation       status (21 CFR 314.107), and commercial marketing (21 CFR       314.107); then FDA will strive to:        1. Approve approvable ANDAs in the first assessment cycle;        2. Approve First Generics on the earliest lawful approval       date, if known to FDA; and        3. Tentatively approve or approve ANDAs for ``First       Applicants'' as described in section 505(j)(5)(B)(iv)(II)(bb)       of the FD&C Act to avoid forfeiture of 180-day exclusivity.      E. Dispute Resolution        1. An applicant may pursue a request for reconsideration       within the assessment discipline at the Division level or       original signatory authority, as needed.        2. The Office of Generic Drugs, Office of Regulatory       Operations Associate Director will track each request for       Division-level reconsideration through resolution.        3. Following resolution of a request for reconsideration,       an applicant may pursue formal dispute resolution above the       Division level, pursuant to procedures set forth in Formal       Dispute Resolution: Sponsor Appeals Above the Division Level       Guidance for Industry and Review Staff (May 2019).        4. FDA will respond to 90 percent of appeals above the       Division level within 30 days of CDER's receipt of the       written appeal.        5. CDER's Formal Dispute Resolution Project Manager (or       designee) will track each formal appeal above the Division       level through resolution.      F. Pre-Submission Facility Correspondence        1. For the purposes of section I.A. and I.B. above, FDA       will consider a PFC to be complete and accurate if the       submission consists of the following:        a. For each manufacturing and testing facility involved in       manufacturing processes and testing for the ANDA and       corresponding Type II API DMF:        i. facility name, operation(s) performed, facility contact       name, address, FDA Establishment Identifier (FEI) number (if       a required registrant or one has been assigned), DUNS number,       registration information (for required registrants), and a       confirmation that the facility is ready for inspection,        ii. information needed to inform FDA's decision regarding       the need for a preapproval inspection, such as a description       of the manufacturing process and controls of critical steps,       identification of any anticipated differences between pilot/      exhibit scale and commercial scale processes, and as       otherwise described in the guidance for industry on ANDAs:       Pre-Submission of Facility Information Related to Prioritized       Generic Drug Applications (Pre-Submission Facility       Correspondence) (November 2017) and any revisions, and        iii. a certification by the applicant that any Type II DMF       has similarly complete and accurate facility information,       including complete facility information (i.e., facility name,       operation, facility contact name, address, FEI number and       DUNS number, and a confirmation that the facility is ready       for inspection).        b. Information needed to inform FDA's decision regarding       the need for a preapproval inspection, such as a description       of the drug substance manufacturing process, that is included       in a corresponding Type II DMF is not required to be       duplicated in the PFC for the ANDA if it is included in a       corresponding Type II DMF.        c. For all sites or organizations involved in all       bioequivalence and clinical studies used to support the ANDA       submission: site names, addresses, and website; the study       numbers; a list and description of all study investigators       consistent with the guidance ICH E3 Structure and Content of       Clinical Study Reports (July 1996) section 16.1.4; the study       conduct dates; and study protocols and any available       amendments.        d. For all sites or organizations involved in analytical       studies used to support the ANDA application submission the       following are required: analytical site name, address, and       website. For those studies that were initiated no later than       60 days prior to the ANDA submission, additional requirements       are:        i. a list of investigator name(s)        ii. study conduct dates; and        iii. if the analytical method validation was completed       before dosing, the analytical method validation study       report(s).        e. This information is provided using a standardized       electronic format and includes unique identifiers that are       current and accurate.        2. Changes to information contained in a PFC when submitted       in an ANDA that are considered a ``significant change''       include changes in the identified facilities for manufacture       of the drug substance or drug product, the proposed       manufacturing operations or operating principles, and the       order of manufacturing unit operations, as described in the       guidance ANDAs: Pre-Submission of  [[Page S5207]]       Facility Information Related to Prioritized Generic Drug       Applications (Pre-Submission Facility Correspondence)       (November 2017) and any revisions.      G. Other ANDA Assessment Program Aspirations        1. FDA aspires to continually improve the efficiency of the       ANDA Assessment program.        2. The absence of a GDUFA III commitment for a specific       program function does not imply that the program function is       not important. For example, other program functions include       determining whether listed drugs were voluntarily withdrawn       from sale for reasons of safety or effectiveness and ANDA       proprietary name evaluations.                            iii. pre-anda program       A. Goal of Pre-ANDA Program        1. The goal of the pre-ANDA program is to clarify       regulatory expectations for prospective applicants early in       product development, assist applicants in developing more       complete submissions, promote a more efficient and effective       ANDA assessment process, and reduce the number of assessment       cycles required to obtain ANDA approval.        2. Some elements of these programs are tailored to enhance       the development of Complex Generic Products. Complex Generic       Products can raise unique scientific and regulatory       considerations, and FDA is committed to providing further       transparency and clarity on Complex Generic Product       development and assessment to help increase the availability       of these products.      B. Suitability Petitions        1. In FY 2023, FDA will work diligently to enhance the       Agency's processes for reviewing and responding to petitions       submitted under section 505(j)(2)(C) of the FD&C Act       (commonly referred to as ``suitability petitions''), and to       review and respond to pending suitability petitions.        2. Prior to FY 2024, FDA will take appropriate action to       determine if petitioners who submitted suitability petitions       prior to FY 2023 remain interested in a response.        3. FDA will conduct a completeness assessment for       suitability petitions submitted in FY 2024-2027. The       timeframe for the completeness assessment will be:        a. 21 days after the date of petition submission; or        b. If an IR is issued as part of the completeness       assessment and the petitioner submits a response, FDA will       finish the completeness assessment within 21 days after the       date of receipt of the IR response.        4. Any suitability petition submitted in FY 2024-2027 will       receive a goal date described in section III(B)(7). Any       suitability petitions submitted to FDA prior to FY 2024 will       not receive a goal date. If a petitioner wants to receive a       goal date on a suitability petition submitted prior to FY       2024, the petitioner may withdraw and submit a new       suitability petition in FY 2024-2027.        5. The date of submission for the purposes of determining       the fiscal year of submission will be the date of FDA's       completion of the completeness assessment.        6. FDA will prioritize the review of suitability petitions       for a drug product that:        a. could mitigate or resolve a drug shortage and prevent       future shortages;        b. address a public health emergency declared by the       Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services       under section 319 of the PHS Act, or anticipated under the       same criteria as apply to such a declaration;        c. is for a new strength of a parenteral product that could       aid in eliminating pharmaceutical waste or mitigating the       number of vials needed per dose by addressing differences in       patient weight, body size, or age; or        d. is subject to special review programs under the       President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).        7. Beginning in FY 2024, FDA will review and respond to       suitability petitions that have been assigned a goal date       pursuant to the following goals:        a. In FY 2024, 50 percent of submissions within 6 months       after completeness assessment, up to a maximum of 50       suitability petitions completed;        b. In FY 2025, 70 percent of submissions within 6 months       after completeness assessment, up to a maximum of 70       suitability petitions completed;        c. In FY 2026, 80 percent of submissions within 6 months       after completeness assessment, up to a maximum of 80       suitability petitions completed; and        d. In FY 2027, 90 percent of submissions within 6 months       after completeness assessment, up to a maximum of 90       suitability petitions completed.        8. As a general matter, if FDA misses goal dates on       suitability petitions due to increased submissions, FDA will       prioritize the review of suitability petitions for which a       goal date was missed prior to reviewing newly submitted       suitability petitions for the current fiscal year, except for       those suitability petitions that are prioritized under       section III(B)(6). See Appendix for additional information on       FDA's review of suitability petitions in GDUFA III.      C. Product-Specific Guidance        1. FDA will continue to issue PSG identifying the       methodology for generating evidence needed to support ANDA       approval.        2. FDA will issue PSGs consistent with the following goals:        a. For Complex Products approved in new drug applications       (NDAs) on or after October 1, 2022, a PSG will be issued for       50 percent of such NDA products within 2 years after the date       of approval, and for 75 percent of such NDA products within 3       years after the date of approval.        b. FDA will continue to develop PSGs for Complex Products       approved prior to October 1, 2022, for which no PSG has been       published.        c. For non-complex drug products approved in NDAs on or       after October 1, 2022, that contain a new chemical entity       (NCE) (as described in section 505(j)(5)(F)(ii) of the FD&C       Act), a PSG will be issued within 2 years after the date of       approval for 90 percent of such products.        3. Information on PSG Development:        a. FDA will provide on its website information related to       upcoming new and revised PSGs to support the development and       approval of safe and effective generic drug products,       including the projected date of PSG publication, which may be       subject to change. When FDA becomes aware that it will not       meet the issuance date listed on the website, FDA will update       the website to provide a new projected issuance date in the       next scheduled update.        b. FDA routinely will update the information on this       website approximately every 4 months.        c. PSGs will be developed (or revised) and issued in       accordance with FDA's Good Guidance Practices and will be       reviewed by senior management and other designated subject       matter experts prior to publication and after consideration       of any public comments submitted to the relevant docket of a       published draft or final PSG.        4. Prioritization of PSG Development:        a. FDA will make available on its website information on       how the Agency prioritizes the development of PSGs.        b. Industry may request via the portal for Controlled       Correspondence that FDA develop a PSG. FDA will consider this       request in prioritizing PSG development but will not consider       this to be a Controlled Correspondence.        c. FDA will seek public input on prioritization of PSGs       annually during the public meeting on research prioritization       described in section V(B)(2).        d. For Complex Products, FDA generally will prioritize the       development of PSGs for Complex Products that contain a NCE       (as described in section 505(j)(5)(F)(ii) of the FD&C Act)       over Complex Products that do not contain an NCE.        5. When a new or revised PSG is published and an applicant       or prospective applicant has already commenced an in vivo       bioequivalence study (i.e., the study protocol has been       signed by the study sponsor and/or the contract research       organization) the applicant or prospective applicant may       request a PSG Teleconference to obtain Agency feedback on the       potential impact of the new or revised PSG on its development       program.        a. To be eligible for a PSG Teleconference, the applicant       or prospective applicant must submit with the meeting request       the signature page of the relevant in vivo study protocol       signed by the study sponsor and/or the contract research       organization.        b. FDA will hold a PSG Teleconference within 30 days after       the receipt of the meeting request. The PSG Teleconference       will be scheduled for 60 minutes.        c. If the applicant seeks further feedback from FDA after a       PSG Teleconference, the applicant may utilize the Controlled       Correspondence process or request an additional meeting. The       purpose of this meeting is to provide a forum in which       industry can discuss the scientific rationale for an approach       other than the approach recommended in the PSG to ensure that       the approach complies with the relevant statutes and       regulations.        i. If the applicant has not submitted an ANDA, the       prospective applicant can submit a request for a Pre-      Submission PSG Meeting. FDA will grant or deny the meeting       within 14 days after receipt of the request and if granted,       will schedule the meeting within 120 days after receipt of       the request.        ii. If the applicant has submitted an ANDA, the applicant       can submit a request for a Post-Submission PSG Meeting. FDA       will grant or deny the meeting within 14 days after receipt       of the request, and if granted, will schedule the meeting       within 90 days after receipt of the request.        iii. FDA may deny a Pre- or Post-Submission PSG Meeting if       the request is incomplete, or the inquiry would be more       appropriately resolved through a Controlled Correspondence.       FDA may grant a Pre- or Post-Submission Meeting request after       such a Controlled Correspondence if the Agency determines       that any issue(s) remain unresolved or would be more       appropriately resolved in a meeting.        iv. Applicants and prospective applicants are eligible to       request a Pre-Submission PSG Meeting or Post-Submission PSG       Meeting regardless of whether they have had a Product       Development Meeting or a post-CRL Scientific Meeting.        6. When FDA intends to issue a new or revised PSG and there       are ANDAs under review that may be impacted by changes to the       new or revised PSG, FDA will ensure that at least division-      level program leadership is aware of the potential impact on       the pending ANDAs for drug products with related new or       revised PSGs.      D. Product Development Meetings        1. A prospective applicant can request a pre-ANDA       submission Product Development Meeting. The purpose of the       meeting is to provide a forum for a scientific exchange on       specific issues (e.g., a proposed study design,  [[Page S5208]]       alternative approach, additional study expectations, or       questions) in which FDA will provide targeted advice       regarding an ongoing ANDA development program.        2. FDA will grant a prospective applicant a Product       Development Meeting if, in FDA's judgment:        a. The requested Product Development Meeting concerns:        i. Development of a Complex Generic Product for which FDA       has not issued a PSG; or        ii. An alternative equivalence evaluation, i.e., change in       study type, such as in vitro to clinical, for a Complex       Generic Product for which FDA has issued a PSG;        b. The prospective applicant submits a complete meeting       package, including a data package and specific proposals;        c. A Controlled Correspondence response would not       adequately address the prospective applicant's questions; and        d. A Product Development Meeting would significantly       improve ANDA assessment efficiency.        3. Dependent on available resources, FDA may grant a       prospective applicant a Product Development Meeting       concerning development issues other than those described in       Section III(D)(2) if, in FDA's judgment:        a. The prospective applicant submits a complete meeting       package, including a data package and specific proposals;        b. A Controlled Correspondence response would not       adequately address the prospective applicant's questions; and        c. A Product Development Meeting would significantly       improve ANDA assessment efficiency.        4. FDA will grant or deny 90 percent of Product Development       Meeting requests within 14 days after receipt of the meeting       request.        5. FDA will conduct 90 percent of Product Development       Meetings within 120 days after the meeting is granted.        6. FDA can meet the Product Development Meeting goal by       either conducting a meeting or providing a meaningful written       response that will inform drug development and/or regulatory       decision-making to the prospective applicant, within the       applicable goal date.        7. Unless FDA is providing a written response to satisfy       the Product Development Meeting goal, FDA will provide       preliminary written comments before each Product Development       Meeting (and aspire to provide the written comments 5 days       before the meeting) and will provide meeting minutes within       30 days following the meeting.      E. Pre-Submission Meetings        1. Prospective applicants may request a Pre-Submission       Meeting. The purpose of a Pre-Submission Meeting is to       provide an applicant the opportunity to present unique or       novel data or information that will be included in the ANDA       submission such as formulation, key studies, justifications,       and/or methods used in product development, as well as the       interrelationship of the data and information in the ANDA.       FDA will grant a Pre-Submission Meeting, if the applicant was       granted a Product Development Meeting for the same Complex       Generic Product or FDA believes in its sole discretion that       the Pre-Submission Meeting would improve assessment       efficiency.        2. For Pre-Submission Meetings, FDA will:        a. Identify the ANDA assessment team members who will       attend the meeting;        b. I entify additional content for the meeting in the       letter granting the meeting request, including information on       what topics should be addressed in the meeting in addition to       those identified in the meeting request by the applicant; and        c. Identify at the meeting, items or information for       clarification before the applicant's submission of the ANDA.        3. FDA will not provide a substantive assessment of summary       data or full study reports at the meeting.        4. An applicant's decision not to request a Pre-Submission       Meeting will not prejudice the receipt or assessment of an       ANDA.        5. FDA will grant or deny 90 percent of Pre-Submission       Meeting requests within 30 days.        6. If. granted, FDA will conduct 90 percent of Pre-      Submission Meetings within 60 days of the meeting request.        7. FDA will provide preliminary written comments 5 days       before each meeting, and meeting minutes within 30 days after       the meeting.                     IV. ANDA Assessment Meeting Program       A. Goal of the ANDA Assessment Meeting Program        1. The goal of the ANDA Assessment Meeting Program is to       provide or continue to provide targeted, robust advice to       ANDA applicants as they work to meet the standards for ANDA       approval.        2. Some elements of this program are tailored to enhance       the development of Complex Generic Products.      B. Mid-Cycle Review Meetings and Enhanced Mid-Cycle Review           Meetings        1. If an applicant for a Complex Generic Product was       granted a Product Development Meeting for the same product,       they may, within 7 days of receiving the last mid-Cycle DRL,       submits a request for a Mid-Cycle Review Meeting or an       Enhanced Mid-Cycle Meeting. The request should describe the       specific deficiency(ies) to be discussed.        2. Mid-Cycle Review Meetings:        a. The purpose of a Mid-Cycle Review Meeting is for the       applicant to ask for the rationale for any deficiency       identified in the mid-cycle DRL(s), and/or to ask questions       related to FDA's assessment of the data or information in       the ANDA. An applicant may not present any new data or       information at this meeting.        b. The Mid-Cycle Review Meeting will take place within 30       days after the date the sponsor submits a meeting request.        3. Enhanced Mid-Cycle Review Meetings:        a. The purpose of this meeting is for the applicant to ask       questions related to a proposed scientific path to address       possible deficiencies identified in the mid-cycle DRL(s). An       applicant may ask questions about potential new data or       information to address any possible deficiencies identified       in the mid-cycle DRL(s). FDA will discuss the data and       information but will not provide substantive assessment of       data or information provided by the applicant at the meeting.        b. If an Enhanced Mid-Cycle Review Meeting is requested,       the meeting will take place within 90 days after issuance of       the last mid-cycle DRL.        c. FDA will extend the ANDA goal date by 60 days if an       applicant requests an Enhanced Mid-Cycle Review Meeting. FDA       also will extend the response due date for the relevant       DRL(s) by recalculating the response due date starting from       the date of the meeting, e.g., if the response was due 30       days after the DRL was issued, it will now be due 30 days       after the Enhanced Mid-Cycle Review Meeting.        d. An applicant may submit an Unsolicited Amendment after       an Enhanced Mid-Cycle Review Meeting, which could result in       an additional goal date extension consistent with section       I(C).      C. Post-CRL Scientific Meetings        1. An applicant can request a Post-CRL Scientific Meeting.       The purpose of this meeting is to provide an applicant       scientific advice on possible approaches to address       deficiencies identified in a CRL related to establishing       equivalence.        a. An applicant's meeting request must discuss:        iii. a new equivalence study needed to address the       deficiencies in the design identified in the CRL,        iv. an approach that is different from that submitted in       the ANDA, e.g., a change in study type from in vivo to in       vitro,        v. a new comparative use human factors study, or        vi. a new approach to demonstrating sameness of a complex       active ingredient; and        b. FDA will grant the meeting if it is for a Complex       Generic Product or in FDA's judgment the request raises       issues that are best addressed via this meeting process and       cannot be adequately addressed through Controlled       Correspondence.        c. An applicant may have a post-CRL teleconference       described in section II(B)(8)(a) prior to requesting this       meeting.        2. FDA will grant or deny the Post-CRL Scientific Meeting       request within 14 days after receipt of the request.        3. FDA will hold the Post-CRL Scientific Meeting within 90       days after the date the meeting is granted.        4. Applicants are eligible to request a Post-CRL Scientific       Meeting even if they have not had a Product Development
