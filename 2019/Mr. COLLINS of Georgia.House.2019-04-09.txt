 Mr. Speaker, I have released several  transcripts of interviews from the Judiciary Committee's investigation  into the apparent wrongdoing at the FBI and the Justice Department.  Today, I am releasing another.   The American people deserve transparency. They deserve to know what  transpired at the highest levels of the FBI and at the origin of the  probe into President Trump's campaign.   Therefore, Mr. Speaker, I request that the link  www.dougcollins.house.gov/baker be placed in the Record so the American  people can review the transcript of one of James Baker's interviews.   Out of an abundance of caution, this transcript has a limited number  of narrowly tailored redactions, relating only to confidential sources  and methods, nonpublic information about ongoing investigations, and  nonmaterial personal information.   I will continue to work to release as many transcripts as possible,  including the entirety of Mr. Baker's interviews with the Judiciary  Committee.   The American people deserve the truth.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1957, the Taxpayer First  Act. The Taxpayer First Act modernizes the IRS and ensures that the IRS  cannot abuse its enforcement powers.   To that end, in 2013, a fellow northeast Georgian, Andrew Clyde,  experienced IRS abuse in the form of civil asset forfeiture firsthand.  Andrew is a Navy veteran who has served multiple tours of duty, and he  owns Clyde Armory in Athens, Georgia. The IRS seized $950,000 from his  bank accounts despite no evidence of criminal activity. The IRS seized  his accounts under what is called structuring laws.   Under structuring laws, the IRS may seize money if an individual made  regular deposits or withdrawals of less than $10,000. The law was  originally intended to catch those trying to conceal a crime, but, too  often, it has been used to target innocent individuals and small  business owners.   Andrew Clyde went to court to challenge the IRS abuse and was  eventually forced to forfeit $50,000 to the IRS and spend over $100,000  in legal fees.   Andrew Clyde's story is, sadly, a common one, with the IRS seizing  more than $242 million in structuring cases from 2005 to 2012. That is  why I introduced the RESPECT Act, to stop this practice and to protect  hardworking Americans like Andrew Clyde from IRS overreach.   I am glad to see that the RESPECT Act was introduced and has been  included in the Taxpayer First Act. This legislation will rein in IRS  overreach by requiring prosecutors to demonstrate probable cause that  seized funds were illegally earned or structured to conceal illegal  activity. It also enables property owners to challenge a seizure at a  postseizure hearing rather than wait months or years to have their case  heard.   I would like to thank my friends and my dear friend from Georgia,  Congressman Lewis, and also   Mike Kelly for their work on this  legislation and for supporting the modernization of the IRS and  protecting innocent Americans from IRS abuse.
