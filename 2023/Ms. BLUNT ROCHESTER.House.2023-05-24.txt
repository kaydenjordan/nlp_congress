 Madam Chair, I thank Ranking Member Pallone for  yielding me time.   Madam Chair, today, I rise to talk about a public health emergency  impacting every corner of our Nation: fentanyl.   As Congress debates the best approach to combating synthetic opioids,  what we can all agree on is that every single one of us is impacted. I  urge my colleagues to keep our focus on comprehensive and sustainable  solutions.   In 2021, in my small State of Delaware, we lost over 500 family  members, friends, coworkers, and neighbors to overdoses. Of the more  than 500 Delawareans lost to overdose, 80 percent involved fentanyl.  Those numbers, unfortunately, are poised to get worse.   As the former deputy secretary of health and social services in  Delaware, my career has made me look at these challenges through a lens  of public health. That is why I was proud to join my colleagues  Representative Annie Kuster and   Don Bacon in introducing the STOP  Fentanyl Overdoses Act.   Our bipartisan bill takes a comprehensive public health approach to  reducing fentanyl overdoses by expanding testing, improving data  collection and analysis, and expanding treatment for opioid use  disorder.   Our approach is supported by a broad and diverse coalition, including  the Drug Policy Alliance, American Psychological Association Services,  and Partnership to End Addiction.   As we continue to work to combat the fentanyl crisis, an issue that I  know we all care deeply about, I hope we will keep a comprehensive  public health approach top of mind.
