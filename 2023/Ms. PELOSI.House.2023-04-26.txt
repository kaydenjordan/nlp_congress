 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Boyle and Mr. Richie Neal for  their leadership in bringing our side of the story to this.   And what is that?   I thank the Republicans for the clarity with which they have put  forth their default on America act because their default on America act  will do just this.   When you vote for this bill, you will vote to:   Put veterans' healthcare at risk, eliminating up to 30 million  healthcare visits for our veterans.   Slash Pell grants for tens of thousands of students.   Rip away food assistance for women, infants, and children, a million  of them, a million seniors off of Meals on Wheels.   Pollute the planet by overturning what we did to save the planet with  green tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act.   Cut $8 billion in law enforcement from State, local, and Federal law  enforcement, pulling cops off the street, and up to 700,000 fewer jobs  to be created.   Certainly, we negotiate over the appropriations bills. I am an  appropriator, and for 20 years I have been in 19 engagements of the  debt ceiling kind. Whether we lift the debt ceiling is a question of  whether we honor the Constitution that says the full faith and credit  of America shall not be in doubt.    When you use that as a wedge, as President Trump admonished you not  to, you are placing in doubt our credit rating and what that means to  American people on their credit card bills  [[Page H2014]]  and at the kitchen table. You are playing with fire.   We have been down this road before. When the former President was  President, three times we lifted the debt ceiling, never placing in  doubt the full faith and credit of the United States of America.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.
