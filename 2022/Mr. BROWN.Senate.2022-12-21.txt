 Mr. President, I think we can all agree we had a very       productive 23 months, starting about the time the Presiding Officer       from Georgia arrived. I am proud of the bipartisan work we have done       for Ohioans. We know there is still more to do.        When we passed the Rescue Plan, I remember sitting at this table,       sitting at this desk. It was March 6, and after 12 hours of all-night       voting--it was a Saturday around noon--we passed the Rescue Plan. We       took care of literally 1 million union pension holders who had lost big       chunks of pension, 100,000 families in my State alone. In the same       vote, we expanded the child tax credit, 51 to 1, 51 Democrats with the       Vice President. Fifty Republicans voted no, denying children the       expanded child tax credit. Two million kids in my State--2 million       children in Ohio--and 60 million around the country benefited from       that. Their families saw more money in their pockets. It was 90 percent       of the children in Atlanta, in Savannah, in Cleveland, and Dayton--90       percent of children. Only the 10 percent wealthiest families did not       benefit from this.        We saw a 40-percent reduction in the child poverty rate, and we       know--think if we had kept the child tax credit going. It was in effect       for a year. If it had kept going, think how effective it would have       been in blunting the effects of inflation on so many families who are       struggling every day, every week, every month.        I heard from parents around my State. It was helping them afford       groceries, childcare, or rent or school clothes or summer camps. Many       parents wrote me and said: It is the first time ever I have been able       to send my daughter to summer camp. We know what a difference this made       at a time when families struggled to keep up with costs.        Unfortunately, as we know, the child tax credit expansion ended at       the end of 2021. That should never have happened. We still have time to       get it up and running again.        We had a chance to pass a tax package tonight. We could have passed a       tax package that addressed the needs of American manufacturers with       research and development credits and to help children and families.        Here is what I want everyone to hear in this body and throughout the       United States: Democrats are willing to do it. We put it on the table       time and time again. We will support the research and development tax       provisions to Republicans--something they wanted--and they should       support the child tax credit. We believe we should invest in American       manufacturing. It would have done that. We believe we should invest in       American families, in American children.        As part of a balanced package, we will make the changes businesses       are asking for. CEOs and small businesses and companies and executives       came to see me and said they wanted us to do both. Yes, do the R&D tax       credit, and also do the child tax credit. My friends on this side of       the aisle--apparently all 50 of them--said no, they are not willing to       do that. For whatever reason, they were not willing to do the child tax       credit. We offered to make these changes. We said it needed to be part       of a balanced tax package so working families are not left behind in       this new tax law the way they were with the huge corporate tax giveaway       of 2017.        We are in the midst of a manufacturing renaissance, especially in the       Midwest, in my State, because of investments we made. We need a Tax       Code that supports American manufacturing and rewards investment in       research and development, and we need a Tax Code that supports working       families and their kids.        Investing in children now, making sure these families have money in       their pockets to keep up with rising costs, weather a financial       emergency, even just to afford the basics in an economy where inflation       is too high, will pay off for decades. It is a smart policy. It is a       win-win for Georgia and Ohio and every one of our States.        One in four kids living in rural Idaho is left out of the full child       tax credit. In Ohio and Kentucky, one out of three kids is left out. We       can fix that if my Republicans would be willing to.        Raising kids is hard work. They say: You give this money to these       families, they don't work. Well, raising kids is hard work.        After we passed the child tax credit expansion 19 months ago, I heard       time and again that it was making things ``just a little bit easier.''       I heard that term ``just a little bit easier'' from families. They work       hard, sometimes more than one job, just to make ends meet.        We can do this. We can make things a little bit easier. We can still       do this.        I won't stop fighting for tax policies that help make our country       more competitive but also more competitive and more just. Justice       should be the goal not just during the holiday season but always.        As I tried to get this deal done, I heard my colleagues on the other       side of the aisle say that expanding the child tax credit was a       partisan issue. It was a ``Democratic ask.'' That is news to American       families. Most families in Georgia and Ohio, they don't care if the       child tax credit was mostly about Democrats wanting it and Republicans       not wanting it; they just want a government that fights for them and       stands with them, not that stands against them.        Just a few days ago, I met with faith leaders--Evangelical, Catholic,       Jewish, Muslim faith leaders and so many others--to fight for the child       tax credit. Only in Washington, DC, in this body and down the hall, the       House of Representatives--only here is fighting for the child tax       credit a partisan issue.        I have a letter here--I have two letters. This comes from the Faith       and Freedom Coalition. It says:                   As leaders of faith organizations, social welfare            organizations, and others, we consider it to be an integral            part of our missions            [[Page S9751]]                 to ensure families and communities have all the resources            they need to be fully flourishing and contributing members of            society.              The letter goes on to say:                   That is why there is broad agreement [among people of            faith, conservative and liberal alike] that the Child Tax            Credit (CTC) needs to be strengthened. We believe there is an            urgent need for legislation that supports children and            families. Many of us had called for increasing the CTC to            $3,000 per child [back in 2017] and we remain committed to            that goal today. It is our hope [that] this Congress will            prioritize an expanded Child Tax Credit.              Mr. President, I ask that this letter, which is signed by leading       conservatives, including a citizen in the Presiding Officer's State,       Newt Gingrich; Rick Santorum, Senator Casey's predecessor; Ramesh       Ponnuru; Kathryn Jean Lopez; and many other politicians.        I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.        There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in       the Record, as follows:                                                            December 16, 2022.           Hon. Nancy Pelosi,           Speaker of the House, Washington, DC.           Hon. Kevin McCarthy,           Minority Leader, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.           Hon. Charles Schumer,           Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.           Hon. Mitch McConnell,           Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.             Dear Speaker Pelosi, Minority Leader McCarthy, Majority            Leader Schumer, and Minority Leader McConnell: As leaders of            faith organizations, social welfare organizations, and            others, we consider it to be an integral part of our missions            to ensure families and communities have all the resources            they need to be fully flourishing and contributing members of            society.             There is no argument that the married family is the            necessary building block for healthy children, communities,            and a free people. However, marriage rates are at an all-time            low while fertility rates continue to decline. For too long,            we have presumed the family would always be there to            strengthen society while spending little effort to support            its health. If we do not take concrete steps to strengthen            the family, we'll have no chance of addressing the social            problems most on Americans' minds--educational failure,            poverty, and crime.             That is why there is broad agreement that the Child Tax            Credit (CTC) needs to be strengthened. We believe there is an            urgent need for legislation that supports children and            families. Many of us had called for increasing the CTC to            $3,000 per child when Congress was debating the Tax Cuts and            Jobs Act of 2017 and we remain committed to that goal today.            It is our hope that this Congress will prioritize an expanded            Child Tax Credit in a year-end tax policy for today's            families and future families in development.             Congress must squarely face the increasing cost of            parenthood and the declining fertility rates these costs            engender. Our goal must be to advance policies that make            having children more affordable and achievable. While there            are many reforms that would either remove barriers to family            formation or help support struggling families, none is more            important than increasing the CTC to $3,000 per child.             Thank you for your consideration of our views and this            request.

There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in       the Record, as follows:               Catholic Charities USA, Committee on Domestic Justice and                  Human Development,                                                      December 14, 2022.             Dear Senator/Representative: On behalf of the Committee on            Domestic Justice and Human Development of the United States            Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), Catholic Charities            USA (CCUSA), and the United States Society of St. Vincent de            Paul (SVdP USA), we write to you to renew our call to            Congress to work in a bipartisan fashion to pass a            strengthened Child Tax Credit before the end of the year.             The Child Tax Credit is a powerful anti-poverty, pro-family            program that we have long supported and asked Congress to            strengthen. To this effect, we ask you to pass, by the end of            this year, an expanded Child Tax Credit that is as refundable            as possible, for as many kids as possible, for as many years            as possible, and remains available to mixed-status families.            The most economically vulnerable children ought to receive            the full value of the Child Tax Credit. A strengthened Child            Tax Credit that benefits the poorest children should be a            priority in any upcoming tax policy package.             The bishops have long stated that we must confront poverty            with a sense of urgency. As the USCCB wrote in the pastoral            document Economic Justice for All ``Dealing with poverty is            not a luxury to which our nation can attend when it finds the            time and resources. Rather, it is a moral imperative of the            highest priority.'' The Child Tax Credit expansion of 2021            demonstrated that a fully refundable Child Tax Credit is a            highly effective mechanism to reduce child poverty. The            version of the Child Tax Credit passed in the American Rescue            Plan lifted 2.1 million children out of poverty in 2021 and            helped to reduce child poverty to its lowest rate on record.            Without the expanded and fully refundable Child Tax Credit            this year, data have shown a spike in child poverty. An            expanded and fully refundable child tax credit is a proven            tool to support women and families and keep millions of            children out of poverty. We implore Congress to prioritize            passage of a substantially improved Child Tax Credit by the            end of the year.             We know members of both parties share our commitment to            prioritizing the well-being of women, children, and families,            especially those who are struggling. As we approach the end            of this Congress, we urge you to work in a bipartisan fashion            to pass an improved Child Tax Credit that is as refundable as            possible, for as many children as possible, for as many years            as possible.                 Sincerely,                                                Most Rev. Borys Gudziak,           Archbishop of Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Philadelphia,             U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Chairman, Committee on                                  Domestic Justice and Human Development.                                        Sister Donna Markham, OP, Ph.D.,                                President & CEO, Catholic Charities USA.                                                       Ralph Middlecamp,              National President, National Council of the United States                                          Society of St. Vincent de Paul.               I would like to emphasize that the people who sign these       letters aren't generally supporting people like me in the Senate. They       are clearly conservatives.        Let me just share, again, some names of people who signed this       letter. I mentioned Newt Gingrich, former Republican Speaker of the       House; Mike Huckabee, former Governor of Arkansas; Rick Santorum,       former U.S. Senator; Timothy Head, Executive Director Faith and Freedom       Coalition; Tony Perkins, President of the Family Research Council--      nobody mistakes him for a liberal Democratic--Robert George, McCormick       Professor of Jurisprudence, Princeton University, one of the real deep       reflective thinkers in the conservative biosphere; Ramesh Ponnuru of       the American Enterprise Institute; Yuval Levin, director of social,       cultural, and constitutional studies at the American Enterprise       Institute; Walter Kim, president of the National Association of       Evangelicals; Kathryn Jean Lopez, I mentioned, National Review       Institute.              I could go on and on--people of faith on the conservative side of       politics who all say we should pass the child tax credit.        Again, this letter says: The child tax credit is a powerful, anti-      poverty, pro-family program we have long supported and ask Congress to       strengthen.        I know I went back and pointed down the hall. I really can't find       very many people who oppose the child tax credit. It has got 80, 90       percent support at home. Ninety percent of kids in my State--the       families of 90 percent of kids benefit from the child tax credit. All       of us have gotten stories, gotten letters, gotten calls from       constituents.            [[Page S9752]]              When we are walking down the street, people come up and say: You       know, that $300, that $550 a month--I have an 8-year-old and a 5-year-      old. One is $300 for the one, $250 for the other. Month after month, it       lifted us out of poverty. It has made a difference. My daughter can go       to summer camp. I can buy school clothes. We are not embarrassed when       she goes back to school in September in old, torn--I mean, all of the       kinds of things that make children's lives a little better and families       a little happier, we can do. But, again, the only people standing in       the way of this are sitting over here in this body and sitting down the       hall. The voters, the thinkers, the political conservative thinkers       from those letters, religious leaders, people of faith--all support       this idea. The benefits of CTC are clear.        Everyone willing to see what is right before them understands it is       far more than about politics. It is about kids. It is about families.       It is about ensuring that the hard work that families do raising       children, working part time--some of them not making much money at all.        I am just so disappointed we can't get this done. But I know the       Senator from Georgia and I know I won't give up. We are going to keep       fighting for this. If we can't get it tonight, we will work on it next       year.                         Brycen Gray and Ben Price COVID-19 Cognitive Research Act              Mr. President, before I conclude I would like to mention one other       piece of legislation I have been working on with my colleague Senator       Duckworth, a Democrat from Illinois, and Senator Cassidy, a Republican       from Louisiana, that we should pass without delay.        The Brycen Gray and Ben Price COVID-19 Cognitive Research Act, named       after one of my constituents, Brycen Gray, and one of Senator       Duckworth's constituents, Ben Price, would do two things. First, it       would codify important research NIH is already doing to further our       understanding of COVID-19, including the neurological effects of the       virus. Second, it would require the National Academies of Science,       Engineering, and Medicine to conduct a study and issue a report on the       disruption of cognitive processes associated with COVID-19.        I would like to thank Senator Murray, a Democrat from Washington, and       Senator Burr, a Republican from North Carolina, for their work to       negotiate the text of the legislation and for their support of the       bill.        I would like to thank my colleague, retiring Representative Gonzalez,       a Republican from northern Ohio, not far from where I live, who       successfully got this legislation through the House with a strong       bipartisan vote, 350 to 69.        This bill would not authorize additional funding. It would not cost       taxpayers. It would mean the world to the Gray and Price families and       to all those struggling with cognitive effects from COVID-19.        I urge Senators with holds on this bill to lift those holds--the       couple of Senators who are standing in the way for reasons I am not       really clear about--so we can pass it out of the Senate and get it to       the President's desk before the end of the year. These families need       our support. These families deserve our support.        I yield the floor.
