 Madam Speaker, while traveling across Pennsylvania's 12th  Congressional District, our team consistently hears from employers with  open positions about a skills gap of trained labor.   Employers and individuals seeking jobs should have every tool  available to fill open jobs needed with skills. That is why celebration  of National Apprenticeship Week is so important. National  Apprenticeship Week brings awareness to the growing skills gap by  highlighting the benefits of apprenticeships.   Apprentices earn wages during on-the-job training, while receiving  instruction and having supervision from a mentor. Apprentices also  learn important soft skills like work attendance, being a team player,  and having a positive work attitude.   Additionally, employers train students in skills they need, often  creating a direct pathway from training to employment.   Apprenticeships have been working across PA-12. Partnership  opportunities exist between employers--including energy developers and  educational institutions--to have apprenticeship-like programs.  Programs like these and apprenticeships across the country have proven  to grow the economy, lower student debt, and lead to family-sustaining  careers.   Please stand with me in support of National Apprenticeship Week.                            ____________________
