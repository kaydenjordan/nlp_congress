 Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to the  remarkable life and enduring legacy of Maxwell ``Max'' Emerson, a  cherished teacher, coach, mentor, and dear friend to many whose  compassion, kindness, and dedication touched the hearts of all who knew  him.   Over the recent Fourth of July weekend, Max, a vibrant 25-year-old  teacher and coach at his alma mater Oldham County High School, traveled  to Washington, DC, for his upcoming professional development hours at  the Library of Congress. He was assigned these hours to fulfill the  requirements for a grant he had been awarded, which would afford him  the opportunity to immerse himself in Vietnam's educational system.  With both his father, a retired principal of South Oldham High School,  and his mother, a dedicated teacher at Oldham County Middle School,  education was truly in his blood.   On the morning of July 5 in Washington, DC, Max set out for his  professional development hours, but he never reached his destination.  Instead, his light was tragically extinguished. Max fell victim to a  senseless act of violence, robbed at gunpoint on the campus of Catholic  University, ultimately losing his life.   Max was the true representation of a champion to the Oldham County  community. He was a beacon of inspiration and led his very accomplished  life through kindness, dedication, and faith. Max was a natural-born  leader and a talented athlete who was admired by all who had the  privilege of crossing paths with him. His unwavering dedication and  genuine care for his students, athletes, friends, and community were  evident in every action he took. Countless individuals can testify to  Max's willingness to lend a helping hand a put a smile on their face.   Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, Max took on the responsibility of  overseeing the credit recovery program, ensuring that no student fell  behind and that everyone remained on track academically despite the  school closures. It is worth noting that Max achieved an outstanding  100 percent pass rate.   Max devoted his life to serving others, and his extraordinary impact  will forever remain etched in the Oldham County community. Anyone who  had the privilege of meeting Max can attest to the profound positive  influence he had on their lives. His legacy will be remembered by the  very phrase he lived his own life by: ``Champions Find a Way!''   While his untimely departure has left an immense void that will be  challenging to fill, his students and athletes carry his memories and  legacy forward. Today I stand in solidarity with his grieving family,  friends, and the entire Oldham County community as we mourn the tragic  loss of a remarkable soul.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the Kentucky Chapter of the National  Association of Women Business Owners--NAWBO--connects women to  resources, people, information, and organizations that can help them  achieve their personal, business, or political goals. It is composed of  women of all ages and levels of experience from all sectors of the  marketplace.   Each year, NAWBO Kentucky recognizes women for their achievements in  business and this year is no exception. In addition to their annual  recognitions, they have added a new award, the Legacy Award, which will  be presented at this year's ceremony. The Legacy Award is to be given  to a woman who is a role model to other women, has achieved excellence  in her field, has promoted other women, has broken barriers for women  in her field, and has held leadership roles in her community. The  inaugural recipient of this award is Ann B. Bakhaus, former president  of Kentucky Eagle, Inc.   Ann Bakhaus served as the president of Kentucky Eagle, Inc., a total  beverage and spirit distributor based in Lexington, and ran day-to-day  operations for the company for 20 years before passing the business to  her daughter. She still owns the company and serves as the chairman of  the corporation board. This company has been in the Bakhaus family  since 1948, and Ann is glad to be able to carry on the family legacy.   In her role with Kentucky Eagle, Inc., Bakhaus achieved many goals  including the expansion of product distribution and the construction of  the company's new headquarters which was the first official Leadership  in Energy and Environmental Design Anheuser Busch distributorship in  the country.   Beyond serving on the board for Kentucky Eagle, Bakhaus is also  heavily invested in community development. One of her biggest passions  currently is the addition of Town Branch Park to downtown Lexington and  the benefits it will provide to the community. Her desire is to see the  Lexington community continue to flourish and is committed to being a  part of that progress. I am proud to recognize the Kentucky Chapter of  the National Association of Women Business Owners and to honor Ms.  Bakhaus for her many achievements.                            ____________________
