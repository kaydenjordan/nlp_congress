 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support H.R. 4044. I want to  thank Mr. Malinowski and Chairwoman Napolitano for their leadership in  crafting this legislation and bringing it to the floor today for  consideration by the full House of Representatives. It is vital that  we, as a nation, focus on preserving and restoring our estuaries.   I am especially pleased that the bill almost doubles the amount of  funding available to support national estuaries. This should finally  allow the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to move forward with  adding more of these critical ecosystems to the National Estuary  Program.   As one of only five or six hypersaline lagoons in the world and the  only one in the nation, the Laguna Madre has unique conservation  requirements. Adjacent to the longest barrier island in the world,  Padre Island, the Laguna Madre is home to five species of endangered  sea turtle and a critical migratory bird habitat for dozens of  endangered or threatened bird species. The EPA previously designated  the Upper Laguna Madre as a national estuary, and with this additional  funding, we can now move forward with adding the Lower Laguna Madre to  the existing designation.   Having grown up in Brownsville, Texas, Chairwoman Napolitano knows  the beauty and importance of this national treasure. On behalf of my  constituents, I want to express the gratitude of South Texas for the  hard work and dedication of the Transportation & Infrastructure  Committee Members and staff to conserving the Lower Laguna Madre for  future generations.   I look forward to working with our Senators to help pass this  legislation, and with our local officials, especially Cameron County  Commissioner David Garza, and our governor, so we can finally secure a  National Estuary Program designation for the Lower Laguna Madre. I urge  my colleagues to support H.R. 4044.
