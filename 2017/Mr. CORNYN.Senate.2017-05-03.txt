 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, seeing none of my Democratic colleagues on  the floor seeking to speak, I ask unanimous consent to speak on the  Democratic time.    Mr. President, this week the Senate continues to consider  the government funding bill, which I hope we will decide to vote on  tomorrow afternoon. I want to highlight a few ways that this  legislation is good for America. It addresses important priorities, and  it is particularly good for those 28 million people I have the  privilege of representing in Texas.   I know people say we don't want to do an omnibus appropriations bill,  and frankly this is not the best way to do business, but when our  Democratic colleagues objected to us processing individual  appropriations bills, this is the only alternative, other than perhaps  a continuing resolution.   A continuing resolution would continue Obama-era policies and frankly  wouldn't end up saving any money because both of them are subject to  the same spending caps under the Budget Control Act.   Here we are. The House will undoubtedly pass this agreed-upon bill,  the first negotiated bill with the Trump White House, with a Republican  majority in the House and the Senate, and with Democratic participation  and input as well.   First, as I mentioned yesterday, this bill provides significant  funding to shore up security at our international border with Mexico.  This is a particularly important Texas issue because obviously we share  a 1,200-mile common border with Mexico, but it is also a national  issue. It is an important issue President Trump ran on and one of the  reasons I believe he was elected.    Attention to securing the border is long overdue. I have always  contended that border security is first and foremost a matter of  political will because we know how to do it. The question is, Do we  have the political will to accomplish it? Rio Grande Valley Border  Patrol chief Manny Padilla likes to say--he served in numerous  capacities all across the border, from Arizona, California, and now in  the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. He likes to say that there are really  three legs to the stool of border security. There is technology, there  is personnel, and then there is infrastructure, what some people like  to call fencing or walls. Each area along the border depends--the  mixture will depend on what makes sense, what is actually effective. It  is obviously important to get the advice and input of professionals of  Border Patrol who work day in and day out to secure the border. With  this omnibus bill, we will see the strongest increase in border  security funding in nearly a decade. That means more resources to help  Customs and Border Patrol, among other agencies, to enforce our laws,  keep trade flowing, and stem the tide of contraband and illegal  immigration.   When we talk about border security, it is also important to recognize  the important economic and trading relationship we have with Mexico.  Roughly 5 million American jobs depend on binational trade with Mexico,  which is another reason I have been paying such close attention to the  administration's discussion about updating NAFTA and other important  trading agreements. More than half of the entire border between the  United States and Mexico is in Texas so this is critical to Texas and  to Texans and necessary to keep our people safe.   Fortunately, this funding deal will also strengthen our Nation's  defense at a time when, under the Obama administration, we saw a 20- percent cut in defense spending. As former Director of National  Intelligence James Clapper liked to say--well, maybe he didn't like to  say it, but he did say it: In 50 years in the intelligence community,  he had never seen a more diverse array of threats in his entire career.  So our country does face multiple threats all over the world.   This legislation includes more than $20 billion for defense--a real  important plus-up in defense spending for the first time in a long  time. This bill also includes new funding to support our military men  and women deployed abroad in the fight against ISIS, for example, and  it includes a pay raise for our troops as well. We have an All- Volunteer military that has been stressed--really, unlike any other  time in our Nation's history--with the longest continuous time at war,  particularly in Afghanistan and Iraq and now in other places around the  world. So in an All-Volunteer military, it is really important for us  to make sure that we treat our troops right when it comes to pay and  living conditions in an All-Volunteer military.   Fortunately, this bill will also begin to tackle a major problem that  I spoke about just last week; that is, our readiness--readiness of our  military to face the new and evolving threats around the globe.   I would just pause here to note that some people have said we can  solve the disparity in our needs or the threats and the amount we have  been able to fund for national security by just tweaking the Budget  Control Act of 2011. Well, the fact is, Congress only appropriates  about 30 percent of the money that the Federal Government spends. Well,  70 percent is on autopilot because of the Budget Control Act. We have  been able to keep discretionary spending, which includes defense  spending, relatively flat since 2011, when the Budget Control Act was  passed, but the fact is, mandatory spending is growing at a rate of  about 5.5 percent. In my own view, we are never going to be able to  fund our priorities--including national security--adequately, unless we  revisit all of that 100 percent of Federal spending, which is going to  take an act of political courage on the part of the President and those  of us in the Congress but something we really cannot continue to put  off day after day, week after week, year after year.   This Omnibus appropriation bill funds the procurement of new warships  and aircraft and increases funding to help modernize our ancient  nuclear deterrent programs and includes resources to counter radicalism  and instability in the developing world.   I am also glad this legislation includes funds to help our veterans  and their families transition into the civilian workforce, and it will  better equip Texans working in military installations across the State,  keep our military ready, and funds resources for the battlefield.   So while there is a finger-pointing and blame game or credit-seeking  game going on here in Washington--and I guess if the blame game were an  Olympic sport, Washington would win that--but this is too important to  be talking about in terms of political winners and losers. The truth  is, the American people will be the winner if we keep the government  running, if we do our job, and particularly if those of us who are  fortunate enough to be in the majority after this last election will  simply govern. That is what they elected us to do, along with the  President of the United States.   On a different note--I want to close on this. Yesterday, I spoke  about the terrible storms and tornadoes that whipped through East Texas  over the weekend. Fortunately, we were able to secure additional  disaster relief funding in this omnibus package that will play a big  part in helping communities rebuild, not only from floods and bad  weather we have had in the past but also this current tragedy with loss  of life and loss of property. It will help our communities rebuild,  recover, and prepare for the next storm.   This legislation will also bring us closer to a solution to mitigate  damage from hurricanes and storm surges along the gulf coast in the  Gulf of Mexico. This is particularly an important issue in Houston and  along that gulf coast region, which is a huge, vital economic center  for our country. By funding an Army Corps of Engineer study, we can  best find a way forward that keeps more Texans safe from the next big  hurricane, which we know is coming, and the question is just a matter  of when.   This bill also dedicates resources to improve and strengthen  waterways that will help maintain Texas ship channels so they can  handle more commerce and provide better flood control for susceptible  areas.   I will close by pointing out that this legislation also appropriates  funds for bipartisan bills we passed last year. I know frequently--if  you read the newspaper or if you watch cable news--you may think that  nothing ever happens here, but actually even under the Obama  administration, Republicans  [[Page S2712]]  worked in a bipartisan way to accomplish important things like the  Every Student Succeeds Act, the follow-on from No Child Left Behind,  and one that actually does things that conservatives think is  important and pushes more authority back down to the States and out of  Washington when it comes to our schools. It makes sure that the States,  local school districts, parents, and teachers have a say when it comes  to the best quality and the best way to teach our children in K-12  schools. So we will fund much of that effort in this legislation.    I know many of our colleagues represent areas of the country that  have been devastated by the opioid crisis, as well as heroin crisis,  which unfortunately seem to go hand in hand. We worked closely  together, in a bipartisan way, to fund the Comprehensive Addiction and  Recovery Act signed into law last year under President Obama to help  tackle the opioid epidemic running rampant throughout many parts of the  country. It also includes resources that help eliminate the rape kit  backlog, one that I have been working on for some time, to make sure-- the Debbie Smith Act, which is in excess of $100 million that is  available in funding to forensic labs all across the country to  eliminate the rape kit backlog. The power of DNA testing through these  rape kits to identify the perpetrator of sexual assault, as well as to  exonerate the innocent, is really something to behold. So in this  funding, the rape kit backlog will be reduced and we will bring to  justice victims of crimes and vindicate those who were accused but who  are in fact innocent.   This legislation will also help provide funds for victims of human  trafficking to recover, and it will help train law enforcement to  handle an active shooter situation via something we passed last year,  on a bipartisan basis, called the POLICE Act. As the Presiding Officer  knows, police changed their tactics when it comes to active shooters. I  believe it was Columbine where the tactic was still used to surround an  area near a school and to make sure nobody comes in or goes out, but  our police and first responders learned to be very resourceful and  innovative and indeed are training now. According to the POLICE Act,  Federal funds go to State and local law enforcement and first  responders to help the police train to engage an active shooter to stop  the killing but also to train the first responders, typically the EMS  officials, to stop the dying. So you can stop the killer, but unless  you have EMS or emergency medical service personnel trained along with  the police department, you may stop the killing, but you will not stop  the dying, and that is the goal of this important bill. This  legislation helps fund that.   So here is the bottom line. Legislation is always a compromise, so it  never ever meets anybody's individual expectations in terms of what  they would want as the perfect bill, but I know people are frustrated  by that because they say: Why couldn't we do more? Why couldn't we get  more of what we wanted, and why did we have to give up something that  other people wanted in order to agree to pass this legislation? Well,  that is the way our system was designed. That is the way our Founding  Fathers created the legislative branch and made it a requirement that  in a country as big and diverse as ours, that we needed to build  consensus in order to pass legislation, and that means Democrats and  Republicans, Congress and the White House, working together to come up  with an acceptable consensus product. That is what this is. It is a  product of bipartisan give-and-take. It includes many conservative  priorities that I like--that we have been talking about for a year-- that benefit communities across my State. It provides for our national  defense, and it will make our country healthier and safer, and it does  that at the same time as we consolidate or eliminate more than 150  outdated and unnecessary programs and initiatives.   That is why it is important we pass this omnibus, as opposed to  another continuing resolution, which, by the way, makes it nearly  impossible for our national security agencies and our intelligence  community to actually plan. When we fund government for a 6-month  period of time, they don't know what is going to happen after that. So  it is really important that we put our shoulders to the wheel and we  work together, on a bipartisan basis, to give them some more certainty,  to give them a longer flow of revenue, so they can do planning and  spend the tax dollars that are appropriated efficiently.   An important point that has been lost as we discussed and debated  this bill is, it finally sets the country in a new direction--one that  leads away from the Obama administration's priorities, which existed  under the continuing resolution and was reflected by endless cycles of  continuing resolutions. That is the past. We entered a new era of a  stronger defense, less regulations for job creators, and a more  streamlined and efficient government.   This is the first major piece of bipartisan legislation negotiated  with the new White House, and it proves that we can come together when  we must, that we can govern, and that we can deliver results. It will  also serve as a good blueprint moving forward with a carefully thought- out strategic budget as we look ahead to the fall.   This legislation isn't perfect, but it does represent progress. It  does represent an important watershed with this new administration,  where we have all come together and reached agreement on a piece of  legislation that we feel is beneficial to the entire country. If we are  not going to engage in that sort of activity, but we are just going to  vote no on everything because it is not perfect, we are not going to be  able to make that kind of progress that we are all, I believe,  committed to making on behalf of the people we represent.
