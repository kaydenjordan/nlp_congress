 Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the House  Appropriations Committee, I am very honored to be co-leading efforts to  provide $6 million for postal nonbank financial services in a pilot  program through the U.S. Postal Service.   I am thankful to my House colleagues, Congressman Bill Pascrell and  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and our friends in the Senate  for joining our effort.   The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that many Americans are left  behind by Wall Street bankers.   As unemployment soared in 2020, the U.S. Congress swiftly provided  relief through economic stimulus payments, unemployment insurance, and  so much more to America's workers, yet over 63 million Americans,  including many who are impoverished, lacked the most basic banking  services to access these funds and to conduct the simplest financial  transactions. Like, for example, paying a utility bill.   Yes, according to the FDIC, some 63 million adults are considered  underbanked in urban, suburban, and rural communities across our  Nation.   In the last Congress, Congressman Pascrell and I successfully led a  Financial Services amendment to the FY21 Appropriations bill to include  $2 million for postal financial services, and we look forward to  reintroducing our bill and to getting it passed in both Chambers this  year.                            ____________________
