 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 693) to amend the Horse Protection Act to designate  additional unlawful acts under the Act, strengthen penalties for  violations of the Act, improve Department of Agriculture enforcement of  the Act, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 693         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``U.S. Senator Joseph D.       Tydings Memorial Prevent All Soring Tactics Act of 2019'' or       the ``PAST Act''.       SEC. 2. INCREASED ENFORCEMENT UNDER HORSE PROTECTION ACT.

(c) Horse Shows and Exhibitions.--Section 4 of the Horse       Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1823) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)--        (A) by striking ``appointed'' and inserting ``licensed'';       and        (B) by adding at the end the following new sentences: ``In       the first instance in which the Secretary determines that a       horse is sore, the Secretary shall disqualify the horse from       being shown or exhibited for a period of not less than 180       days.

(d) Unlawful Acts.--Section 5 of the Horse Protection Act       (15 U.S.C. 1824) is amended--        (1) in paragraph (2)--        (A) by striking ``or (C) respecting'' and inserting ``(C),       or (D) respecting''; and        (B) by striking ``and (D)'' and inserting ``(D) causing a       horse to become sore or directing another person to cause a       horse to become sore for the purpose of showing, exhibiting,       selling, auctioning, or offering for sale the horse in any       horse show, horse exhibition, or horse sale or auction; and       (E)'';        (2) in paragraph (3), by striking ``appoint'' and inserting       ``hire'';        (3) in paragraph (4)--        (A) by striking ``appoint'' and inserting ``hire''; and        (B) by striking ``qualified'';        (4) in paragraph (5), by striking ``appointed'' and       inserting ``hired'';        (5) in paragraph (6)--        (A) by striking ``appointed'' and inserting ``hired''; and        (B) by inserting ``that the horse is sore'' after ``the       Secretary''; and        (6) by adding at the end the following new paragraphs:        ``(12) The use of an action device on any limb of a       Tennessee Walking Horse, a Racking Horse, or a Spotted Saddle       Horse at a horse show, horse exhibition, or horse sale or       auction.        ``(13) The use of a weighted shoe, pad, wedge, hoof band,       or other device or material at a horse show, horse       exhibition, or horse sale or auction that--        ``(A) is placed on, inserted in, or attached to any limb of       a Tennessee Walking Horse, a Racking Horse, or a Spotted       Saddle Horse;        ``(B) is constructed to artificially alter the gait of such       a horse; and        ``(C) is not strictly protective or therapeutic in       nature.''.

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 693.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to lead H.R. 693, the U.S. Senator Joseph D.  Tydings Memorial Prevent All Soring Tactics Act, with my colleague,  good friend, and fellow veterinarian, Congressman Ted Yoho.   The PAST Act would finally end the incredibly abusive practice of  horse soring. Soring is the act of deliberately causing pain on a  horse's legs or hooves to artificially exaggerate the horse's normal  gait. The gait is called the ``big lick.''   Horses can, and are, trained to do this naturally, but,  unfortunately, a cottage industry has been built up around this abusive  soring practice.   Soring is most commonly done to Tennessee Walking Horse, Racking  Horse, and Spotted Saddle Horse breeds.   Soring can be done by applying caustic chemicals to a horse's lower  leg--imagine that--trimming their hooves unnaturally, applying weighted  shoes to the horse's hooves, and wrapping ``action devices'' like heavy  chains around a horse's hooves.   The Horse Protection Act of 1970 outlawed chemical soring,  supposedly, which causes burning and blistering to horses' legs, and  soring caused by--actually, they used to inject nails, tacks, and  chemical agents into the limb of the horse.   It did not include the action devices, however, or the stacked shoes  which are also common in today's soring techniques.   We have a photo, I think, that shows very clearly what this is like.  The photo actually shows--which we would like to get up here at some  point in time, if that is remotely possible--that it is actually a  package.   What they do is use plastic pads and wedges stacked on one another,  actually nailed together, and then attached to the bottom of the hoof.  [[Page H7370]]    The package elevates the horse's front feet and adds weight and  pressure, causing the horse's foot to strike at a very unusual and  painful angle.   The chains are wrapped over the horse's chemically sored and raw  front pastern, increasing the pain felt by the horse and further  exaggerating that big lick, pain-induced gait, which again, as I said  before, is not necessary. Horses will move with that action under their  own volition when properly trained by an actual trainer.   Our bill will make it illegal to use these and other similar devices  in the show ring, and horses would only be allowed to show with a  normal horseshoe.   There is the photo I was alluding to earlier.   Some people may argue that these action devices are not harmful for  horses, but the experts at the American Veterinary Medical Association,  the American Association of Equine Practitioners, and the United States  Equine Federation all say that pressure from these items contained in  this package produce pain in the hoof and in the leg, that the horse  lifts its feet higher and faster in an exaggerated gait beyond what  they are naturally able to do.   All of these organizations support a ban on action devices and  packages to protect the health and welfare of the horse.   As a veterinarian with over 30 years' experience, I agree with them.  I agree with the AVMA that it is indisputable that soring causes horses  an unnecessary and unacceptable level of pain. These horses--it is  horrible when you see them, you see what is going on in the legs of  these horses.   They used to actually use soldering irons sometimes to blister the  horses' legs so that they would react to these chains in an exaggerated  manner. I saw that.   In addition to outlawing action devices and stacked shoes, the PAST  Act will also end the unsuccessful system of industry self-policing  that we tried for almost 40 years.   The USDA has let it run, and, unfortunately, it has been completely  ineffective. Our bill will require the USDA to create a process to  train, license, assign, and oversee impartial inspectors--hopefully  veterinarians, among others--who can detect and diagnose horses that  have been sored.   It will also require the USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection  Service to publicly publish information on sorers so that the folks  managing the horse shows, competitions, and sales know who has broken  the law and abused their horses.   Soring has been illegal since 1970, yet here we are 50 years later,  and soring is still taking place. Self-policing has not worked.   There is a clear and demonstrable need for this bill. To oppose this  action is a disservice to the people who really work hard and train and  show horses the right way, without abusing them.   That is who we should be focused on right now--not the abusers but  the animals, these equine athletes that we love and revere so much.   Our bill is supported by the American Veterinary Medical Association;  the American Horse Council; American Association of Equine  Practitioners; National Sheriffs' Association; Kentucky-based United  States Equestrian Federation; the All American Walking Horse Alliance;  Animal Wellness Action; Humane Society; veterinary medical associations  from all 50 States; and many, many more.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the American Horse  Council                                          American Horse Council,                                      Washington, DC, July 24, 2019.      Hon. Kurt Schrader,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Ted Yoho,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Schrader and Yoho: The American Horse       Council (AHC) congratulates you for your leadership and hard       work to position the Sen. Joseph Tydings Memorial Prevent All       Soring Tactics (PAST) Act (H.R. 693) for a vote on the House       floor prior to adjourning for the August recess. With more       than 300 cosponsors on your bill, we look forward to a       resounding and long-awaited legislative victory for equine       welfare.        As you know, the PAST Act outlines a commonsense solution       to prevent the continued practice of taking action on a       horse's limb to produce an accentuated gait during       competition. The scope of the bill is limited. It lays out a       specific framework that focuses enforcement efforts on three       horse breeds--the Tennessee Walking Horses, Spotted Saddle       Horses, and Racking Horses--that continue to be the target of       soring practices. The treatment of these select breeds stands       in stark contrast to the dramatic decline in the overall       mistreatment of horses that has occurred since enactment of       the HPA during the 1970s. AHC, along with most major national       horse show organizations and state and local organizations,       supports the PAST Act. Also, AHC members have sent hundreds       ofletters to your House colleagues this year supporting H.R.       693.        Thank you very much for all the efforts you're making to       push this important bill across the finish line. If you'd       like more information related to the PAST Act, feel free to       contact me.            Regards,                                            Julie M. Broadway, CAE,      President, AHC.                                   ____     Mr. Speaker, the PAST Act will strengthen existing law  to ensure that horse soring becomes a thing of the past.   It is a commonsense bill and widely supported. I am proud to have 307  of my colleagues as cosponsors on this bill, especially the original  cosponsors, the long-time champions of this bill: Dr. Ted Yoho,  Congressman Cohen of Tennessee, Congresswoman Schakowsky, Congressman  Estes, and Congressman Collins.   I urge all of my colleagues to support the PAST Act, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  2215     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee, the best committee in the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the other gentleman  from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Tennessee coming down  and talking on this, and obviously he is from Tennessee and has an  interest, maybe a slightly special interest in talking about the  industry from his perspective.   And if, indeed, most of the industry is complying, then he shouldn't  object to this bill. This bill just makes sure that the bad actors that  the gentleman from Georgia referenced in his opening remarks are,  frankly, taken care of and they can, therefore, not compete unfairly  against the other 90 percent that are doing the right thing.   I will show you a picture here. I don't know if it shows up, but look  at all the nails in here. Look at all this stuff. Congressman Yoho and  I in our previous lives treated a lot of horses, would see a lot of  limb problems, would see a lot of coffin bone problems in their feet.   This sort of thing almost guarantees a horse is going to prematurely  get arthritic, end its athletic career, and have serious problems. It  is completely unnecessary and unfair.   The Veterinary Medical Association states unequivocally, along with  the American Association of Equine Practitioners, who are the medical  experts--not the Farm Bureau from Kentucky or Tennessee; these are the  medical experts--say that pads and chains cause harm to the horses.   I believe the veterinary experts. There is no doubt.   I would certainly hope that folks here would go with the body of  evidence, the folks who care about the horses passionately, deeply,  have worked on them for their entire professional career. Let's be fair  about this, and let's make sure there is no unfair competition.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would just point out for those who are  listening that the bill referenced by the gentleman from Tennessee is  another self-policing bill where you have, frankly, the industry and  the horse people from those States selecting and designating these  people for inspection. And contrary to some of the remarks, the PAST  Act has science behind it, licensed, trained professionals--again,  probably veterinarians, for the most part--who are going to be the ones  who are going to be looking at this.   I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), my good  friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I appreciate the discussion here tonight. I wish we didn't have to  have this discussion. Unfortunately, soring is still with us, and it is  crystal clear we need the PAST Act, a commonsense bill to give USDA and  the industry itself the ability to clean out these bad actors who are,  frankly, a stain on the Tennessee Walking industry that we all love and  respect. Those horses are majestic. Anyone that has been around an  equine athlete just can't be but in awe of what they are able to do.   Soring is completely unnecessary. Good trainers, good veterinary  help, these horses are going to perform in a way that make Americans  proud.   I thank my colleagues for the work on the bill and urge all my  colleagues to support the PAST Act.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
