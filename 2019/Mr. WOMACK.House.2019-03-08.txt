 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  legacy of the late Joe Steele, the founder of Steele Canning Company in  Arkansas.   Joe grew up in northwest Arkansas and eventually enrolled at the  University of Arkansas. To cover his tuition, he began canning  tomatoes. This side job quickly turned into the Steele Canning Company.   The business continued to grow and relocated to Springdale. There Joe  made history by shipping the first trainload of canned food in the  United States and introducing Popeye brand spinach. During World War  II, 70 percent of Steele's products were sent to our brave troops. One  soldier even commented on the beans, saying that the  [[Page H2608]]  reason they are so good is because they were canned in Arkansas.   His legacy also includes the creation of the Beaver Water District,  which is the primary source of water for northwest Arkansas.   For these contributions, he was posthumously inducted into the  Arkansas Business Hall of Fame. I congratulate his family on this great  honor.                            ____________________
