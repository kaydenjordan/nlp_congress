 Mr. Chairman, we know that there have been  foreign attacks on our election infrastructure. That is a fact.   Knowing there are those out there who seek to rob us of our  democracy, why would we leave our door wide open? Why would we not  create a shield when our democracy is under attack?   The SHIELD Act, carefully drafted by my colleague and chair, Ms.  Lofgren, requires that political campaigns report any information they  receive from foreign agents to the FBI so we can centralize information  and stop attacks. Why would we not want to do that?   The SHIELD Act establishes strong penalties for online voter  intimidation by foreign actors. Why would we not want to do that?   The SHIELD Act closes loopholes that allow foreigners to spend their  money in our elections. Why would we not want to do that?   There are enemies out there every day trying to cast doubt on our  elections. We have no excuse--no excuse--for not doing all we can to  make ourselves less vulnerable.   This should be a bipartisan no-brainer, Mr. Chairman. I urge my  colleagues to support the SHIELD Act to protect our democracy.
