 Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the legislation. I am  disappointed that today we once again are discussing the continued  Republican insistence that immigration is a Federal land emergency.   I will continue to dispute this claim because instead of focusing on  the root causes of our Nation's immigration crisis and challenges, my  colleagues have chosen to double down on a distraction.   I oppose this bill because it is a political stunt that will invite  even more hateful anti-immigration rhetoric from the extreme MAGA wing  of the Republican Party.   The case of Floyd Bennett Field does not represent a threat to our  public lands. Rather, it encapsulates the humanitarian crisis that we  are facing caused by failed immigration policies from the past  administration and from the failure of Congress to take any action to  reform a broken immigration system.   The crisis can be solved but only with real comprehensive immigration  reform.   Madam Chair, former President Trump, as I understand it, is still the  frontrunner for the Republican Presidential nomination.   News flash: Nothing has changed. He has stated that he intends to  return to the White House with his supercharged plan that one of his  closest confidants and noted white nationalist Stephen Miller described  as a ``blitz.''   Miller went on to say that, ``Trump will unleash the vast arsenal of  Federal powers to implement the most spectacular migration crackdown.''   Madam Chair, I include in the Record The New York Times article,  ``Sweeping Raids, Giant Camps and Mass Deportations: Inside Trump's  2025 Immigration Plans.''                  [From the New York Times, Nov. 11, 2023]   Sweeping Raids and Mass Deportations: Inside Trump's 2025 Immigration                                   Plans           (By Charles Savage, Maggie Haberman and Jonathan Swan)         Former President Donald J. Trump is planning an extreme       expansion of his first-term crackdown on immigration if he       returns to power in 2025--including preparing to round up       undocumented people already in the United States on a vast       scale and detain them in sprawling camps while they wait to       be expelled.        The plans would sharply restrict both legal and illegal       immigration in a multitude of ways.        Mr. Trump wants to revive his first-term border policies,       including banning entry by people from certain Muslim-      majority nations and reimposing a Covid 19-era policy of       refusing asylum claims--though this time he would base that       refusal on assertions that migrants carry other infectious       diseases like tuberculosis.        He plans to scour the country for unauthorized immigrants       and deport people by the millions per year.        To help speed mass deportations, Mr. Trump is preparing an       enormous expansion of a form of removal that does not require       due process hearings. To help Immigration and Customs       Enforcement carry out sweeping raids, he plans to reassign       other federal agents and deputize local police officers and       National Guard soldiers voluntarily contributed by       Republican-run states.        To ease the strain on ICE detention facilities, Mr. Trump       wants to build huge camps to detain people while their cases       are processed and they await deportation flights. And to get       around any refusal by Congress to appropriate the necessary       funds, Mr. Trump would redirect money in the military budget,       as he did in his first term to spend more on a border wall       than Congress had authorized.        In a public reference to his plans, Mr. Trump told a crowd       in Iowa in September: ``Following the Eisenhower model, we       will carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in       American history.'' The reference was to a 1954 campaign to       round up and expel Mexican immigrants that was named for an       ethnic slur--``Operation Wetback.''        The constellation of Mr. Trump's 2025 plans amounts to an       assault on immigration on a scale unseen in modern American       history. Millions of undocumented immigrants would be barred       from the country or uprooted from it years or even decades       after settling here.        Such a scale of planned removals would raise logistical,       financial and diplomatic challenges and would be vigorously       challenged in court. But there is no mistaking the breadth       and ambition of the shift Mr. Trump is eyeing.        In a second Trump presidency, the visas of foreign students       who participated in anti-Israel or pro-Palestinian protests       would be canceled. U.S. consular officials abroad will be       directed to expand ideological screening of visa applicants       to block people the Trump administration considers to have       undesirable attitudes. People who were granted temporary       protected status because they are from certain countries       deemed unsafe, allowing them to lawfully live and work in the       United States, would have that status revoked.        Similarly, numerous people who have been allowed to live in       the country temporarily for humanitarian reasons would also       lose that status and be kicked out, including tens of       thousands of the Afghans who were evacuated amid the 2021       Taliban takeover and allowed to enter the United States.       Afghans holding special visas granted to people who helped       U.S. forces would be revetted to see if they really did.        And Mr. Trump would try to end birthright citizenship for       babies born in the United States to undocumented parents--by       proclaiming that policy to be the new position of the       government and by ordering agencies to cease issuing       citizenship-affirming documents like Social Security cards       and passports to them. That policy's legal legitimacy, like       nearly all of Mr. Trump's plans, would be virtually certain       to end up before the Supreme Court.        In interviews with The New York Times, several Trump       advisers gave the most expansive and detailed description of       Mr. Trump's immigration agenda in a potential second term. In       particular, Mr. Trump's campaign referred questions for this       article to Stephen Miller, an architect of Mr. Trump's first-      term immigration policies who remains close to and is       expected to serve in a senior role in a second       administration.        All of the steps Trump advisers are preparing, Mr. Miller       contended in a wide-ranging interview, rely on existing       statutes; while the Trump team would likely seek a revamp of       immigration laws, the plan was crafted to need no new       substantive legislation. And while acknowledging that       lawsuits would arise to challenge nearly every one of them,       he portrayed the Trump team's daunting array of tactics as a       ``blitz'' designed to overwhelm immigrant-rights lawyers.        ``Any activists who doubt President Trump's resolve in the       slightest are making a drastic error: Trump will unleash the       vast arsenal of federal powers to implement the most       spectacular migration crackdown,'' Mr. Miller said, adding,       ``The immigration legal activists won't know what's       happening.''        Todd Schulte, the president of FWD.us, an immigration and       criminal justice advocacy group that repeatedly fought the       Trump administration, said the Trump team's plans relied on       ``xenophobic demagoguery'' that appeals to his hardest-core       political base.        ``Americans should understand these policy proposals are an       authoritarian, often illegal, agenda that would rip apart       nearly every aspect of American life--tanking the economy,       violating the basic civil rights of millions of immigrants       and native-born Americans alike,'' Mr. Schulte said.        Since Mr. Trump left office, the political environment on       immigration has moved in his direction. He is also more       capable now of exploiting that environment if he is re-      elected than he was when he first won election as an       outsider.        The ebbing of the Covid-19 pandemic and resumption of       travel flows have helped stir a global migrant crisis, with       millions of Venezuelans and Central Americans fleeing turmoil       and Africans arriving in Latin American countries before       continuing their journey north. Amid the record numbers of       migrants at the southern border and beyond it in cities like       New York and Chicago, voters are frustrated and even some       Democrats are calling for tougher action against immigrants       and pressuring the White House to better manage the crisis.        Mr. Trump and his advisers see the opening, and now know       better how to seize it. The aides Mr. Trump relied upon in       the chaotic early days of his first term were sometimes at       odds and lacked experience in how to manipulate the levers of       federal power. By  [[Page H5959]]       the end of his first term, cabinet officials and lawyers who       sought to restrain some of his actions--like his Homeland       Security secretary and chief of staff, John F. Kelly--had       been fired, and those who stuck with him had learned much.        In a second term, Mr. Trump plans to install a team that       will not restrain him.        Since much of Mr. Trump's first-term immigration crackdown       was tied up in the courts, the legal environment has tilted       in his favor: His four years of judicial appointments left       behind federal appellate courts and a Supreme Court that are       far more conservative than the courts that heard challenges       to his first-term policies.        The fight over Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals       provides an illustration.        DACA is an Obama-era program that shields from deportation       and grants work permits to people who were brought unlawfully       to the United States as children. Mr. Trump tried to end it,       but the Supreme Court blocked him on procedural grounds in       June 2020.        Mr. Miller said Mr. Trump would try again to end DACA. And       the 5-4 majority of the Supreme Court that blocked the last       attempt no longer exists: A few months after the DACA ruling,       Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died and Mr. Trump replaced her       with a sixth conservative, Justice Amy Coney Barrett.        Mr. Trump's rhetoric has more than kept up with his       increasingly extreme agenda on immigration.        His stoking of fear and anger toward immigrants--pushing       for a border wall and calling Mexicans rapists--fueled his       2016 takeover of the Republican Party. As president, he       privately mused about developing a militarized border like       Israel's, asked whether migrants crossing the border could be       shot in the legs and wanted a proposed border wall topped       with flesh-piercing spikes and painted black to burn       migrants' skin.        As he has campaigned for the party's third straight       presidential nomination, his anti-immigrant tone has only       grown harsher. In a recent interview with a right-wing       website, Mr. Trump claimed without evidence that foreign       leaders were deliberately emptying their ``insane asylums''       to send the patients across America's southern border as       migrants. He said migrants were ``poisoning the blood of our       country.'' And at a rally on Wednesday in Florida, he       compared them to the fictional serial killer and cannibal       Hannibal Lecter, saying; ``That's what's coming into our       country right now.''        Mr. Trump had similarly vowed to carry out mass       deportations when running for office in 2016, but the       government only managed several hundred thousand removals per       year under his presidency, on par with other recent       administrations. If they get another opportunity, Mr. Trump       and his team are determined to achieve annual numbers in the       millions.        Mr. Trump's immigration plan is to pick up where he left       off and then go much farther. He would not only revive some       of the policies that were criticized as draconian during his       presidency, many of which the Biden White House ended, but       also expand and toughen them.        One example centers on expanding first-term policies aimed       at keeping people out of the country. Mr. Trump plans to       suspend the nation's refugee program and once again       categorically bar visitors from troubled countries,       reinstating a version of his ban on travel from several       mostly Muslim-majority countries, which President Biden       called discriminatory and ended on his first day in office.        Mr. Trump would also use coercive diplomacy to induce other       nations to help, including by making cooperation a condition       of any other bilateral engagement, Mr. Miller said. For       example, a second Trump administration would seek to re-      establish an agreement with Mexico that asylum seekers remain       there while their claims are processed. (It is not clear that       Mexico would agree; a Mexican court has said that deal       violated human rights.)        Mr. Trump would also push to revive ``safe third country''       agreements with several nations in Central America, and try       to expand them to Africa, Asia and South America. Under such       deals, countries agree to take would-be asylum seekers from       specific other nations and let them apply for asylum there       instead.        While such arrangements have traditionally only covered       migrants who had previously passed through a third country,       federal law does not require that limit and a second Trump       administration would seek to make those deals without it, in       part as a deterrent to migrants making what the Trump team       views as illegitimate asylum claims.        At the same time, Mr. Miller said, the Centers for Disease       Control and Prevention would invoke the public health       emergency powers law known as Title 42 to again refuse to       hear any asylum claims by people arriving at the southern       border. The Trump administration had internally discussed       that idea early in Mr. Trump's term, but some cabinet       secretaries pushed back, arguing that there was no public       health emergency that would legally justify it. The       administration ultimately implemented it during the       coronavirus pandemic.        Saying the idea has since gained acceptance in practice--      Mr. Biden initially kept the policy--Mr. Miller said Mr.       Trump would invoke Title 42, citing ``severe strains of the       flu, tuberculosis, scabies, other respiratory illnesses like       R.S.V. and so on, or just a general issue of mass migration       being a public health threat and conveying a variety of       communicable diseases.''        Mr. Trump and his aides have not yet said whether they       would re-enact one of the most contentious deterrents to       unauthorized immigration that he pursued as president:       separating children from their parents, which led to trauma       among migrants and difficulties in reuniting families. When       pressed, Mr. Trump has repeatedly declined to rule out       reviving the policy. After an outcry over the practice, Mr.       Trump ended it in 2018 and a judge later blocked the       government from putting it back into effect.        Soon after Mr. Trump announced his 2024 campaign for       president last November, he met with Tom Homan, who ran ICE       for the first year and a half of the Trump administration and       was an early proponent of separating families to deter       migrants.        In an interview, Mr. Homan recalled that in that meeting,       he ``agreed to come back'' in a second term and would ``help       to organize and run the largest deportation operation this       country's ever seen.''        Trump advisers' vision of abrupt mass deportations would be       a recipe for social and economic turmoil, disrupting the       housing market and major industries including agriculture and       the service sector.        Mr Miller cast such disruption in a favorable light.        ``Mass deportation will be a labor-market disruption       celebrated by American workers, who will now be offered       higher wages with better benefits to fill these jobs,'' he       said. ``Americans will also celebrate the fact that our       nation's laws are now being applied equally, and that one       select group is no longer magically exempt.''        One planned step to overcome the legal and logistical       hurdles would be to significantly expand a form of fast-track       deportations known as ``expedited removal.'' it denies       undocumented immigrants the usual hearings and opportunity to       file appeals, which can take months or years--especially when       people are not in custody--and has led to a large backlog. A       1996 law says people can be subject to expedited removal for       up to two years after arriving, but to date the executive       branch has used it more cautiously, swiftly expelling people       picked up near the border soon after crossing.        The Trump administration tried to expand the use of       expedited removal, but a court blocked it and then the Biden       team canceled the expansion. It remains unclear whether the       Supreme Court will rule that it is constitutional to use the       law against people who have been living for a significant       period in the United States and express fear of persecution       if sent home.        Mr. Trump has also said he would invoke an archaic law, the       Alien Enemies Act of 1798, to expel suspected members of drug       cartels and criminal gangs without due process. That law       allows for summary deportation of people from countries with       which the United States is at war, that have invaded the       United States or that have engaged in ``predatory       incursions.''        The Supreme Court has upheld past uses of that law in       wartime. But its text seems to require a link to the actions       of a foreign government, so it is not clear whether the       justices will allow a president to stretch it to encompass       drug cartel activity.        More broadly, Mr. Miller said a new Trump administration       would shift from the ICE practice of arresting specific       people to carrying out workplace raids and other sweeps in       public places aimed at arresting scores of unauthorized       immigrants at once.        To make the process of finding and deporting undocumented       immigrants already living inside the country ``radically more       quick and efficient,'' he said, the Trump team would bring in       ``the right kinds of attorneys and the right kinds of policy       thinkers'' willing to carry out such ideas.        And because of the magnitude of arrests and deportations       being contemplated, they plan to build ``vast holding       facilities that would function as staging centers'' for       immigrants as their cases progress and they wait to be flown       to other countries.        Mr. Miller said the new camps would likely be built ``on       open land in Texas near the border.''        He said the military would construct them under the       authority and control of the Department of Homeland Security.       While he cautioned that there were no specific blueprints       yet, he said the camps would look professional and similar to       other facilities for migrants that have been built near the       border.        Such camps could also enable the government to speed up the       pace and volume of deportations of undocumented people who       have lived in the United States for years and so are not       subject to fast-track removal. If pursuing a longshot effort       to win permission to remain in the country would mean staying       locked up in the interim, some may give up and voluntarily       accept removal without going through the full process.        The use of these camps, Mr. Miller said, would likely be       focused more on single adults because the government cannot       indefinitely hold children under a longstanding court order       known as the Flores settlement. So any families brought to       the facilities would have to be moved in and out more       quickly, he said.        The Trump administration tried to overturn the Flores       settlement, but the Supreme Court did not resolve the matter       before Mr. Trump's term ended. Mr. Miller said the Trump team       would try again.  [[Page H5960]]         To increase the number of agents available for ICE sweeps,       Mr. Miller said, officials from other federal law enforcement       agencies would be temporarily reassigned, and state National       Guard troops and local police officers, at least from willing       Republican-led states, would be deputized for immigration       control efforts.        While a law known as the Posse Comitatus Act generally       forbids the use of the armed forces for law enforcement       purposes, another law called the Insurrection Act creates an       exception. Mr. Trump would invoke the Insurrection Act at the       border, enabling the use of federal troops to apprehend       migrants, Mr Miller said.        ``Bottom line,'' he said, ``President Trump will do       whatever it takes.''    Madam Chair, apparently, the plan that has Mr. Miller  salivating includes mass roundups, mass incarceration, permanently  ending DACA, and the construction of camps to hold migrants waiting to  be processed and presumably later expelled from the country.   This is the leader from the Republican Party--his platform on  immigration.   I wonder if MAGA Don thinks that he will build these camps on public  lands. I hope not, but who knows, perhaps he even thinks Mexico will  pay for it.   Seeking asylum is a human right. We should be discussing how we can  best support migrants in this time of crisis by providing additional  resources to guarantee safety and well-being during the immigration  process.   We should be supporting cities like New York that are responding  proactively to this crisis. Instead, we are taking up a bill that  micromanages and limits local decisionmaking authority.   If the Republicans wanted to protect our parks, they would have  passed an appropriations bill that would not cut nearly half a billion  dollars from the National Park budget. Such a cut would result in the  loss of 1,000 park staff and will reduce the agency's maintenance and  preservation funding.   These extreme cuts are going nowhere in the Senate, and President  Biden has promised to veto, so why waste that time.   To protect our parks, we should empower our Federal land management  agencies by providing them with the necessary resources to fulfill  their mission and the mission to the American people. Instead, this  bill would interfere with that work.   Historically, the National Park Service has the authority to lease  its property if the agency head determines that the lease will not  obstruct the preservation of the property. Well, in the case of Floyd  Bennett Field, the temporary lease will have minimal environmental  impact.   New York City will be investing millions of dollars to address the  deferred maintenance and improve visitor amenities, leaving the site  actually better than before. This idea that leasing the field this way  will somehow degrade it is a red herring.   The temporary lease will also have minimal impact on recreation. The  park at Floyd Bennett Field we are talking about in this instance is  the disused runway at an abandoned airport. That is why the site has a  long history of leasing for nonrecreational purposes.   It has been used for emergency responses, like during Hurricane  Sandy, and even now it is used by NYPD and the New York City Department  of Sanitation for exercises, including training their drivers in the  use of heavy-duty vehicles.   Madam Chair, New York City is urgently responding to a humanitarian  crisis. We need to support that effort. Evicting the migrants at Floyd  Bennett Field with no plan for keeping them from being homeless is not  a real solution for New Yorkers. It is not a real solution for our  national immigration debate. We need real immigration reform, not more  unserious attempts to distract from the root of the problem.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Velazquez), a distinguished member of the Natural  Resources Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New York.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Maine (Ms. Pingree).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I think a soft reminder is important now, as we point to these asylum  seekers and those who are seeking refugee status in this country and  those who are going through the immigration process.   It is important to note that they are not the first. Almost everybody  who speaks on this floor today can trace their lineage to somebody who  wasn't here in this country when the indigenous people, the first  Americans in this country, were here.   I think we need to be careful not to stereotype, not to be ugly, and  not to be abusive about a crisis and human tragedy that we see before  us that we should be attending to rather than exploiting.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Menendez), a valued colleague.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Garcia).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Goldman).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from New York.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Garcia).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks), the ranking member of the Foreign  Affairs Committee.    Mr. Chairman, as a reminder, seeking asylum is a human,  legal right protected by international law and United States law,  period.   Instead of wishing that that was not the case, Republicans should  work with Democrats and the administration to move a meaningful  response to this humanitarian crisis and dealing with the issue of  comprehensive immigration reform. Unfortunately, we are here debating a  senseless stunt of a bill instead.   Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Chicago,  Illinois (Mrs. Ramirez).    Mr. Chairman, yes, elections do have consequences, and  one of the responsibilities that elections provide to the United States  Congress and the House of Representatives, let me remind my colleagues,  is our broken immigration system, and that is a problem only Congress  can solve.   We have seen what happens when Republicans try to solve this from the  White House. The Trump administration set an unprecedented pace for  executive action on immigration. These restrictive policies did not  solve the crisis. Instead, they increased the backlog in immigration  proceedings, separated children from their families, banned foreign  nationals from predominately Muslim countries, and cut refugee numbers  to the lowest in decades, among other things. So this is on Congress to  fix.   Unfortunately, as long as Republicans refuse to support real,  substantive reform that is fair, humane, and equitable for all parties,  then we will continue to see immigration-related crises of the makings  of Congress and in this particular instance of the making of the House  majority Republicans.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, it is interesting to hear my Republican counterparts  wax eloquently about their concerns for our national parks during this  debate. They didn't say a word about the tremendous damage done to  cultural resources by Trump's disastrous border wall along the southern  border in Arizona primarily. They did not speak to that issue at all.   In fact, now they want to condition aid to Ukraine and possibly  Israel, who are key U.S. allies, on the construction of even more miles  of an ineffective and destructive border wall.   It is one thing to have a debate about a basic philosophical  difference and policy difference that we have in terms of immigration  reform. It is another to use half-truths and disinformation and to be  disingenuous in presenting what is a reality. The reality on the  southern border in Arizona is serious, and I have not denied and will  not deny that it is a crisis.   Nevertheless, this is a crisis that must be worked on humanely and  not by stereotyping and profiling people because of their country of  origin as the reason that we make the harsh comments that are being  heard today.   Pandering is not the solution. Constructive and pragmatic immigration  reform is what we need to do. That is not being done, and this bill  doesn't do it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   We have heard the argument today, and indeed for years now, that  migrants crossing our border are the primary ones responsible for the  tens of thousands of American lives tragically lost to fentanyl  overdoses each year. It is a tragedy that we can all not only  sympathize with but want to do something desperately about.   Nevertheless, that story is simply false. Fentanyl is overwhelmingly  smuggled into the United States by American citizens where it is then  also consumed by American citizens. That is a fact.   In 2021 more than 86 percent of convicted fentanyl traffickers were  U.S. citizens. More than 90 percent of fentanyl seizures occur at legal  crossing points and interior checkpoints, not illegal immigration  routes, and just 0.02 percent of migrants arrested by Border Patrol are  found to possess fentanyl.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a piece from The American Prospect  exploring how customs loopholes allow smugglers to ship fentanyl and  its precursor chemical to the United States without inspection or law  enforcement.                   [The American Prospect, Nov. 27, 2023]             The Amazon Loophole Is Driving the Fentanyl Crisis                              (By David Dayen)         One of the more frustrating things about public policy in       the United States is how the dominance of corporate interests       makes simple reforms that could save thousands of lives       impossible. To wit: Here is the story of how Amazon and other       retailers are facilitating the epidemic of deaths from       fentanyl.        We know that fentanyl deaths rose 279 percent from 2016 to       2022. Two-thirds of the 110,000-plus overdose deaths in       America last year were due to fentanyl. It is the leading       killer of Americans aged 18 to 49, and it has devastated       communities across the country.        Drug enforcement efforts in the U.S. have historically       targeted supply through a so-called ``war on drugs.'' But       reducing the amount of fentanyl on the street need not       involve military-style operations in Central and South       America. China is the source of most of the chemical       compounds that cartels use to make fentanyl in illicit drug       labs. Without these raw materials, much of the fentanyl trade       would be stopped.        Now, of course this would not halt opioid addiction or use       by itself; traditional smuggled heroin would likely fill in       the gap. But fentanyl is orders of magnitude more dangerous       than heroin thanks to its extreme potency, which is a       principal cause of the overdose epidemic. The tiniest of       measurement errors can lead to an overdose, and black-market       drug dealers are not exactly known for their responsible       metrology.        Customs enforcement officials have begun to charge Chinese       firms that produce and ship these precursor chemicals (and       produced fentanyl as well, and President Biden, in a summit       earlier this month, pressured Chinese President Xi Jinping on       the matter. The U.S. and China agreed in principle to a deal       where China would limit the flow of fentanyl  [[Page H5966]]       in exchange for the U.S. rolling back restrictions on China's       forensic police institute.        But while Chinese cooperation is welcome, the bigger       problem is that the vast majority of fentanyl chemicals sent       from China are not inspected at all. That's because of       something called the ``de minimis'' rule.        Section 321 of the Tariff Act of 1930 allows for goods       under a certain value to be shipped into the U.S. without       tariffs, fees, or inspections. Anyone who has flown on       international travel is familiar with this from their       declaration card when they return to the U.S.; if you got       some trinkets from abroad that are of a nominal value, you       don't have to submit them to customs officials.        In 2016, that nominal, or de minimis, value, went up from       $200 to $800. There are only two countries in the world that       have a higher de minimis value than the U.S.; China's de       minimis value is less than $10.        Why did this change happen? Because      e-commerce firms, primarily Amazon, wanted to be able to       bring in goods from China to their warehouses or even       directly to their customers without any taxes or tariffs. In       fact, it's often been characterized as the ``Amazon       loophole.''        Chinese shippers have been known to package shipments in       separate boxes to keep under the $800 threshold, or send       goods to distribution centers just outside the United States,       where packages are broken up to get under the de minimis       threshold and sent into the country.        These small shipments have exploded in frequency. In fiscal       year 2018, 410.5 million de minimis packages were sent. By       fiscal year 2022, that number was up to 685.1 million. Some       experts put that number much higher. One analysis estimates       that the official figure for the trade deficit with China       last year was short by $188 billion after accounting for de       minimis shipments.        While there's practically no information available about       these shipments (many have no data at all except for a       mailing label), there is mounting evidence that one of the       most common de minimis items is fentanyl, as Michael Stumo of       the Coalition for a Prosperous America has written. This       stands to reason, as fentanyl's potency means it is highly       valuable by weight. ``The overwhelming volume of small       packages and lack of actionable data,'' the U.S. Office of       Customs and Border Protection wrote earlier this year,       ``impacts CBP's ability to identify and interdict high-risk       shipments that may contain narcotics, merchandise that poses       a risk to public safety, counterfeits, or other contraband.''       It's highly likely that precursor chemicals are moving from       China to Mexico under de minimis rules as well.        It was not the original intention of de minimis rules to       build a parallel, off-the-books customs system, used often       for illegal goods shipping. But that's what the Amazon       loophole has facilitated. Congress is aware of the problem. A       bill from Sens. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Bill Cassidy (R-LA)       would reduce de minimis thresholds to the level of trading       partners (meaning that the de minimis threshold on Chinese       goods would fall to under $10). A separate bipartisan,       bicameral bill would simply ban de minimis shipments from       ``non-market'' economies, as well as countries on a priority       watch list for using de minimis, which would target China.        The House Select Committee on China has investigated       rampant use of the Amazon loophole from fast-fashion       companies using forced labor. One textile industry official       described de minimis as akin to ``handing a free trade       agreement to China and the rest of the world.'' The chairman       of the China committee, Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI), has       expressed optimism that legislation reforming de minimis       would pass this year (though passing anything in Congress is       incredibly optimistic).        Of course, this is terrible news for the companies       exploiting the loophole for tax benefits, like Amazon and       other online retailers. So they are firing up their lobby       engines. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National       Foreign Trade Council (a trade group of importers) deny that       counterfeit goods or fentanyl enter the U.S. through de       minimis shipments at all, while arguing that CBP gets plenty       of information about what's in the packages. Lobbyists and       their allies are also complaining about higher CBP costs for       inspections of small packages, while not mentioning that it       would be the importer who would have to pay those charges.        Keep in mind that when indictments were handed down on the       companies sending precursor chemicals for fentanyl to drug       cartels, they were reportedly packagd to appear as dog food,       nuts, or motor oil. The ``benefits of free trade'' are hard       to discern in a recently expanded loophole intended mostly to       save Amazon money that is now facilitating the fentanyl       crisis.        There's another beneficiary of the de minimis loophole:       digital advertising companies, which benefit from ads from       Chinese fast-fashion firms like Shein and Temu that make       liberal use of the loophole. Financial Times reporter Rana       Foroohar reported recently that one-third of the revenue       growth from Meta this year is due to these two fast-fashion       firms.        The Biden administration could actually use executive       authority to remove certain de minimis exceptions. But in a       meeting last week about combating the entry of fentanyl,       administration officials actually claimed that reauthorizing       the warrantless spying provisions of the Foreign Intelligence       Surveillance Act was critical to stopping the supply. There       isn't much evidence that surveillance dragnets would deal       with the fentanyl trade, and Congress is highly unlikely to       rubber-stamp government spying once again.        Drug addiction is largely a medical issue, and expanding       treatment is likely to pay higher dividends than a loser's       game of trying to stem the flow of supply. But the fact that       fentanyl is coming in through ordinary shipping services       without inspection seems to be the low-hanging fruit here.       The process of customs inspection has been almost totally       circumvented, to the benefit of two groups: e-commerce       companies raking in cheap goods from China, and drug       traffickers. The latter may be a universally hated scourge,       but the former is quite powerful. And so abuse of the       loophole continues.        The question for lawmakers and the White House then       becomes: How many Americans are they willing to sacrifice so       Amazon doesn't have to pay a little bit in import fees?     Mr. Chair, U.S. citizens are providing both the supply  and the demand for fentanyl and other illegal drugs. The organized  criminal syndicates on both sides of the borders are the ones profiting  off the billions and billions of dollars from the misery and deaths  that fentanyl has caused.   Instead of addressing these root causes that have led to the tragic  opioid epidemic, Republicans want to lay the blame on migrants seeking  a life in this great Nation of ours, being free from persecution and  free from hatred and fear.   That is another piece of disinformation. I think it is important to  know that we are talking about an issue where that bitter taste and  that deadly taste was introduced to the American people by Big Pharma,  nice homegrown American corporations that provide pharmaceuticals to  this country.   They introduced the habit to the country. Organized crime has taken  it over. American citizens are being hurt, and American citizens are  hurting other citizens.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1515     Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, in closing, we are having a debate on a  piece of legislation that is not really the intent of the legislation.  The intent of this legislation is to begin to continue to develop the  narrative anti-immigrant, xenophobic rhetoric that the Republican  majority feels is going to be their pathway to electoral success in  2024.   I think the American people are going to be able to see that if you  want to talk about our national parks and the public use as being the  priority, Democrats are prepared to work with the Republican majority  to protect them and to enhance those resources.   If we are going to talk about immigration and we are going to talk in  an atmosphere where the dog whistles don't become barks on this issue,  Democrats are prepared to do that. We are prepared to sit down and look  at the aspects of legalization, security, and fighting the syndicated  crime that is causing much hurt in this country and in Mexico. We are  prepared to do that, but we are not prepared to deal with this issue as  a ruse, as a stunt, as a political performative act leading to 2024.   If they are serious about immigration reform, if we are serious about  protecting our public lands and waters, we are serious about it, too.   Mr. Chair, I urge all Members of the House to vote ``no'' on this  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment is, frankly, completely  unnecessary. It would require preparation and submission of an annual  report in perpetuity regarding the migrants housed on certain public  lands. Yet, the underlying bill would essentially ban any such housing.   It is a permanent requirement for reporting on nothing, paid for by  the taxpayer.   Over the years, I have heard plenty of skepticism from my Republican  colleagues about some of the reports that Congress requires of the  executive branch. Usually, though, I can at least see the argument for  those other reports, but I have to say it is interesting to see my  Republican colleagues in favor of this one.   That said, I don't think this amendment is worth fighting over  either. Having these reports would not be useful, but it would not be  actively harmful either. I only hope that House Republicans would  change their minds about slashing the budgets of these departments and  will instead give Federal workers the funding they need to carry out  their missions, which will now also include generating these annual  reports.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, again, in our view, this amendment is  unnecessary, but it is not actively harmful, either. I hope we can move  on. I hope that everybody is satisfied, that they got their little  clips done in terms of being strong, hard, anti-immigrant people and  got those little sound bites done already. I think it is time that we  move on.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of this amendment. This  amendment draws attention to the dubious and deceptive strategy of  placing migrants on buses under false pretenses and without any  coordination or even a courtesy call.   Both Governor Abbott and Governor DeSantis have demonstrated that  they are more interested in ginning up the MAGA base on Twitter than  finding meaningful solutions to the challenges facing our immigration  system, the refugee crisis both nationally and particularly in their  States.   Migrants are people, not political pawns. We can have disagreements  over immigration policy. That is fair game. However, the dehumanizing  games and political stunts need to stop.   Mr. Chair, I associate myself with the remarks of the gentlewoman  from New York, the sponsor of the amendment.
