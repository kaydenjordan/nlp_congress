 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to address the  latest action my colleagues from across the aisle have taken to blow up  what was a perfectly good piece of legislation for the sake of scoring  political points.   The SECURE Act was a great piece of legislation that would have  allowed Americans to expand the benefits of 529 education savings  plans.   It would have also allowed students with disabilities to be able to  use their 529 savings accounts to pay for critical therapy options  outside of the traditional classroom. But Democrats struck this  commonsense provision down before bringing the bill to the floor today.   How can my colleagues across the aisle justify limiting the resources  that children with disabilities have at their disposal to grow and to  thrive?   As a father of a child with disabilities, I know how difficult it is  to allow disabled children to receive the services that they deserve  and that they need. Having flexible payment mechanisms to enhance these  opportunities to access therapies opens doors that are otherwise  closed.   Mr. Speaker, I condemn my colleagues across the aisle for their  attack on children with disabilities.                            ____________________
