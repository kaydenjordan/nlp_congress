 Mr. President, I am glad to yield my friend 5 minutes to  start the day.    Mr. President, I want to talk about the Affordable Care  Act and its failures, as well as the American Health Care Act and what  differences I think it makes. I am going to be joined on the floor by  at least one of my colleagues soon, and we may even, with permission,  have a colloquy. I know Senator Barrasso is on a limited time schedule  and has been one of our great leaders on this issue. I think I will  turn to him first and then come back when he has had a chance to make  his comments.    I thank the Senator from Wyoming for his efforts on this  topic from the time we were both explaining why we thought President  Obama's plan wouldn't work. What I see and I think what you mentioned  you see is that people who have coverage often don't have access. It  doesn't matter if you have coverage if there is nowhere to go or you  feel like there is nowhere to go. I continually hear that from people  who have the high-deductible policies. That means they are discouraged  from spending the first $6,000 or $8,000 that is out-of-pocket  spending.   Many people I talk to say they have not only more expensive coverage  than they had before but less coverage than they had before and are  reluctant to spend the out-of-pocket dollars that used to be covered by  the insurance that didn't meet the new standards but met their family  needs. I am wondering if the Senator is seeing that same thing.    It is.   Mr. President, I think you are seeing that too. The critical needs  hospitals, the critical access hospitals--the only hospitals  available--are often also hospitals that disproportionately have people  who are not insured or people who are of low income who aren't on any  government program. What has happened in those hospitals and in the  ones that have been able to stay open is that they have often had to go  outside the traditional community support they had and associate with a  bigger hospital.   That may turn out to have been a good thing, but one of the basics of  the President's healthcare plan was--which we now know is a highly  unlikely result--that everybody will have coverage. In a world where  everybody has coverage, you don't have the disproportionate share of  problems that inner-city hospitals, like the Truman Hospital in Kansas  City, MO, have, or rural hospitals, like the dozen-plus that we have in  our State that are critical needs hospitals. Those things don't happen.  If this had worked the way the President thought it would work--and  Democrats, when they, all on their own, passed this bill 7 years ago-- we wouldn't be having the problems we see now: the havoc in our  healthcare system--leaving Missourians, people from Alabama, people  from Wyoming, people from all over the country with higher costs, with  fewer options, and with more uncertainty.   How many times did the President say, when he was supporting this  just after the election and during his election 8 years ago--President  Obama kept making the case--that Americans would be able to keep the  plans they like. They would be able to keep the doctors they like. Now  we act as if those pledges--well, everybody knows--couldn't happen.   When the bill was passed, everybody said that was what would happen.  Remember this: If you have a doctor you like, you will be able to keep  the doctor you like, period. If you have an insurance plan you like,  you will be able to keep the insurance plan you like, period. The  period should have at least been a question mark.   As it turned out, it was not true. People didn't get to do that.  According to the advocates of the law we have now, there would be more  choices, there would be more competition, and there would be lower  costs, and none of those things happened. Those things just did not  happen.   In Missouri, several insurers have totally pulled out of the  individual market. We have 115 counties. Last year, they all had at  least two companies willing to offer insurance. This year, we have 97  counties where only one company is willing to offer insurance. I have  always thought we needed to expand that insurance marketplace, not  reduce it--and buying across State lines and buying an insurance  product you thought met the needs of you and your family, rather than  the needs somebody at the Department of Health and Human Services  thought they knew was better for your family, rather than what you  would know was better for your family. But instead, we have done just  the opposite. Instead of expanding the marketplace, expanding choices-- somehow ObamaCare was designed in a way that actually prevents this-- instead of being able to buy across State lines, now you can't buy  across county lines. We have 97 of our 115 counties where only one  insurance company is willing to be part of the process on the  individual market. That one insurance company, rightly, was able to go  and say: Here is what we are going to charge. If you don't want to  accept that, State insurance regulator, we won't offer the product.   Families one year to the next are often facing 40 percent increases.  I  [[Page S1707]]  think the average is a 25-percent increase year over year. Many people  are paying more than 100 percent, double what they paid when this  started. The rate hikes have gone up and the coverage has gone down.   The average deductible in the bronze plan, the third plan down, is  $6,000 for an individual and $12,000 for a family. That is before  anybody helps you at all. So you have insurance that you are paying for  every month, but if you get sick, you have to pay $6,000 for each  individual and more than twice that if two people in your family have  healthcare problems before anybody does anything. For most families in  our country, and certainly most families in Missouri, that is like not  having insurance at all.   Even in the silver plan, the average deductible is $3,500. That is an  increase of 15 percent of the deductible over last year. Every year,  the price goes up and the deductible goes up. All of us hear from  families, individuals, and businesses who say: We can't continue to do  this. Mark from Blue Springs told me: ``There is nothing affordable''  about the Affordable Care Act. When it comes to what he and his family  are facing, he said that before ObamaCare, they paid $246 a month to  cover five people with coverage they thought met their needs. Now the  premium is $800 a month. There are only three people. Only one child  and he and his wife are still at home. For five people, they were  paying $246 a month. Now they are paying $800 a month. He says:         These days, when we go to the doctor, nothing is covered.       We still have to pay for that visit 100 percent out of       pocket. In other words, we pay $800 per month only to be told       that none of the office visit or procedure is covered until       the $8,000 deductible is met.    He says: Really, what are we going to do? They have taken insurance  away from us, and the promise that was made over and over was never  kept.   Dave, a small business owner in Columbia, says his premiums have more  than doubled at the same time that his business has been forced to  continually raise deductibles and seriously reduce benefits so that  people could continue to have insurance at work. As he puts it,  President Obama's healthcare plan ``is far from affordable.''   Let's see. That is exactly what Mark said: There is nothing  affordable about the Affordable Care Act. And Dave's increase this year  over last year was 40 percent. At some point, Dave and lots of other  employers are deciding that this isn't working.   We have a group in our State that many other States have, the Older  Adults Transportation Service. It is a nonprofit that provides  transportation services for older adults. The title is actually pretty  descriptive of what they do. The cost has gone up over half a million  dollars. The paperwork is ``so complex and so cumbersome,'' the  executive director told me, that they have to spend additional money to  hire a consultant just to fill out the forms to have the insurance they  used to have. Then the insurance doesn't keep up with what they need  and what their drivers need. They have to begin to cut services back to  have insurance that even begins to resemble what they had before the  Affordable Care Act. Talk about people being left out. There are older  adults in Missouri who don't have the same access to transportation  they had before the Affordable Care Act.   President Trump, in his address to the Congress just a few days ago,  reiterated his commitment to step-by-step healthcare reforms ``that  expand choice, increase access, lower costs, and, at the same time,  provide better healthcare.''   I was encouraged that he decided to back the expansion of health  savings accounts. That allows everybody in the country to put more of  their pretax dollars into portable health savings accounts that go with  them wherever they go from job to job. You still have that health  savings account. The plan that the House of Representatives is debating  right now expands the way you can use that health savings account, as  well as expands how much money you can put into that account.   Most importantly, the President reaffirmed the need to ensure  coverage for all preexisting conditions. I have always supported  providing insurance options for people who have preexisting conditions.  I sponsored the legislation that allowed young people to stay on their  parents' healthcare until they were 25. The people drafting the  Affordable Care Act put exactly that language in the bill and raised  the age to 26. Three million people every year have access to insurance  because of a simple choice like that. I think that bill was four pages,  with lots of white space, and 3 million people get insurance every year  who wouldn't have insurance otherwise, or at least traditionally hadn't  had insurance otherwise at no cost to taxpayers. Frankly, there is not  much cost to anybody because those young, healthy people are just  establishing themselves, just leaving home, just going off mom and  dad's insurance, and they thought they could get by without it for a  while. In all likelihood, they were right. They are not a hard group to  insure.   That is the kind of thing we ought to think about, where we figure  out how to increase access to coverage without taxpayers having to bear  the load for somebody else's healthcare, if there is another way to do  it. We want to be sure that, whether it is keeping them on your family  insurance, staying on your family insurance longer, or having no  lifetime cap--that was a legitimate problem that many people faced-- they would have their insurance. They would pay for it forever, and  then when they faced a catastrophic situation, at some point the  insurance companies in earlier times were able to say: You reached your  lifetime cap; so we are now canceling your policy. That wouldn't happen  under the plan we are discussing.   The landscape for healthcare--and what families and individuals have  to deal with--has dramatically changed. Because of that, it is going to  be more challenging to go forward than it would have if we had done the  same half-dozen commonsense things just a few years ago. This is no  2,700-page response or substitute for the 2,700-page ObamaCare bill.   This is an easily understood way to go forward that eliminates taxes  that everybody is now paying on their healthcare. There is a medical  device tax. There is an over-the-counter medication tax for things you  don't have a prescription for. There is a special tax on those over- the-counter medicines in the current law. Those will be repealed. The  medical device tax would be gone, would be phased out. The over-the- counter tax on medicines would be phased out and the tax on  prescription drugs. If you buy over the counter, you pay a tax, but if  you get a prescription, you also pay a tax. There may be a place in  here where you pay a tax for just paying a tax. But the medical device  tax is gone. The over-the-counter medication tax is gone. The tax on  prescription drugs would be gone. The tax on health insurance policies  would be gone. When you get health insurance, there is a tax to be paid  under ObamaCare on that, as well. The Medicare tax increase would be  gone. The tanning bed tax would be gone. The net investment tax would  be gone. The health insurance tax would be gone. It is about a trillion  dollars in taxes that were added back into the system. By the way, if  you have some kind of coverage for a medical device, you are paying for  the coverage. You are paying a tax on the coverage, if you are lucky  enough that the medical device is covered, if your insurance company  pays that. Of course, they pay the tax on that, and, then, you have  paid it in the premium that you had to pay to cover the tax. We have to  step back here and try to do the right thing.    My friend from Illinois earlier mentioned that there traditionally  were five different community ratings of people of different ages based  on the healthcare costs that they might have, but the ObamaCare bill  said: No, you can only have three ratings. The oldest, sickest, most  likely to use health coverage can't pay more than three times what the  youngest, healthiest people pay, which is another reason, if you are  young and healthy, not to get insurance.   Things that were put into this raised costs for so many people. Then  what happens? Then people say: Well, why is it that we don't have  enough people covered? They say: The real problem with ObamaCare is  that there weren't enough young, healthy people who bought coverage on  their own. It was designed into the plan to make it very unattractive,  if you are young and healthy, to buy coverage because suddenly coverage  for that population was in relationship to all other people  [[Page S1708]]  being covered, higher than it had ever been before.   With the bill the House is debating now, we would restore the  disproportionate share payments to inner-city hospitals, to rural  hospitals, where you have to treat more people who are either on a  government program that doesn't pay very well or more people who don't  have any coverage at all. That was eliminated in ObamaCare.   We now realize that world is a world that doesn't exist, a world in  which everybody who goes to the hospital, everybody who goes to see the  doctor, everybody who seeks healthcare has insurance coverage.   Who takes care of that?   This bill, being debated right now in the House, looks at that again  and says: Let's get back to where we are actually helping those  institutions that are particularly focused on underserved populations,  that are particularly focused on doing that.   We have an opportunity here, basically in three different steps, to  do what needs to be done. The first two steps are critical. One is to  set an end date for the chaotic situation we are in now, to do as much  as we can with budget tools to set a framework for how we move on and  get out of these incredibly devastating budget situations for both the  Federal Government and for families. The second is to let the Secretary  of Health and Human Services, who was confirmed by the Senate just a  few weeks ago, look at the over 1,400 times in ObamaCare where that  Department can create regulations that either make it harder or make it  easier for people to comply with the law. One of the most important  decisions, if you are an insurance company and you are offering a  healthcare product, is deciding what classifies as an acceptable  product, what is the basic criteria you can offer people and still be  offering healthcare insurance. So we are at an important moment.   There is no doubt that the current situation is collapsing, that  healthcare providers are providing healthcare to people who don't have  coverage, who are not protected by programs they were previously  protected by. The people who used to have a lot of choices in  insurance, in many cases, now have only one choice, and it is not a  choice they can afford, and when they do pay for it, they feel like  they are living without insurance at all.   So we are doing what needs to be done. We have to do what we can to  get back to where people can buy the insurance they think meets their  needs, insurance they can afford and enables them to see the doctor  they want to see. A patient-centered system, instead of a government- centered system, is the answer here. We have to get this job done, and  I believe we will.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
