 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member  Rogers for their hard work on this bill.   I have two amendments that have been added into this amendment. The  first puts anticorruption at the core of U.S. foreign policy,  reflecting the Biden administration's declaration that corruption is a  national security threat, and indeed it is.   As the House chair of the bipartisan and bicameral Helsinki  Commission, bipartisan foreign policy to promote human rights and  counter corruption is deeply important to our group and to our Nation.  Corruption is the fuel of human rights abuse, and dictatorship is the  primary means by which dictators and their cronies influence government  and society.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank the large group of bipartisan  colleagues who supported this amendment, many of whom are members of  the Counter-Kleptocracy Caucus. A special thank-you to Representatives  Malinowski and Salazar, whose Combating Global Corruption Act is also  included in the amendment.   The other amendment would require the Secretary of Defense to attempt  to recover the Afghan aircraft that the U.S. provided to the Afghan  Government and were flown out of the country by Afghan pilots fleeing  the Taliban. These aircraft were purchased with U.S. tax dollars and  should be returned to us. They are in Uzbekistan and other countries. I  am sure the Taliban would like to get them back, but they should come  back to the USA.
