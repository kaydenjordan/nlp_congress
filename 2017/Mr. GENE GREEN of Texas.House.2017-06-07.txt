 Mr. Speaker, we have had this competitive  shoot for a number of years, and I have to admit, this year I had a job  fair at home, so I am going to turn it over to my vice chair, Marc  Veasey, who was actually out there. It is a great competition between  the Republicans and the Democrats, but we work together on a lot of  other issues.
