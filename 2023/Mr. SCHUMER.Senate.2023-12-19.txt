 Mr. President, Senate Democrats and Republicans  understand there is more work to do to pass legislation protecting  America's security and the security of the Western World. We have made  important progress. But negotiations have not been easy, and it is  going to take more time.   But no matter how long it takes, we must succeed because the stakes  are high--for America and for our friends in Europe, the Middle East,  and around the world. We must send more aid to Ukraine to defeat  Vladimir Putin. We must help our friends in Israel prevent another  terrorist attack like October 7. We must send critical aid to innocent  civilians in Gaza.   Republicans and Democrats must also continue negotiations on an  agreement for securing our southern border. As the past few weeks have  made abundantly clear, Democrats have always been willing to engage in  good-faith, realistic negotiations about border security. We agree the  border must be fixed, but not at the expense of our values.   Finding common ground on the border has been difficult--in fact, one  of the most difficult issues Congress has faced in a good while. The  details here matter immensely, and this is not a topic that Congress  has tackled at this level in many years. While we have made important  progress over the past week on border security, everyone understands  that we have more work to do, and that it is going to take more time.   Later today, I will meet with colleagues at the weekly Democratic  caucus lunch to give an update on border and supplemental negotiations.   Now, I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for working  without rest on the supplemental package. I also thank staff from both  sides who have been working morning, noon, and night to push us  forward.   Again, we still have more to do. It is not going to be easy, and  everyone understands it is going to take more time to figure this out.  But we must--we must--succeed. Democrats remain committed to working  with our Republican counterparts to reach an agreement.  [[Page S6032]]         Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  consider the following nominations en bloc: Calendar Nos. 188, 198,  202, 236, 262, 288, 292, 328, 335, 338, 416, and Calendar Nos. 449  through 452, and all nominations on the Secretary's desk in the Air  Force, Army, Marine Corps, Navy, and Space Force; that the Senate vote  on the nominations, en bloc, without intervening action or debate; that  the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table;  and that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, for the information of the Senate and the  American people, these are the 11 four-star generals who were not  included in the last approval of the 300-and-some-odd flag officers  whom we did approve last time. So these are the 11 remaining generals  that have just been approved and some other regular nominations that we  usually do through the military. But these 11 flag officers have now  been approved, joining the rest of their colleagues whom we approved a  few week ago. That is good news.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 174.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 311.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 376.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum calls  for the cloture motions filed today, December 19, be waived.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    As in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent the  veto message on S.J. Res. 32, it be considered as having been read,  printed in the Record, and spread in full upon the Journal.    Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that,  notwithstanding rule XXII, the veto message with respect to S.J. Res.  32 be considered at a time to be determined by the majority leader in  concurrence with the Republican leader prior to January 31, 2024; that  there be up to 2 hours for debate equally divided between the two  leaders or their designees; that the Senate then vote on passage of the  joint resolution, the objections of the President to the contrary  notwithstanding.    Mr. President, for the information of Senators, there  will be no further votes tonight. It is our expectation that we will  finish all remaining business tomorrow.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, you, the Senator from Colorado, have  voiced increased optimism in getting a supplemental done, and I agree  with the Senator from Colorado. This won't be easy, but we will keep  working because this is so important to our country and to the world.   I read a statement that Senator McConnell and I issued a few hours  ago, a joint statement regarding supplemental national security  legislation:         Bipartisan border security negotiations are essential to       the Senate's efforts to address critical national security       priorities. Our colleagues are making encouraging progress on       this front.        Challenging issues remain, but we are committed to       addressing needs at the southern border and to helping allies       and partners confront serious threats in Israel, Ukraine and       the Indo-Pacific. The Senate will not let these national       security challenges go unanswered.        As negotiators work through remaining issues, it is our       hope that their efforts will allow the Senate to take swift       action on the national security supplemental early in the new       year.        In the time remaining this year, Senate and administration       negotiators will continue to work in good faith toward       finalizing their agreement.    Now I will move to pass the extension of the reauthorizing of the  FAA. It is critical we extend this funding as so many Americans travel  for the holidays. It is going to give us more time for a long-term  funding measure in the new year, so passing FAA funding tonight is good  news.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 6503, which was received  from the House.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to executive session to consider the following nomination:  Calendar No. 445, John David Russell, of Oklahoma, to be United States  District Judge for the Northern District of  [[Page S6068]]  Oklahoma; that the cloture motion be withdrawn and the Senate vote on  the nomination without intervening action or debate; that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate  resume legislative session.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture  motions filed during yesterday and today's sessions ripen at 5:30 p.m.,  Monday, January 8, 2024, and that the nominations remain in status quo  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXXI, paragraph 6, of the  Standing Rules of the Senate.    Mr. President, before we adjourn, let me inform Senators  that we have no more votes until we return in January. We are going to  be in session tomorrow to do housekeeping business, but there are no  more votes scheduled until January.                            ____________________     I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes  its business today, it stand adjourned until 12 noon on Wednesday,  December 20; that following the prayer and the pledge, the morning hour  be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day,  and the Senate be in a period of morning business for debate only, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each; further,  that following leader remarks, the Senate stand in recess subject to  the call of the Chair.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 9:38 p.m., adjourned until  Wednesday, December 20, 2023, at 12 noon.                            ____________________
