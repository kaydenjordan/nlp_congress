 Madam Speaker, the historic Inflation Reduction Act  lowers everyday costs Americans are struggling to afford by cutting the  price of prescription drugs, by making the largest-ever investment in  climate action, and by reducing inflation--all of this without raising  taxes on middle-class Americans and also paying down the national debt.   For too long, the price of lifesaving prescription drugs has  bankrupted  [[Page H7688]]  American families. No more. This bill caps out-of-pocket drug costs at  $2,000 and allows Medicare finally to directly negotiate the price of  drugs.   Similarly, we must address the increasing costs Americans are bearing  at the hands of climate change. This bill's $369 billion investment in  climate action will unleash a renaissance in clean energy technology,  creating millions of new, high-paying manufacturing jobs, and build the  next generation of American energy and transportation.   Madam Speaker, I support this legislation, and I call upon my  colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to pass this legislation.
