 Mr. Speaker, I join in supporting this resolution. I felt  that we should have had a stronger resolution that censured the  President, H. Res. 490, because the conduct that has been charged is  beneath the Office of the President. He should not disparage people and  suggest they go back to where they were born.   Ms. Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx, and her parents were born in  Puerto Rico. Mr. Trump should know that Puerto Rico is the United  States of America.   From references to Haiti and African countries as ``-hole'' countries  to the ``fine people on both sides'' in Charlottesville with neo-Nazis  and Klansmen there, he has gone out of his way to find opportunities to  besmirch Hispanic Americans, people of Mexican descent, African  Americans, and African countries. This is wrong and beneath the Office  of the President.
