 Mr. Chair, I thank my colleagues for helping me bring  this amendment to the floor.   We now live in a world where technology has become increasingly  important in our personal lives, in our economy, and in our democracy,  but Congress is not adequately prepared to lead on the technical issues  that could have serious effects on our country's future.   The Office of Technology Assessment would provide Congress with  nonpartisan reports and realtime advice on issues that require  leadership from lawmakers, including data privacy, artificial  intelligence, cybersecurity, and others. When it was operating,  lawmakers used the OTA's reports to make decisions that save taxpayer  money, which is why this amendment received bipartisan support in the  past.   Before it was defunded, the OTA advised Congress, for example, on the  importance of interoperability of electronic health records, advice  that, had it been acted on, would have saved billions of dollars and  thousands of lives.   So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and restore the OTA  so Congress, once again, has access to credible and nonpartisan  scientific expertise.
