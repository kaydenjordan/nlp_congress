 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support  of H.R. 3800, the Educational Opportunities and Success Act, the bill  introduced last week by my colleague Representative Warren Davidson of  Ohio.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 3800 seeks to address a common, yet preventable,  issue impacting students from low-income families and first-generation  college students. In recent years, applicants to the Department of  Education's Upward Bound program found themselves stuck in financial  limbo when their grant applications were rejected due to clerical  errors, some errors as insignificant as using the wrong font.   This is unacceptable. I was proud to cosponsor H.R. 3800, a bill that  reauthorizes the TRIO programs for 5 additional years.   I am also proud to work with my colleagues across the aisle to  support this commonsense legislation that eases the administrative  burdens during the application process.   TRIO programs like Upward Bound are critical in ensuring  disadvantaged students have a shot at turning the dream of a college  education into a reality, and H.R. 3800 has my full support.                            ____________________
