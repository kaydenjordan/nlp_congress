 Madam Speaker, over half of the people in my  district in Florida, including myself, were born in another country.  Over 8,000 of those immigrants are DACA recipients who have lived here  for many years, some for decades, and have roots in our community. They  are entrepreneurs, first responders, teachers, community leaders, and  servicemen and -women. They are just as American as any of us.   But today, DACA is at risk, leaving our friends and neighbors  terrified for their future.   DACA recipients contribute billions to our economy, and the economic  consequences for removing our working DACA recipients would be  catastrophic. But more importantly, we would lose valued colleagues,  friends, and local business owners.   Protecting DACA recipients is not just the right thing to do for our  economy. It is the moral thing to do for us and our country.   I urge the Senate to swiftly pass H.R. 6, the Dream and Promise Act,  that we sent them months ago to secure DACA and our country's future.                            ____________________
