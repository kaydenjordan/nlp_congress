 Mr. President, Idaho small businesses are the  backbone of our great State's economy. These small businesses deserve  to be celebrated for their great work in preserving the values unique  to our communities. I am proud to relaunch Support Local Gems, a  statewide initiative, on June 9, to encourage Idahoans to support the  small businesses that make the Gem State special. As a member and  former chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship, I am pleased to honor Fancy Pants in Boise as one of  Idaho's Small Businesses of the Month for June 2023.   Fancy Pants was established in 2006 in the heart of downtown Boise.  Owners Courtney Holden and Jaime Petrilli created a space unlike any  other boutique. Their vision was a shop featuring the best pieces your  favorite brands have to offer, accompanied with styling advice and  shopping assistance.  [[Page S1895]]  From the original 1,200-square-foot store to a now double in size and  space on the corner of 9th and Idaho, Fancy Pants has built an  expansive and loyal customer base for 17 years. Courtney and Jaime  carefully curate inventory tailored to fit the diversity of their  clients' needs and lifestyles, including pieces by A.L.C., Alice +  Olivia, Veronica Beard, Vince, and Rag and Bone.   Fancy Pants is a key member of the small business community of  downtown Boise and a proud supporter of local causes including the  Women's and Children's Alliance of Boise, Dress for Success, and the  Boise Festival of Trees. At the heart of their mission, Courtney and  Jaime strive to make everyone feel confident and comfortable. When you  are at their store, you will discover hand-selected pieces along with  knowledgeable, friendly employees to help you find that perfect pair of  jeans. From casual to fancy or trendy to classic, there is something  for every occasion.   Congratulations to Courtney Holden, Jaime Petrilli, and all of the  employees at Fancy Pants for being selected as an Idaho Small Business  of the Month for June 2023. You are an outstanding example of what it  means to be one of Idaho's Local Gems. You make our great State proud,  and I look forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Idaho small businesses are the  backbone of our economy and our communities.

As a member and former  chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship, I am pleased to honor Perrine Man Press as one of  Idaho's Small Businesses of the Month for June 2023.   Cory and Kenji Paulson started Perrine Man Press out of their home in  2017 and opened a physical storefront on Twin Falls' Maine Avenue in  the fall of 2020. The Paulsons grew up in southern Idaho and have  always been inspired by Idaho's beautiful landscape and way of life,  which Kenji hand draws on their product designs. Their signature  design, the ``Perrine Man'' highlights their hometown's iconic  landmark: the Perrine Bridge.   Perrine Man Press' mission is more than simply selling good tees, but  about ensuring every customer knows they are ``made for more.'' Perrine  Man Press is committed to reminding everyone they are incredibly  valuable and giving back to great causes.

As a member and former  chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship, I am pleased to honor The Only Store located in  Nezperce as one of Idaho's Small Businesses of the Month for June 2023.   Sandi Herker Berry began her grocery store career in 1985, when The  Only Store was known as the Nezperce Cash & Carry. A decade later, in  1996, Sandi bought the store from owner Jim Schmidt and recently  renamed it The Only Store. Sandi loves the grocery business, including  the long hours, restocking shelves, the cleaning, the problem-solving,  the creativity, and, most notably, freight day.   Sandi credits her six employees and the Nezperce community for her  success. To that end, she is committed to supporting her small town  through the Nezperce School District, the Lewis County Fair, donating a  portion of her earnings to emergency medical services, purchasing  school clothes for underprivileged children, and delivering groceries  to elderly members of the community.
