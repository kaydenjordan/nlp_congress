 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of military assistance for Israel and  Ukraine and the Indo-Pacific, all regions in which our Nation has  forged critical strategic alliances. Make no mistake, in a dangerous  world, these precious alliances help secure liberty forward against all  enemies, foreign and domestic.   The largest land war since the Second World War is raging on Europe's  continent at the eastern edge in Ukraine following Russia's initial  brutal invasion in 2014.   The question before us is: What is liberty's worth for our  generation? We are not being asked to fight, but only to aid Ukraine's  valiant soldiers to drive Russia, the third largest military in the  world, out of their homeland.   It is day 617 of that brutal war. Few believed Ukraine could shoulder  this wretched war beyond a few weeks, but Ukraine's will to win  inspires us and subjugated people everywhere.   Over centuries, Ukrainians survived the absolute butchery of Lenin,  Stalin, and now Putin, all tyrannical mass murderers. No place on Earth  lost more lives to mass murder and forced starvation than did Ukraine  during the 20th century, 10 million to 14 million people, only God  knows.   Now is the time to turn a page for liberty in the annals of history.  This GOP's leadership's willful ignorance of the history of Russian  oppression and murder is mind-bending. The necessity for America, the  leader of the free world, to defend liberty, will prevent the blood of  Putin's tyranny running across not just more of Ukraine, but of Europe  and likely other places, including the Middle East.   Putin has refused to condemn Hamas and has gone as far as comparing  Israel's defensive actions to Nazi Germany's seize of Leningrad. In  return, Hamas has called Russia its friend.   They understand these conflicts are connected. Why don't we?   Vote ``no,'' the imperative vote for liberty.
