 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, a country as ours, a constitutional republic, requires a  citizenry that is well-educated and are responsible.   I questioned a colleague of mine from New York about her policies  calling for defunding of the police. The city of New York cut funding  to the city police department by $1.5 billion, but my colleague from  New York said that is not sufficient, we need 100 percent defunding of  the police, while at the same time advocating for people to shoplift if  you are hungry.   My question is: Do you suppose that is okay for the shop owner? Do  you suppose it is okay for our children watching those police? Who does  the shop owner call and how do the police respond with those kinds of  ideas out there? Do you call Antifa? I don't know. I wouldn't.   A civil society needs rule of law. We need policemen who uphold those  laws and are willing to serve to protect the citizens. Our lawmakers  need to preserve the rule of law, not weaken it.   The dangerous policies of the left espouse no police, free this, free  that, free healthcare, it is not your fault. This does not lead to the  utopia they promise.   In reality, this leads to the Hugo Chavez/Nicholas Maduro's  Venezuela, and that is a short period of time. People don't think it  can happen here, but we need our policemen.
