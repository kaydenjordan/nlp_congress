 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of bipartisan  legislation, the Farm and Agricultural Worker Safety Education Act,  which I am proud to introduce with my friend from Texas (Mr. Cuellar).   The coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the need to ensure that we  have a safe and reliable workforce to maintain our food supply. In  order to win the battle with COVID-19, we must guarantee that the most  up-to-date and science-based information is readily available and  accessible for community leaders, educators, and rural businesses.   Our legislation will help guarantee that timely, relevant health and  safety guidelines are reaching our rural workforce and communities by  allowing higher learning institutions to apply for grants to distribute  best practices and safety guidance to help farms, ag workers, and  others who conduct business during this pandemic.   When we think about best practices and safety in the rural areas, we  often think about tractor accidents and how to stop the farmers from  being hurt in grain bin incidents and things of that nature.   We haven't really delved into this idea that we have to look at the  health of our employees, the workers who are in the packing plants, the  folks driving the trucks, the people at the distribution plants, and  the people on the farms.                                time  1015    We have learned during this pandemic that when our health workers and  when our workers on the farms and everything are in trouble, we are in  trouble. We had shortages in our grocery stores of meat products, and  that was not due to any problems having a supply of hogs, for instance.  We had excess supply. But the folks who did the work at the packing  plants were down, and we had disruptions, which led to those types of  shortages.   So to make sure that we ensure our food supply and that we have  everyone in as safe a condition as possible, we want to have these  grants and best practices moving forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join  me in supporting this important initiative that will help ensure the  safety of our farmers in rural communities as we work to keep  rebuilding our economy.                            ____________________
