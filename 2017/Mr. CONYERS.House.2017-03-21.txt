 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in qualified support of H.R. 372, the Competitive  Health Insurance Reform Act, but I do not endorse the majority's  exaggerated claims regarding the bill's impact on the affordability and  availability of health insurance.   H.R. 372 would partially repeal the limited Federal antitrust  exemption for the business of insurance established by the McCarran- Ferguson Act in 1945. Specifically, the bill only permits Federal  antitrust enforcement with regard to the business of health insurance.   Now, House Democrats have long supported a full repeal of McCarran- Ferguson's antitrust exemption for all insurers, not just for health  insurers. In 2010, under a Democratic House majority, we passed  legislation to repeal the McCarran-Ferguson exemption for health  insurers by a vote of 406-19, even though House Republicans had not  previously supported moving any version of a McCarran-Ferguson repeal  bill.   But let me be clear. Enacting H.R. 372 would in no way be a  substitute for the many health insurance guarantees of the Affordable  Care Act. The two things are completely separate. To begin with,  enacting H.R. 372 would not significantly improve healthcare  affordability or coverage. According to the Congressional Budget  Office, H.R. 372's effect on health insurance premiums would probably  be quite small, and enacting the bill would have no significant net  effect on the premiums the private insurers would charge for health or  dental insurance. That is according to the Congressional Budget Office.   The Consumers Union observes that the application of the antitrust  laws to some health insurance activity, by itself, is simply not enough  to create a vibrant insurance market because our long experience shows  you can't expect a healthcare system to run effectively on competition  alone. That is the Consumers Union.   Likewise, the majority's claim that enacting H.R. 372 would create  major new competition by allowing cross-State insurance sales is  unavailing. Current law, including the Affordable Care Act, already  allows States to agree with each other to allow cross-State insurance  sales.   Enabling Federal antitrust agencies to police certain forms of  anticompetitive conduct will not, in and of itself, incentivize health  insurers to offer products across State lines beyond the incentives  that already exist for offering such products. It just won't happen by  itself. Whatever the incentives for health insurers to offer such  products, they have little to do with Federal antitrust law or  enforcement.   Finally, enacting H.R. 372 would not ensure that the Affordable Care  Act's prohibitions against discrimination and limits on premium growth  would remain in place. H.R. 372 only applies to certain anticompetitive  conduct and does not preserve or enhance existing protections for  consumers of health insurance. For instance, it does not prohibit  discrimination by health insurers on the basis of preexisting  conditions, nor does it reduce premium growth or require health  insurers to be accountable for price increases.   Repeal of the antitrust exemption for health insurance is a  complement to and not a replacement for the Affordable Care Act's many  consumer protections. This is not an either-or situation. We need H.R.  372 and the Affordable Care Act to be in place to maximize benefits,  improve quality, and lower costs for consumers.   So while I support the bill with some reluctance, I take issue with  the majority's rhetoric. It is very important that we set the record  straight here.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H2269]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), who is a distinguished  leader of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 18 minutes  remaining. The gentleman from Virginia has 21 minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentleman very much  for his leadership. I acknowledge the chairman of the committee for  his, as well.   I thank the gentleman for yielding to me, and although I will make  the points that I think are important, I wanted to take the time to  thank Mr. Conyers for the thoughtful legislation that he has introduced  over the years.   This leads me to call this the Conyers bill because of the important  contributions it makes to ensuring that our health care is competitive,  our health insurance is competitive, and his thoughtfulness in this  legislation. As it comes to the floor, I am reminded of Mr. Conyers'  influence on this legislation. It is an interesting time at which it  comes, Mr. Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to acknowledge the importance of H.R. 372, the  Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2017, a proposal to remove  the antitrust exemption in the McCarran-Ferguson Act as it applies to  health insurance.   Overall, the proposed legislation, as well as previous attempts by  the Judiciary Committee to repeal the McCarran-Ferguson Act's antitrust  exemption for health insurance, does not raise new or pressing issues.   Opponents of repeal assume problems that cannot be documented, unlike  the very tangible and real economic and competitive costs that will be  incurred if the exemption is allowed to continue.   As the Justice Department has explained, where there is effective  competition, coupled with transparency, in a consumer-friendly  regulatory framework, insurers will compete against each other by  offering plans with lower premiums, reducing copayments, lowering or  eliminating deductibles, lowering annual out-of-pocket maximum costs,  managing care, improving drug coverage, offering desirable benefits,  and making their provider networks more attractive to potential  members.   That sounds, of course, like the Affordable Care Act, which we will  celebrate tomorrow, for that was the day it was signed. That is what  health insurance should be for the American people.   This legislation is a very thoughtful legislative initiative, and I  am hoping that its coming to the floor is not like trying to put  lipstick on a pig. That, of course, is the latest configuration of the  meaningless TrumpCare, and which the amendment that will be coming  forward will, again, in essence, throw people off health insurance. It  will take away all that we are intending it to do, but this legislation  has reason.   Other current enforcement tools and regulatory policies already in  place address competition issues at the State and Federal level to  police health insurance competition. In this and numerous other ways,  effective regulation can promote improved healthcare delivery and  improved cost control by ensuring that all insurance companies are  required to follow certain basic consumer-friendly rules of the road.   Again, wouldn't it be great to have this very thoughtful legislation  with all of the points of the Affordable Care Act: it eliminates  preexisting conditions, has lowered premiums and continues to lower  premiums, and is lowering or eliminating deductibles. All of those were  thoughtful of Mr. Conyers, and they would have been the right  complement to the Affordable Care Act.   However, the additional risks of adding new regulatory uncertainty,  increasing boundary-testing litigation, and distracting policymakers  from more important ways to reduce healthcare costs and improve  healthcare competition suggest that further caution and delay on this  front is inadvisable, given present circumstances and conditions.   But let us not fool ourselves into thinking that the legislation  before us is a panacea that will lead to affordable, accessible, high- quality health care for all Americans. If that worthy goal is the  objective sought, the best way to achieve it is to retain and  strengthen the Affordable Care Act and abandon the misguided effort of  House Republicans to repeal this landmark legislation and replace it  with the pay more for less act masquerading as a healthcare bill.   The Affordable Care Act works. I think we in the Judiciary Committee  know it full well. We held hearings and briefings; we heard from the  victims of those who did not have insurance, who had lost insurance,  did not have enough insurance, or the insurance would not cover them.   I am reminded of a very emotional story of an 8-year-old girl in the  office of an insurance company where her family was begging for  coverage because she had leukemia; obviously, a preexisting condition.  It is sad to say, but I understand that she lost her life.   The Affordable Care Act has significantly improved the availability,  affordability, and quality of health care  [[Page H2271]]  for tens of millions of Americans, including millions who previously  had no health insurance at all.   Americans are rightly frightened by Republican attempts to repeal the  ACA without having in place a superior new plan that maintains  comparable coverages and comparable consumer choices and protections,  not throwing off 24 million Americans who will have no insurance.   It is beyond dispute that the pay more for less plan proposed by  Republicans fails this test miserably. The Republican pay more for less  act is a massive tax cut for the rich, paid for on the backs of  America's most vulnerable: those who work and who happen to be of low  income. This Robin-Hood-in-reverse bill is unprecedented and  breathtaking in its audacity. No bill has ever tried to give so much to  the rich while taking so much from the poor.   One number comes to mind: $880 billion taken away from Medicaid  insurance covering nursing homes, patients, the blind, the disabled;  again, then giving a great plus and a great refund in tax credits to  the richest in America. They will be happy. It won't be health care.  They have got private health insurance. But it certainly will be a big  check that they get in the mail.   This pay more for less bill represents the largest transfer of wealth  from the bottom 99 percent to the top 1 percent in American history.  This Republic scheme gives gigantic tax cuts to the rich, and pays for  it by taking insurance away from 24 million.   In addition, Republicans are giving the pharmaceutical industry a big  tax repeal, worth nearly $25 billion over a decade, without demanding  in return any reduction in the cost of prescription and brand-name  drugs. That is very important.    To paraphrase Winston Churchill, of this bill, it can truly be said  that never has so much been taken from so many to benefit so few.   The pay more for less plan destroys the Medicaid program. CBO  estimates 14 million will lose Medicaid. In 2026, 52 million Americans  will be uninsured.   We know that these combined policies will not help to cure some of  the thoughtful deliberations that went into the underlying bill. We  want more competition. We want the insurance products to be the kind of  products that we can be sure provide health care.   In short, the Republican pay more get less plan represents a clear  and present danger to the financial and health security of American  families and to the very stability of our Nation's healthcare system.   Mr. Speaker, the healthcare marketplace is complex in how it operates  and how it motivates providers, insurers, and consumers.   If I can quote the 45th President, he said: ``I didn't know how  difficult this would be.'' Well, we know how difficult it can be, and  was.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats held some 79-plus hearings. We had 181  witnesses-plus. We had hundreds of hours of hearings. We held  thousands, I might imagine, of townhall meetings. We didn't hold one  here and one there. I myself held 11 townhall meetings.   We continue to hear from not only the consumers, but the rural  hospitals, the major hospitals, the senior citizens, and particularly  those senior citizens on dealing with the cost of prescription drugs.   I am proud to say that we saved the dastardly Medicare part D by  closing the doughnut hole, which is closed today, so that seniors under  the Affordable Care Act do not fall into an abyss, a deep ocean, and  have to, in essence, not take their drugs because they don't have  enough money.   An effective regulatory framework is needed to shape this complex  environment--and this is a word to the administration--to help  safeguard consumers, help keep costs under control, and help make a  full range of healthcare services. But our country's long experience  shows that we cannot expect a healthcare system to run effectively on  market competition alone. Markets can and do fail when proper  regulation is lacking.                                time  1515    So the goodness of this bill has to go along with--a good example is  recognizing what happens in the ACA's provision, banning insurance  companies from denying coverage of preexisting disease--we had to help  them along--preexisting conditions. We had to help them along. You have  to help them along to be a good steward of the insurance that the  American people need.   This is a key consumer protection that the free market demonstrates  time and time again that it could produce and needed to do. That is  where regulation and the antitrust laws come in to protect consumer  choice. Let me go back and say that it could not produce on its own. It  is a per se violation of antitrust laws for competing companies to  agree to divide markets or to fix prices. The other sectors in the  healthcare supply chain are already subject to antitrust laws, and it  will be beneficial to the healthcare marketplace and to consumers if  the healthcare industry joins them. That is why I said this bill is a  thoughtful, important bill to dealing with the complex issues of  insurance and health care.   I am sad to say that tomorrow, as we celebrate the Affordable Care  Act, we will be looking toward Thursday, where we will be, in essence,  debating a bill that takes 24 million people off of health insurance,  period. 24 million will lose their coverage. Tax giveaways will  continue again to the top 1 percent. That will be $600 billion in tax  breaks to the rich and big corporations. In fact, the Republican bill  gives $2.8 billion to 400 of the richest families in America.   Then to add to the downside, the Affordable Care Act was known to  create more jobs. Unfortunately, this will see 2 million jobs destroyed  and lost. Families will be paying more for less. Young people will be  hit with a millennial penalty. And we don't know if this formula that  they have still stops the 50- to 64-year-olds from paying higher  premiums. Women lose comprehensive care, middle-aged Americans pay the  age tax, seniors see Medicaid and Medicare weakened, preexisting  conditions and disabilities may suffer, and it does not reduce the  deficit as the ACA does.   My final point, if I can, we are glad to come to the floor and honor  Mr. Conyers for this important bill and support H.R. 372. I believe  this legislation before us does a lot more good than it does harm, but  I hope that we can, in a bipartisan manner--maybe even in a nonpartisan  manner--reflect on what is needed to really insure the American people  and we can work with the Affordable Care Act, which has all of these  positive elements, and move this country forward through competition  and health care that saves lives.   Mr. Speaker, overall, the proposed legislation, as well as previous  attempts by the Judiciary Committee to repeal the McCarran-Ferguson  Act's antitrust exemption for health insurance, does not raise new or  pressing issues.   Opponents of repeal assume problems that cannot be documented, unlike  the very tangible and real economic and competitive costs that will be  incurred if the exemption is allowed to continue.

Other current enforcement tools and regulatory policies already in  place address competition issues at the state and federal level to  police health insurance competition.   In this and numerous other ways, effective regulation can promote  improved health care delivery and improved cost control, by ensuring  that all insurance companies are required to follow certain basic  consumer-friendly ``rules of the road.''   It might be argued that increasing the federal government's role in  regulating health insurance, through expanded antitrust enforcement,  would appear to conflict with proposed reforms to delegate more  responsibility to state governments.   However, the additional risks of adding new regulatory uncertainty,  increasing boundary-testing litigation, and distracting policymakers  from more important ways to reduce health care costs and improve health  care competition suggest that further caution and delay on this front  is inadvisable given present circumstances and conditions.   But let us not fool ourselves into thinking that the legislation  before us is a panacea that will lead to affordable, accessible, high  quality health care for all Americans.   If that worthy goal is the objective sought, then the best way to  achieve it is to retain and  [[Page H2272]]  strengthen the Affordable Care Act and abandon the misguided effort of  House Republicans to repeal this landmark legislation and replace it  with their Pay More For Less Act, masquerading as the American Health  Care Act.   The Affordable Care Act has significantly improved the availability,  affordability, and quality of health care for tens of millions of  Americans, including millions who previously had no health insurance at  all.   Americans are rightly frightened by Republican attempts to repeal the  ACA without having in place a superior new plan that maintains  comparable coverages and comparable consumer choices and protections.   It is beyond dispute that the ``Pay More For Less'' plan proposed by  House Republicans fails this test miserably.   The Republican ``Pay More For Less Act'' is a massive tax cut for the  wealthy, paid for on the backs of America's most vulnerable, the poor  and working class households.   This ``Robin Hood in reverse'' bill is unprecedented and breathtaking  in its audacity--no bill has ever tried to give so much to the rich  while taking so much from the poor and working class.   This ``Pay More Get Less'' bill represents the largest transfer of  wealth from the bottom 99% to the top 1% in American history.   This Republican scheme gives gigantic tax cuts to the rich, and pays  for it by taking insurance away from 24 million people and raising  costs for the poor and middle class.

To paraphrase Winston Churchill, of this bill, it can truly be said  that ``never has so much been taken from so many to benefit so few.''   The ``Pay More Get Less'' plan destroys the Medicaid program under  the cover of repealing the Affordable Care Act Medicaid expansion.   CBO estimates 14 million Americans will lose Medicaid coverage by  2026 under the Republican plan.   In addition to terminating the ACA Medicaid expansion, the ``Pay More  Get Less'' plan converts Medicaid to a per capita cap that is not  guaranteed to keep pace with health costs starting in 2020.   The combined effect of these policies is to slash $880 billion in  federal Medicaid funding over the next decade.   The cuts get deeper with each passing year, reaching 25% of Medicaid  spending in 2026.   In short, the Republican ``Pay More Get Less Act'' represents a clear  and present danger to the financial and health security of American  families, and to the very stability of our nation's health care system  overall.   Mr. Speaker, the health care marketplace is complex in how it  operates and how it motivates providers, insurers, and consumers.   An effective regulatory framework is needed to shape that complex  environment, to help safeguard consumers, help keep costs under  control, and help make a full range of health care services available.

The other sectors in the health care supply chain are already subject  to the antitrust laws, and it will be beneficial to the health care  marketplace, and to consumers, if the health insurance industry joins  them.   For these reasons, I believe the legislation before us does more good  than harm and, accordingly, I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting H.R. 372.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   In closing, I want to reiterate my support for this measure, H.R.  372. Now, I don't know what is happening on the other side, but many of  its leaders voted against a substantively identical version of this  bill in 2010, and that was including Speaker Ryan, Health and Human  Services Secretary Tom Price, Committee on Ways and Means chairman  Kevin Brady. They voted against a substantively identical version of  this bill. I don't want to impugn motives that I don't know about, but  maybe if you support H.R. 372, you are going to be making the  Affordable Care Act, ACA, better. So I want to thank my friends on the  other side for helping us out. This is great. We passed something like  this a few years ago, and we were very proud that it was an  overwhelming vote.   This is a very important step forward. The Affordable Care Act is not  going to be affected in any kind of negative way, and that is why I am  eager to join with those who are going to be voting for H.R. 372. I  thank my friends on the other side for supporting H.R. 372 as well.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
