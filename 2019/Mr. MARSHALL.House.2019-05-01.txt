 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 6 million Jewish  men, women, and children who were violently murdered for their  religious beliefs by the Nazi regime.   This week remembers the victims who lost their lives to this evil  regime and honors the survivors who beat the unthinkable odds.   Sonia Warshawski, a Kansan from Overland Park, was a young teenager  when Nazi Germany invaded her home in Poland. She was imprisoned,  locked inside a Nazi concentration camp, and then later sent to the  Auschwitz death camp. There, she saw human hatred in a way many of us  today cannot comprehend.   Sonia tells a story of waking up each day suffering from starvation  and seeing thousands of bodies stacked where she was imprisoned. She  watched as her mother was forced into a gas chamber. And still, through  this torture and through it all, she never gave up hope or abandoned  her faith.   Sonia will not forget the hatred and horrific injustice that the  murderous Nazi regime put her and millions of others through in the  name of anti-Semitism and neither will this country.   As the most well-documented genocide in human history, a genocide  documented and confirmed by General Eisenhower, the evil and  unimaginable torture throughout the Holocaust will forever haunt us. We  must never tolerate or overlook anti-Semitism in any form.   In 2017, I had an emotional experience at the Holocaust museum in  Israel with my wife. There, we met and heard from many survivors and  walked through the Hall of Names honoring the 6 million victims of the  Holocaust.   Sadly, we have recently seen the ugly face of anti-Semitism rearing  its ugly head. We must continue to fight it with full force. It should  be made abundantly clear to those with this deep hatred of Jewish  people in their heart that this country has zero tolerance for this  type of evil.   Mr. Speaker, I stand with the survivors like Sonia and those who lost  their lives during the darkest days in the history of our world, and I  stand against anti-Semitism.

In a 6-1 vote, the radical Kansas courts ruled the State's  constitution guarantees unlimited rights to an abortion. This verdict  came in response to a 2015 State law that prohibits performing a  dismemberment abortion procedure in the second trimester, except when  necessary to save the life of the mother. Two doctors who performed  this barbaric and painful procedure in the second trimester of  pregnancy have challenged the law.   As someone who has dedicated my career to bringing life into this  world and has delivered 5,000 babies in my home State of Kansas, please  forgive me and allow me to be graphic for just a moment.   This horrid procedure literally tears the live baby apart limb by  limb in the womb and then evacuates the dismembered baby body parts one  at a time from the uterus. Then the person who performs the procedure  pieces these parts back together to make sure they have removed the  entire baby. This very pain-capable baby literally bleeds to death to  end its life.   Sadly, the method is used today in 95 percent of second trimester  abortions, even though the child's heart is beating and the baby is  breathing and, as I said earlier, is quite capable of feeling pain. It  is despicable, and this procedure should be banned nationwide.   It sickens me to the core that the Kansas Supreme Court violated the  sanctity of life and voted to deny the rights of the unborn in our  State.   Today, I call upon our State legislators to quickly pass a  constitutional amendment that overrules and protects these precious  babies.   Many of us have fought our whole life to defend the unborn. Now, we  must all fight harder than ever. I ask for you to fight alongside me.                            ____________________
