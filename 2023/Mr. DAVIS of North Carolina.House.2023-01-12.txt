 Madam Speaker, I rise on behalf of  eastern North Carolina.   Nearly 100,000 eastern North Carolinians do not have access to  affordable healthcare, placing them in the Medicaid coverage gap.   Madam Speaker, more than a decade after the passage of the Affordable  Care Act, 12 States have declined to expand coverage. This is simply  unacceptable.   That is why one of my first acts as a Member of Congress included  cosponsoring H.R. 31, the COVER Now Act. This bill, introduced by my  good friend, Lloyd Doggett of Texas, is a critical piece of legislation  that would allow local authorities to provide health benefits to  residents of States that have not expanded Medicaid.   Madam Speaker, the hardworking people of eastern North Carolina make  up more than 20 percent of our State, and we must do all that we can to  keep them safe and healthy.                            ____________________
