 Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise  today to pay tribute to the life and legacy of an extraordinary person,  Mrs. Janice Gallagher, who our community tragically lost.   Born in Philadelphia, Janice was a lifelong resident of Bensalem and  was a proud graduate of Archbishop Ryan High School and Holy Family  University.  [[Page H18]]    Janice worked at her family's farm market, D-G's Farm Market, for  over 30 years. Janice went on to own and operate her own market, J&M  Deli and Produce for many more years. Janice spent the last 5 years,  Mr. Speaker, working at the Bensalem Police Department, a phenomenal  organization of tremendously courageous women and men where she was  widely respected by our law enforcement community throughout Bucks  County.   A longtime volunteer of St. Ephrem Catholic Church, Janice will  always be remembered for her kind and giving spirit.   I send my deepest condolences to Janice's beloved husband of 45  years, District Judge Mike Gallagher, her son, her siblings, and all  who knew and loved her. I know I speak for our entire community when I  say that we are all grateful for Janice's contributions during her  incredible 66 years of life on this planet.   Mr. Speaker, may the spirit of her generosity and service continue to  inspire everybody in our community and everybody in this Chamber.                                time  1100                   National Human Trafficking Awareness Day     Mr. Speaker, today is National Human Trafficking  Awareness Day, and I rise in support of the more than 40 million men,  women, and children, who are victims of this global tragedy.   Human trafficking is a $150 billion criminal industry that exploits  vulnerable individuals and strips them of their fundamental human  rights.   Mr. Speaker, while this criminal conduct may seem a world away, it is  very often taking place right in our own backyards. Human trafficking  is reported in cities, suburbs, and rural areas in all 50 States in  this Nation. Last year alone, the National Human Trafficking Hotline  reported 221 cases of human trafficking in my home State of  Pennsylvania and more than 10,000 cases nationwide.   These staggering and horrific numbers underscore the need for  increased victim support services, education and awareness, and  legislative advocacy surrounding human trafficking.   On this National Human Trafficking Awareness Day, let us renew our  commitment to the global fight to end this abhorrent crime against  humanity and redouble our efforts for the millions of survivors and  their victims.                            ____________________
