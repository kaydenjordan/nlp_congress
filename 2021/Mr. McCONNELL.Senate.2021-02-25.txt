 Mr. President, next week, House Democrats say they  will try to recycle failed legislation that would have Washington  Democrats grab unprecedented power over how America conducts its  elections and how American citizens can engage in political speech.   For several years now, we have seen the political left grow less  interested in having normal policy debates within our governing  institutions and more interested in attacking the institutions  themselves to tilt the playing field in their side's favor.   When their side loses a Presidential election, it is not their fault;  it is the electoral college's. When they don't like a Supreme Court's  decision, it is time to threaten the Justices or pack the Court. When  longstanding Senate rules threaten to frustrate far-left proposals, it  is the Senate rules they want to change. And now House Democrats want  to try to use their slim majority to unilaterally rewrite and  nationalize election law itself. They want to use the temporary power  the voters have granted them to try to ensure they will never have to  relinquish it.   This year's version of the House Democrats' legislation contains the  same bad ideas as their efforts 2 years ago. For example, when the  Federal Election Commission was created after Watergate with the  sensitive job of regulating American politics, it was designed to  require bipartisan consensus. House Democrats want to scrap those rules  and turn the FEC from an even-numbered body, bipartisan body, to an  odd-numbered partisan body so Democrats can dominate it. Then they want  to hand the newly partisan FEC new authorities to scrutinize and  regulate an even wider share of political speech and private citizens'  activities. Or take election law itself--House Democrats have looked at  the division and the disunity of the last several months and decided  that what American elections really need is a one-size-fits-all  partisan rewrite by one side here in Washington.   In our country, States and localities run elections. Those of us in  the Federal Government do not get a stranglehold over the ways in which  voters decide our fates. But House Democrats want to change that. Their  bill would take prudential questions about early voting, registration,  and no-excuse absentee balloting and resolve them one way for the  entire Nation. They want to force all 50 States to allow the absurd  practice of ballot harvesting, where paid operatives can show up at  polling places carrying a thick stack of filled-out ballots with other  people's names on them. They want to forbid States from implementing  voter ID or doing simple things like checking their voter rolls against  change-of-address submissions. They want to mandate no-excuse mail-in  balloting as a permanent norm, post-pandemic. And--I promise I am not  making this up--their bill proposes to directly fund political  campaigns with Federal tax dollars. They want to raise money through  new financial penalties, which the government would then use to fund  campaigns and consultants. It is a strange idea. It takes a minute to  kind of wrap your head around it. They want the Federal Government  itself to send money for things like political ads that half the  country disagrees with. What a bizarre concept that nobody is asking  for.   This sweeping Federal takeover would be exactly the wrong response to  the distressing lack of faith in our elections that we have recently  seen from both political sides.   After both 2016 and 2020, we saw significant numbers of Americans on  the losing side express doubt in the validity of the result. As  recently as late last September, fewer than half of Democrats said they  were confident the 2020 election would be free and fair. Just weeks  later, however, by mid-November, once things had gone the way they  wanted, Democrats' confidence in the election magically skyrocketed up  to 90 percent. We cannot keep trending toward a future where Americans'  confidence in elections is purely a function of which side won.   A sweeping power grab by House Democrats, forcibly rewriting 50  States' election laws, would shove us further and faster down that  path. In this country, if the people who win elections want to hold on  to power, they need to perform well, pass sound policies, and earn the  support of the voters again. House Democrats do not get to take their  razor-thin majority, which voters just shrunk, and use it to steamroll  States and localities to try to prevent themselves from losing even  more seats the next time. Protecting democracy cannot be a partisan  issue                            ____________________     Mr. President, on a completely different matter, this  week, the institution of the Senate is losing a talented leader who has  spent 6 years as one of our top officials.   The Secretary of the Senate is a truly unique position in American  Government. She or he is essentially the chief administrative officer  of the institution itself. Back in the 18th century, that meant keeping  the minutes and records and making sure people had ink for their  quills. Today, it means managing a sprawling array of offices packed  with career professionals, everything from parliamentary procedure to  payroll, to public records, to the Senate Library and the page school  and much more. The Secretary also fulfills key institutional functions.  She or he signs every act that we pass. They carry formal messages to  other branches of our government.   It takes major smarts, guts, integrity, and people skills just to  survive in this mammoth job, let alone to actually thrive in it, but  for the last 6 years, Julie Adams hasn't just survived, she hasn't just  personally thrived; she has strengthened the entire institution of the  Senate.   I first met Julie back in 2003 when we hired her to help out our  press team. I was just starting my time as Republican whip. Julie was  new to Washington, but she wasn't new to policy or to politics, and she  knocked everyone's socks off right from the start. She combined  diligence and professionalism with a heart of gold. She mastered her  day job, volunteered for tasks above and beyond, and became the whole  office's favorite teammate.   Of course, nobody is perfect; for example, Julie is not a Kentuckian.  She is a proud daughter of Iowa. But trust me, she has become an  honorary citizen of the Commonwealth many times over.   A few years later, she was stolen away to do important work for First  Lady Laura Bush, but in 2009, we brought her back to coordinate  operations and administration across both my personal office and my  leadership office. She brought great judgment, a quick mind, stellar  instincts, and a meticulous eye to a big job and made us all a whole  lot better. From short-term crises to long-term relationships, Julie  can do it all.   While perpetually juggling 10 tasks for herself, she always found  ways to look after everyone else. She made sure each of her colleagues,  down to the most junior, got the attention and the resources they  needed. Everyone was included. Everyone mattered. She made sure of it.   Her talent and skills made Julie an easy choice for Secretary of the  Senate after we took the majority in 2014. Now, there is always the  potential for sensitivity when a new leader, appointed by a Senate  leader of one party, comes in to oversee huge numbers of dedicated,  long-serving, nonpartisan specialists. Not surprisingly,  [[Page S876]]  Julie rapidly won the admiration, affection, and trust of the men and  women under the Secretary's umbrella. She has championed the  professionals who make this place go. She empowered them. She stuck up  for them and made sure they were properly insulated from political  pressure.   Everyone knows Julie puts this institution and its rules first. Staff  trust her. Senators on both sides trust her. Leaders across other  branches of government trust her. She plays everything down the middle  with total integrity.   And amid all of this, she maintained the generous spirit that  everyone admires. Whether she is delivering official Senate  correspondence to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court or the  Secretary of State or checking in with a Senate employee on a birthday  or during a tough personal time, everyone gets the same friendly  ``hello'' and sincere kindness from Julie Adams.   Alas, it is customary to have a new Secretary of the Senate when  there is a change in party control. Tomorrow is Julie's last day. I am  really, really sorry to say good-bye to such a key player.   So on behalf of the whole Senate, I want to thank Julie's proud  parents, Dr. Harold and Leah Adams; her siblings, John and Jessica; and  her beloved canine companion Maggie for sharing this great friend and  essential colleague with us for many years.   Julie, you made your family proud, you made me proud, and, most  importantly, you have been a great credit to this institution. Thank  you, sincerely, for your service.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
