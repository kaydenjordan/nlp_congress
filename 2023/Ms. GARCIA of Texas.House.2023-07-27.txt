 Mr. Speaker, extreme MAGA Republicans have gone  from Trump's caging children to Abbott's trapping children in the  river.   Razor wire-wrapped barrels in the river, pushing children back into  the river, and denying water during extreme heat are simply acts of  deliberate, inhumane, and horrific torture. It goes beyond politics and  crosses a line into human rights violations.   These buoys by the Governor will not stop migrants from crossing the  Rio Grande. Instead, they will pose a grave threat to Border Patrol  agents and increase the risk of drowning for children, disabled people,  mothers and others.   Mr. Speaker, what if this were one of your own children, your niece  or nephew, or your grandchildren?   Mr. Speaker, how would you respond if you saw your family treated  this way?   Governor Abbott's anti-life actions do not reflect our Texas values.  It is just simply bad and inhumane actions.   Migrants deserve to be treated with dignity and compassion, not by  this relentless dehumanization.                            ____________________
