 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator is recognized.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S645, January 29, 2020, second column, the following  appears:  I send a question to the desk on behalf of myself,  Senator Murkowski, and Senator Romney.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. This is a question for the counsel for the  President:         If President Trump had more than one motive for his alleged       conduct, such as the pursuit of personal political advantage,       rooting out corruption, and the promotion of national       interests, how should the Senate consider more than one       motive in its assessment of article I?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, in response to that  question, there are really two layers to my answer because I would like  to point out first that, even if there was only one motive, the theory  of abuse of power that the House managers have presented, that the  subjective motive alone can become the basis for an impeachable  offense, we believe is constitutionally defective. It is not a  permissible way to frame a claim of an impeachable offense under the  Constitution.   I will put that aside and address the question of mixed motive. If  there were a motive that was of public interest and also of some  personal interest, we think it follows even more clearly that that  cannot possibly be the basis for an impeachable offense. Even the House  managers, as they have framed their case, they have explained--and this  is pointed out in our trial memorandum--that in the House Judiciary  Committee report, they specify that the standard they have to meet is  to show that this is a sham investigation; it is a bogus investigation.  These investigations have--there is not any legitimate public purpose.  That is the language: any ``legitimate public purpose.'' That is the  standard they have set for themselves in being able to make this claim  under their theory of what an abuse of power offense can be.   It is a very demanding standard that they have set for themselves to  meet, and they have even said--they came up, and they talked a lot  about the Bidens. They talked a lot about these issues and 2016  election interference because they were saying there is not even a  scintilla--a scintilla of any evidence of anything worth looking into  there. And that is the standard that they would have to meet, showing  that there is no possible public interest and the President couldn't  have had any smidgeon, even, of a public interest motive because they  recognize that once you get into a mixed-motive situation--if there is  both some personal motive but also a legitimate public interest  motive--it can't possibly be an offense because it would be absurd to  have the Senate trying to consider: Well, was it 48 percent legitimate  interest and 52 percent personal interest or was it the other way, was  it 53 percent and 47 percent? You can't divide it that way.   That is why they recognize that to have even a remotely coherent  theory, the standard they have to set for themselves is establishing  there is no possible public interest at all for these investigations.  And if there is any possibility, if there is something that shows a  possible public interest and the President could have that possible  public interest motive, that destroys their case. So once you are into  mixed-motive  [[Page S646]]  land, it is clear that their case fails. There can't possibly be an  impeachable offense at all.   Think about it. All elected officials, to some extent, have in mind  how their conduct, how their decisions, their policy decisions will  affect the next election. There is always some personal interest in the  electoral outcome of policy decisions, and there is nothing wrong with  that. That is part of representative democracy. And to start saying now  that, well, if you have a part motive that is for your personal  electoral gain that that somehow is going to become an offense, it  doesn't make any sense and it is totally unworkable and it can't be a  basis for removing a President from office.   The bottom line is, once you are into any mixed-motive situation,  once it is established that there is a legitimate public interest that  could justify looking into something, just asking a question about  something, the managers' case fails, and it fails under their own  terms. They recognize that they have to show no possible public  interest. There isn't any legitimate public interest, and they have  totally failed to make that case.   I think we have shown very clearly that both of the things that were  mentioned, 2016 election interference and the Biden-Burisma situation,  are things that raise at least some public interest; there is  something worth looking at there. It has never been investigated in the  Biden situation. Lots of their own witnesses from the State Department  said that on its face it appears to be a conflict of interest. It is at  least worth raising a question about or asking a question about it. And  there is that public interest, and that means their case absolutely  fails.    Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Democratic leader is recognized.    Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator.    I send a question to the desk on behalf of myself and  Senator Murkowski.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question is to counsel for the President:         Witnesses testified before the House that President Trump       consistently expressed the view that Ukraine was a corrupt       country. Before Vice President Biden formally entered the       2020 presidential race in April 2019, did President Trump       ever mention Joe or Hunter Biden in connection with       corruption in Ukraine to former Ukrainian President       Poroshenko or other Ukrainian officials, President Trump's       cabinet members or top aides, or others? If so, what did the       President say to whom and when?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for that  question.   Of course, I think it is important at the outset to frame the answer  by bearing in mind I am limited to what is in the record, and what is  in the record is determined by what the House of Representatives  sought. It was their proceeding. They were the ones who ran it. They  were the ones who called the witnesses. Part of the question refers to  conversations between President Trump and other Cabinet members and  others like that. There is not something in the record on that. It  wasn't thoroughly pursued in the record, so I can't point to something  in the record that shows President Trump, at an earlier time,  mentioning specifically something related to Joe or Hunter Biden.   It is in the record that he spoke to President Poroshenko twice about  corruption in Ukraine, both in June of 2017 and again in September of  2017. But there is other information publicly available and in the  record that I think is important for understanding the timeline and  understanding why it was that the information related to the Bidens and  the Burisma affair came up when it did.   One important piece of information to bear in mind is that from the  tapes we have seen, President Poroshenko was the person who Joe Biden  himself went to to have the prosecutor fired. So as long as President  Poroshenko was still in charge in Ukraine, he was the person who Joe  Biden had spoken to to get the prosecutor, Shokin, fired when,  according to public reports, Shokin was looking into Burisma. As long  as he was still the President in Ukraine, it questioned the utility of  raising an incident in which he was the one who was taking the  direction from Vice President Biden to fire the prosecutor.   When you have an election in April of 2019 and you have a new  President--President Zelensky--who has run on an anti-corruption  platform, and there is a question ``Is he really going to change  things; is there going to be something new in Ukraine?'' it opens up an  opportunity to really start looking at anti-corruption issues and  raising questions.   The other thing to understand in the timeline is that we have heard a  lot about Rudy Giuliani, the President's private lawyer, and what was  he interested in in Ukraine and what was his role? Well, as we know--it  has been made public--Mr. Giuliani, the President's private lawyer, had  been asking a lot of questions in Ukraine dating back to the fall of  2018, and in November 2018, he said publicly he was given some tips  about things to look into.   He gave a dossier to the State Department in March of this year.  Remember, Vice President Biden announced his candidacy in April--April  25. In March, Rudy Giuliani gave documents to the State Department,  including interview notes from interviews he conducted both with Shokin  and with Yuriy Lutsenko, who was also a prosecutor in Ukraine. Those  interview notes are from January 23 and January 25, 2019--so months  before Vice President Biden announced any candidacy--and it goes  through in these interview notes, Shokin explaining that he was removed  at the request of Mr. Joseph Biden, the Vice President. It explains  that he had been investigating Burisma and that Hunter was on the  board, and it raises all of the questions about that.    So it was Mr. Giuliani who had been, as Jane Raskin as counsel for  the President explained the other day--Mr. Giuliani is looking into  what went on in Ukraine: Is there anything related to 2016? Are there  other things related there?   And he is given this information--tips about this--and starts  pursuing that as well. He is digging into that in January of 2019.   We know that Mr. Giuliani is the President's private counsel. I can't  represent specific conversations they had. They would be privileged.  But we do know from testimony that the President said in a May 23 Oval  Office meeting with respect to Ukraine: Talk to Rudy. Rudy knows about  Ukraine. It seems from that that the President gets information from  Mr. Giuliani.   Months before Vice President Biden announced his candidacy, Mr.  Giuliani is looking into this issue, interviewing people, and getting  information about it.   In addition, in March of 2019, articles began to be published. Then  three articles were published by ABC, by the New Yorker, and by the  Washington Post before the July 25 call.   On July 22, 3 days before the call, the Washington Post has an  article specifically about the Bidens and Burisma. That is what makes  it suddenly current, relevant, probably to be in someone's mind.   That is the timeline.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Thank you, Senator.    Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Collins is for the House managers:         The House Judiciary Committee report accompanying the       Articles of Impeachment asserted the President committed       criminal bribery as defined in 18 U.S.C., section 201, and       Honest Services Fraud as defined in 18 U.S.C., section 1346,       but these offenses are not cited in the Articles of       Impeachment. Did the President's actions as alleged in the       Articles of Impeachment constitute violations of these       Federal criminal laws, and if so, why were they not included       in the Articles?    Mr. Manager JEFFRIES. Thank you, Chief Justice, and thank you,  Senator, for your question.   Our article I alleges corrupt abuse of power--corrupt abuse of power  connected to the President's effort to try to cheat in the 2020  election by pressuring Ukraine to target an American citizen, Joe  Biden, solely for personal and political gain and then to solicit  foreign interference in the 2020 election. And the scheme was executed  in a variety of ways.   Now, Professor Dershowitz has indicated, based on his theory of what  is impeachable, that it has to either be a technical criminal  violation, though the weight of constitutional authority says the  contrary, but he said that it should be something that is either a  criminal violation or something akin to a criminal violation--akin to a  criminal violation.   And what we allege in article I falls into that category because what  happened here is that President Trump solicited a thing of value in  exchange for an official act. The thing of value was phony political  dirt in the form of an investigation sought against Joe Biden, his  political opponent, and he asked for it explicitly on that July 25 call  and through his intermediaries repeatedly in the spring, throughout the  summer, into the fall--solicited a thing of value in exchange for two  official acts.   One official act was the release of $391 million in security aid that  was passed by this Senate and by the House on a bipartisan basis, and  the President withheld it without justification. Witnesses said there  was no legitimate public policy reason, no legitimate substantive  reason, no legitimate foreign policy or national security reason for  withholding the aid. It was withheld to solicit foreign interference.   Yes, that is akin to a crime. That is your standard, sir.   The President also solicited that political dirt in exchange for a  second official act: the White House meeting that the Ukrainian leader  desperately wanted--so much so that he mentioned it on the July 25  call, and even when President Trump met with President Zelensky at the  sidelines of the U.N. in late September, the President of Ukraine  brought up the Oval Office meeting again because it was valuable to  him. The President withheld it--withheld that official act--to solicit  foreign interference in the 2020 election.   That is not acceptable in America. That undermines our democracy.  That is a stunning, corrupt abuse of power. And yes, sir, it is akin to  a crime.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from New York.
