 Madam President, I recently read an article published by  a woman who is very credible on the issue of energy, which I would like  to share after the statements recently made by the Republican leader.   The question is whether or not our production of crude oil during  President Biden's Presidency was higher or lower than the Trump  administration. I quote Heather Cox Richardson:         To encourage production, Biden's officials have issued more       permits on federal lands than were issued in the Trump       administration's first three years, at a pace that approaches       [that of] George W. Bush's administration. Only 10% of all       U.S. drilling takes place on federal land, but the Bureau of       Land  [[Page S2986]]       Management confirms that more than 9,000 drilling permits on       public land are currently approved. Not all would be       productive if they were developed, and none of them could       start producing immediately, but this undercuts the argument       that gas prices are high because the Biden administration has       choked off permits.    She goes on to say:         What appears to be driving U.S. gas prices is the pressure       investors are putting on oil companies, whose officers answer       to their investors. Limited production creates higher prices       that are driving record profits. In a March 2022 survey of       141 U.S. oil producers asking them why they were holding back       production, 59 percent said they were under investor       pressure. Only 6 percent blamed ``government regulations''       for their lack of increased production.    Oil companies are seeing huge profits and are using the money for  stock buybacks to raise stock prices. BP, Shell, ExxonMobil, Chevron,  TotalEnergies, Eni, and Equinor will give between $38 and $41 billion  to shareholders through buyback programs this year.   That is a little different picture than was just painted by the  Republican leader.   There is some culpability here when it comes to the oil companies,  and blaming President Biden is ignoring the fact that he has, on  Federal lands, which, as written, account for a percentage of our  production in this country, expanded permits beyond the levels offered  by the previous administration. This is certainly a more complex issue  than was suggested by the Senator from Kentucky.                               Gun Legislation    Mr. President, on another topic, I would say that we have learned a  lot from COVID-19. We have learned that this particular pandemic  targeted, more than ever, those among us who were up in years, the  seniors. They were the most vulnerable to the attack of COVID-19, and  many folks in their senior years were threatened by and some succumbed  to this terrible pandemic. We knew that it was a problem for senior  citizens and still do.   Yesterday, we had a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee that  called to mind the real question before us: What if this pandemic had  targeted our children and babies? What if we knew that the next  pandemic was going to make them particularly vulnerable? Well, I will  tell you, I believe this country--rightly so--would rally behind an  effort to do everything we could to protect our children from this  looming, potential, cause of death.   Mine is only a hypothetical when it comes to pandemics, but it is not  a hypothetical when it comes to the No. 1 cause of death among children  and teenagers in America. The CDC, the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention, just announced within the last 2 weeks that the No. 1 cause  of death is not a pandemic but guns, firearms, gun violence, and gun  deaths.   Yesterday, we held a hearing in the Judiciary Committee on the  leading cause of death for children in America--guns. In 2020--the most  recent year's statistics that are available--more than 4,300 American  babies, children, and teens died from gunfire. During the hearing, we  heard from a chorus of witnesses: healthcare witnesses, law  enforcement, community violence prevention. They agreed on one basic  thing: that gun violence is traumatizing an entire generation of  American youth. Lawmakers in Congress have a responsibility to stem  this tide of violence.   One of the witnesses was a young college student from Northeastern  University in Boston. He actually grew up on the West Side of Chicago.  His name is Ernest Willingham. He isn't 20 years old yet, but his  testimony sounded like the testimony of a person who was wise in years.  He has already experienced one gun-related tragedy after another.   Mr. Willingham told the members of our committee:         I have seen my brother, my father, my cousin and my best       friend become victims of gun violence. . . . This is       something that young people should never have to prepare       themselves for, yet it remains the lived experience of so       many children and youth around our nation.    He continued:         We are better than this as a country, and we can solve this       crisis.    Then he made reference to one basic fact. He said:         Most kids who grew up with me spent more time attending       funerals than weddings.    That is a sobering statement, and it puts into perspective not only  the threat of gun violence and the toll that it has taken but also the  trauma that is visited on so many who are affected by this gun  violence. We think instantly of the families of the victims, but trauma  goes far beyond that; it extends to families of witnesses and to so  many others whose lives are affected.   Two weeks ago, in Chicago, Lurie Children's Hospital convened a group  of young people from gun-infested neighborhoods. They agreed to meet  with me on a private, off-the-record basis. We closed the door, and I  looked at their 20 or 30 faces and said:         Tell me what I need to know as a U.S. Senator about what it       means to grow up in your neighborhood.    I can tell you that there was an outpouring of statements from every  one of them, talking about how guns have become such a sad and tragic  part of their lives and how many of them had either been shot or had  lost a family member or a loved one or a friend to gun violence. And  they talked about the basics.   One young man said:         Senator, we need home training.    I said:         What do you mean by ``home training''?    He said:         We need parents to tell us what is right and wrong, to tell       us what to do. There are no rules. The only rules I find are       the rules of the gang's on the street. I know what their       rules are, but I don't know what the rules are in terms of my       own life.    I think back on my childhood. Rules? Oh, I had plenty of rules, and  most kids do: Clean your plate. Clean your room. Do your homework. Take  out the trash. Walk the dog.   The rules were coming at me all the time. Then I went and attended  Catholic grade schools, and, believe me, they had even more rules to  play by.   The statements by many of these young people were that their lives  were adrift in the earliest stages. Some of it reflects parents who are  facing poverty, who are struggling to make ends meet. Some are working  two jobs just to get enough money to keep food on the table. They can't  be at home and nurturing and guiding these young people as much as they  should because they are struggling from paycheck to paycheck. That is a  reality of poverty in these neighborhoods.   Some families aren't that ``lucky''--and I use that in quotes. Some  are dysfunctional. They have one parent who is a drug addict and  another parent who is inclined toward violence or alcohol, and the  child suffers as a result of it.   The point I am getting to is this: That hearing yesterday on gun  violence highlighted the reality of what life is like for too many kids  in places around America, and it highlighted the importance of doing  something.   We had a doctor there who was the chairman of the American Academy of  Pediatrics. She said that she sent out an email, in preparation for her  testimony, to a number of pediatricians and said:         Can you share with me any personal experiences with kids       who are victims of gun violence?    She received 300 replies, which we put in the record of the Senate  Judiciary Committee's. They were sobering statements by doctors of what  they faced with kids who had either been victims of gun violence or who  had witnessed it and were trauma victims as a result. That was the  reality.   Ernest Willingham, whom I mentioned earlier, talked about what it  meant to have this as an integral part of his life while growing up. He  was one of the lucky ones. He was able to break free from this terrible  experience and really start down the path toward a college education.   We had the chief of police from Phoenix, AZ, Chief Williams, who came  in. She is a 23-year veteran of the police force and is the chief in a  major city. She talked about guns and kids and what they face in her  city, where she just recently had a number of her policemen who were  injured in the line of duty.   She spoke to that and said:         Last night, there was a shooting, and luckily they survived       or I wouldn't be here today.    That is the reality of guns in America.   We focused with her on the guns like AR-15s that are showing up at  these  [[Page S2987]]  shootouts and massacres. The AR-15 is a ``semiautomatic'' weapon, which  means it fires ammunition every time you pull the trigger, but it can  be converted into an automatic weapon, whereby you can hold the  trigger, and it just sprays ammunition at people who are victims.   How many of these exist in the United States today, these AR-15  assault weapons that we are seeing in so many of these massacres and  shootings? We are not sure. It is somewhere between 10 and 20 million-- 10 and 20 million.   I asked the pediatrician what kind of damage is done by these guns,  and she told us: It is devastating.   Some of the stories that are coming back from these mass shootings  now are horrific. I just even hesitate to repeat them, but they have  been reported widely in the news--the damage that is done to these poor  little bodies in the classrooms when these weapons are turned on them.   Now, there is no earthly purpose for such a weapon other than their  use in the military--it isn't used for sport; it isn't used for  hunting; it can't be used for self-defense very effectively--but so  many, millions, are being sold across America.   From my point of view, we should be dealing with that issue directly,  as well as high-capacity magazines that allow these to happen, but,  unfortunately, we can't at this moment. We don't have the political  will to do it in the U.S. Senate--50-50 divided. We do have the will to  take up the framework, which is being worked on at this very moment. It  isn't what I want to see, and it isn't what many of us want to see, but  it is a step forward.   I commend the Senators--the Democrat Chris Murphy and the Republican  John Cornyn--for assembling a group of some 20 Senators, Democrats and  Republicans, who are working on this legislation. It is critically  important that they are successful. I know they are having drafting  challenges--that is common around here--but we have plenty of talented  people, and if the Members, in good will, sit down, they can work out  their differences. I urge them to do so.   Senator Schumer and Senator McConnell publicly support this  undertaking. It is one of the rare bipartisan events in the U.S.  Senate, and it is on the critical issue of gun safety. I hope that by  next week, we can consider this on the floor.                      Nomination of Steven M. Dettelbach    Mr. President, there is another matter that will come before us as  soon as today, and it was a matter that was raised in the Judiciary  Committee this morning.   Today, we can start by discharging from the committee a proven,  battle-tested leader to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms  and Explosives. His name is Steve Dettelbach. The Presiding Officer  knows him well as he served as a member of his staff as a detailee. He  has an exceptional record.   You see, it has been 7 years since there has been a Senate-confirmed  Director at ATF, and at a moment when guns are killing our kids at a  devastating rate, this office cannot remain vacant any longer--7 years.   How many times have you heard the statement: ``We don't need any gun  laws. We just need to enforce the laws that are already on the books''?  Well, one of the Agencies that have major jurisdiction is Alcohol,  Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.   It is no coincidence since it has been 7 years since there has been a  person in charge of that Agency. You need someone to guide the Agency  to enforce the laws to keep our streets safe. That is very basic.   Well, we made a gesture toward that this morning in the Senate  Judiciary Committee. Today, we voted for discharge. The Senate will  take a critical step toward confirming Mr. Dettelbach. He is the kind  of leader our Nation needs to get a handle on the crisis of gun  violence. Later today, we will have a vote on the floor here. I hope we  can get bipartisan support for Mr. Dettelbach.   Members of law enforcement, mayors across America, and former Federal  prosecutors all agree that it is time that this man, Steve Dettelbach,  become the Director of the ATF. More than 140 former Justice Department  officials, including multiple Trump administration appointees, have  stepped forward to voice their support for Mr. Dettelbach's nomination.  The Judiciary Committee has also received letters of support from  multiple former Directors and Acting Directors of the ATF.         It is no surprise. As a career prosecutor, Mr. Dettelbach       has devoted decades of his life to working alongside law       enforcement, including ATF agents, to combat gang violence,       gun crimes, and hate crimes. In every role he has held, Mr.       Dettelbach has been squarely focused on protecting the lives       of law enforcement officers and the families they serve.    In his own words:         Politics can play no role in law enforcement.    He has earned the trust of an amazing list of law enforcement  organizations. Listen to the groups that support his taking on this  job: The National Sheriffs' Association, the International Association  of Chiefs of Police, the Major County Sheriffs of America, the National  Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, the Federal Law  Enforcement Officers Association, Women in Federal Law Enforcement, the  Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association, and many, many  more.   When a mass shooter tears apart a community like Buffalo, NY, or  Uvalde, TX, ATF agents are among the first Federal officers to respond.  Let us not wait a minute longer in providing these heroic agents the  leader they deserve. Yes, let's enforce the laws that are on the books.  Let's put together the leadership of the ATF to make certain that is  done.   I hope my colleagues will join me in voting for Steve Dettelbach's  confirmation on the floor of the Senate today. It is timely, it is  important, and it is long overdue.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    I announce that the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) is  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, this work period, the Senate will continue  to confirm highly qualified, diverse nominees to the Federal judiciary.   First on the list is Judge Ana Isabel de Alba, who has been nominated  to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California.   A San Joaquin Valley native, Judge de Alba has served as a Superior  Court Judge for Fresno County, CA, since 2018. She has presided over  thousands of hearings and more than seven bench trials before the  court's Criminal Misdemeanor Division, the Juvenile Justice Division,  and the Environmental Quality Act Panel.   Prior to her judicial service, Judge de Alba practiced for 11 years  at a Fresno-area law firm, where she became partner in just 5 years and  specialized in business, employment, construction, and personal injury  law. In addition to her expansive litigation practice before California  State courts, Judge de Alba handled many administrative law trials  before a State agency as well as a Federal jury trial.   Judge de Alba earned her B.A. with highest honors and her J.D. from  the University of California at Berkeley.   The American Bar Association has unanimously rated Judge de Alba as  ``Qualified'' to serve on the Eastern District of California, and she  also has received the strong support of her home State Senators, Mrs.  Feinstein and Mr. Padilla.   With her record of fair-minded judicial service and years of  litigation experience, Judge de Alba will serve her home district well  as a Federal district court judge.                            ____________________     I announce that the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Warnock) is  necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need for  the Senate to act to protect Federal judges.   In the past few years, the growing use of political violence has  endangered elected officials, police officers, flight attendants,  school board members, election workers, and judges. We all must condemn  all violence and threats of violence against public officials in the  strongest possible terms, regardless of whether it comes from the right  or the left.   Last week, news broke that an armed man was arrested near the home of  Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. This man made it clear to law  enforcement that he desired to kill Justice Kavanaugh. Importantly,  court documents showed that the gunman outside Justice Kavanaugh's home  said he found the address online.   This week, the House approved a bill that unanimously passed the  Senate  [[Page S2994]]  last month and would give the Supreme Court Police greater discretion  to protect the Justices' families. I am glad that this important  legislation is headed to President Biden's desk.   But it has been over 6 months since the Judiciary Committee  unanimously reported the Daniel Anderl Judicial Security and Privacy  Act. This bill was first introduced by Senators Menendez and Booker in  response to a tragic incident in which a disgruntled litigant found the  home address of Judge Esther Salas on the internet, went to her house,  and shot and killed her son.   The bill is directly responsive to the threats that Federal judges  face, including the threat to Justice Kavanaugh. It would allow judges  to safeguard their personal information from being posted on the  internet and would empower the judiciary to monitor online threats. We  have tried to pass this bill in the past, and it has been blocked by at  least one Republican Senator. The bill's sponsors have negotiated  changes to address these concerns, and I am hopeful that Republican  objection will be lifted today.   The threat to Justice Kavanaugh and the tragic death of Daniel Anderl  underscore the need to pass this bipartisan bill quickly and get it  signed into law so we can protect all Federal judges and their  families.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the  following letter in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       To the Secretary of the Senate:        PN1975, the nomination of Steven M. Dettelbach, of Ohio, to       be Director, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and       Explosives, having been referred to the Committee on the       Judiciary, the Committee, with a quorum present, has voted on       the nomination as follows--        (1) on the question of reporting the nomination favorably       with the recommendation that the nomination be confirmed, 11       ayes to 11 noes; and        In accordance with section 3, paragraph (1)(A) of S. Res.       27 of the 117th Congress, I hereby give notice that the       Committee has not reported the nomination because of a tie       vote, and ask that this notice be printed in the Record       pursuant to the resolution.

Congress finds the following:        (1) Decisions by the United States Patent and Trademark       Office relating to patents may implicate, or have relevance       to, information housed at or involving other Federal       agencies.        (2) Entities submitting patent applications to the United       States Patent and Trademark Office may also submit       information to, or share information with, other Federal       agencies, necessitating accuracy and consistency in those       representations.        (3) Research has shown that patent examiners may benefit       from additional information that is housed at, or is       available to, Federal agencies other than the United States       Patent and Trademark Office in order to assess prior art and       the state of science and technology.        (4) The Under Secretary of Commerce for Intellectual       Property and Director of the United States Patent and       Trademark Office is encouraged to work with other Federal       agencies.
