 Mr. Speaker, our Democratic colleagues have spent the  last few months claiming there was clear criminal conduct from the  President, but they don't specifically cite the crime in their Articles  of Impeachment, which we are voting on tomorrow.   The Intelligence Committee chairman, Mr. Schiff, said there was clear  extortion, but extortion is not a direct crime they are accusing the  President of in the articles tomorrow.   The Speaker herself has decided to use the term ``bribery'' over the  last few weeks, but that is not explicitly cited in the articles  either.   It seems like my colleagues across the aisle may have pulled back in  accusing the President of bribery in the last week, realizing they  couldn't enforce it.   So what is it then? Collusion, quid pro quo, or just some vague  catchall charge, which is what we are seeing.   It is clear the American people are not in favor of this impeachment.  Polling shows that they are moving against that.   But what about polling? Indeed, Democrats know this isn't going to  stick. This is going to be a problem for them, especially for those in  the moderate districts.   Let's get back to work and do what needs to be done around here.                            ____________________
