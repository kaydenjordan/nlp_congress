 Mr. Speaker, President Trump, along with his Republican  choir here in Congress, is sabotaging your healthcare.   First, his administration put hurdles to enrollment by slashing  outreach for insurance signup efforts, and then he just announced he  was slashing navigator funding. Now the administration cut off key  payments to insurers that helped stabilize insurance markets.   This Republican Congress repealed the requirement that everyone have  insurance, which puts further strains on costs in the healthcare  system. Meanwhile, Republicans in States across our Union are urging  Federal courts to rule health protections for 130 million people with  preexisting conditions unconstitutional.   Ohioans are staring down an 8 percent increase in premiums for 2019,  and what is the Trump administration doing? Sabotaging people's  healthcare.   His Supreme Court nominee has now questioned the constitutionality of  key elements of coverage in the Affordable Care Act.   There are bipartisan solutions to help Americans facing the daunting  task of paying rising healthcare costs. This Congress must choose  people over the profits of big pharmaceutical insurance companies.  Human lives hang in the balance.                            ____________________
