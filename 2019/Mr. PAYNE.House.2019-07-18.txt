 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Phil Freelon, who  passed away on July 9 at his home in Durham, North Carolina.   While attending Central High School in Philadelphia, he was drawn to  art and the technique of designing and building. He was one of two  Black architect students at North Carolina State University's College  of Design, where he had a passion for increasing diversity within his  profession.   One of his major contributions to our Nation was the building of the  National Museum of African American History and Culture.   Mr. Speaker, we mourn the passing of Mr. Freelon, but his legacy and  passion lives on to educate and empower the next generation of  architects.                            ____________________
