 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 151, the Pallone-Thune  TRACED Act. As you heard, it is a great step forward this Congress will  take to help curb illegal robocalls.   I want to thank Chairman Pallone, Chairman Doyle, and my colleague,  Mr. Latta, for their great bipartisan work on this; and, of course, our  colleagues in the Senate again.   Last year RAY BAUM'S Act passed unanimously out of this Chamber with  bipartisan support, and that included provisions that targeted  fraudulent robocalls and spoofing from overseas. Those provisions are  in law and are being used today.   Today the TRACED Act builds on that bipartisan success by better  enabling consumers, carriers, law enforcement, and the Federal  Communications Commission to target these scammers. While this Chamber  has not made a lot of progress this year on legislating, I am pleased  to see bipartisan legislation before us today that addresses a  challenge that affects nearly every American, and that is illegal  robocalls.   Last month alone, Mr. Speaker, in my district in the area code of 541  we got 14.1 million robocalls, just last month; and that is just in one  part of Oregon. We know last year it was something in the order of over  50 billion illegal robocalls that came into America. I got one today  already, and I imagine speaking here I will get five more. I will get  targeted or something. It is time to put consumers back in charge of  their phones, and that is exactly what this legislation does.                                time  1300    It allows carriers and consumers to use new, innovative call-blocking  and call-authentication tools. We can strike the right balance between  allowing important calls to get through while making sure illegal  robocalls are blocked, all at no additional cost to the consumer.   This means when you receive a call from an unfamiliar number with a  familiar area code, you should be confident that there is a legitimate  reason for that call. That means your pharmacist can still  automatically call you to say prescriptions are ready for pickup if you  signed up for those notifications. That means vulnerable populations  can be better protected from scams trying to steal their hard-earned  savings. We have all read those stories.   When these illegal robocallers get caught, we need to ensure they are  prosecuted. This legislation takes steps to improve our traceback  efforts and provides the Department of Justice additional tools they  need to go after bad actors.   We all get these calls. I got one about a year or so ago, Mr.  Speaker, and it was out of Greece. I don't know anybody in Greece. It  was a 02 something or other area code. I let it go to voicemail, and by  golly, they left a message. A day later, I listened to it. It was the  Vice President of the United States aboard Air Force Two trying to  reach me. Sometimes you should answer those calls.   With this legislation, hopefully, we will know with certainty you can  answer a call like that, and it will be somebody that is trying to  reach you for real.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Latta), the top Republican on the Communications and Technology  Subcommittee and a real leader in this effort.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie), the top Republican on the Oversight and  Investigations Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Olson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Johnson), who brings an incredible amount of background and  technology to the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Flores), another great Texan who needs to speak on this matter.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from the  great State of Washington (Mrs. Rodgers), the top Republican on the  Digital Commerce and Consumer Protection Subcommittee of the Energy and  Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Carter), the only pharmacist in the United States House of  Representatives.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Montana (Mr. Gianforte).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Kinzinger).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Again, I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for  working together to get this done. Our constituents deserve this. We  deserve this.   Over 50 billion illegal robocalls--we are not talking about the kinds  you sign up for to give you notices when your prescriptions are ready  for something else; we are talking about illegal scammers, often state- backed enterprises overseas, coming into our wallets, coming into our  bank accounts, coming into our homes, coming into our offices, and  coming into our cell phones.   Now, let's be clear: While this legislation will make a difference,  the scammers are going to try and do an end around whatever technology  the carriers use to try and block these calls, authenticate these  calls, stop these calls; so we have, in this legislation, additional  requirements for reporting back to Congress on other steps that need to  be taken, especially when it comes to our healthcare system and our  hospitals. That will be something the committee needs to continue to  look at.   But I think building a better bridge between the Department of  Justice and the Federal Communications Commission so they can go after  the bad actors and really nail them is a good thing in this bill, and  extending out to 4 years the statute of limitations is a good thing so  bad actors don't get to run the clock and get away with their crimes.   This is good legislation; it will make a difference; and we will  continue to fight this fight.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I, too, want to thank our terrific staff,  some of whom, by the way, have worked on this long enough they have  gone on to other pursuits, including Robin Colwell and Tim Kurth, who  is still with us but in a different role than when he started on this,  Kristine Hackman, Kate O'Connor, Evan Viau, Rachel Rathore.   And on the majority side, Alex and Jerry and AJ and Dan and Parul and  Phil, a thank-you for their great work on this, as well. We really  appreciate it.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage our colleagues to vote for this bill. Let's  get it to President Trump's desk. He will sign it, and we are going to  help our consumers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
