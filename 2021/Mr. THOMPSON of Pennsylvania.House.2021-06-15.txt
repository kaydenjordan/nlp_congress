 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  June as National Dairy Month.   National Dairy Month began as National Milk Month in 1937. Now it has  developed into an annual tradition that celebrates the contributions  the dairy industry has made to the world.   Milk contains nine essential nutrients which may help reduce your  risk of high blood pressure, osteoporosis, and certain cancers; yet  dairy products, particularly milk, continue to be unfairly demonized.   Coming from a long line of dairy farmers, I understand the impact  that this decrease in milk consumption has caused. Not only does it  hurt our dairy industry, but it has also resulted in the loss of an  entire generation of milk drinkers, which has negatively impacted their  health.   That is why I introduced the Whole Milk For Healthy Kids Act in March  of this year with the gentleman from New York, Mr. Antonio Delgado.  This bill addresses the importance of providing both flavored and  unflavored whole milk in school cafeterias.   This builds upon the efforts from the School Milk Nutrition Act,  which allows for flavored and unflavored 1 percent milk to return as an  option for the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs.   Last month, Mr.   Joe Courtney and I led a bipartisan coalition of 55  Members of Congress from across the country in writing a letter to  Secretary Vilsack of the USDA. This letter urged him to codify the  efforts to continue to provide schools the option to offer low-fat  flavored or unflavored milk.   Whether it is protein to help build and repair the muscle tissues of  active bodies or vitamin A to help maintain healthy skin, dairy  products are a natural nutrient powerhouse.   That is why, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sign on to my bill,  the Whole Milk For Healthy Kids Act, during National Dairy Month and  allow our students the option of consuming the type of milk that they  love.   And this month, when you pour a glass of milk, enjoy a cheese board,  or cool down with some ice cream, remember the hardworking dairy  farmers and farm families who made that possible.                            ____________________
