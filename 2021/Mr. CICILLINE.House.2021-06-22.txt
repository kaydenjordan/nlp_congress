 Mr. Speaker, everyone--regardless of their financial  situation--should be able to fully and fairly defend themselves in  court.   Unfortunately, however, many defendants who live very far away from  the court trying their case cannot afford to get to and from their  court appearances to defend themselves. The costs can be simply  insurmountable.   This situation often makes poverty the difference between winning and  losing a case, regardless of the facts.   That is not justice.   This bill helps make courtroom justice available to everyone by  ensuring that travel and lodging costs are covered for low-income  defendants.   This will help ensure justice for all defendants, not just those  wealthy enough to afford it.   This bill also makes courtrooms more effective. It allows magistrate  judges to rule on certain post-judgment issues that they previously  could not adjudicate on cases that they handled at the trial level.   This is common sense. If a case has been with a judge through the  entirety of the trial, that judge knows the case best and should be  able to handle post-conviction issues.   As a former litigator, I believe this bill will help ensure that  justice prevails and make our overburdened court system more efficient,  and I thank Congressman Jeffries for introducing this important  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, reports estimate that as many as 1 in 10  elders are abused every year, but less than half of these incidents are  actually reported, and the COVID pandemic has left seniors isolated and  more vulnerable to fraud and abuse.   All over, we are seeing scammers deceive a grandparent that their  grandchild is in trouble and needs money.   We see imposters pose as IRS agents to trick an elder into paying  money they do not owe.   We see fraudsters offer tech support assistance and collect money for  fraudulent services.   We must hold these criminals accountable for taking advantage of and  abusing our seniors.   Protecting and caring for our loved ones--who once supported and  cared for us--is one of our most honorable responsibilities.   The Elder Abuse and Protection Act promotes justice for vulnerable  seniors by making the Elder Justice Initiative a permanent office  within the Department of Justice, which works to combat elder abuse,  neglect, and financial fraud and scams that target our nation's  seniors.   I thank Congresswoman Garcia for introducing this important  legislation to protect our seniors, and I am proud to be a cosponsor  and support it today.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, our prison systems are ideally meant to rehabilitate,  but all too often, they do exactly the opposite. They are frequently  home to widespread, horrible abuse, including physical and sexual  violence and unsanitary living conditions.   It is unacceptable to subject any person to such conditions--but,  particularly, our youth to this kind of mistreatment. Our system makes  it incredibly difficult for young people to  [[Page H2961]]  file a legal complaint with huge burdens imposed if they want to file a  lawsuit, and major barriers to legal representation.   Mr. Speaker, I was a public defender here in Washington, D.C., at the  start of my career, and I am certain that this is no way to treat  children that we are trying to rehabilitate and prepare for society and  prepare for success in their communities.   These circumstances only make it more difficult for young people and  children and, in fact, they keep them in abusive and delinquency  cycles.   This legislation, however, will remove some of those barriers for  incarcerated juveniles to take their abusers to court and to seek  remedies for mistreatment by their correctional institutions. This bill  will take us one step closer to desperately needed reform in our  criminal justice system and will help to protect our incarcerated  youth.   Mr. Speaker, I really thank and applaud Congresswoman Scanlon for  this important and bipartisan legislation, and it is my honor to  support it today.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York, the  chair of the Judiciary Committee, for bringing this bill to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2571, the Advancing Mutual  Interests and Growing Our Success Act, or the AMIGOS Act.   The AMIGOS Act is a bipartisan bill that I introduced along with my  colleagues Mr. Costa, Mr. Keating, Mr. Valadao, and Mr. Khanna to  encourage greater investment and trade between the United States and  Portugal.   H.R. 2571 makes Portuguese nationals eligible for E-1 and E-2  nonimmigrant investor visas. Extending visas to Portugal not only gives  Portuguese businesses an opportunity to invest in the United States,  but it is a mutually beneficial relationship that promotes jobs in both  countries and growth in United States businesses and our economy.   The United States has no better friend than the country of Portugal.  As one of the first countries to recognize the United States after the  Revolutionary War, Portugal is one of our closest economic partners and  strongest allies. Today, the United States maintains that longstanding  relationship as the fifth-largest export market for Portugal and its  largest trading partner outside of the European Union.   I am proud to represent the First District of Rhode Island, home to  one of the country's largest and most vibrant Portuguese communities, a  community that has made outstanding contributions in the arts, culture,  business, and public service in this country for many decades.   The United States is Portugal's largest trading partner outside the  European Union, with bilateral trade reaching $6.6 billion in 2019.  There are currently over 130 American companies operating in Portugal  in a wide range of economic sectors, including pharmaceutical,  chemical, technology, banking, and health sectors.   In 2019, the United States' direct investment position in Portugal  was $2.3 billion, an increase of 6 percent from 2018. The direct  investment position from Portugal in the United States, however,  experienced a 1 percent decrease to $1.4 billion from 2018 to 2019.   Portugal is one of only five EU countries whose citizens are not  currently eligible for E-1 or E-2 visas. In the absence of a bilateral  treaty, which Portugal cannot enter due to the rules of the European  Union, Congress has the power to authorize E-1 and E-2 visa benefits to  other countries. We have exercised our authority to do so for both  Israel in 2012 and New Zealand in 2018.   I am proud to lead this effort to support our ally and friend,  Portugal. I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 2571, the AMIGOS  Act, and I again thank Mr. Nadler for bringing the bill to the floor.    Madam Speaker, to Mr. Roy, I look forward to our  debate tomorrow and I think a good resolution on a number of important  issues before the committee.   Madam Speaker, I rise this evening to honor Pride Month.   I want to begin by saying that we are grateful to the members of the  Congressional LGBTQ-plus Equality Caucus, who continue to be champions  for full equality for our community.   Each year, we gather as a community in June to celebrate the progress  that our community has made, that is the LGBTQ-plus community, and also  to reflect on the work ahead and how much remains to be done. It is an  opportunity each year to really celebrate the progress we have made and  recommit ourselves to the work that remains. This year is no different.   In 2021, we come together on the floor of this House to celebrate  Pride Month with some very great highs and some very deep lows. Our  community was deeply impacted by COVID, both because preexisting  conditions added to people's vulnerabilities, but also because segments  of our population already face isolation, which was made even worse  during the pandemic.    Like all communities, we have been shocked at the efforts to  undermine our democracy and restrict the right to vote, restrictions  that we know will impact our community, particularly people of color,  trans people, and those with disabilities.   Of course, this year alone we witnessed a historic number of anti- transgender laws being introduced around the country, many of them  passing. Opponents of equality have decided to zero in on the most  vulnerable within our community, the community that is subject to the  greatest amount of violence and the worst kind of discrimination, and  we must stand up in force against this.   But it wouldn't be Pride Month without a celebration, and we have  much to celebrate this year.   In the last 6 months, Congress passed the NO HATE Act, which  strengthens hate crimes reporting; we passed the Pulse Night Club  Memorial bill. Now the Senate has passed it, and it goes to the  President's desk for his signature.   In February, I proudly introduced H.R. 5, the Equality Act, with 224  original cosponsors. It passed the House with bipartisan support.  President Biden has challenged Congress to do everything in its power  to get him the bill, get it to his desk for his signature.   We are rolling up our sleeves to get the bill passed in the Senate. I  am particularly proud that the House of Representatives did its part in  passing this critical piece of legislation.   No American should be forced to live in fear of legal discrimination  simply because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, and they  certainly shouldn't have to worry about whether or not the person in  the White House or the State legislature will undermine what few  protections they do have.   The Equality Act is a commonsense piece of legislation that gets to  the core issue of equality by expanding the Civil Rights Act of 1964,  and other existing laws, to ensure that LGBTQ Americans can live their  lives free from discrimination.   Equality is a founding principle of this great country, and I hope  that by the time I stand before you for Pride Month next year, we will  have turned this bill from a hope into a reality.   I am very proud to have the support of so many Members of Congress  and so many colleagues. In fact, every single Democrat is an original  cosponsor of the Equality Act, including, of course, you, Madam  Speaker.   So I am proud to be a part of a caucus that understands the  fundamental importance of recognizing the dignity and value of every  person, and Pride Month is about expressing that and affirming that to  all LGBTQ-plus people all across this country and all across the world.   Tonight, I am proud to have one of the co-chairs of the Equality  Caucus, Mark Takano, Chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, a  member of the LGBTQ community, a very close friend, a deeply respected  colleague, and a great champion for the equality of our community.   I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano) to share his  views on the celebration of Pride.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Takano for his powerful  words.   Now, Madam Speaker, I am honored to yield to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Green), who has been a longstanding member of the Equality Caucus  and who has always encouraged the celebration of Pride. For the last 8  years, he has led the resolution in the House marking June as LGBTQ  Pride Month. I want to thank him again and his office for his efforts,  and I thank him for being with us this evening.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his very  eloquent words.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms.  Adams), a tireless advocate for women and historically Black colleges  and universities, a member of the LGBTQ Equality Caucus, and an  original cosponsor of the Equality Act.    Madam Speaker, I thank my friend for her eloquent  words and for being part of our Pride celebration here tonight.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Newman),  my new colleague who has been such an extraordinary, relentless  advocate for our community. I know she does it on behalf of her child  but also for children all across America.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for being part  of this Pride Special Order and for her incredible advocacy on behalf  of our community, particularly her heroic work on behalf of the  transgender community. It is making a real difference.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  Auchincloss), a new colleague and someone who has been an extraordinary  advocate for the LGBT community, a great ally for our caucus. He is a  member of the LGBTQ-plus Equality Caucus, an original cosponsor of the  Equality Act, and a really powerful voice in our fight for equality.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for participating  in our Special Order and for being such a great ally to our community.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson  Lee), a distinguished senior member of the Judiciary Committee, someone  who has long been a champion of justice and equality, a great ally to  the LGBTQ community, an original cosponsor of the Equality Act, and a  member of the LGBTQ Equality Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her really  eloquent words and for being such a good ally for our community for so  long.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania (Ms.  Scanlon), an education and voting rights advocate, an original  cosponsor of the Equality Act, vice-chair of the Equality Caucus here  in the House, and an extraordinary champion for our community.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for being part  of this Special Order hour tonight.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Jacobs), a colleague on the Foreign Affairs Committee, someone who has  dedicated her work, even before she got to Congress, to ending  childhood poverty to the promotion of human rights and equality. She is  an original cosponsor of the Equality Act, a member of the LGBTQ  Equality Caucus, and a great advocate for our community. We are  delighted she is with us this evening.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for being part  of this Special Order hour and for her great support of the LGBTQ-plus  community.   Madam Speaker, before I end, I just want to recognize Annise Parker.  I also want recognize Barney Frank, Jared Polis, our former colleagues  who have served in this House. And now Governor Polis is the Governor  of Colorado. Tammy Baldwin and Kyrsten Sinema in the United States  Senate. Sean Patrick Maloney, Mark Pocan, Angie Craig, Sharice Davids,  Mark Takano, Chris Pappas, Mondaire Jones, and Ritchie Torres, who are  current Members of Congress. There are nine LGBTQ Members in the House  and two in the Senate. So 11 Members in total.   And part of the reason we celebrate Pride is to send a message to the  entire community, but especially to young people who may be struggling  with their sexual orientation or their gender identity. Pride is a  moment for us to say: You are valued. We celebrate you. We honor you.  You have a right like every other American to be treated with dignity  and respect. You are hearing that from the floor of the United States  House of Representatives, where nine Members of our community serve  openly and honestly, and two Members in the Senate.   Let that be a message to every young person, every family struggling  with the issues of sexual orientation or gender identity, that they are  heard, they are valued, they are affirmed and respected.   Happy Pride Month.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
