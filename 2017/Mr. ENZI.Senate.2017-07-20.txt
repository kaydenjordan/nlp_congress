 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for a few  minutes as in morning business.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, my colleagues and I have been on this floor  for the last 7 years talking about the problems with ObamaCare and the  need to address them.   In the early days, when ObamaCare was still being cobbled together,  we talked about individuals losing their coverage. Promises were made  that if you liked the plan you had, you could keep it. That turned out  to be a broken promise.   In 2009 and 2010, we talked about premiums skyrocketing. Today, we  are still talking about it. Premiums are more than 100 percent higher  in Wyoming today than they were when the law was passed. Our insurer  has fortunately been more conservative in their approach. So premiums  didn't spike the way they did in other States.   I usually enjoy being right, but in this case, I am very sad to have  watched the worst possible scenario play out. Time after time,  President Obama was faced with problems in implementation and in  outcomes, and he would dismiss them by saying: ``It just needs more  time,'' or, as this cartoon shows, ``it just needs a tune up.''   We and the American people gave it time and money--specifically, 7  years and hundreds of billions of dollars. We are now left trying to  pick up the pieces of health insurance markets all across the country.   You can see here that this ambulance is ObamaCare. Behind it is its  engine and other key components, and they have completely fallen apart.  That is the private insurance market today. The part you don't see here  is that there is a patient in the back of this ambulance. This isn't  just about politics. This is about real people and whether they can  afford an insurance premium that is in some cases higher than their  rent or their mortgage payments each month.   Even before its passage, my Republican colleagues and I talked about  the danger that ObamaCare posed to private insurance markets.   Insurers have already left the market in droves. In Wyoming, we are  down to one carrier. We lost the others to the economics of ObamaCare,  and we will be lucky to keep the one we have. I know many people in our  country are going to be in the position of having no insurers offering  plans in their county.   How could this happen? It has happened because of politics being put  before patients and an unwillingness to take on the hard task of fixing  something that you have sold as the perfect solution.   I can tell you that healthcare isn't a simple issue. It is incredibly  complex and, really, there is no one right way to tackle it. I was the  ranking member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee  when ObamaCare passed. We worked hard to find common ground. When it  became clear that there was not a reciprocal commitment to that from  our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, we did work hard to try  to stop it.   Now we are finally in a position to do so. We have a President in the  White House who is committed to repealing and replacing ObamaCare with  better care before more irreparable harm is done. Republicans have been  working on an approach that attempts to address both the short-term and  long-term problems caused by ObamaCare.   We have problems to solve right now. We are proposing to stabilize  insurance markets in the short term and to get insurance costs on a  more manageable trajectory over the longer term. We are striking at the  heart of ObamaCare by removing its mandates and taxes while putting  Medicaid on a more sustainable footing.   Doing this isn't easy. You may have read a little something about the  challenges of moving a healthcare bill forward, but the alternative is  to do what our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have done for  7 years and watch ObamaCare crater. We don't think that is the right  thing to do. We think we have an obligation, even if it is not an easy  vote, to salvage our insurance system.   Getting something done in Washington isn't always a pretty process,  but I am proud to be working with the women and men in my conference  who see that there is something larger at stake than themselves and who  know that sitting this out means more harm and, perhaps, harm that  can't be undone later.   I will keep working. I am committed to passing the best product that  we can deliver for the people of Wyoming and for our whole country. I  look forward to continuing to work together to repeal ObamaCare and  replace it with policies that will truly improve healthcare in America.  I hope my colleagues will join me in this worthy endeavor.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). Without objection, it is so  ordered.   Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday, several of my Democratic  colleagues spoke in opposition to the nomination of John Bush to serve  on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. They were particularly concerned  about his activities outside of the courtroom, especially his personal  blog posts. The comments of my friend, the junior Senator from  Minnesota, were representative of their concern.   He reminded us that he has been serving on the Judiciary Committee  for 8 years. He said that by confirming someone to the Federal bench  like Mr. Bush, who has blogged about controversial political and policy  matters, the Senate would be doing something unprecedented.  Specifically, my friend from Minnesota--in angst--said, ``I don't think  we have been here before.''   ``I don't think we have been here before,'' he said. I would  encourage my friend to think a little harder about his tenure on the  Judiciary Committee. Just a few years ago, the Senate considered  President Obama's nomination of Stephen Bough to be a Federal judge in  Missouri. Mr. Bough had been quite an active blogger himself. His  blogging and online commentary were not simply confined to political  satire and sarcasm. His blogging didn't use merely flippant or  intemperate language. His blogging demonstrated a real and palpable  animus toward conservatives and Republicans in general, toward elected  Republicans in particular, and by name--by name. He insulted and  impugned people from his home State, such as Senators, his Governor,  the President of the United States, and a Republican nominee for  President, just to name a few.   Mr. Bough's posts were truly mean-spirited. It wasn't just that he  called Republicans ``knuckleheads''--which he did. That was when he was  feeling especially kind. No, he said specific Republicans were  ``corrupt.'' They had done ``evil things''--``evil things.'' I can go  on and on about his corrosive rhetoric.   He approvingly posted an article describing how San Francisco was  contemplating naming a sewage plant after President Bush as a suitable  legacy for the President and posted another one that said his Governor  was highly ``ignorant.''   His invective was not reserved to members of the political branches.  He said that his State supreme court was the most corrupt in the  history of the State. I am not making this up. He is an officer of the  court, calling the supreme court the most corrupt in the history of his  State.  [[Page S4089]]    For my Democratic colleagues who now profess to care about the  judgment of judicial nominees who blog, I submit that impugning the  integrity of the tribunal that has jurisdiction over their professional  conduct and law license, as Mr. Bough did, is more than a few tweaks  shy of exhibiting sound judgment.   Mr. Bough also implied that President Bush made his Supreme Court  appointments as some sort of quid pro quo. He harshly criticized  sitting Supreme Court Justices by name, and he claimed that the  Republican nominee for President wanted only Federal judges who would  disregard the law and rule in favor of the ``religious right'' and that  he was ``sucking up.''   He made a crude comment about women that I will not repeat.   Now, some of our Democratic colleagues have criticized John Bush  because he said that he would try hard to be impartial as a judge. By  contrast, in one of his blog posts, Stephen Bough flat-out said that  he, himself, ``shouldn't be a judge.'' This is commentary on himself.  But every one of our Democratic colleagues on the Judiciary Committee  at the time, including our friend from Minnesota, obviously disagreed  with his own judgment about himself. They all voted for him, which is  especially curious in hindsight, given the superior weight our  Democratic colleagues now place on blog posts. Only one Member of the  Democratic conference voted against Mr. Bough. These are many of the  same Democrats, of course, who are supposedly aghast--aghast--at the  Bush nomination. Mr. Bough is now Federal District Court Judge Stephen  Bough.   Finally, I would like to set the record straight on the subject of  the slur. Mr. Bush did not use the slur in a blog post, and he did not  use it flippantly. In fact, he said he has never used this term and  would never use it.   Rather, Mr. Bush quoted by name someone else--a prominent author who  had used the slur. Mr. Bush quoted him to show how various authors had  viewed our hometown of Louisville over time--both those who praised it  and those who criticized it. In short, Mr. Bush said that he used it to  show ``the good, the bad, and the ugly.''   So who was the author he quoted verbatim and by name? Why, it was  noted liberal Hunter Thompson. I note that Mr. Thompson's use of the  slur did not prevent liberals, including Democratic officeholders, from  praising him. In fact, not one but two Democratic Presidential  candidates went to his funeral--George McGovern and John Kerry.   The Senate has considered a judicial nominee who did use this slur in  a blog posting, who actually did use the exact same slur, in fact. The  judicial nominee was not quoting any literary or published work, and  this judicial nominee did not use the slur for any critical purpose.  The judicial nominee used it flippantly and cavalierly. Who was the  judicial nominee? It was President Obama's judicial nominee and current  Federal District Court Judge Stephen Bough, who sits on the bench right  now for life, after being confirmed by the votes of our Democratic  colleagues.   I hope I have at least refreshed the memory of my friend from  Minnesota and some of my other Democratic colleagues.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the President  be immediately notified of the Senate's action.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  resume consideration of the Bernhardt nomination.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.   The clerk will report the nomination.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of David  Bernhardt, of Virginia, to be Deputy Secretary of the Interior.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.
