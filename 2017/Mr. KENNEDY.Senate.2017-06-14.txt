 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, Congressman Steve Scalise; Special Agent  Crystal Griner; Special Agent David Bailey; Zack Barth, a legislative  aide to Congressman Roger Williams; Matt Mika, who works for Tyson  Foods--those five individuals were shot today, and I am asking and  saying to every American who happens to be listening to the Senate at  this time: If you believe in God, please pray for them as I have and as  I do. If you don't believe in God, this is America, and that is your  right. Send positive thoughts their way.   Like most Americans, I feel awful, I feel sad, and I feel mad.   I have known Steve Scalise a long time, I don't know, 20, 25 years.  He is a political friend, but he is also a personal friend. Steve works  all the time. He loves his family. He will do anything for his  constituents. I know that is what we always say about each other, but  it is true with Steve. He loves this place. I have never seen him in a  bad mood. I know he must be; he is human. But I don't think I have ever  seen Steve in a bad mood. He is positive; he is can-do. Every time I go  to a function, Steve is there. I don't think he ever sleeps. He does an  extraordinarily good job of representing the First Congressional  District of Louisiana, and this is so unfair. I wish I understood why  bad things happen to good people.   My thoughts and prayers, as all of our thoughts and prayers should  be, are with Jennifer, Steve's lovely wife. Steve and Jennifer have two  great kids, Madison and Harrison. I can't imagine what his family is  going through right now. I am just so sorry.   We are also praying and hoping for a quick recovery for Matt and for  Zack.   I thank Special Agent Griner and Special Agent Bailey. There were 30,  40, 50 Congressmen and Senators out there today. It was an open field.  But for the bravery of these two special agents and other members of  the Capitol Police, it would have been a turkey shoot: no cover. You  have a person--that is as charitable as I can be right now--a person  armed with an assault rifle and a handgun. I just want to tell those  two agents and all the other law enforcement officials who support them  and who keep us safe every day: Thank you so much for doing your job.   We have heard--and I hope it is not true--that this was a political  shooting; that this person who decided to commit these despicable acts  did it because he didn't like the political persuasion of the people at  whom he decided to shoot. I hope that is not true. I hope members of  the media come back tonight after the Secret Service investigates and  tell us that is not true. Because if it is true, this represents a new  low for America.   Reasonable people disagree, and you have the right under our  Constitution to disagree. This is America. You can believe what you  want. Within reason, you can say what you want. And most of us--I dare  say, all of us in Congress--would do anything we could to protect that  right.   I guess you have a constitutional right to hate, if you want to. But  I don't understand people who hate other people just because they don't  agree with them politically. It is not only nonsensical, it is un- American. If the reports are true, it breaks my heart that this is what  we have come to. I think many of us have probably seen that attitude.  It has not become prevalent in America, but it certainly has become  more than just a mere occurrence. I will put it that way.   The internet has been an extraordinary thing for commerce and for the  quality of life of all of us, but sometimes I read what people write on  Facebook and I read comments. The worst are the ones where people can  comment anonymously on newspaper articles. The vitriol, the hatred--I  would hate to live with that much hate in my heart.   Our thoughts and prayers are with Steve, Jennifer, Madison, and  Harrison, and they are with Special Agent Griner, Special Agent Bailey,  Zack Barth, and Matt Mika. My personal thoughts and prayers are with  every American today who feels as I do, that this is just a sad, sad  day for this great country.   I don't know if there is any good that can come out of this, but if  there is, I hope the good that does come out of this is that we will  all stop and think about the things that divide us and understand it is  OK to disagree. I will say it again: Reasonable people do. But you can  disagree with somebody without hate.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  [[Page S3483]]         Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that privileges  of the floor be granted to a member of my staff, Patrick Flanigan.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
