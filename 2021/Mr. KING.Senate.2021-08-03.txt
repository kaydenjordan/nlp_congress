 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am beginning my comments with my mask on  for a very specific reason. If you can tell what is populating the  mask, they are America's favorite crustacean: the North American  lobster.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration  of S. Res. 335, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to,  the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I appreciate the adoption of this  resolution.   The American lobster, the North American lobster, is a staple, an  iconic product of the State of Maine. It supports our coastal economy;  it produces well over $1 billion a year of economic activity; and it  supports thousands of families along the coast of Maine.   Some people occasionally refer to the lobster industry, but in  reality it is a series of small, sole proprietorship businesses. Almost  all lobsters are caught on boats owned by individual owners, with,  perhaps, what we call a sternman on board, but it is a series of, as I  say, small, independently owned businesses, and that is one of the  things that is so special about this industry.   So it is a treat for me to be able to move this resolution, to have  it agreed upon unanimously by the U.S. Senate. September 25, 2021, will  officially be National Lobster Day.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, today I wish to recognize and congratulate  COL Brad Boyd on his outstanding service to our Nation both as a member  of my defense and foreign policy team, and as a U.S. Army infantry  officer with 30 years of combined military experience in both the Army  and the Marine Corps.   Colonel Boyd selflessly devoted the last 4 months of his time in  service to working in my office as a defense and foreign policy adviser  and as the lead staff member assigned to the Cyberspace Solarium  Commission. During this service, Colonel Boyd made several major policy  contributions that will affect how the Department of Defense and the  Department of Homeland Security will defend the United States and its  interests in the future. Prior to joining my office, Brad served as the  Director of Joint Warfighting for the Department's Joint Artificial  Intelligence Center. Colonel Boyd also previously served as a senior  military fellow at Stanford University's Center for International  Security and Cooperation, where his research addressed cyber- and AI- enabled information warfare and national security strategy. Before  Stanford, Brad served as a liaison officer to the British Army, as well  as in a number of infantry and overseas assignments: as deputy  commander of a 4,000-paratrooper brigade ready for short-notice  worldwide contingency operations; as commander of a battalion in the  82nd Airborne Division tasked as the U.S. Army's Global Response  Force--a unit of 800 paratroopers ready to deploy and operate anywhere  in the world within 18 hours' notice; and as commander of a rifle  company as part of a task force that played a key role in the hunt for  Saddam Hussein.   On behalf of my colleagues and the U.S. Congress, I thank Colonel  Boyd for his dedicated service to my staff, the U.S. Army, the U.S.  Marine Corps, and the Nation. What truly makes the U.S. military the  greatest in the history of the world is the fact that servicemembers  like Colonel Boyd decide to dedicate their lives to service and  sacrifice for their country. I wish him all the best and know that he  will excel in anything that he chooses to pursue in his next endeavors.  [[Page S5710]]                                ____________________
