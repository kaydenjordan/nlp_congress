 Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the recent loss of  one of West Virginia's best and brightest and recognize the life of a  good man, kind friend, and dedicated public servant, Emmett Pugh III.   Emmett was widely known for his accomplishments as the city of  Beckley's longest serving mayor, and while his positive impact on the  city was immeasurable, Emmett was the sort of person who had a positive  impact on the lives of everyone he met. Countless people benefited from  the work, words, and kindness of Emmett Pugh throughout his life.   Emmett was a native son of Beckley, WV, and came from a long  tradition of public service that followed him to the University of  Alabama. While at Alabama, he cultivated a deep love for two things:  the Crimson Tide and his hometown. After earning a degree in political  science, with a focus on State and local government, Emmett returned  home to serve as the president of Bowl-Wick, Inc., a bowling center  that brought joy and entertainment to the citizens of Beckley for many  years.  [[Page S3290]]    In 1979, Emmett began his long career in public service as a  councilman-at-large. In 1988, upon the death of the current mayor,  Emmett stepped up and began his tenure as the longest serving mayor in  Beckley's history. During his time in office, he expanded city limits,  led a razing campaign on deteriorated properties, and established two  new fire stations. He also helped lead the development of the Beckley  Intermodal Gateway, the Rahall Company Store at New River Park,  Thornhill Courts, Freedom Park, Jim Word Memorial Park, and the Lewis  McManus Trail, among other accomplishments. In 1988, he was named Mayor  of the Year for his efforts.   When Mayor Pugh left office in 2013, his positive impact on the  community and State did not stop. He continued to inspire all whom he  encountered and acted as a mentor to his successors and any who sought  his advice. He also continued in his role as a family man, and he is  survived by his wife, their three children, two step-children, and  eight grandchildren. Emmett's passion for Beckley and West Virginia  lives on, and I think I speak for many when I say that he will be  sorely missed.                            ____________________
