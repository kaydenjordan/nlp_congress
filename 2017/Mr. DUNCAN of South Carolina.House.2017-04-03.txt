 Mr. Speaker, I briefly want to mention  the country of Colombia. Tremendous flooding and mudslides there have  taken more than 200 lives. Colombia is in my prayers, the prayers of  the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, and the prayers of all of  America.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 54, which reaffirms  America's partnership with Argentina, and applaud the economic reforms  undertaken in recent years.   I applaud Ranking Member Sires for his leadership on this issue. Last  year, he and I led a congressional delegation to Argentina to see the  differences in the country under the new leadership of President Macri  and to reextend a hand of friendship of the United States.   Though the previous government followed the path of ruinous economic  and foreign policies, I saw new optimism that the new Macri  administration would right these wrongs. For example, at the  Organization of American States, Argentina has been supportive of the  actions of OAS Secretary General Almagro, urging the Venezuelan  Government to respect democracy, human rights, and the rule of law.   In addition, President Macri is working to find justice for the 1994  AMIA bombing terrorist attack--the largest loss of life from an act of  terror in this hemisphere prior to 9/11--and the murder of the AMIA  special prosecutor, Alberto Nisman. It is my sincerest hope that he  will find the perpetrators and hold them accountable for these heinous  acts of terror.   In conclusion, the United States should be very clear that we are  thankful for President Macri's courage and willingness to take  unpopular but principled positions. I urge the new Trump administration  to do all in its power to take the steps outlined in this legislation  and advance a deeper bilateral relationship.
