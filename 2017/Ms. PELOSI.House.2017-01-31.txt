 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up Congresswoman  Lofgren's H.R. 724, which would rescind President Trump's refugee ban  on individuals, like the 30-year-old Iranian citizen who entered the  U.S. to visit his family in San Francisco, then was detained and  transferred to county jail.
