 Madam Speaker, had I been present, I  would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 134.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  the 100th birthday of Ola Cox.   Ola is a lifelong resident of Venango County, Pennsylvania, where she  continues to make history in her own right over the last century. She  has broken gender barriers, supported community endeavors, and brought  a global perspective home.   Born in Pittsville, Pennsylvania, Ola graduated high school at 16  years old and enlisted in the Navy WAVES. After returning from naval  service during World War II, she married Lester ``Boone'' Cox and  started a family.   Ola continued to break gender barriers as a working mom beside her  husband at their Franklin Print Shop. In Ola's 100 years of life, she  has countless stories, from their working farm to raising four  children.   Following her time in the print shop, she worked at Oakwood Rose  Gardens, served as the township tax collector, and frequently  volunteered in her community and with her church, the Rockland  Methodist Church. She also traveled the world.   Mr. Speaker, Ola is a dedicated wife, mother, grandmother, and great- grandmother. She cared for her dear husband and spent countless hours  with her children and great-grandchildren so they could learn and  understand the importance of family, community, and the world.   I thank Ola for her service to our country and her dedication to our  community.                            ____________________
