 Madam Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues from the  Kentucky delegation to honor the life of a true American patriot,  former Congressman Larry Hopkins, who served in this body from 1979 to  1993 and passed away early yesterday.   Throughout his extraordinary career in public service, Larry served  in the Kentucky State legislature and for over a decade in Congress in  the seat I now hold.   Larry's career in public service began as a U.S. marine in 1954. It  was that love for the military that Larry would bring with him to the  Congress, where he rose to become the top Republican on the Armed  Services Committee.   Larry's humor was famous with both his constituents and his  colleagues, always offering a disarming joke to lighten the mood or  evoking a good laugh.   Above all, Madam Speaker, Congressman Hopkins was proud of his work  across the aisle and the relationships he had with all his colleagues,  Republicans and Democrats alike.   In these divided times, let us be inspired by the legacy of  Congressman Larry Hopkins to come together and solve the problems of  our day not as Republicans or Democrats, but as Americans who all love  our country.   On behalf of a grateful Nation, I invite my colleagues in the House  to join me in praying for Larry's family: his wife, Carolyn; and three  children, Shae, Tara, and Josh.   I now ask that the House observe a moment of silence to honor the  life of Congressman Larry Hopkins. God bless Larry Hopkins.                            ____________________
