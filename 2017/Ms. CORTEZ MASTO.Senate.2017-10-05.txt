 Mr. President, I had expected to be able to  vote today on the confirmation of Mr. Randal Quarles to be a member of  the Federal Reserve. Instead, I am in Las Vegas, meeting with victims  of and first responders to the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S.  history.   On the question of Mr. Quarles's nomination, I want to make clear  that I would have voted ``no'' had I been present. While an official in  the Bush administration Treasury Department in the lead-up to the  economic crisis of 2007 to 2009, Mr. Quarles failed to take action to  prevent the build-up of risk that ultimately led to hundreds of  thousands of foreclosures and evictions in Nevada. In fact, Mr. Quarles  during that period repeatedly maintained that the financial system was  safe, that large banks were well-capitalized, and that the housing  market was strong, notwithstanding clear signs of escalating risk.  After serving in the Treasury Department, Mr. Quarles was the  beneficiary of the second-largest ``loss share'' agreement in the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's history. This agreement  provided a taxpayer-backed guarantee and allowed Mr. Quarles to profit  substantially off of the failure of a large bank.   If confirmed, I hope that Mr. Quarles will exceed my expectations and  become a strong advocate for a safe and resilient American financial  system. However, I cannot in good conscience vote to confirm him given  my concerns about his past record.   Thank you.    Mr. President, I had expected to be able to  vote today on the motion to invoke cloture on the nomination of  Callista L. Gingrich to be Ambassador to the Holy See. Instead, I am in  Las Vegas meeting with victims of and first responders to the deadliest  mass shooting in modern U.S. history.   I support the motion to invoke cloture on the nomination of Callista  L. Gingrich to be Ambassador to the Holy See. The U.S. relationship  with the Holy See is an important one and is best supported with a  confirmed ambassador leading it. Ms. Gingrich's faith and engagement  with the Catholic community will support U.S. ties to the  Vatican.    Mr. President, I had expected to be able to  vote on the confirmation of Mr. Eric Hargan, to be Deputy Secretary for  Health and Human Service, HHS. Instead, I am in Las Vegas to grieve  with and assist my fellow Nevadans in the aftermath of the worst mass  shooting in modern American history.    On the question of Mr. Hargan's nomination, I want to make my  opposition to his confirmation clear. I do not believe Mr. Hargan to be  qualified to be a leading member of HHS. This decision is based on his  prior experience, his work and statements opposing the Affordable Care  Act, as well as his statements regarding the extension of the State  Children's Health Insurance Program. Deputy Secretary Eric Hargan would  be the highest ranking appointee at HHS, making him responsible for  implementing and enforcing the Affordable Care Act, ACA, going forward.  Considering the fact that the administration has repeatedly and  consistently sought to undermine the ACA, I fear that someone with Mr.  Hargan's views will only aid and abet this reckless game the  administration is playing with Americans' healthcare.    I hope that Mr. Hargan will surpass my expectations and serve this  country well as Deputy Secretary at HHS. The role of HHS Deputy  Secretary in implementing and administering the efforts of  strengthening our healthcare system is too important for any other  result. I believe strongly that Americans deserve affordable and  accessible healthcare coverage, and I hope Mr. Hargan's actions as  Deputy Director show that he agrees. However, I could not in good  conscience vote to confirm someone about whom I have so many concerns.  Thank you.                            ____________________
