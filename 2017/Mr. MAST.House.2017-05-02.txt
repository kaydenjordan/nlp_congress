 Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my friend from  Pennsylvania for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I would also like to recognize my committee colleagues  from the great State of Florida, Ms. Frankel and Mr. Webster, on  promoting this important piece of legislation. I am very proud to be a  cosponsor of this bill.   There is no question for Florida that the emergency management  capabilities are among the best in the Nation, but some disasters are  even beyond what we can handle and what we can handle in an effective  and timely manner.   Right now in our State, we are battling wildfires across the State.  We are on the eve of a brand-new hurricane season which happens year  after year. These FEMA disaster relief programs are necessary, they are  critical, and they are one of the most important responsibilities of  the Federal Government to help States and their citizenry recover; but,  unfortunately, there is an issue going on.   Many counties in south Florida are still fighting to this day with  FEMA to defend the legitimacy of disaster relief aid that they received  following one of the worst hurricane seasons in our State's history,  where hurricane after hurricane after hurricane crossed the shores of  Florida.   Mr. Speaker, victims of a disaster or a national emergency who may  not even have shelter over their heads--or food or water or basic  necessities--should not be victimized again by their own government  just because they lack the paper trail from decades ago when they were  undergoing this sort of devastation in their life. By reinstating a 3- year statute of limitations on the reclamation of funds, when there is  no evidence of fraud, no evidence of waste, no evidence of abuse, this  bill moves more of the onus for recordkeeping and combating fraud away  from relief recipients and back to where it belongs, back on to FEMA,  and during that time when it is most essential, immediately after the  recovery process. Mr. Speaker, I think that is just common sense.   Once again, I fully support this bipartisan bill, and I commend  Chairman Shuster and Chairman Barletta for their assistance in getting  this important bill to the floor.                                time  1400
