 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on the topic of this Special  Order.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a number of my  colleagues from Indiana and Ohio, the great Midwest, to celebrate the  6-month anniversary of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act being signed into law.   Our previous tax code was written more than 30 years ago and became  broken, outdated, and overly complicated, and desperately needed to be  reworked so Americans could receive much-needed relief. It was failing  to support families with the resources they need in order to properly  plan for their futures. Our tax code left those who were struggling to  make ends meet behind.   But on December 22, 2017, that began to change when the President  signed H.R. 1, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, into law. The Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act cut the individual tax rates for all individuals, allowing  Americans to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks. It also slashed  our corporate tax rate to ensure American businesses can remain  competitive and compete on a global scale.   H.R. 1 also included provisions to support the most important engines  of our economy: small businesses. By allowing businesses to fully write  off the cost of new equipment in the first year, our updated and  revamped tax code provides small businesses more money up front to  quickly reinvest back into improving their operations, hiring new  workers, and increasing pay and/or bonuses of current workers.   In 6 short months, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is already working for  those who need it most, our country's hardworking middle class families  and workers, allowing Americans across the country, and in Indiana, to  keep more of their income.   For the typical family of four nationwide earning the median family  income of $73,000, with this new law, they will now receive a tax cut  of $2,059. In the Fifth District of Indiana--central Indiana, which I  represent--the average  [[Page H5643]]  family of four is saving even more than that, at about $2,590, and the  average single person is saving about $1,716 dollars.   These savings allow people to put money aside for things like  continued education; payments toward a new home; and, overall, provide  relief by making the cost of living just that much more manageable.   Additionally, more than $4 billion in bonuses have been given out to  employees all across the country--$4 billion. Our Nation's unemployment  has fallen to the lowest in 17 years, an unemployment rate of 3.8  percent as of May of this year.                                time  2115    Market confidence is also high. Our economy is booming, with 63  percent of small businesses saying they feel optimistic about the  direction of our economy and 77 percent of manufacturers are planning  on hiring new employees.   This is good news, because when our economy grows, everyone benefits.   A constituent of mine from Pendleton, who owns a restaurant, recently  told me that instead of having to shut down for several days for  repairs when a vital piece of his kitchen equipment broke, he was able  to purchase a newer, more efficient model and remain open thanks to the  new expensing provisions in the tax law.   I also heard from a Hoosier who came to D.C. with NFIB who is now  able to provide his employees health insurance thanks to the savings he  has seen through the savings for small businesses resulting from the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This critical benefit has helped him retain  workers--he, I recall, had eight employees--and is allowing him to  recruit even better talent to further grow his operations.   These stories are just two of millions from across the country  showing just how much tax reform changes people's lives for the better  and will provide certainty and optimism for much brighter futures.   Still more good news is to come as Americans file their taxes next  April for the first time using the new system.   Mr. Speaker, I am really pleased that I have several colleagues here  both from Indiana and from Ohio who have come to share their stories  about their constituents and the good things that are happening in  their districts.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Banks). Mr.  Banks represents Indiana's northeastern Third District and is serving  in his first term in Congress. I thank Congressman Banks for being  here.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Indiana (Mr. Hollingsworth), who represents the Ninth Congressional  District in southern Indiana. He is a gentleman who has done business  for many years.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  southern Indiana for sharing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers). He is  from central southern Ohio's 15th District.   He is a dedicated soldier. I understand Mr. Stivers has been a long  time in the Army National Guard, actually over 30 years, and is now a  brigadier general in the Ohio Army National Guard. I thank him for that  service and ask that he please share with us the stories he has been  hearing about how it has been impacting those in the Buckeye State.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio  for his comments. When he shared about people breathing easier, I know  that a bank teller that I spoke with in Sheridan, Indiana, shared with  me that that extra in her paycheck is allowing her to pay more for  daycare rather than her husband having to work quite so hard at that  second job. So it is helping her pay their daycare bill and it is  helping them breathe a little bit easier.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs.  McMorris Rodgers). Mrs. McMorris Rodgers represents eastern  Washington's Fifth District.   I have the pleasure of working alongside her on the Energy and  Commerce Committee, and we have heard about 1 million more jobs  created, 4 million more people receiving bonuses, 90 percent of people  with more money in their paychecks.    Mr. Speaker, I look forward to hearing how tax cuts are impacting the  State of Washington.   Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman very much  for yielding and for hosting us this evening and bringing us together  to talk about the positive impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, one  part that is contributing to our booming economy.   Last Friday was the 6-month anniversary of the passage and the  signing of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act into law. It is the most sweeping  tax reform in more than 3 decades, and our goal was pretty simple: more  jobs, bigger paychecks, and fairer taxes. And as this law continues to  be implemented, that is what we are seeing.   Since we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we have been able to  create more than 1 million jobs; the unemployment rate is now at 3.8  percent, that is the lowest in 50 years, since 1969; unemployment for  Blacks and Hispanics is at the lowest level ever on record;  compensation increases for small business workers are at the highest  level in 20 years; consumer confidence is close to an 18-year high;  people are the most hopeful that they have been in 17 years about  finding that good-paying job; and for the first time in our history,  there are more jobs available than people that are seeking and looking  for those jobs.   There was a recent survey of manufacturers that found 72 percent of  manufacturers report that they plan to increase employee wages and  benefits; 77 percent plan to hire more workers; 86 percent say that  they have already planned expanded investments.   This is the economic comeback that Americans and their families have  long waited for. With results we promised, like bigger paychecks and  lower utility bills, because of tax reform, people are better off.   So often policy becomes about the numbers. And these are great  numbers and we are proud of these numbers.   But now I would like to focus a little bit more on what tax reform  means, focus on why it matters.                                time  2130    The why is the real people in eastern Washington, hardworking men and  women in eastern Washington and all across this country who now have  the opportunity for a better life, thanks to this progrowth policy.   For weeks now, my colleagues have come to the House floor to share  stories of small businesses that are expanding, moms and dads that can  spend more time with their children, families taking vacations together  for the first time, and so many more stories. Those stories are the  same stories that I hear in eastern Washington.   A few weeks ago, I was talking with a family in Spokane, Washington,  and they told me that they are seeing $400 more a month in take-home  pay. They are grateful for that extra cushion because their daughter is  living with a disability and, given her needs, they never know what the  expenses may be. With nearly 5,000 more dollars in their pocket this  year, they are more confident about the future and their ability to  care for her.   I also met a dad who manages the Starbucks in downtown Spokane. He  was so excited about the announcement of bigger paychecks, more take- home pay, better benefits, because he had just had a son. He and his  wife had just given birth 4 months earlier, and he was so hopeful about  this future.   When the withholding tables changed in February, I received a call in  my office from a woman who could barely speak because she was so  excited about what an extra $40 in her paycheck was going to mean for  her. And I quote her: ``I just got my paycheck for the first time, and  I am getting $47.98 more than I did in the past, which is about $1,200  more a year. For me, they are not crumbs. It's more money to help me  put food on the table. I'm so happy, I wanted to tell everybody, the  whole world, that these tax cuts work.''   So to some, these may be crumbs, but to hardworking men and women, it  makes a difference in being able to support their families.   I had another person contact my office thinking that their H.R.  system had glitched when they saw $100 more in their paycheck, and he  said: ``For  [[Page H5645]]  me this will be $2,400 a year. That's real money, to buy groceries,  fill the car up with gas, or take the family on a weekend trip.''   Tax reform is changing lives and, despite all the good, all these  milestones and positive headlines, our colleagues across the aisle  still voted ``no,'' and worse, they now are wanting to take it away.   For working moms and dads, we doubled the child tax credit, preserved  the adoption tax credit, expanded 529 accounts to help with the cost of  raising children. For moms like me who are raising a child with a  disability, I was proud to get my ABLE 2.0 provisions included so that  now a child with disabilities can go explore work, find a job, and take  those earnings and put them into their ABLE account.   ABLE to Work is going to allow individuals to save more of their own  money, maybe go get an internship or a part-time job. My ABLE Financial  Planning Act will allow families of those with disabilities to roll  over funds from a child's savings account to an ABLE account if their  child becomes disabled. These provisions are going to help families who  have children with disabilities live full and independent lives, and I  was proud to be a part of that.   For the millions of women who recently received a pay increase,  including entry-level employees at Wheatland Bank in Spokane,  Washington, they can now invest more of what they earn in their pay for  their education, retirement, everyday expenses to travel and chase  their dreams.   In fact, more than 600 companies have passed down benefits from tax  reform to their employees. For people and small-business owners in my  district, this means real relief. Ninety percent of people are seeing  more money in their pocket every month. For the average family of four,  it is $2,000 a year.   These are real stories from real people who are benefiting, and we  are just getting started.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Washington, and I love her message of more jobs as she just talked  about bigger paychecks, fairer taxes. It is happening in her State and  all across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson), who,  prior to coming to Congress, also served our country. He retired as a  lieutenant colonel from the United States Air Force, and I am very  fortunate because I get to serve with him, also, on the Energy and  Commerce Committee.   I ask the gentleman to please share with us how the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act is helping eastern Ohio.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio  for sharing with us how it is impacting eastern and southeastern Ohio.   I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Davidson), who represents the  Eighth Congressional District and also served his country as a United  States Army Ranger and had been in business prior to coming here to the  people's House.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Ohio  for his comments, and I agree with him. Everyone is hiring. There are  so many job openings right now.   As the gentleman said, there are a million new jobs. Everyone is  competing at a higher level, and they have to compete in order to  retain those employees in order to keep those employees happy.   So things are really buzzing along, and I thank the gentleman for  being here this evening and sharing what is going on in southern Ohio.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, but as we have heard from  Members from Indiana, Ohio, and Washington, because everyone is hiring  and people have to compete, there are companies throughout Indiana,  companies like First Merchants Bank, one of the first in Indiana to  announce they were going to have an hourly wage increase and $500 bonus  for nonsenior management; a company in my district, one of the larger  employers, Hoosier Park Casino, all employees received a $500 bonus  after the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was announced; Fifth Third Bank, $1,000  bonuses to over 13,000 employees, and they also raised the minimum  wage.    These are the types of stories that we have heard, whether it is from  small companies or from large, national companies and companies that do  business all across the country. They are competing for workers, and  when they are competing for workers, the workers and the employees are  winning because everyone is hiring and everyone is trying to compete.   Mr. Speaker, I thank all of my colleagues for the opportunity to  highlight the benefits of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Every Member of  Congress has this duty to their constituents and to try to make sure  that we promote and make sure that the benefits of historic tax reform  have extended all across the country, as we have heard today, and have  impacted Americans from all walks of life.   Moving forward, we have to continue to implement these types of  policies that will encourage economic growth, create those jobs, ensure  that our Tax Code continues to support the policies to make sure that  the welfare of American citizens in the 21st century is at the highest  so that we can have the best for all Americans in the 21st century.   I want to thank all my colleagues for taking the time to participate  this evening, as we have gone late into the evening. I look forward to  working for the benefit of all of our constituents all across the  country.   Mr. Speaker, I am very proud to have been a part of the passage of  this historic Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, and I yield back the balance of my  time                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now  adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 45 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, June 26, 2018, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
