 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.R. 1695.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Intellectual property is a critical and growing part of our Nation's  economy, and the Register of Copyrights has a crucial role in the  numerous copyright policy issues that impact it.   Four years ago, the Judiciary Committee began considering how to  modernize our Nation's copyright laws, including how the Copyright  Office is structured. Making the Register position subject to the  nomination and consent process with potential candidates identified by  a congressional selection panel was among the many issues considered by  the House Judiciary Committee.   Because the Director of the Patent and Trademark Office, who has an  equally important voice on patent and trademark issues, is already  subject to the nomination and consent process, it provided a precedent  for this approach.   However, unlike the Patent and Trademark Office, the Copyright Office  is part of the legislative branch. Thus, it is appropriate to also  follow the precedent set for other legislative branch agencies, which  gives Congress a greater say in selecting candidates for the heads of  legislative branch entities to ensure those agencies are more  accountable to Congress.   Because the Register position is now vacant, filled on an acting  capacity by a well-regarded Acting Register, Ranking Member Conyers and  I introduced this bipartisan legislation to update the Register  selection process. To mirror a recent change to the Librarian of  Congress position that is now subject to a 10-year term limit, the  legislation also makes the Register of Copyrights position subject to a  10-year term limit.   The selection panel would be bipartisan and would consist of leaders  of the majorities and minorities of the House and Senate, and would  also include the Librarian of Congress.   In the past, the authority of the Register of Copyrights to issue  rulemakings has not been challenged in the courts because the Register  is not subject to the nomination and consent process.                                time  1400    This legislation would remedy that question, once and for all. H.R.  1695 was reported by the House Judiciary Committee by a bipartisan vote  of 27-1. In addition to strong support from traditional copyright  groups, such as the Copyright Alliance, and the publishing, movie,  music, and software industries, the bill has been supported by a wide  range of diverse groups, such as the American Conservative Union; the  AFL-CIO; Heritage Foundation scholars; the Directors Guild of America;  the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; MANA, A National Latina Organization;  Americans for Tax Reform; and the Council for Citizens Against  Government Waste.   With such strong support from a wide range of over 70 groups and a  vacancy at the Register of Copyrights that needs to be quickly filled  under the new process created by this legislation, I urge my colleagues  to support H.R. 1695.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.

Hon. Bob Goodlatte,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Goodlatte: I write to you concerning the       jurisdictional interest of the Committee on House       Administration in H.R. 1695, the Register of Copyrights       Selection and Accountability Act of 2017. The bill, as       reported from the Committee on the Judiciary on March 29,       2017, contains provisions that fall within the jurisdiction       of the Committee on House Administration.        I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this       legislation before the House of Representatives in an       expeditious manner, and accordingly, I will waive Committee       consideration of provisions that fall within the Committee's       jurisdiction. However, agreeing to waive jurisdiction over       these provisions should not be construed as waiving,       reducing, or affecting the jurisdiction of the Committee on       House Administration.        Additionally, the Committee on House Administration       expressly reserves its authority to seek conferees on any       provision within its jurisdiction during any House-Senate       conference that may be convened on this, or any similar       legislation. I ask for your commitment to support any request       by the Committee for conferees on H.R. 1695 for provisions       within the Committee's jurisdiction.        I ask a copy of this letter and your response be placed in       the Congressional Record during any floor consideration of       H.R. 1695.        I look forward to working with you on matters of mutual       concern.            Sincerely,                                                      Gregg Harper,                                                          Chairman.                                          House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                     Washington, DC, April 20, 2017.      Hon. Gregg Harper,      Chairman, Committee on House Administration,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Harper: Thank you for consulting with the       Committee on the Judiciary and agreeing to be discharged from       further consideration of H.R. 1695, the ``Register of       Copyrights Selection and Accountability Act,'' so that the       bill may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.        I agree that your foregoing further action on this measure       does not in any way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of       your committee or prejudice its jurisdictional prerogatives       on this bill or similar legislation in the future. I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will seek to place our letters on H.R. 1695 into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                     Bob Goodlatte,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I have no speakers remaining, and I am  prepared to close when Ranking Member Conyers concludes.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   I thank Ranking Member Conyers and many other Members across the  aisle, as well as the subcommittee chair and the subcommittee vice  chair of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual  Property, and the Internet--Mr. Issa and Mr. Collins--for their hard  work in support of this legislation, which is urgently needed. It is  very straightforward. It has very broad bipartisan support here in the  House.   It is also strongly supported in a bipartisan fashion in the Senate.  A wide array of outside organizations--virtually every copyright  organization in the country--as well as a number of other organizations  concerned about the importance of intellectual property protection and  particularly copyright law want to see the status of the Register of  Copyrights elevated by Presidential appointment with input from six  leaders in the House and the Senate and the Librarian of Congress to  select the next Register of Copyrights and have a 10-year term, which  is compatible with terms of other important legislative branch  positions.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, but I do not oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in support of the  amendment offered by Mr. Deutch. Mr. Deutch has been a strong supporter  of intellectual property as well as the modernization of the Copyright  Office during the House Judiciary Committee's copyright review.                                time  1445    The needs of a modern copyright registration system require advanced  information technology systems, so it is critical that all future  Registers have a strong base of information technology knowledge within  the Office to lead such efforts. By requiring all future Registers to  have the skills necessary to identify and hire a chief information  officer or other similar official to lead such efforts within the  Office, the Deutch amendment ensures a strong Copyright Office. I want  to thank the gentleman for making this important contribution to the  legislation.   I neglected to mention earlier--I don't see him here now--but I also  want to thank the ranking member of the subcommittee, the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Nadler), for the important contributions he has made  to this legislation as well.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, but I do not oppose the amendment.  [[Page H2876]]     Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment  offered by Ms. Judy Chu. She has been a strong advocate for the  protection of intellectual property as well as the modernization of the  Copyright Office during the House Judiciary Committee's copyright  review, and we miss her on the committee.   One of the issues that has been raised while we have discussed  updates to our Nation's copyright laws is the importance of preserving  our mandatory deposit system. The mandatory deposit system that exists  in our Nation's copyright law has resulted in numerous copyrighted  works being added to the collections of the Library of Congress at no  charge to taxpayers. Without the mandatory deposit system, the  Library's collections would be vastly smaller, without a significant  increase in taxpayer funding in order to buy these copyrighted works  that are now provided free to the Library.   Ms. Judy Chu's amendment ensures that this system is not disrupted as  the Register position is made subject to the nomination and consent  process, and I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
