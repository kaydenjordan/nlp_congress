 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this censure  resolution. Inciting violence is unacceptable. Threatening to kill a  colleague, the President of the United States, or any American, is  unacceptable.   I rise to make it clear that we have an opportunity today to choose  decency over demonization, to choose civility over cynicism, and to  choose the rule of law over recklessly violent behavior. That is why  the House of Representatives is acting and acting decisively. We cannot  normalize violence today, we cannot normalize violence tomorrow, and we  cannot normalize violence at any point moving forward in our future.  The House will hold Paul Gosar accountable for his violent and  deplorable behavior whether the cover-up caucus likes it or not.   Madam Speaker, vote ``yes'' on this censure resolution.
