 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Democratic Caucus, I  offer a privileged resolution and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 127         Resolved, That the following named Members be and are       hereby elected to the following standing committees of the       House of Representatives:        (1) Committee on ethics.--Mr. Cohen.        (2) Committee on oversight and government reform.--Mr.       Sarbanes.        (3) Committee on small business.--Mr. Schneider.    The resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, sweetheart deals?   Since when is it a sweetheart deal to have a modicum of retirement  for working poor and middle class people?   That is a sweetheart deal?   All I hear from the other side of the aisle is people talking about  government overreach, executive orders, and unnamed bureaucrats. So it  is surprising that today the Republican majority is creating a manmade  roadblock toward helping working Americans save their own money for  their own retirement.   We have all heard about the olden days when, if you worked for a  company for life, you could retire with a guaranteed pension. Now, with  the exception of union workers, the days of a guaranteed pension plan  for most private sector workers are a thing of the past. Captains of  industry don't offer them anymore. They line their own pockets instead.    Some employers have tried to fill that retirement income gap by  offering 401(k) retirement savings plans. Not a bad thing, but it was  not the answer that everyone thought it was going to be, the panacea  that everyone made it out to be.   But for far too many companies, they don't offer any retirement  package to their employees at all. Today, half of all Americans going  to work are not offered a retirement plan from their employer, meaning  these workers are not accumulating any nest egg outside of Social  Security for their retirement years.   To address this growing retirement savings crisis, the Obama  administration made it easier for States and large municipalities to  sponsor their own 401(k)-style retirement plan for their residents who  work in the private sector, but are not offered any retirement plan  from their private sector job. They are not offered by their employer  that 401(k) plan. They have nothing, no opportunity.   These rules do not require employees to participate, so the captains  of industry who don't offer their employees a retirement plan, under  the Obama administration rules, would not even have to participate.  These rules do not require any employer contributions.   What these rules simply do is create a pathway for States and large  cities, if they choose, to enroll private sector workers into a  retirement savings vehicle so they can start saving early to enjoy the  benefits of a more financially secure retirement. And what is wrong  with that?   It is a universal fact that the most successful way to get people to  save for their retirement is to enroll them in a retirement plan  through their workplace and have a percentage of their pay taken out  automatically and invested for the long-term future and for their  benefit.   So these Obama administration rules were actually adopting best  practices to help workers who had been offered no opportunity to save  for their retirement, to start to build their own nest egg with their  own money for their own future, potentially even investing in a private  401(k) plan down the road.   The cruel irony is, if these two bills pass, congressional  Republicans will have prohibited States and local governments from  trying to help those workers who have been forgotten about by some in  the Federal Government and ignored by the private sector marketplace.   What ever happened to local government being the laboratory of  democracy?    Now, I could understand if Republicans in Congress were  working on a national plan to ensure that every American who works  their whole life could have some form of guaranteed income in addition  to--and not as a replacement for--Social Security.   But you don't have one. You never have. I won't say you never will,  but you don't have, and you never have yet. Then maybe there would be  some justification for the action you are taking today, but that is not  the case.   In fact, Republicans in Congress have done nothing to protect workers  or retiree benefits, and they are the party that wants to privatize  Social Security.   But today, with these two bills, they go one step further to  eliminate the ability of millions of workers from even the potential to  enjoy some financial comfort after a lifetime of work.   It is time for a progressive agenda for America that puts America's  workers first and their families first.    Mr. Speaker, we need to tackle a challenge that is  threatening the financial security of the middle class and those who  are working hard to remain in it. That is not just in New York City,  that is throughout our entire country, but particularly in my home city  and my home State, and that is a savings and retirement security crisis  in America.   The word ``crisis'' is no exaggeration, Mr. Speaker. Nearly half of  U.S. households do not have a savings plan. Less than one-third have a  cushion to cover basic expenses for just 3 months if a layoff or other  emergency leads to loss of income.   The status for retirement savings is even more dire, Mr. Speaker.  Remember, one out of every two Americans going to work today doesn't  have a retirement plan provided by their employer. We are seeing a new  generation of Americans growing up with little or no savings to help  them climb the economic ladder or simply weather a difficult time.   Younger workers are trying to save for their children to go to  college. They are trying to buy a home or build the emergency fund they  will need if their car breaks down. Others are wondering if they can  afford to start their own business or have the financial security to  leave their job for a better opportunity. Older Americans are looking  at retirement and if they will be able to support themselves and  maintain a good quality of life without working. We know that savings  are the path for middle class families to achieve the American Dream,  yet that dream is increasingly being put at risk.   We can turn this around, Mr. Speaker. We can put building a college  savings account, a nest egg, and a retirement plan back in reach for  millions of American families.   That is why I have put forward a plan of action entitled ``Building  Better Savings, Building Brighter Futures.'' You can read my action  plan on my website at crowley.house.gov.   This plan is a comprehensive approach to ensure no American who works  their whole life will spend their retirement in poverty. But to get to  that point, we need to stop wasting time going backwards. So let's  allow States and local governments to continue to do what they are  doing to help those workers who are being left behind now.   Oppose these two bills that target workers' retirement savings, and  let's work towards positive solutions to address the real problems of  America's working families. We can do that with my proposal, Building  Better Savings, Building Brighter Futures.    I thank my friend, the gentlewoman from Ohio, for being  here this evening to have this Special Order to speak on an issue of  such magnitude, of importance to we the people of the United States,  important to the world, that we never forget what took place: the  horror, the utter destruction of humankind during the Holocaust, but,  in particular, the focus of that destruction upon the Jewish race.   It is important because we are seeing a rise, quite frankly, of anti- Semitism not only around the world, but right here in the United  States. It takes different forms in different places, but, in  [[Page H1237]]  the end, has the same result of targeting and hurting one of the  historically most vulnerable groups in our world: the Jewish people.   One of the things that has been the most concerning to me is the  minimizing of the suffering of the Jewish people during the Holocaust.  Frankly, it is really outright disturbing--I don't know if that does it  justice--that the White House of the United States of America, the home  of our President, our present administration, representing the same  country that defeated Nazi Germany, the same country that bore the  Greatest Generation, the same country that led the fight against anti- Semitism worldwide, while recognizing from time to time it had to douse  it here in the United States, our country, this same White House that I  referred to deliberately refused to mention that the Holocaust was  designed to eliminate the Jewish people from the face of the Earth. Not  a single mention of the Final Solution. The Final Solution was to  obliterate, eliminate the Jewish people off the face of the Earth.   Yes, many people died in the Holocaust, as the gentlewoman made  reference to so eloquently--disturbingly, but eloquently. Of the tens  of millions of people who died, we know of them historically, but no  race or religion was designated for elimination like the Jewish people  were. The Final Solution was about ridding the Jewish people from the  face of the Earth. It is that simple. It is imperative that this moment  does not pass without some clarity.    What is clear is that the White House purposely removed the  reference. They are proud of it. They doubled down. They tripled down.  They removed the reference to the Jewish people in its statement on  International Holocaust Remembrance Day.   Why does this matter, you may ask? Well, first and foremost, it feeds  the extremists. We know they exist. Let's face it, extremists have  welcomed this White House statement. They love it, they glorify it, not  just theoretically, but literally. Literally, White supremacists have  welcomed the White House decision to leave any mention of the Jewish  people out of the Holocaust remembrance.   Secondly, it matters because a lot of people in the world today  either don't know that the Holocaust happened or don't believe that the  Holocaust happened--not just theoretically, but literally don't believe  that the Holocaust took place.   Literally, a 2014 global survey of anti-Semitic attitudes found that  35 percent of people around the world have never heard about the  Holocaust. Maybe you can understand that. But an additional 32 percent,  more importantly, believe it is a myth or greatly exaggerated.   Thirdly, it matters because there are many Holocaust survivors--I  know them and their descendents--in the United States and throughout  the world.   The actions behind the statement were just downright cruel and  inhumane to them, not just theoretically, but literally cruel and  inhumane.   Literally, groups that are dedicated to this issue are deeply, deeply  disturbed. The Anne Frank Center and others have raised their voices.   This is not just coming from Democrats. I don't want to mislead here  at all. There are a range of Republican leaders--and there are four of  them--and Republican groups that have expressed their anger at the  White House position on the Holocaust, but one entity. We will come  back to this House in a moment.   The White House hasn't seemed to have heard their outcry, but the  gentlewoman from Ohio and I, the Democratic Caucus, we have heard.   What has taken place is wrong; simply wrong. You would think that the  President would correct the situation. In fact, today, he had the  opportunity to condemn anti-Semitism at his press conference with Prime  Minister Netanyahu, and he didn't do it. In fact, when he was asked on  this very subject of the failure to mention the Jewish people of the  Holocaust, he used the opportunity not to clarify his position, but to  make reference to how great his election victory was.   In watching that press conference, as disturbed as I was about the  answer from our President, I was more than a bit disappointed, quite  frankly, by Prime Minister Netanyahu's failure to challenge the  President on that. I wish Prime Minister Netanyahu would have asked  President Trump to change his statement; not to whitewash what was  done, but to change his statement on the Holocaust. I still hope that  the Prime Minister does that in the time that he is here.   So this Special Order tonight will help us set the record straight,  not just on behalf of the millions of Jewish Americans across this  country, but to send a clear message to all those who engage in this  type of behavior.   I ask this question: Where are our Republican colleagues on this  issue?   Do you hear that? Silence.   We have given them opportunity after opportunity to speak out against  what the White House has done, but our Republican colleagues refuse to  criticize the White House for the omission of the Jewish people in the  Holocaust resolution.   Could you imagine for a moment what the outcry would have been had  President Obama accidentally omitted this, putting aside purposely  omitting it, but the outcry if he had accidentally omitted the  mentioning of the Jewish people in his annual statement? He never did  that, though, nor did President Bush, as the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms.  Kaptur) has pointed out. This was no mistake. It was a willful  omission. Yet still, nothing from our Republican colleagues.   The gentlewoman from Ohio knows that I have offered a resolution. We  will continue to ask our Republican colleagues to join us on that  resolution asking the White House to set the record straight and to  include the mentioning of the Final Solution and the attempt by the  Nazi regime to eliminate the Jewish people from the face of the Earth.                                time  1945    We will use every legislative mechanism possible to do that, whether  it is a motion to discharge, whatever that will be. I am putting my  Republican colleagues on notice, because they must raise their voices.  They must raise their voices to what has taken place in this White  House. Whether it is Steve Bannon and those who work within the cellar,  the deep cellar of the White House who came up with this resolution to  purposely omit the mentioning of the Jewish people, our Republican  colleagues will either have to answer for the White House and defend it  or condemn it. You can't have it both ways.   I want to thank the gentlewoman from Ohio once again for bringing us  together. It needed to be done. We will continue to raise this question  until the White House comes to its senses and sets the record straight  and does no longer continue to enable Holocaust deniers. I thank the  gentlewoman from Ohio for holding this Special Order this evening.
