 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms.  Marion Johnson for her contribution to landing a man on the Moon 50  years ago this month.   A product of the First Congressional District of Georgia, Ms. Johnson  used her love of math to break barriers throughout her life not only in  math and science but also for women and people of color.   With a math degree from Talladega College, Ms. Johnson took a risk  and applied to become one of the first female and/or minority engineers  at Boeing. She was accepted. By chance, it happened to be around the  same time that President Kennedy announced the national mission of  sending a man to the Moon.   At Boeing, she worked on a team of engineers with the specific  mission of putting a man on the Moon.  [[Page H7254]]    In her own words, she said, ``We worked hard. We worked Saturdays. We  worked afternoons and evenings until we got it right.''   The rest is history. Now, Ms. Johnson's name is enshrined in the  Apollo Saturn V Roll of Honor at the Smithsonian and Library of  Congress.   I could not have been prouder to have someone like Ms. Johnson from  the First Congressional District of Georgia contributing to this  engineering marvel that changed world history.           Recognizing Blackshear Times' Robert and Cheryl Williams     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. and  Mrs. Robert and Cheryl Williams, who are retiring after nearly 50 years  of running the Blackshear Times in the First Congressional District of  Georgia.   The oldest business in the area, the newspaper is 150 years old this  year. Under Mr. and Mrs. Williams' leadership, the Blackshear Times has  become one of the top papers in Georgia, receiving over 400 awards.  Nearly everyone in Pierce County gets their news from the newspaper,  exemplified in the Blackshear Times tag line, ``Liked by Many, Cussed  by Some, Read by Them All.''   Mr. Williams edited and published, his dream job since he was a young  child. Mrs. Williams continually kept the paper's financials in check.   ``To be a good paper, first, you have to be a good business,'' Mr.  Williams said in praise of his wife's work.   I am proud to have the Blackshear Times in my district, and I am  thankful that Mr. and Mrs. Williams dedicated 50 years to the paper and  keeping the Blackshear community informed.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Mr. and Mrs. Williams on their  retirement. They both will be missed.                 Recognizing Holocaust Survivor Sam Weinreich     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Sam  Weinreich, who is celebrating not only his 100th birthday in August but  also his 73rd wedding anniversary with his wife, Frieda.   Referred to as Zadie, from Yiddish, Mr. Weinreich is a Holocaust  survivor who spent time in both the Auschwitz and Dachau concentration  camps. He was the only survivor from his family, which included nine of  his siblings. His hometown, Lodz, Poland, once contained over 200,000  Jews and the second largest Jewish community in Europe.   After the Nazi occupation ended, Mr. Weinreich was one of only 6,000  to survive. Mr. Weinreich survived in part because he was a Jewish  doctor and received more privileges than other prisoners, but he also  had a beautiful voice and would sing songs in front of the guards for  food.   Now living in Memphis, Tennessee, Mr. Weinreich has dedicated his  life to sharing his story and ensuring that a tragedy of this magnitude  will never happen again.   Mr. Speaker, happy birthday and anniversary, Zadie.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Stopping Bad Robocalls  Act. This legislation will seek to stem a problem affecting nearly  everyone I know, and that is the issue of robocalls.   Last year, we had almost 50 billion robocalls in the United States.  This year, we have already had almost 30 billion robocalls, or roughly  90 robocalls per person.   It is an issue that everyone can agree is a nuisance and should be  addressed. That is why I join my colleagues in supporting this  legislation to end this practice and once again make it possible to  answer a phone call from a phone number you don't recognize.   This bill will give the FCC the authority to move forward with  changes under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act and to ensure that  these changes will lead to an effective effort to get rid of unwanted  robocalls.   Not only will we see a greater ability to stop these, but we will see  penalties that will, hopefully, deter future efforts by bad actors.   Madam Speaker, I applaud my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce  Committee for their work on this legislation, especially since it is an  issue that affects everyone. For this reason, I urge my colleagues to  support this legislation and to help us get this bill to the finish  line.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, reauthorizing the Autism CARES Act will continue the  scientific development in understanding autism and support those with  autism spectrum disorder.   Since its original passage in 2006, we have invested over $3 billion  for the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention, and Health Resources and Services Administration to  help the autism community.   We provided services through programs and grants to benefit  individuals with autism. We have improved training for those working  with autistic patients, including how to better deter and diagnose  autism.   We have expanded prevalence monitoring to improve our understanding  of our population, and we have also invested in research that  transforms our understanding of autism spectrum disorder and how we  were able to treat and care for that community.   In Georgia, we are able to see up close what a big impact these  programs can make in our children's lives. Children's Hospital of  Atlanta's Marcus Autism Center is one of the largest autism centers in  the U.S. Since opening, they have treated more than 40,000 children  from Georgia and across the country, and we are blessed to have them in  our State.   This reauthorization builds on our good work from the past, ensuring  that places like the Marcus Autism Center can continue helping our  children moving forward. I encourage my colleagues to support this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in support of H.R. 776, the  Emergency Medical Services for Children Program Reauthorization Act of  2019.   I would like to thank Representatives Peter King and Kathy Castor for  their work on this important legislation.   The Emergency Medical Services for Children program was enacted in  1984 to provide grant funding to increase the ability of emergency  medical systems to care for pediatric populations. Not only does this  program provide funding so that emergency departments and hospitals can  equip themselves with the appropriate pediatric medical tools, it  enables partnerships and drives research and innovation in emergency  care for children.   Whether children require emergency care following a car crash or fall  ill in the middle of the night with nowhere else to turn, our emergency  medical system needs to have staff trained in how to treat children. A  major part of that is providing the resources to equip healthcare  professionals with the right size medical tools.   The Emergency Medical Services for Children program provides grants  for the State Partnership Program to integrate pediatric care into the  EMS system and reduce pediatric morbidity and mortality. States can  focus on providing quality prehospital and hospital-based care, in  addition to establishing plans to handle disaster and trauma care.   Our Nation's healthcare workforce still has much to learn about the  treatment of pediatric populations, which is why continued research  through the Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network is  crucial. This body is the first federally funded pediatric emergency  medicine research network in the country and conducts a wide variety of  research about acute illness and injuries in children.   The reauthorization of the Emergency Medical Services for Children  program is critical to maintaining and improving pediatric emergency  care. Mr. Speaker, I urge strong support of H.R. 776, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 2507, the Newborn  Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2019.   Newborn screening is critical in early detection and intervention for  conditions, some life-threatening, for our Nation's infants. These  screenings inform both physicians and the families of a newborn what  steps may be necessary to treat or prevent further health complications  as the infant ages.   The Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act, which passed for the first  time in 2008, aims to improve the ability to address pediatric health  by standardizing newborn screening programs.                                time  2200    Newborn screenings are incredibly important in providing physicians  and families with information regarding their baby's health, enabling  them to practice early intervention and treatment, if necessary.   According to the March of Dimes, in 2017, only 10 States and  Washington, D.C., required infant screening for the recommended  disorders.   Since enactment of the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act, all the  States, D.C., and Puerto Rico screen for at least 29 of the 35  recommended conditions.   This bill would reauthorize funding for the Health Resources and  Services Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention, and the National Institutes of Health to ensure that our  newborn screening remains comprehensive and that our Nation's  healthcare providers are adequately equipped to conduct the screenings.   Newborn screenings are for serious but rare conditions that families  and doctors may otherwise be unable to detect at birth.   Newborns are screened in the hospital when they are 1 or 2 days old  by blood tests, in addition to hearing and heart screenings. About 1 in  300 newborns has a condition that can be detected via newborn  screening.   By catching these disorders early, many can be managed successfully,  allowing children to live fuller, better lives. However, if not  detected and left untreated, these conditions can impact a child for  the rest of their life by causing disabilities, delays in development,  illness, or even death.   Prior to the passage of the initial bill in 2008, States had varying  standards for newborn screening. Some States were only screening for 4  conditions in 2002, when other States were screening for more than 30.   Reauthorizing the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Act will allow the  CDC to work with States to continue to level the playing field and  provide for equal access to newborn screenings across the country.   H.R. 2507 also reauthorizes grants through the Health Resources and  Services Administration that not only allows for expansion of screening  programs but improved follow-up care after a detection.   The bill also allows for the continuation of the National Institutes  of Health Hunter Kelly Newborn Screening program, which helps to  identify new treatments for conditions detected in newborn screenings.   I applaud Representatives Roybal-Allard and Simpson for their work on  this bill, and I urge my fellow Members to support H.R. 2507.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers at this time. I urge passage  of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 693, the PAST Act. In a  bipartisan fashion, this bill takes a step forward to protect horses  from abuse and make the practice of ``soring'' something of the past.   As with many other professions, I know the vast majority of breeders  and trainers care deeply about their horses and their businesses.   As someone who has been a practicing pharmacist for over 30 years, I  can tell you that there is nothing more offensive than people in your  profession who don't follow the rules. That is why it is so important  to address the small number of bad actors and ensure that the men and  women who follow the rules have the ability to operate in a profession  they care so deeply about.   Although the practice of soring is already banned and the industry  takes action to police itself, there are still examples of this  occurring in the United States.   Additionally, loopholes in Federal law often disallowed the United  States Department of Agriculture from taking action against those  individuals who are soring their horses. That is why this bill is so  important.   H.R. 639 amends the 1976 Horse Protection Act to make important  changes in enforcement and to address any criteria that could lead to  soring.   In addition to the technical provisions laid out in this bill, it is  an example of the work that can be accomplished when both sides of the  aisle work together.   While I would have preferred we address this in the Energy and  Commerce Committee, we are here because of the widespread support for  this legislation, which has 307 cosponsors. Simply put, we are here  because we want to improve the support and strengthen it, not weaken  it.   It is my hope that we can continue to work on these and other issues  together to ensure a better industry for all of those involved.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho), a veterinarian, who  has worked on this bill tirelessly and has done a yeoman's job at  getting it to this point here.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. DesJarlais).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds  to the gentleman from Tennessee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. John W. Rose).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Budd).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me  in  [[Page H7374]]  supporting H.R. 693, and I yield back the balance of my time.
