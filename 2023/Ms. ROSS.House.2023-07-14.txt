 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the epidemic of gun  violence  [[Page H3581]]  in America, which continues to inflict bloodshed and heartbreak on our  communities.   Last week, Americans were supposed to be celebrating the Fourth of  July, but big cities and small towns across the country were once again  devastated by senseless gun violence.   In October, my own Raleigh community joined the long line of American  communities forever changed by a mass shooting. We should not have to  live this way.   While we took a momentous step forward last summer by passing  bipartisan, commonsense reform, we must do more. I am proud that the  Raleigh Police Department is leading the charge through education,  awareness, and prevention.   June was Gun Violence Awareness Month, but the call for action  shouldn't end then. Today and every day, we must work together to end  gun violence once and for all.                            ____________________
