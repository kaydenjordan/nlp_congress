 Mr. President, first of all, I appreciate the opportunity  to get wedged in here. There are a number of very interesting things  happening today. One is the CRA that I am very much concerned about. I  know that my good friend from Massachusetts did not misrepresent  something intentionally; however, this is a little bit more complicated  than people think it is.    I spoke earlier this week on our need to roll back a lot of these  regulations that were handed down during the Obama administration. They  are all a part of that War on Fossil Fuels, and as you hear, that war  is still going on with some of those individuals. However, President  Obama is gone, and now we have to look at some of these  overregulations.   For a number of years, I chaired the Environment and Public Works  Committee. During that period of time, that particular committee had  the jurisdiction over the EPA, which is where most of the bad  regulations came from. When I say ``bad regulations,'' I am talking  about the overregulations that make it very difficult for our companies  to compete with foreign companies that don't have these types of  regulations.   Let me share something that is not very well understood, and that is  what a CRA really is. There are a lot of people of the liberal  persuasion who would like very much to have everything they could  regulated in Washington, DC. For example, one of the fights we had was  the WOTUS fight. If you ask any of the farmers and ranchers in  America--not just in my State of Oklahoma but Nebraska and many other  States--what is the most serious problem they have, they would say it  is the overregulation of the EPA. If you ask them, of all the  regulations, which ones are the most difficult for the farmers out  there trying to scratch a living, they will say it is the regulations  on water.   Historically, the jurisdiction of water is a State jurisdiction. Now,  a liberal always wants that jurisdiction to be with the Federal  Government in Washington. That is their nature. I don't criticize them  for that. They believe that. But if you ask the farmers in my State of  Oklahoma, they will say they don't want that to happen. Historically,  water has always been the State's jurisdiction, with the exception of  navigable water. We understand that navigable water should have a  Federal jurisdiction. In fact, I would have to say there was a real  effort 6 years ago by a Senator who at that time was representing the  State of Wisconsin and a House Member who was representing a district  in Minnesota. Those two individuals introduced legislation to take the  word ``navigable'' out of water regulations so the Federal Government  would have jurisdiction over all of the water in the States as opposed  to the State having that jurisdiction. Not only did we defeat the  legislation, but both of those Members were defeated in the polls when  they came up for reelection on that issue. The people are clearly on  our side.   Where does a CRA come in? A CRA is something that has been used to  shed light on what we are doing here. I am talking about with respect  to our elected representatives. If there are regulations that are  punitive to the businesses back home, when the Senator goes back to his  or her State, they can say: Well, that wasn't I, that was an unelected  bureaucrat who did that. I am opposed to it. They have a shield so  people don't really know where they stand. A CRA takes away that shield  because the CRA challenges a regulation, and it has to be voted on,  forcing Members of the Senate and the House to be responsible for how  they are really voting. It is a way of shedding light.   We have a lot of CRAs coming. One is going to be a CRA that I  sponsored having to do with a regulation in the Dodd-Frank bill, in  section 1504. As I mentioned, most of the overregulations come from the  EPA, but this particular regulation didn't come from the EPA. It came  from the Dodd-Frank banking legislation having to do with financial  services. It is in a section that had nothing to do with financial  services. Section 1504 requires all information to be made public that  would come from a bid. In the United States of America, our oil and gas  companies are in the private sector, but in China it is run by the  government. If we are competing for an oil and gas issue that might be  in Tanzania and we are competing with China, China would be competing  as a government, and we would be doing it  [[Page S622]]  in the private sector. Section 1504 requires the private sector to  disclose all elements of their bid when they are competing for a  contract with China. The reason for this initially was to preclude a  country's leaders from attempting to steal money that was given to them  for a certain oil project. With this disclosure, they would not be able  to do it. Well, you don't have to have all the components of the bid.  All you have to have is the top line, how much money was actually sent  to, in this case, the country of Tanzania.   The courts came along in 2014 and said this regulation was wrong.  There are a couple of problems. One problem is that there is no reason  in the world that you should have a mandate to disclose all the details  of a bid because that is giving away information to the competition,  giving the other side an advantage. The other problem is the expense of  it. We are talking about $600 million a year that would be borne by the  private sector in America that China would not have to pay. So it only  punishes those within the United States.   After the courts threw this out, the SEC should have reworked the  rule. They were instructed to rework the rule so every detail of the  bidding did not have to be disclosed, just the total amount. That  solved the problem that was perceived to be out there because then it  would be known that so much money, for instance, maybe a check for $50  million, would go out, and we wouldn't have to break down the details  of it. The main thing is, we need to know, in good government--and that  was the intention in the first place--how much money was going to a  foreign government.   Some have argued that the CRA is motivated by companies who want to  get around transparency. That is clearly not the case. The courts have  said it is not the case. Oil and gas companies in particular are  longstanding supporters of greater transparency initiatives such as the  Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, the EITI, that is a  multilateral, multistakeholder global initiative composed of energy  companies, civil society organizations, and host governments. The EITI  rules would apply equally to all companies that would be operating in a  country. That would level the playing field.    We have also heard from those on the left saying that voting to  repeal the rule would be a vote in favor of corruption. Yet,  importantly, the United States already has in place the Foreign Corrupt  Practices Act, which prohibits the paying of bribes to foreign  officials to assist in obtaining or trying to retain business. The  Federal Government is able to bring civil enforcement actions against  companies that violate this rule, and section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank  Act did not change that. That was in place before and is still in place  now. If we pass the CRA and eliminate section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank  Act, it is not going to change things.   There are others in the humanitarian community who have expressed  concern to me that the CRA will undermine efforts to fight corruption  in other governments around the world. Let me assure you that I support  your goal.   The courts were emphatic when they said this regulation should be  repealed. In fact, it was taken down by the court way back in 2013.  Well, it has come back up again. What we want to do is merely comply  with what the courts told us to do in 2013, and that is to use the CRA  to knock out this section 1504 and go back and rewrite it to take out  merely the requirement for a breakdown of all the individual elements  of a contract. That is something we intend to do.   I see my good friend from West Virginia, who I think would understand  just as well as anyone that when I go back to my State of Oklahoma,  they say to me: You have a President--this was back when President  Obama was President--who has a War on Fossil Fuels. Fossil fuels are  coal, oil, gas, and I would include nuclear. Coming from my State of  Oklahoma, they ask: Explain how, if 89 percent of the power that is  generated in America comes from fossil fuels and nuclear and they are  successful in doing away with it, how do we run this machine called  America? The answer is, we can't. We have to have it.   I think we all understand what we want to do is have this rule  changed so we are not put at a competitive disadvantage so we are able  to go ahead and compete with countries that have a government-run  system. To be able to do that, we need to rewrite this particular act.  Again, the courts have already agreed to that and that is what we are  attempting to do.   For those concerned about the timing and speed of the CRA, I have  good news. The actual rule is not set to go into effect until 2018  anyway. The more swiftly we can enact the CRA, the more time it will  give us and the SEC to rework it. This is something that is perfectly  acceptable.   Some of my critics say we can't come back with a rule that is  substantially the same. This will not be substantially the same.  Actually, this is what the court recommended in 2013.   In closing, I want to ask this question: If we put forth a rule that  makes it harder for U.S. companies overseas, who will fill the void?  The U.S. companies have the best environmental standards, the best  labor practices, and the least corruption of many of the other  countries. However, if this vacuum is there, the business will go to  companies from China, India, and Mexico that don't care about pollution  and don't care about labor standards. That is not what we want to have  happen. What we need to do is foster a strong competitive environment,  with reduced corruption overseas, for the benefit of those living under  these governments.   So I invite my colleagues to join me in this effort to do away with  this regulation through the CRA and to repeal section 1504 of Dodd- Frank and rewrite it so it accomplishes the goal of stopping corruption  and at the same time is not going to put us at a competitive  disadvantage.   With that, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.    Will the Senator from Ohio yield for a request?   I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the remarks of the  Senator from Ohio, I be recognized for up to 5 minutes.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?    Mr. President, I know that President Obama is gone now,  but his War on Fossil Fuels is alive and well. However, they are not  winning that.   Back in Oklahoma, they ask me the question sometimes: If all of the  liberals are concerned and if they are all opposed to fossil fuels--and  to nuclear, I might add; coal, oil, gas, and nuclear--if coal, oil,  gas, and nuclear are responsible for 89 percent of the power it takes  to run this country, how do you run the country without those? Those  are the kinds of questions we get.   I appreciate and--I know it is a very popular statement that was made  by my friend from Ohio; unfortunately, it has nothing to do with the  issues we are looking at right now.   Back during the time Dodd-Frank was considered, it was dealing with  banks and financial institutions. It had nothing to do with energy. Yet  section 1504 was put in there. Part of section 1504 required that  information be provided during the course of a competitive situation  for some kind of a project.   I will give you an example. We have a private sector in our oil and  gas. For China, that is a government project. If we are competing with  them--let's say for some cause that is in Tanzania or someplace--they  said, so that there is a safeguard and there can't be corruption, so  that if we should win--I say ``we,'' but I am talking about the private  sector in the United States of America--then they have to report the  information to the SEC, which in turn makes it published. Their intent  was not to have to break down everything that was in that offer. It is  the bottom line.   What is the total cost that goes to these countries? What are the  total costs? That is all they care about because if that money went to  Tanzania--and there are some corrupt officials there and they might  steal some of the money, but to keep that from happening, we want to  report what the cost was in the winning party. You don't have to have  all that information.   In fact, in 2013, the court struck this down because they said that  was not the intent. The intent was to have the total figure, so they  said, even suggested--and our intent at that time was to vacate that,  as the court did vacate that rule and send it back and have the SEC  redo it in such a way that it would affect only the amount of money  that would go that might cause some corruption at some time. That is  what it was all about. Unfortunately, they put together another one  that was very similar and required a lot of information that was not  necessary.   I would like to correct something on the CRA that the Senator from  Ohio said. The CRA is there because when an unelected bureaucrat comes  out with some kind of an unreasonable rule that is very costly to the  people of this country and it is done by someone who is not an elected  official, the elected official says: Look at this. Wait a minute. This  is something that people are complaining about when I go home.   They love that because they can say: This wasn't me. This wasn't me.  This was an unelected bureaucrat that put these rules in.   What a CRA does is make us in the House and in the Senate more  accountable because we have to then stand up and vote on something,  saying that we endorse this rule or we don't endorse this rule. That is  what it is all about.   Anyway, we have an opportunity here to go ahead, and I am certainly  [[Page S638]]  hoping that we will do this and change this rule so that it would make  as a requirement nothing but the amount of money that is paid by the  winning party in a situation where they are competing with each other.   If that happens, then we will know how much money that was, and we  will be able to go to the party and find out if they are stealing some  of this money. Why is it necessary to have all of the components of  competition when you have the private sector in the United States of  America competing with countries like China where it is a government- owned institution?   That is all this is about. All we want to do is to be able say we  want to report so that the public knows how much the total bid or, in  this case, the total amount was, not all the components that went into  the calculation of that. That is all it is about.   My time has expired.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Young). The majority leader.                              Order of Business    Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I wish to lay out the schedule for  everyone. I know they are interested in knowing the way forward. I have  discussed with the Democratic leader where we go from here.   The Senate is going to debate the pending joint resolution tonight  for as long as there is interest in debate. Tomorrow the Senate will  convene at 6:30 a.m. and immediately proceed to two rollcall votes:  passage of the joint resolution of disapproval and cloture on the  nomination of Betsy DeVos.   Restating that, debate tonight as long as our friends on the other  side would like to debate, and tomorrow we will convene at 6:30 a.m.  and immediately turn to two rollcall votes: passage of the joint  resolution of disapproval and cloture on the nomination of Betsy DeVos.
