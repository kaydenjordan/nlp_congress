 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Buchanan for all  his hard work on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of H.R. 6756, the American  Innovation Act.   Over the last 9 months since we passed once-in-a-lifetime tax reform,  small businesses have been empowered by those positive changes to  expand operations, hire new workers, reward employees with bonuses or  increased pay, and keep jobs here at home.   In central and west central Illinois, in my district, we have seen  firsthand how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has alleviated businesses of  the burdensome Tax Code we were under before, giving companies all  across different sectors and sizes the ability to innovate and grow  into businesses.   They are companies such as Rivian Automotive in Bloomington-Normal,  Illinois, who is creating state-of-the-art full electric-powered  pickups and SUVs. They announced in May they will be manufacturing  their trucks in Bloomington-Normal, bringing jobs and economic  opportunity to our community.   AutonomouStuff in Morton, Illinois, has evolved into a worldwide  leader in the development of innovative software and engineering  technologies that enable robotics and autonomy.   Precision Planting in Tremont, Illinois, is testing agriculture  practices so that farmers all across the heartland can find innovative  ways to increase production and sustain equipment, making central  Illinois the Silicon Valley of the Midwest.   With the largest medical community in downstate Illinois, the  innovative breakthroughs at our local healthcare systems, such as OSF  HealthCare's Jump Trading Simulation Center in Peoria, or the Memorial  Center for Learning and Innovation in Springfield, serve as catalysts  for reforming how healthcare is delivered by making healthcare safer,  more accessible, and affordable.                                time  1430    The American Innovation Act, which we are presenting today after a  lot of thoughtful work by the committee, builds upon the economic  successes small businesses have seen over the last 9 months, unleashing  entrepreneurs' innovative spirit, so they can continue to grow,  prosper, and succeed.   Since the recession, creation of new businesses has taken a  significant downturn, and it is time we reform our Tax Code so  entrepreneurs have the ability to achieve their goals.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Chairman Buchanan and Chairman Brady for their  hard work and urge my colleagues to support this bill.
