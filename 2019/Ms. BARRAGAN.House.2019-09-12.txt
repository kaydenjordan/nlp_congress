 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 1146 and  protecting one of our Nation's greatest treasures from becoming the  spoils of an industry that recklessly puts profits ahead of risks to  the environment.   After nearly four decades of protection, earned by virtue of its  diverse wildlife habitats and scenic wonders, the Trump administration  wants to sell off the heartbeat of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  to the highest bidders. Buried in the small print of a tax giveaway,  the President removed critical habitat protections with the stroke of a  pen, leaving more than 250 wildlife species, like the polar bear,  exposed to potential disaster at the hands of the oil industry.   This action is not only a complete failure of the government's  stewardship of these natural habitats, but completely unnecessary,  considering the United States is already the world's largest producer  of petroleum. Why threaten a fragile ecosystem that is already under  terrible threat from climate change?   We owe it to the planet, to future generations of Americans, and to  the two-thirds of American people who are opposed to drilling in this  iconic landscape to pass this protection act.
