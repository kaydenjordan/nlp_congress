 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the importance of  raising the minimum wage for millions in our country. This important  legislation raises the wage for 45 percent of workers in my district,  and provides a wage increase of nearly $640,000.   The Raise the Wage Act will indeed lift thousands of my constituents  out of poverty and provide opportunity for economic mobility. However,  I would like to highlight the work I have done on this legislation to  make it more amenable to small, family owned businesses.   While I certainly acknowledge that every day Americans deserve a  raise, we in Congress must be above rhetoric and talking points. With  such a significant change proposed to the minimum wage, this must be  carried out in a precise, tactful manner. As of June of this year, the  unemployment rate in the United States is a mere 3.7 percent. It is  critical that policies we pass through this House do not interrupt or  deter this economic prosperity.   Furthermore, while I support this important legislation, we must  consider how it will affect small businesses and their economic  futures. Therefore, I have negotiated with the Committee a provision to  lengthen the phase in period to $15 minimum wage until the year 2026.   Additionally, I am a co-sponsor of the O'Halleran Amendment. This  amendment will require a comprehensive GAO report on national and  regional economic impacts of the minimum wage increases in this bill.  The report will have a special focus on small business and agricultural  sectors. It will facilitate Congress' ability to make policy changes  based on the actual economic effects of this legislation.   Lastly, I submitted two amendments that exempt local and small farms,  as well as small businesses from the $15 minimum wage. These amendments  delayed the minimum wage from reaching $15 until the year 2029, as well  as kept the current ``tipped-wage'' provision for restaurant workers. I  also sought to create a small business tax credit, along with providing  two additional years to comply with a doubling of the federal minimum  wage.   By providing tax credits, compliance exemptions, and a longer runway  to $15, my amendments intended to give small businesses the tools they  need to thrive in the economy this bill will create.   I was disappointed that my amendments were not included in this  measure, but will work for their inclusion elsewhere given the vast  economic benefits that small businesses provide in my community, and  around the country. There are over 30 million small businesses in the  United States today. Additionally, there are 24.3 million individually  operated businesses with no employees. Small businesses employ over 60  million Americans--nearly half of the private workforce--and there are  now over 287,000 small business exporters.   The United States small business community contributes approximately  $8.5 trillion to the economy, roughly half of the United States total  $17 trillion GDP.   Small businesses are the back bone of our country, and the engine  that drives our economy. While I will vote in favor of this  legislation, I hope to have my amendments incorporated as this bill  moves through the legislative process. I include them for the Record.   Passage of this act is simply the first step. As this legislation  heads over to the Senate, I look forward to working with my friends to  improve this bill and ensure further small businesses provisions are  included, as well as with my colleagues in the House on future  legislation that would help address these concerns.   Mr. Speaker, I thank you for the time to recognize the importance of  small businesses to our great nation, and the need to pay Americans a  living wage.
