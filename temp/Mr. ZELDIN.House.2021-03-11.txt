 Madam Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 125th  anniversary of the Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America.   Jewish War Veterans was founded on March 15, 1896, by 63 Jewish Civil  War veterans after several anti-Semitic comments were made claiming  there was a lack of Jewish participation during the Civil War.   Since then, the Jewish War Veterans have made it their mission to  fight anti-Semitism and advocate for Jewish servicemembers and veterans  from all walks of life.   Whether it was supporting Jewish servicemembers fighting Nazi Germany  during World War II or establishing the National Museum of American  Jewish History, the Jewish War Veterans have never stopped supporting  its members, Jewish servicemembers, and our veterans.   As a fellow member of the Jewish War Veterans, thank you for your  service to our Nation and our veterans, and congratulations again on  125 incredible years. May there be many more to come.                            ____________________
