 Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize Mr. Vic  Bird on the occasion of his retirement. Vic has been a champion for the  Oklahoma aviation community for nearly two decades. He most recently  served as the director of the Oklahoma Aeronautics Commission for 18  years, the longest serving director in Oklahoma history.   You would never know it, but back in 2002, Vic Bird was a newcomer to  aviation. Nevertheless, there is no one in State government who worked  harder to make Oklahoma the aviation capital of America. Vic Bird led  the charge on numerous State legislative initiatives that brought  aviation employers to Oklahoma, and the proof is in one number. Today,  aviation and aerospace is Oklahoma's second largest industry, with an  annual economic impact of $44 billion.   Throughout his tenure at the Oklahoma Aeronautics Commission, Vic has  been a true friend to general aviation, supporting pilots and airports.  Vic Bird was instrumental in making sure Oklahoma State law protected  pilots at public-use and military airports by keeping dangerous  structures from being built too close to airport infrastructure. Vic  Bird promoted airports as anchor institutions supporting economic  development and job growth in communities across Oklahoma and joined me  in an aerial tour of general aviation airports across Oklahoma back in  June 2017.   Before I conclude, I want to highlight two of the awards and  recognitions Vic Bird has received that speak volumes of his commitment  to aviation. The Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association awards the  Joseph B. ``Doc'' Hartranft Jr. Award to an individual in government  service who has made significant contributions to the advancement of  general aviation. Vic Bird was the first and only nonelected official  to receive this award. Vic Bird is also the first and only Oklahoman  elected to serve as chair of the National Association of State Aviation  Officials.   Vic Bird has remained an unwavering passionate advocate for aviation  and aerospace in Oklahoma. I know I join his family and all that know  him, in thanking him for his years of service and contributions to  Oklahoma and our entire aviation community.   Congratulations on your retirement.                            ____________________
