 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, last year the Nation was shocked by  undercover videos produced by investigative journalists with the Center  for Medical Progress exposing Planned Parenthood's sale of fetal body  parts and the callousness with which Planned Parenthood officials  described their grisly work.   As we know, as Planned Parenthood and its allies in the mainstream  media hoped, outrage fades with time, and attention turns--but not for  long, for the abortion industry and its profiteers are never really  beset by scandal. They are a scandal.   Just last month we got another reminder about the reality behind the  talking points. Once again, it was the undercover journalists of the  Center for Medical Progress doing the investigative journalism the  mainstream media refuses to do. Once again, the video has been ignored  by the pro-abortion media elite, whose principal interest is the story  of the prosecution of the journalists for daring to speak this truth to  their power.   The American people and their representatives in the U.S. Senate  deserve to know what the new video shows. It shows the founder of  Planned Parenthood's Consortium of Abortion Providers on a conference  panel. She recounts a harrowing experience while performing an  abortion: ``An eyeball just fell down into my lap, and that is gross.''  Her remarks were greeted with laughter from the audience.   It shows another Planned Parenthood doctor stating: ``The fetus is a  tough little object, so taking it apart in the womb is very  difficult.''   This comment echoes a previous undercover video in which a Planned  Parenthood doctor says that the bones of a 20-week old fetus were so  strong that ``I have to hit the gym for this.''   The video shows the director of abortion services for Planned  Parenthood Gulf Coast saying that she sometimes uses forceps to ``pull  off a leg or two'' to ensure an unborn child dies before being born--in  other words, to avoid the moment when our Nation's laws might protect  that child.   The video shows the medical director of Planned Parenthood in  Michigan talking about surprising common ground between abortion  doctors and pro-life activists.         We might actually both agree that there is violence in       here. Let's just give them all the violence, it's a person,       it's killing. Let's just give them all that.    That is not what they say in public. It certainly isn't what they  tell their patients, the women who come into their clinics--just in  private, at industry conferences, between networking opportunities and  drinks at the open bar. Because they know--deep down, everyone knows  the Center for Medical Progress videos shock, but they do not surprise.  They don't teach us anything we don't already know. All they do is  remind us of an inconvenient truth that demands our attention and our  action.   It is certainly stirring the pro-abortion political machine into  action. As expected, the Center for Medical Progress is once again the  target of criminal and civil investigations designed to intimidate  further questions about the abortion industry's methods and money. But  the truth is out. It is there.   As we know, threats and intimidation are tactics of guilt and  desperation of the losing side in every battle  [[Page S3350]]  that has ever been fought. If Planned Parenthood were what they have  publicly declared themselves to be, they would welcome transparency. We  all know why they hide because we know what they hide.   The question, as always, is not what they will do, but what we will  do. And the answer is always ``as much as we can.'' We can start by  enforcing existing abortion laws and by reforming others, for example,  making the Mexico City policy permanent so taxpayer money is not used  to promote abortions to disadvantaged people overseas or ending  abortion after 20 weeks when unborn children begin to feel pain. We can  confirm Federal judges who follow the Constitution rather than reverse  engineer their preferred policy outcomes.    The truth about abortion is spreading because of advances in medical  imaging, because of brave journalists, tireless activists,  compassionate doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals.  Statehouses are passing laws to protect American women and their  children. The rising generation of young Americans is the most pro-life  in decades because they know too.   Little by little, the truth is fighting free, like green shoots  through the frost. One day soon, we will reaffirm our Nation's  principles in their dignified fullness and avow, once again, that all  men are created equal. All are entitled to life.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
