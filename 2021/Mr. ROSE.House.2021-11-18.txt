 Madam Speaker, today, I come to the House floor to speak on  behalf of business owners and employees and healthcare providers,  including employees at Cookeville Regional Medical Center who are  concerned about President Biden's unconstitutional vaccine mandate.   If the Biden administration mandate is allowed to take effect, there  is a strong possibility that Cookeville Regional Medical Center, the  hospital in my hometown where I was born and where my two sons were  born, will not have the staff necessary to carry on normal operations.   The Biden administration's plan to mandate vaccines will devastate  medical facilities throughout the country. Let me be clear. President  Biden's mandates on medical facilities will dramatically exacerbate the  current medical worker shortage in my State and in my district.   While I encourage everyone to consult with their doctors and consider  joining me in being vaccinated, it is not the Federal Government's  place, under the current circumstances, to mandate a vaccine. That is  why I am calling on President Biden to end his indiscriminate vaccine  mandate.  [[Page H6375]]                                ____________________
