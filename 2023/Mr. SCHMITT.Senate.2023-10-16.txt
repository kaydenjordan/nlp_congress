 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the  executive director of the Missouri Pork Association, Don Nikodim.   In September, Don announced he would be retiring in January 2024  after 40 years at the Missouri Pork Association as their executive  director. He is well-respected by everyone in Missouri's agricultural  community, and he is truly a champion for Missouri's pork industry.  Under his leadership, the Missouri Pork Association has hit many  milestones when advocating for needed policy, educating producers, and  ensuring commonsense practices.   From eating ribs and candied bacon at the Pork Place at Missouri's  State Fair, to visits to my Washington, DC, office, Don is always a  welcoming and friendly face wherever I see him. As a graduate of the  University of Missouri, with degrees in animal science, agricultural  economics, and agricultural education, Don has always been a wealth of  knowledge in the agricultural sector. Those around him always benefit  from his expertise. I am glad for how closely I got to work with Don  and the Missouri Pork Association, during my time as Missouri's  attorney general, as we worked together to combat ridiculous  regulations by the Federal Government that hurt our pork industry.   Don will be greatly missed in this role, but I wish him the best in  his well-deserved retirement. This is the end of an era for the  Missouri Pork Association, and now, they have some very big shoes to  fill.   I applaud Don for his over 40 years of commitment, hard work, and  leadership in Missouri's pork industry, and I ask my Senate colleagues  to join me in honoring his incredible career and unrelenting passion  for Missouri's pork industry.                            ____________________
