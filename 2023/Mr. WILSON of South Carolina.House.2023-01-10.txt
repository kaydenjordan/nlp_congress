 Mr. Speaker, I am grateful that with a  new Congress is new leadership.   Congratulations to Speaker Kevin McCarthy.   Speaker McCarthy has a proven record of accomplishments for the  American people, and his leadership will be enhanced with Majority  Leader   Steve Scalise, Majority Whip   Tom Emmer, Republican  Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, Republican Conference Vice Chair    Mike Johnson, National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman  Richard Hudson, and Policy Committee Chairman Gary Palmer.   The Republican majority will immediately begin to implement the  Commitment to America that Speaker McCarthy coordinated with input from  across the country. It promotes an economy that is strong, a Nation  that is safe, a future that is built on freedom, and a government that  is accountable.   Legislation begins with the Family and Small Business Taxpayer  Protection Act, which defunds Biden's army of 87,000 new IRS agents.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who have successfully protected  America for 20 years in the global war on terrorism as it continues  from Afghanistan's safe haven to America.   Our sympathy to the family of magnificent Lynette ``Diamond''  Hardaway of North Carolina, and we welcome Delegate Jim Moylan of Guam.                            ____________________
