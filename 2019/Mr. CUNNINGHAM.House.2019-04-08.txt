 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Majority Whip Clyburn  for yielding and for his service to the rest of the delegation of South  Carolina.   This weekend we lost the most transformational leader South Carolina  has ever seen. Fritz Hollings left his mark on our economic  development, our education system, civil rights, desegregation, and  countless other areas. There is no doubt we are all better off because  of his service.   Hollings was once referred to as a ``Senator from central casting,''  and, in many ways, he represented the ideals of public service: service  to his country in uniform during World War II, to the Lowcountry in the  State house, and to his State as Lieutenant Governor, Governor, and  U.S. Senator.   He was a true statesman who exemplified character, courage,  integrity, and honor. The action he took was often not easy or  politically popular, but it was always with what was best for South  Carolina in mind.   As we honor his life over the coming days and weeks, I hope we can  all pause to reflect on how his legacy can guide us now more than ever.  Hollings made a lifelong career out of fearlessly doing what was right,  working across the aisle to reach remarkable achievements, and always  putting the people of South Carolina over politics. We need that sort  of leadership now more than ever.
