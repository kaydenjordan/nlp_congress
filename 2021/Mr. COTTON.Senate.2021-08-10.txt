 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 3680 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, growing up I was taught, as I suspect most  of you were, that America is a great, noble nation, in large part  because, as Lincoln put it, it is ``dedicated to the proposition that  all men are created equal.''   In America, our rights have no color, our law and society should be  colorblind, and as Dr. Martin Luther King said, we should not be judged  by the color of our skin, but by the content of our character.   Sadly, today, some want to replace our founding principles with an  un-American ideology called critical race theory. They want to teach  our children that America is not a good nation but a racist nation.  Those teachings are wrong, and our tax dollars should not support them.   My amendment will ensure that Federal funds are not used to  indoctrinate kids as young as pre-K to hate America. Our future depends  on the next generation of kids loving America and loving each other as  fellow citizens, no matter their race.   I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the amendment.  [[Page S6227]]         Mr. President.    Let's vote.    I ask for the yeas and nays.
