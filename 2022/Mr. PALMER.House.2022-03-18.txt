 Madam Speaker, I have been asked many times this week  about my thoughts on the address to Congress by the President of  Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy.   I was moved and inspired by his commitment to the defense of his  stricken nation and its besieged people. President Zelenskyy's remarks  reminded me of another time when a courageous and determined leader  sought the aid of America in defense of his nation as it was being  threatened by the armed might of Hitler's Nazi forces.   On February 9, 1941, Winston Churchill addressed the British  Parliament with a speech that was broadcast by the BBC. Churchill spoke  to Parliament, but he was really speaking to the United States, and, in  particular, to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.   At the end of that speech, Churchill said this: ``Put your confidence  in us. Give us your faith and your blessing, and, under Providence, all  will be well.''   He concluded his message to Parliament and to America by saying:  ``Give us the tools, and we will finish the job.''   That is what I heard President Zelenskyy saying to the Congress of  the United States. Madam Speaker, it is time to listen to the people  who are face-to-face with the enemy fighting for their country.   Madam Speaker, they know better what they need, far better than  people in suits sitting behind desks who are thousands of miles from  the battlefields of Ukraine.   We should heed their call and give them the tools to defend their  country.                            ____________________
