 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, later on this afternoon, the Senate will  vote on cloture on the nomination of Judge Cory Wilson to fill a  vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.   I rise at this point in strong, enthusiastic support of confirmation  for my friend, Judge Cory Wilson. This will be a historic moment for  this body and for the administration. A vote to confirm Judge Wilson  would make him the 200th judge to be confirmed under President Trump.  This is the highest number of judges confirmed at this point in a  Presidency since the Presidency of Jimmy Carter. Judge Wilson is an  outstanding nominee to have this distinction.   The seat we are voting to fill is actually the last remaining circuit  court vacancy at this time, reflecting the remarkable progress we have  made in rebuilding the Federal judiciary. Judge Wilson is an  outstanding nominee to mark this milestone. His credentials, intellect,  and respect for the rule of law are well established.   The American Bar Association is considered by many to be the ``gold  standard'' for assessing judicial nominees, and the American Bar  Association has awarded Judge Wilson its highest rating of ``well  qualified'' to serve on the Fifth Circuit. I certainly agree with this  assessment by the ABA.   In recent weeks, Senators on both sides of the aisle have been able  to question Judge Wilson about his judicial philosophy, and I believe  he has shown a steadfast commitment to honoring the Constitution and  enforcing the laws passed by the Congress as we have written them.   Judge Wilson is a native of South Mississippi and currently serves on  the Mississippi Court of Appeals, where he decides appellate matters,  including civil, commercial, domestic, and criminal appeals. He  graduated from my alma mater, the University of Mississippi, with  highest honors, and then he went on to Yale Law School, where he  distinguished himself in many respects. He served on the Yale Law  Journal, was a member of the Yale chapter of the Federalist Society,  and was on the Barrister's Union, which is the equivalent of the Yale  moot court. He served as a law clerk for the Court of Appeals for the  Eleventh Circuit, having been appointed and having served as a clerk  for Judge Cox on the Eleventh Circuit. He was a White House fellow for  the Department of Defense, and then he came back to Mississippi.   Before becoming a judge, Cory Wilson was an accomplished lawyer in  his own right in private practice and served in senior roles in State  government in the Mississippi Secretary of State's office and the  office of the State Treasury. For 3 years, he also represented  Mississippi's 73rd district in the State House of Representatives,  where he was vice chairman of the Judiciary Committee.   Judge Wilson is active in civic affairs and his church, Highlands  Presbyterian Church. He and his wife Stephanie have one son.   He has garnered respect and admiration and endorsements from many of  my constituents during the years of service, and in the last few weeks  and days, I have been presented with letters of endorsement from people  who know him--lawyers he practiced with and people he has been  associated with. In particular, I want to draw the attention of Members  of the Senate to a letter from retired Judge Robert L. Gibbs of  Jackson, MS.   Who is Judge Gibbs to write a letter on behalf of Cory Wilson? For  one thing, we should know that Judge Gibbs is a Democrat, and he  practiced law in Mississippi for a time for Mississippi legal services.  He spent 10 years in the office of the Mississippi attorney general, a  statewide elected Democratic official, and then Robert Gibbs served as  a circuit judge, an elected position in a Mississippi court of general  jurisdiction. He served for some 7 years there as a circuit judge in  Mississippi. That is who Judge Robert Gibbs is.   Here is what Judge Gibbs says about our nominee, the very Cory Wilson  whom we will be voting cloture on around 5:30 this afternoon.   This is a letter dated June 10. It is to the chair and ranking member  of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Graham and Senator  Feinstein.         Dear Chairman Graham and Ranking Member Feinstein:        I submit this letter in support of the nomination of Judge       Cory T. Wilson for a seat on the Fifth Circuit Court of       Appeals.        I am former Circuit Judge for the Eleventh Circuit Court       District in Mississippi and have known Cory as an attorney,       who practiced before me and as a colleague as we worked on       cases together. From these experiences, I can attest that no       one works harder in this profession than Judge Wilson. When       we were representing clients, Cory would normally prepare the       first draft of pleadings and send it to me to review. Seldom       were there any reasons to make changes because he utilized       his legal abilities to navigate through the complexities of       the legal issues which resulted in a well thought out,       plausible argument.        During Judge Wilson's investiture as a Judge on the       Mississippi Court of Appeals, I had the pleasure of being one       of the speakers.    This is retired Judge Gibbs saying he had the pleasure of being one  of the speakers.         I spoke about three traits of Judge Wilson--(1) Respect,       (2) Character and (3) Legal Intelligence. To keep this letter       to a respectful length, I will not repeat everything I said       but the essence is, Cory respects everyone he comes into       contact with, he does not change who he is because of race or       political affiliations and his ability allow him to break       through legal jargon and get to the point.    Judge Gibbs goes on to say this:         Judge Wilson and I are quite different--I am Black and he       is White. I am older and he is younger. I am a Democrat and       he was a Republican (before he became a judge). I live in the       majority African American City of Jackson, Mississippi and he       lives in a suburb of Jackson. Yet these differences have       become our strengths. We often have lunch and discuss the       pressing issues of the day as friends. He has sought my       advice, based on my judicial experience, on how to be a       better judge. And while we may disagree on some matters, in       the end we realize that we are just two lawyers who want our       communities to be better and we know that having a fair       judiciary is one of the ways to make that happen.    These are the words of an older, retired circuit judge who happens to  be an African-American Democrat in endorsement of a younger White  Republican nominee whom we will have a chance to vote on in a few  moments. We need more members of the younger generation of whatever  race who are best friends with an older generation of professionals of  another race. We need more people like Judge Robert Gibbs and Judge  Cory Wilson who are friends, who sit down, who have lunch together and  discuss the law and the ways we can make this country better.   I think this is a profound endorsement by someone of a different  race, of a different political party, and of a different political  philosophy, saying that Judge Cory Wilson is someone we will be proud  to vote for.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in  the Record at this point   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                              Gibbs Travis PLLC,                                                      June 10, 2020.      Re Nomination of Cory T. Wilson as Judge of the United States           Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.       Hon. Lindsey Graham,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Dianne Feinstein,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.

If you need any additional information or have any       question, please do not hesitate to let me know.            Sincerely,                                                   Robert L. Gibbs.     Again, let me just stress to my colleagues that Cory  Wilson has gained a reputation as a fair and impartial judge and a good  and decent man, and I am confident that this reputation will follow him  as he serves on the Fifth Circuit. He will serve the circuit and our  Nation well as a U.S. circuit judge.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
