The total       estimated cost is $500 million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by improving the       security of a NATO ally that continues to be an important       force for political stability and economic progress in       Europe. This sale is consistent with U.S. initiatives to       provide key allies in the region with modern systems that       will enhance interoperability with U.S. forces and increase       security.        The proposed sale will contribute to Estonia's military       goals of updating capability while further enhancing       interoperability with the United States and other allies.       Estonia intends to use these defense articles and services to       modernize its armed forces and expand its capability to       strengthen its homeland defense and deter regional threats.       Estonia will have no difficulty absorbing this equipment into       its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractor will be Lockheed Martin, Grand       Prairie, TX. There are no known offset agreements proposed in       connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale may require the       assignment of approximately fifteen (15) U.S. Government       representatives and up to fifteen (15) contractor       representatives to Estonia at any given time, during the       delivery, training, integration, and testing of the HIMARS       capability.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 22-35       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act, as           amended        (vii) Sensitivity of Technology        1. The M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS)       is a C-130 transportable wheeled launcher mounted on a 5-ton       Family of Medium Tactical Vehicles truck chassis. HIMARS is       the modern Army-fielded version of the M270 Multiple Launch       Rocket System (MLRS) launcher, and can fire all of the MLRS       Family of Munitions/Missiles (FOM) that includes Guided       Multiple Launch Rocket System (GMLRS), Extended Range GMLRS,       and the Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS). Utilizing the       FOM, the HIMARS can engage targets between 15 and 300       kilometers with Global Positioning System/Precise Positioning       Service (GPS/PPS)-aided precision accuracy.        2. The GMLRS M31A2 Unitary is the Army's primary munition       for units fielding the M142 HIMARS and M270Al MLRS Launchers.       The M31A2 Unitary is a solid propellant artillery rocket that       uses GPS/PPS-aided inertial guidance to accurately and       quickly deliver a single high-explosive blast fragmentation       warhead to targets at ranges from 15-70 kilometers. The       rockets are fired from a launch pod container that also       serves as the storage and transportation container for the       rockets. Each rocket pod holds six (6) total rockets.        3. The M30A2 GMLRS Alternative Warhead (AW) shares a       greater than 90% commonality with the M31A1/A2 Unitary. The       primary difference between the GMLRS Unitary and GMLRS AW is       the replacement of the Unitary high explosive warhead with a       200-pound fragmentation warhead of pre-formed tungsten       penetrators which is optimized for effectiveness against a       large area and imprecisely located targets. The munitions       otherwise share a common motor, GPS/PPS-aided inertial       guidance and control system, a  [[Page S3331]]       multi-option fuzing height of burst capability, and effective       range of 15-70 km.        4. The M57 ATACMS Unitary is a conventional, semi-ballistic       missile that utilizes a 500-pound high explosive warhead. It       has an effective range of between 70 and 300 kilometers, and       has increased lethality and accuracy over previous versions       of the ATACMS due to a GPS/ PPS aided navigation system.        5. The ER GMLRS missiles provide a persistent, responsive,       all-weather, rapidly deployed, long range, surface-to-      surface, area- and point-precision strike capability. The       XM403 AW, like GMLRS M30A1/A2, carries a 200-pound       fragmentation assembly filled with high explosives which,       upon detonation, accelerates two layers of preformed       penetrators optimized for effectiveness against large area       and imprecisely located targets. The XM404 Unitary, like       GMLRS M31A1/A2, has a 200-pound class unitary with a steel       blast-fragmentation case, designed for low collateral damage       against point targets. Both variants of the ER GMLRS missiles       maintain the accuracy and effectiveness demonstrated by the       baseline GMLRS out to a maximum range of 150 km (double that       of the GMLRS capability) while also including a new HOB       capability referred to as the Side Mounted Proximity Sensor       (SMPS) HOB capability.        6. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        7. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        8. A determination has been made that Estonia can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        9. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Estonia.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

Transmittal No. 22-42       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The AIM-120C-8 and D-series Advanced Medium Range Air-      to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM) are supersonic, air-launched, aerial       intercept, guided missiles featuring digital technology and       micro-miniature solid-state electronics. AMRAAM capabilities       include look-down/shoot-down, multiple launches against       multiple targets, resistance to electronic countermeasures,       and interception of high- and low-flying and maneuvering       targets. State-of-the-art technology is used in the missile       to provide it with beyond-visual-range capability.        a. The increase in capability from the AIM-120C-8 to AIM-      120D consists of a two-way data link, a more accurate       navigation unit with Global Positioning System (GPS) updates,       improved high-off boresight (HOBS) capability, and enhanced       aircraft-to-missile position handoff.        b.

A determination has been made that Norway can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This       proposed sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign       policy and national security objectives outlined in the       Policy Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Norway.                            ____________________
