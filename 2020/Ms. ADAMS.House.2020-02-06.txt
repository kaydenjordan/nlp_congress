 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the survivors of gun  violence.   Last month, I had the opportunity to meet with Jules Oringel of  Charlotte when she led the Pledge of Allegiance at my State of the  District address. She is a local high school senior, and her story is a  story that no young woman should ever have to tell.   She was at home in her room, on her phone, like any teenager, and  then she gets a message from one of her best friends. She says there is  an active shooter in her school and she doesn't know what is going on.  She tells everyone in the group chat she loves us.   The best friend is at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in  Parkland, Florida. Eventually, Jules learns that one of the people she  had attended camp with lost her life in the shooting.   Jules says, for the next few weeks, she was riddled with anxiety at  school, at other public spaces; she couldn't sleep, and she did not  know how her friends would heal.   That is something no young woman should ever go through.   That is not okay with me.   In the aftermath, Jules stepped up to start the nonprofit Return Home  Supplies, because every student and every teacher deserves to return  home.   It is hard for me to believe that we have reached a point in our  country where people have legitimate concerns about making it home at  the end of the day. As a 40-year educator, I cannot imagine how  students balance those concerns with every other challenge that they  face.   And that is not okay with me.   Last year, the city of Charlotte saw the worst violence that we have  seen in decades. Tragically, we concluded 2019 with 107 murders, the  highest in decades. Our community lost a disproportionate number of  African American men whose lives matter, too. The towns of the 12th  Congressional District lost people to gun violence as well.   And that is not okay with me.   107 murders, total--the vast majority involving guns. Charlotte  families lost siblings and parents and loved ones and community  members, congregants, students, and children to gun violence. Our  community has been torn apart.   That is not okay with me.   Our very own UNC Charlotte, our 49ers, lost two souls who called our  community home. Four other students were gravely injured, and our  community was shaken to its core. And many of us are still in  disbelief.   A school shooting happened in Charlotte. In a hallowed place that is  supposed to prepare our youth for their future, two futures ended.   It was the first mass shooting that we have had at a school in  Charlotte, and it should also be the last.   That is not okay with me.   Many Holy Books tell us that whoever destroys a single life is  considered by Scripture to have destroyed the whole world, and whoever  saves a single life is considered by Scripture to have saved the whole  world. Each time we lose someone, we lose an entire world, an entire  universe of hopes, dreams, and aspirations; we lose a thread that binds  together families and communities.   Well, as a Charlotte community, as a nation, we must do something to  stop the gun violence that tears at the fabric of our communities.   In this Congress, the first three bills the House sent to the Senate  took weapons of war off the street and would make our communities  safer. Now that the Senate has concluded its impeachment trial, they  have no excuse to continue to hold these bills up other than they just  don't care.   And that is not okay with me.   My colleagues and I have led the efforts to introduce key pieces of  legislation that would close the loophole in our background checks,  extend the background check process, prohibit those convicted of hate  crimes from purchasing firearms, and reinstate the Federal ban on  assault weapons.   I would like to take a moment to applaud the Charlotte City Council  for  [[Page H852]]  taking the lead with their Safe Communities Committee and our  educational institutions for their security upgrades and initiatives.   Despite this Congress, more work lies ahead. And that is personal to  me, because the violence must stop.   Let me end by sharing one more message from the Queen City. Our  city's comedians at Charlotte Squawks took a break from being funny to  add a somber note to the comedy show.   To the tune of ``This Land is Your Land'' by Woody Guthrie:       This land is Parkland,      It's Columbine and      It's Thousands Oaks at      A student line dance.      From Santa Fe High School      To Virginia Beach murders,      This stuff is not okay with me.      As I keep watching      This endless violence,      With thoughts and prayers for      A moment of silence,      The politicians      Are doing nothing,      This stuff is not okay with me.    I agree. This is not okay with me. We need sensible gun laws, and we  need them right now.                            ____________________
