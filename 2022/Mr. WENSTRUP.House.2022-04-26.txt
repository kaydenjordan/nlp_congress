 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 200th  birthday of our 18th United States President, Ulysses S. Grant.   President Grant was born in Point Pleasant, located in Clermont  County in Ohio's Second Congressional District. When Ulysses was a  child, the Grant family moved to Brown County, also in Ohio's Second  District, and there he was educated before accepting a nomination to  the United States Military Academy at West Point.   Following his commissioning, Grant served in the Mexican-American  War, and most notably, the Civil War, where he became Commanding  General of the United States Army in 1864.   General Grant oversaw the surrender of General Lee at Appomattox  Court House and served as Commanding General of the Army until he was  elected President in 1868. He served two terms as President, overseeing  the beginning of the Reconstruction Era in the United States.   President Grant is the General who ``saved the Union.'' He was a  great leader who left his mark in American history. We should all seek  to follow his example and leadership.    Mr. Speaker, I am honored to have President Grant's birthplace in  Ohio's Second Congressional District, a true landmark of our Nation's  history.                            ____________________
