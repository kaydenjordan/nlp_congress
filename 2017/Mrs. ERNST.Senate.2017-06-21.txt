 Mr. President, no choice and a proposed 43-percent  increase in premiums--that is what ObamaCare and its harmful impact  will bring to Iowa in 2018. This year, it brought premium increases up  to 42 percent. Last year, it brought increases up to 29 percent.  ObamaCare is not sustainable and not affordable for Iowans.   To anybody who has studied healthcare reform, this should come as no  surprise. In the past, many States have tried to reform their  individual market. Twenty-seven years ago, Kentucky made an attempt and  implemented the Kentucky Health Care Reform Act of 1994. This bill was  similar to ObamaCare in many respects. It contained more taxes, more  regulations, and more mandates. Within 3 years--3 years--insurers fled  the individual market and the State was hit with skyrocketing premiums.   What happened in Kentucky then is eerily similar to what is happening  in Iowa today as a result of ObamaCare. When it comes to affordability  and choice, my home State of Iowa has been hit particularly hard.   While traveling across the State, I hear from Iowans who are looking  for affordable coverage. Far too often, I hear that high monthly  premiums are squeezing pocketbooks and that soaring out-of-pocket  costs, such as deductibles and copays, make coverage unaffordable to  use for those who do have it. That is not what ObamaCare promised, but  that is what it has brought.   One Iowan who works at a small business in Hinton wrote to me and  said:         Over the past seven years, prices have jumped considerably       and the coverage employees are getting for the amount of       money spent is substantially less! We have tried to help our       employees by minimizing the changes in premiums, but these       last two years we had to start passing on some of the       increases in order to survive.        We can no longer absorb the constant rate increases, nor       can we not offer a health plan to our employees. Therefore,       we find ourselves between the proverbial rock and the hard       place. We certainly are not the only small business facing       the same dilemma.    Employees at this small business can breathe a small sigh of relief  because their employer still has the ability to offer coverage, even if  they are forced to pay more and more because of ObamaCare. Other Iowans  are on the edge because their options for coverage are shrinking.   In 2016, UnitedHealthcare left the individual market in Iowa. A few  months ago, Wellmark and Aetna both announced they would be leaving the  individual market in 2018. Medica is the only remaining statewide  carrier, and while they appear to be staying for the next year, it will  take a massive rate increase on Iowans for them to do so.   The Iowa insurance commissioner said:         Iowa has hit a point within our market's collapse that a 43       percent rate increase will drive healthier, younger, and       middle aged individuals out of the market. Iowa's individual       market remains unsustainable.    If Medica leaves after next year, there is a very real possibility  that tens of thousands of Iowans will have nothing to purchase on the  individual market.   To put this issue into perspective and show why it matters so much, I  want to share concerns I received from a constituent in Ames, IA. This  constituent is the parent of a child with a rare disease. The family  purchased a plan from Wellmark to cover the child for 2017, but now  that Wellmark plans to leave, the parents are unsure whether they will  be able to find a plan for their child. They find this whole experience  ``disruptive and anxiety provoking.''   Disruption and anxiety are not being felt just in Iowa; all across  the country, premiums are skyrocketing and choices are limited and in  some places, nonexistent. Recent data from the Centers for Medicare and  Medicaid Services shows that 2.4 million people in 1,200 counties  across the country will have one option for insurance in 2018. That is  not an option at all. A recent report by HHS found that between 2013  and 2017, premiums more than doubled on the exchange--more than doubled  on the exchange. In some States, premiums tripled.   Across the country and in my home State of Iowa, we don't have the  option to continue with the status quo when it comes to our healthcare.  The reality is, the status quo is truly unsustainable.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  [[Page S3664]]
