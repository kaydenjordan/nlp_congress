 Mr. President, this explanation reflects the status of  negotiations and disposition of issues reached between the Senate  Select Committee on Intelligence and the House Permanent Select  Committee on Intelligence for the Intelligence Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2024.   The explanation shall have the same effect with respect to the  implementation of this act as if it were a joint explanatory statement  of a conference committee.   I ask unanimous consent that the explanatory statement for the  Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 be printed into the  Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:  Explanatory Statement on the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal                                 Year 2024         The following is the Explanatory Statement to accompany the       Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (``the       Act''), which has been included as Division G of the National       Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024. The       Explanatory Statement reflects the result of negotiations       between the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and the       House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (together,       ``the Committees''). The Explanatory Statement shall have the       same effect with respect to the implementation of the Act as       if it were a joint explanatory statement of a conference       committee.        The classified nature of U.S. intelligence activities       prevents the Committees from publicly disclosing many details       concerning their final decisions regarding funding levels and       policy direction. Therefore, the Committees have prepared a       classified annex--referred to here and within the annex       itself as ``the Agreement''--that contains a classified       Schedule of Authorizations and that describes in detail the       scope and intent of the Committees' actions.        The Agreement authorizes the Intelligence Community to       obligate and expend funds as requested in the President's       budget and as modified by the classified Schedule of       Authorizations, subject to applicable reprogramming       procedures.        The classified Schedule of Authorizations is incorporated       into the Act pursuant to Section 7102 of the Act. It has the       status of law. The Agreement supplements and adds detail to       clarify the authorization levels found in the Act and in the       classified Schedule of Authorizations.        This Explanatory Statement incorporates by reference, and       the Executive Branch shall comply with, all direction       contained in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence       Report to accompany the Intelligence Authorization Act for       Fiscal Year 2024 (S. Rept. 118-59) and in the House Permanent       Select Committee on Intelligence Report to accompany the       Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2024 (H. Rept.       118-162). The Agreement supersedes all classified direction       related to programs and activities authorized by the Schedule       of Authorization.        The Executive Branch is further directed as follows:       Inspector General Review of Dissemination by Federal Bureau of     Investigation Richmond, Virginia, Field Office of Certain Document         The Committees are committed to ensuring full transparency       in the FBI's actions implicating the rights of the American       people to the free exercise of religion and speech.       Therefore, the Committees direct that, not later than 120       days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the       Inspector General of the Department of Justice shall conduct       and submit to the congressional intelligence committees, the       Committee on the Judiciary, Committee on Homeland Security       and Governmental Affairs, and the Committee on Appropriations       of the Senate, and the Committee on the Judiciary, the       Committee on Oversight and Accountability, and the Committee       on Appropriations of the House of Representatives, a review       of the actions and events that served as a basis for the       January 23, 2023, dissemination by the field office of the       Federal Bureau of Investigation located in Richmond,       Virginia, of a document titled ``Interest of Racially or       Ethnically Motivated Violent Extremists in Radical-      Traditionalist Catholic Ideology Almost Certainly Presents       New Mitigation Opportunities.'' The review shall cover any       orders or direction regarding the document from any official       in any field office concerning purported proximate links       between any religion, any political affiliation, or the       intent of this report.        The Committees further direct that, not later than 10 days       after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Director of       the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall submit to the same       committees identified above the unredacted August 22, 2023,       Inspection Division report associated with the Richmond       Domain Perspective.       Funding Limitations Relating to Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena         Section 7343 of the Act provides for funding limitations       relating to unidentified anomalous phenomena because of       perceptions of insufficient transparency in this area.       Section 7343 is also intended to avoid technology and       security stovepipes and expand awareness regarding any       historical exotic technology antecedents previously provided       by the Federal Government for research and development       purposes if they are shown to exist.        Section 7343 further provides a limitation regarding       independent research and development funding to ensure that       certain indirect expenses are prohibited. That provision is       intended to be interpreted consistent with Department of       Defense Instruction Number 3204.01 (dated August 20, 2014,       incorporating change 2, dated July 9, 2020; relating to       Department policy for oversight of independent research and       development), or any successor instruction.   Screening and Vetting of Visitors or Assignees from Sensitive Countries                        at the National Laboratories         The Committees are concerned that the Office of       Intelligence and Counterintelligence at the Department of       Energy (DOE-IN) does not require the comprehensive screening       and vetting of foreign visitors or assignees from the       People's Republic of China (PRC), Russia, Iran, North Korea,       and Cuba who work or otherwise collaborate with scientists in       our National Laboratories. United States Government-funded       research carried out at National Laboratories is incredibly       important and sensitive. Whether a laboratory supports a       science mission or is oriented toward supporting national       security, it is critical that all foreign visitors and       assignees from countries of concern receive appropriate       vetting in order to mitigate counterintelligence risks. In       fiscal year 2023, more than 7,000 nationals from the PRC       visited 16 National Laboratories. Russian visitors numbered       more than 3,700. The Committees understand that international       cooperation on matters of basic, fundamental science helps       maintain the United States' technological edge. At the same       time, we need to protect both the classified research as well       as unclassified research that result in technologies with       dual-use applications, and which can be adapted for military       or economic gain, from getting into our adversaries' hands.        The Committees therefore direct that DOE-IN require a       robust effort to screen and vet visitors or assignees to our       National Laboratories from the PRC, Russia, Iran, North       Korea, and Cuba. The Committees also direct DOE-IN to ensure       appropriate oversight over such screening and vetting to       ensure that counterintelligence threat information related       to potential assignees or visitors is appropriately       identified and tracked. The Committees further direct       that, not fewer than twice per year, the Director of DOE-      IN shall submit to the Committees a report noting each       instance in which a visitor or assignee from the PRC,       Russia, Iran, North Korea, or Cuba, identified as a       significant counterintelligence risk was permitted access       to a National Laboratory.      Briefing Relating to Certain Intelligence and Counterintelligence                       Activities of the Coast Guard         Section 416 of H.R. 3932 provided the Commandant of the       Coast Guard with enhanced authority to obligate and expend       amounts made available under the National Intelligence       Program for intelligence and counterintelligence activities       if the object of the activity is of a confidential,       extraordinary, or emergency nature.        Therefore, the Committees direct the Commandant of the       Coast Guard, no later than March 31, 2024, to brief the       congressional intelligence committees, the congressional       defense committees, the congressional appropriations       committees, the House Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure, and the Senate Committee on Commerce,       Science, and Technology on why this authority is necessary       and appropriate.         Director of National Intelligence Notice to Congress Before  Establishing New National Intelligence Center or Assigning Significant                      New Function to Existing Center         The Committees direct the Director of National Intelligence       to provide reasonable notice to the congressional       intelligence committees before the Director establishes a new       national intelligence center or assigns a significant new       function to an existing national intelligence center.      Briefing Relating to Confidential Human Source Program of Federal                          Bureau of Investigation         The Committees direct the Director of the Federal Bureau of       Investigation, no later than March 31, 2024, to brief the       congressional intelligence committees and the congressional       judiciary committees on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's       management of confidential human sources, specifically       pertaining to the current notification requirements and       program review processes in  [[Page S5991]]       the event that an agent of the Federal Bureau of       Investigation has reasonable grounds to believe that a       confidential human source, or any immediate family member of       such a source, has engaged in unauthorized criminal activity,       including any misdemeanor or felony crime.       Enhanced Personnel Security Review with Respect to Social Media         The Committees are of the view that--        (1) A trusted national security and Intelligence Community       workforce is paramount to the protection of our nation's       security and to reduce the risk of unauthorized disclosures       of classified and other sensitive information;        (2) the increased global availability and use of social       media accounts, including by members of the national security       workforce of the United States, increase the risk of       unauthorized disclosures of classified national security       information, which can endanger the United States and its       partners and allies, and empower foreign adversaries;        (3) to maintain trust in and the protection of the national       security and Intelligence Community workforce of the United       States, the Intelligence Community must fully and       continuously use available vetting resources and all       authorities prescribed by law, while guaranteeing all       constitutional protections of such workforce;        (4) the Intelligence Community must maintain high-quality       vetting processes and ensure appropriate and necessary       measures are taken to thoroughly and in a timely manner       investigate and adjudicate prospective applicants for       sensitive national security positions within the Intelligence       Community; and,        (5) the Intelligence Community should use existing       authorities to ensure robust continuous vetting for continued       eligibility for access to classified information and       carefully manage the speed and accuracy of the security       clearance adjudication process at both the initial       investigation process and throughout the career of personnel       serving in positions within the Intelligence Community.    Matters Pertaining to United States Economic and Emerging Technology                 Competition with United States Adversaries         The Committees support the National Intelligence Strategy       of 2023 goal of leveraging emerging technologies and their       adoption at scale. Sections 7502 through 7506 of the Act       further advance this objective, and the Committees expect the       Intelligence Community to implement these provisions       faithfully and expeditiously.   Intelligence Community Counterintelligence Office at the Department of                                Agriculture         Section 7318 establishes a counterintelligence office       located within the Department of Agriculture. Accordingly,       the Committees direct the Director of National Intelligence       to submit the report required in section 7318(f)(2) to the       Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the       Senate and the Committee on Agriculture of the House, at the       same time that the Director submits the report to the       congressional intelligence and appropriations committees.                            ____________________
