 Mr. President, today I introduced the Progressive  Consumption Tax Act of 2020.   We need a tax code that is fair for American families and for  employers. We need a tax code that rethinks how our Nation collects the  revenue that allows us to build our roads and bridges and keeps our  Nation safe. We need a system that values our most vulnerable  Americans, small businesses, and makes our U.S.-based businesses more  competitive.   In our recent history, comprehensive tax reform has been out of  grasp. Congressional leaders have long called for a 1986-style tax  reform in which the tax code would be streamlined and simplified to  broaden the tax base and lower income tax rates. The 2017 tax law was a  representation of how hard this type of tax reform is. It kept in place  much of what makes the tax code complicated and inefficient, did not  secure permanent income tax rate reductions for working families, and  it increased the deficit by nearly $2 trillion. It is time we take a  new approach.   As we look to the future and work towards the goal of a sustainable  economy that works for all, my colleagues and I will need to think  creatively about how to raise revenues and provide for the services the  government must and can deliver.   Austere and regressive spending cuts are not the answer to the  question of how to set the country on a sustainable path and support  working families. Instead, we should look at ways to raise reasonable  revenues and make the tax code work better for all. The Progressive  Consumption Tax Act should be part of that conversation.   I introduced versions of this bill in the past to provide an opening  for discussion and an opportunity to review legislative language for  this type of comprehensive tax reform. Now more than ever it is  critical Congress revisit the thinking about comprehensive tax reform  that is lasting and progressive.   The 2017 tax law was constructed with many temporary policies that  will require future action on tax policies as these provisions expire.   While some of those will be years from now, this conversation can  never start early enough. We know that good ideas can take time to  become mainstream. In a world where about 150 countries now have a  consumption tax, it is time the U.S. join this mainstream thinking.   The legislation I have introduced today is an example of truly  progressive, fiscally responsible, pro-growth tax reform could look  like.   It also provides an opportunity for the U.S. to catch up with the  rest of the world. All OECD countries except the U.S. have a  consumption tax.   The Progressive Consumption Tax Act would put this country on a level  playing field by providing for a progressive consumption tax, or PCT,  at a rate of 10 percent. The PCT would generate revenue by taxing goods  and services, rather than income.   The revenues collected by the PCT would eliminate an income tax  liability for most households in this Nation. Lower income individuals,  those currently eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child  Tax Credit, would receive rebates to cover the cost of their PCT  burden, cementing the progressivity of this new system.   For those who do still have an income tax liability under this Act  would have lower rates and a simplified income tax. Under current law,  the top marginal income tax rate is 37 percent. Under the Progressive  Consumption Tax Act, the top income rate would be just 28 percent.   The 2017 tax law reduced the corporate tax rate to 21 percent. This  Act would further reduce that rate to 17 percent. Businesses would be  more competitive and this would contribute to a pro-growth economy in  the U.S., all while collecting reasonable revenues.   As we discuss this proposal, you will hear me say this over and over  again: An overarching goal of the Progressive Consumption Tax Act is  ensuring the tax code is progressive, meaning that those who make less  in income don't have a higher tax burden than wealthy people. The  provisions included in this Act--removing an income tax liability for  most households and providing rebates--are meant to maintain  progressivity in the tax code for families.   For those who worry that a consumption tax will bring in ``too much''  money, my legislation remains balanced. It is designed to raise stable  and reasonable tax revenues. However, if more revenues than envisioned  are collected under this legislation, a ``circuit breaker'' would  return additional revenues to taxpayers. Again, we put money back into  the hands of the taxpayers.   In 2017, I offered the Progressive Consumption Tax Act as an  alternative to the tax legislation considered that year. While it would  have been a responsible choice to enact then, it could still provide a  fresh start now.   Since that law was passed, there has been increased interest in  looking at ways to reform the nation's tax laws to tilt any benefit  more towards those who were left behind and raise reasonable revenues.  My colleagues in Congress and stakeholders are searching for forward- looking ideas for how to modernize the tax code. I am excited that  President-elect Biden has put forward tax reform proposals and  Congressional leaders have done the same. The longer we wait to put  this country in a better, more competitive, progressive position, the  harder it will be.   That's why I am reintroducing the Progressive Consumption Tax this  year. As this Congress closes and the new Congress convenes, I hope we  will seriously consider the tax system in this country and consider the  types of reforms proposed in the Progressive Consumption Tax Act.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill  appear in the Record following these remarks.
