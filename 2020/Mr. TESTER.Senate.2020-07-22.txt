 Mr. President, before I call up my amendment and get to  the issue of our veterans in this country, I want to say a few words  about a good friend and a legendary Montana conservationist named Jim  Posewitz, who passed away a few weeks ago.   He was a towering figure in Montana and in the history of  conservation in our great State. He was a man who knew right from  wrong, and Montanans know that he was almost always right and seldom  wrong.   Poz's accomplishments are too long to list, but any Montanan who  fished in the Missouri River, learning the ethics of hunting or hiking  in Montana's Rocky Mountain Front, owes a deep debt of gratitude to  Poz's more than 30 years of work for the Montana Fish, Wildlife, and  Parks and to his post-retirement work as a conservation advocate,  ethicist, and leader.   The Wilderness Act of 1964 says that America's wildest places are  those where man himself is a visitor. Poz understood that power, that  magic, and the importance of these places. He was relentless in his  fight to protect them, and he was uncompromising in his faith that they  bring us closer to nature, to each other, and to ourselves. He never  stopped fighting for Montana and for the wild places in Montana.   My heart goes out to Poz's family, including his life partner Gayle;  his sons, Brian, Allen, Carl; Matthew and Matthew's wife Heather and  their daughters, Sarah and Lindsay; his son Andrew and Andrew's wife  Kelly and their daughters Madison and Charlotte; his stepdaughter Ann  and Ann's husband Nate and their children, Joslin and Lyzander; his  stepson Clayton and Clayton's wife Michelle and daughter Ayla. Poz is  also survived by his brother John and John's wife Mary and their four  children.   He will be greatly missed. He is somebody they only make one of, an  incredible human being.                       Amendment No. 1972, as Modified     Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1972, as modified,  and ask that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, I want to turn to the issue of the day,  and that is this amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act.   Senator Reed talked about it a few minutes ago because, quite  frankly, justice is long overdue for thousands of veterans who are  currently suffering and dying from illnesses related to exposure to  Agent Orange in Vietnam.   You know, one of our most sacred duties is to take care of those who  are wounded in service to this country, and the fact is, this  administration, the Trump administration, has refused to expand the  list of presumptive health conditions associated with Agent Orange to  cover illnesses such as bladder cancer, hypothyroidism, and  Parkinsonism. They don't seem to think that exposure to these toxic  chemicals in Vietnam is a cost of war. Well, let me tell you, they are  wrong. It is a cost of war. The fact is, this administration wants to  outlive the Vietnam veterans, and they don't want to pay for it.   Every time we get in a situation--and I should say the last time we  got in a situation, for sure--we sent off our young men and women in  the military, and we put the cost on the credit card for our kids to  pay and don't think a thing about it, but when they come back and they  are changed, all of a sudden, we don't want to pay for it, especially  when these conditions, in particular, already meet the historical  standard to be added to the Department of Veterans Affairs' presumptive  list for service connection.   Now, this is not just me talking. This is the National Academies of  Medicine weighing in with their reviews of scientific evidence-- scientific evidence. Each day this administration stonewalls benefits,  more and more veterans are forced to live with the detrimental effects  of their exposure without the assistance that not only they have earned  but that we owe them--veterans like Bill Garber from Great Falls, MT.   In 1967, Bill enlisted in the U.S. Army, and within 6 months he was  sent to fight in Vietnam, where he served as a combat engineer and  demolitions expert with the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment, 1st Brigade  Combat Team of the 101st Airborne Division. During his yearlong tour in  Vietnam, Bill saw heavy combat, and like most military folks who were  in Vietnam, was exposed to Agent Orange.   Now, more than 50 years later, after his service and his sacrifice,  Bill suffers from tremors diagnosed as Parkinsonism, one of the three  conditions that would be covered by the Department of Veterans Affairs  if this amendment passes. Bill's story is heroic, but the truth is, he  is one of tens of thousands of Vietnam veterans in this country who are  still waiting for this White House to grant them the benefits they have  earned.   No more waiting. No more trying to outlive the Vietnam veteran. My  amendment directs the Department of Veterans Affairs to acknowledge the  overwhelming scientific evidence already put forward by veterans,  scientists, and medical experts, and provide Vietnam veterans with the  benefits they have earned in service to our country.   Today, we have an opportunity to end the needless suffering and  disappointment for an entire generation of veterans who are counting on  Congress to simply do the right thing. The reality is that taking care  of our veterans is a cost of war and is a cost that must be paid. We  must hold this administration accountable on behalf of thousands of  veterans like Bill who gave so much for this country, and I urge my  colleagues to get this done with a ``yes'' vote on this amendment so we  can end the wait for veterans who have already sacrificed greatly and  who shouldn't be forced to wait 1 minute longer.   I yield the floor.
