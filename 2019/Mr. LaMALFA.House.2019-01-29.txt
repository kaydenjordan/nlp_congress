 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remind people, that  although it is wintertime, a rainy season, a stormy season, that we are  still in a dire circumstance on fire safety in our forested areas,  California, of the West, and many areas of the United States.   So for us to just be comfortable during the wintertime, during the  rainy season and not think about it would be in error. We need to do  much to catch up on the forest inventory we have across this country,  across the West.   That will require USDA, the U.S. Forest Service, our States, our  local governments, Tribes, and everybody to be able to coordinate much  better than we have in the past to reduce this fuel load, this  inventory we have in our forests that makes it so dangerous when fire  season comes around once again.   We have seen that with so many devastating fires in the West, just  this year in my own district, the Carr fire in the Redding area, and  the Camp fire in the Paradise area.   Many factors go into what causes these fires, but we can at least be  proactive in thinning our Federal forests, thinning the material that  needs to come out of there, putting people back to work doing that,  using this material for biomass, generating electricity, and the wood  and paper products that we all need and enjoy.   We need to move fast-forward on the pace and scale of what it takes  to make our forested areas fire safe, healthy, good for the economy,  and good for all of us.                            ____________________
