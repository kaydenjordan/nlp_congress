 Thank you, Mr. President.   My colleague and friend, the Senator from Delaware, is also a former  Governor, and it is always enjoyable to listen to the experiences and  clearly the understanding about a number of the issues we have in  common in terms of things that concern us.   I remember back in 1993, as well when we were looking at healthcare  reform in South Dakota, we actually, in our process, adopted the vast  majority of what was considered to be the recommendations from the  National Association of Insurance Commissioners--guaranteed  renewability of policies, guaranteed to be able to move from one group  insurance product to another group insurance product, a minimum amount  of premium versus maximum amount of premium by any carrier in any  single group of policies in one plan. Those provisions actually worked  for us for a period up until 2009, when ObamaCare became the law of the  land, and at that point we suffered through the same problems most of  the rest of America is suffering through right now.   But there are some things that really do bind us together, and one of  them is trying to make and produce the best healthcare products for the  citizens within our different States that we possibly can. I think in  the U.S. Senate there are enough of us who truly believe we can fix,  repeal, replace ObamaCare. I think Democrats would like to say we are  going to fix it. I think Republicans recognize that we are probably  going to do more of a startover because the basic concept of ObamaCare,  which was moving more and more into a single-payer system, will not  work.   For those of us who believe in the free market, what we want to do is  take away the regulations at the Federal level, give them back to the  States, and allow the States to actually experiment and make a more  competitive healthcare product. That allows for businesses to be able  to insure more individuals to help pay for their costs. It also means,  then, you can actually get more individuals to receive the benefits of  private healthcare rather than being responsible for or at least  expecting that the Federal Government is going to subsidize with  Federal taxpayer money their healthcare costs. I think that is part of  what we need to be concerned with here today.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and  legacy of Dr. Andre Larson, who passed away on March 24, 2017, at the  age of 74. Dr. Larson grew up in Brookings, SD, and graduated from the  University of South Dakota, USD, in Vermillion with a BFA in music  education and later, a MM degree in music literature.   A lifelong advocate for fine arts and music, Dr. Larson created the  renowned National Music Museum in Vermillion, on USD's campus. Today it  has the most complete collection of well-preserved and historically  important musical instruments in the world.  [[Page S2614]]    The National Music Museum houses and preserves over 15,000 rare  musical instruments: Stradivarius violins, and one of the only two  Stradivarius mandolins that exist, dombaks and didgeridoos, the oldest  playing harpsicord, more than a dozen saxophones made by the  instrument's inventor, Adolphe Sax, bouzoukis, hurdy-gurdies, and a  bombardon, a 1772 bowlback mandolin, a Javanese gamelan, lutes, flutes,  harmonicas, and zithers, the world's oldest cello, called the King  cello and created around 1550 A.D., Johnny Cash's guitar, and  everything in-between, including a substantial collection of historic  instrument documents.   Dr. Andre Larson was inspired by his father, Arne B. Larson, who was  a high school music teacher, bandleader, and later a college music  professor. Arne began collecting musical artifacts and instruments  while serving in World War II, and his passion for music was not lost  on his son, Andre. Wanting to share his and his father's passion, Andre  conceptualized, planned, and implemented the development of the  National Music Museum in Vermillion. In 1972, he was hired as the first  director of the museum, then named the Shrine to Music Museum, with his  father's 2,500 instruments as the foundation. Andre served as director  of the museum until his retirement in 2011.   Under Dr. Andre Larson's leadership, the museum expanded  significantly from one room in the Carnegie Library to now occupying  the entire building today. His intelligence and great knowledge of  instruments and history enabled him to select the best instruments for  the collection. He also had a very unique skill in matching instruments  to generous donors who would allow the museum to showcase their  purchases.   In addition to teaching at the University of South Dakota and running  the museum, Dr. Larson also created, produced, and marketed many  musical events every year that sometimes included internationally known  musicians performing music with the museum instruments. He also created  the Nation's only graduate degree program in the history of musical  instruments.   Throughout his life, Dr. Larson also served three terms as the  president of the American Musical Instrument Society. He edited its  newsletter for 18 years, and he was honored with the Curt Sachs Award,  the highest honor given by the American Musical Instrument Society. In  2016, he was elected to the South Dakota Hall of Fame for his  contributions to the arts in South Dakota.   Dr. Andre Larson's commitment to excellence and his dedication to  music have inspired thousands of students and music lovers, not just  across South Dakota, but throughout the entire Nation. His work in  creating the National Music Museum will continue to inspire others for  as long as there is music and there are people.                            ____________________
