 Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support my bill, the State Opioid Response Grant Authorization Act.   This bipartisan bill directly addresses the worsening opioid crisis  by authorizing $10.5 billion over 6 years in grants to States and  Tribes. This funding will prevent and treat those suffering from  addiction.   During Recovery Month last month, I met with several healthcare  providers to discuss the challenges faced by those in recovery. We hear  time and time again how individuals in recovery often struggle to  access the resources they need.   This bill meets the moment by giving States and Tribes the  consistent, necessary funding they need to meet their specific needs.   I want to thank Energy and Commerce Chairman Pallone and Ranking  Member McMorris Rodgers, and Health Subcommittee Chairwoman Eshoo, and  my friend, Subcommittee Ranking Member Guthrie, for considering this  bill.   I thank our bipartisan sponsors. In particular, I want to thank  Congresswoman Sherrill, Congressman Baird, and Congressman Armstrong  for their advocacy. I am so grateful to the members of the Bipartisan  Addiction and Mental Health Task Force for helping us get this over the  finish line.   When we put aside partisan politics and focus on the real issues and  work hard, we can make a difference. For these reasons, I urge a  ``yes'' vote on the State Opioid Response Grant Authorization Act.                                time  1615
