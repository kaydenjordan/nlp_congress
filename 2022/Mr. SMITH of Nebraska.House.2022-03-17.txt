 Madam Speaker, I rise today to support the  long overdue legislation to hold Russia accountable for its invasion of  Ukraine. It is unfortunate it took so long to get to this point, but I  am glad we have finally reached a consensus.   This bill, as you know, revokes permanent normal trade relations for  Russia and normal trade relations for Belarus, putting them in the same  trade category as North Korea and Cuba, and appropriately so.   The U.S. must take the lead in showing the real economic consequences  of violent acts against NATO members and partners, and this bill is a  key element of that.   We were all moved by President Zelenskyy's address earlier this week,  [[Page H3806]]  and I am glad we are finally answering his call for additional  assistance. We can and should do more, especially when it comes to  banning energy imports from Russia.   As Republican leader of the Trade Subcommittee, I am glad this bill  is finally seeing a vote on the House floor. I support this bill and  certainly urge my colleagues to do the same so we can use the trade  tools at our disposal to hold Vladimir Putin accountable.
