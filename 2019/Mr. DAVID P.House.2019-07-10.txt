 ROE of Tennessee. Madam Chair, I am a U.S. Army veteran  who has used the GI Bill.   While I strongly support being good stewards of resources expended by  the Department of Defense to various educational institutions across  the Nation, the amendment offered by my friend across the aisle goes  too far by including the term proprietary when referring to  universities. Congress and the Department of Education have set  standards of financial responsibility and are already reviewing whether  certain colleges and universities meet those standards.   Let's continue to hold all universities accountable for these  standards, not just a select few. There is no reason for this amendment  to exclude any colleges because all students deserve to know that their  choice of school meets Federally set responsibility standards whether  public, private, or proprietary.   Fortunately, this is already happening.   Unfortunately, this amendment is duplicative of the work that the  Departments of Defense and Education are conducting and is simply an  effort to further categorize colleges and universities and hold them to  different levels of scrutiny.   Let's work together to make sure all students have access to a high  quality, affordable education in a setting and format that works best  for them.
