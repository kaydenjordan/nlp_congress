 Madam Speaker, I rise on the 200th day  of the House Democrats delivering for the people.   Madam Speaker, over the years, I have had the opportunity to mentor  young girls from hard-pressed families, and I will tell you this, they  taught me more than I ever could teach them. And I learned that even  with mothers working two jobs, there were weeks of just peanut butter  in their pantry and having to move place to place just to find  affordable rent.   That is why I celebrate the historic expansion of the child tax  credit in the American Rescue package, because it has the power to lift  millions of children out of poverty, give them the futures they  deserve. It is going to help our families thrive and our economy to  recover. We can build back better by lifting our children.                            ____________________
