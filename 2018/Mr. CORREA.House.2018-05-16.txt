 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2372, the VA  MISSION Act.   Mr. Speaker, I support the VA MISSION Act because it will improve  access to timely care for all our veterans through consolidation and  reform of the various care and community programs and through expansion  of the caregiver program.   Like my colleague from Maine said, in California, we are the proud  home to the largest number of veterans in the United States, and we  want more of them in California.   Let me say that I know there may be some issues with this  legislation, but at the end of the day, I have got to ask myself, is  this about Wall Street or is this about the beltway? No. This is about  Main Street, Main Street Santa Ana, Anaheim, Orange County, California.   This VA MISSION Act is supported by 38 veteran and military service  groups, including The American Legion.   One of my constituents, Ken George, the District 29 Commander of the  Department of California American Legion, represents more than 8,000  American Legion members in Orange County, he called me and he said: If  Congress wants to help veterans and caregivers, there is no better way  than to support this legislation.   As Ken said, the bill will help veterans and caregivers through  expansion of benefits available to our caregivers of veterans of all  eras.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this legislation. Yes, there are some  issues there, but at the end of the day, if you listen to our veterans,  our friends, and neighbors, the folks we represent, this is an ``aye''  vote.
