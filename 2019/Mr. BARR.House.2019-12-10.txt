 Mr. Speaker, tonight we find ourselves at a crossroads in  the history of our great Nation, a nation founded upon the simple,  self-evident truth that we are endowed by our Creator ``with certain  unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit  of happiness--that to secure these rights, governments are instituted  among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the  governed.''   With those words, the Declaration of Independence gave birth to a new  nation rooted in the principles of limited government, individual  freedom, and the rule of law through self-government, and it set into  motion the greatest experiments in human freedom and prosperity the  world has ever known. That is largely because our Constitution  protected those principles through separation of powers, federalism,  and the Bill of Rights.   Just as the Constitution protected political freedom, it also  protected our economic freedom and enabled the American people to  flourish through entrepreneurship, business, and private enterprise  operating in a free market. In short, Mr. Speaker, American capitalism,  as enabled by the United States Constitution, has delivered the most  free, prosperous, and successful country in the history of the world.   But today, those principles of free enterprise and capitalism are  under attack, and that experiment in liberty is threatened by leftwing  politicians who are openly embracing socialism, defenders of central  planning in the media and in the academy, and even some business  leaders who are calling for a redefinition of the purpose of a  corporation.   So, today, my colleagues and I, members of the Republican Study  Committee, join the debate. We join the debate between staying on the  road of capitalism, prosperity, and freedom versus going down a much  different path, what Austrian-British economist and philosopher  Friedrich August von Hayek called ``The Road to Serfdom,'' in which he  spelled out a vivid warning to the socialist intelligentsia in England  that an experiment with socialist policies would result in the same  disastrous outcomes that had destroyed liberty in Germany and Russia.   The experience of history is clear: Whenever and wherever socialism  has been tried and put into place, it has resulted in a loss of  individual freedom, economic stagnation, diminished productivity,  deprivation and shortages, misery, and death.   Central planning in Germany, Italy, and Japan before World War II and  in the Soviet Union and China in the postwar, Cold War era, invariably  resulted in soul-destroying and liberty-crushing totalitarianism.   To paraphrase Hayek, fascism, communism, and so-called democratic  socialism are merely variants of the same totalitarianism which central  control of all economic activity tends to produce.   Socialist Parties may not deliberately aim for a totalitarian regime,  but the experience of history teaches us that the unforeseen but  inevitable consequences of socialist planning create a state of affairs  in which, if the policy is to be pursued, totalitarian forces will get  the upper hand.   Economic planning necessarily requires coercion and uses of  compulsion upon individuals in ways that deprive them of freedom of  choice. As author Charles C. W. Cooke recently wrote, ``Socialism Is  Not Democratic.''   Ascendant elements within the American left are engaged in a  sustained attempt to reintroduce and rehabilitate the word  ``socialism,'' in part by prepending to it a word that has a much  better reputation and an infinitely better historical record:  ``democratic.''   Voters should not be fooled by the rebranding, for there is no sense  in which socialism can be made compatible with democracy. At worst,  socialism eats democracy and is swiftly transmuted into tyranny and  deprivation. But, at best, socialism stamps out individual agency,  places civil society into a straight jacket of uniform size, and turns  representative government into a chimera.   The U.S. Constitution is crystal clear on the appropriate role of  government. And government that it permits is incompatible with and  insufficient to sustain socialism.   Just as the individual right to free speech is widely comprehended as  part of what we mean by democracy rather than as an unacceptable  abridgement of majority rule, so the individual rights protected in  property and by markets are necessary to the maintenance of a  democratic order in this deeper sense of the word.   In the West, choosing to trade with a person in another country is,  itself, a democratic act.   Electing to start a company in your garage with no need for another's  imprimatur is, itself, a democratic act.   Banding together to establish a cooperative is, in itself, a  democratic act.   Selecting the vendor from which you source your goods and services  and choosing which to buy from, it is, itself, a democratic act.   Keeping the lion's share of the fruits of your labor is, itself, a  democratic act.   So, when the government steps in with their bayonets and say no, they  are, in effect, keeping your choices off the ballot.   Democratic socialism, to me, is about democratic control of every  single facet of our life. That is one way of putting it; certainly,  another is tyranny.                                time  1815    So during the last 3 years through tax cuts, deregulation, unleashing  America's energy and easing restrictions on credit markets by rolling  back Dodd-Frank's one-size-fits-all rules, we have witnessed a rebirth  of freedom and free enterprise. We have witnessed a reinvigoration of  America's first principles and a very fortunate move away from  socialism. The result has been an American worker boom, but if we  retreat from these hard-fought gains, we will return to the road to  serfdom.   The socialist policies of today with populous names like: Medicare  For All, the Green New Deal, the Lower Drug Costs Now Act, the Wall  Street Tax Act, the Stop Wall Street Looting Act, these pieces of  legislation are all a danger to a free society. They are nothing more  than central planning schemes that accumulate power in the government  at the expense of the people, and in ways that rely on administrative  coercion, force and discrimination, and through measures which are  entirely incompatible with a free society.   If you think that a transition to socialist policies won't pose a  danger to our economy, I would urge you to review the so-called  Accountable Capitalism Act, offered by Senator and candidate-for- President, Elizabeth Warren.   The bill is a wish list of socialist ideas aimed to shackle  government enterprise with government control. The bill would require  any company over $1 billion in revenue to be chartered by the Federal  Government and allow the Federal Government to relinquish that charter  at any time through opaque rules. The bill gives control to the  government to determine who serves on a company's board and whose  interests that board must satisfy.   Senator Warren went so far as to send letters to CEOs of some of  America's largest and most successful businesses stating that she,  ``expects them to support her bill.'' With this burden of government  control over its operations, where is the incentive for business to  expand? Where is the incentive for Americans to innovate? Where is the  incentive for Americans to risk their capital in entrepreneurship?  Where is the incentive to increase revenue or create new jobs?   Presidential candidate, Bernie Sanders, said that we should wage a  moral and political war against corporate leaders.   The gentlewoman from New York, our colleague, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez,  called capitalism, ``irredeemable.''   These arrogant attitudes of our Nation's elected representatives  threaten the very principles of limited government and individual  freedom on which  [[Page H10008]]  our country was founded, and they compromise the path to prosperity  that a capitalist system creates.   Tonight, Mr. Speaker, we will explore the extent to which socialism  destroys freedom and crushes the human soul, and we will examine how  socialism, far from delivering on its promise to help people struggling  in poverty, that socialism itself produces poverty. It produces famine  and misery and corruption.   And we will also, on the flip side, in contrast, we will examine  capitalism and how free enterprise and the benefits that it creates  helps individuals and businesses thrive, how it is the American Dream  and how pro-growth, free and fair market policies beget innovation,  opportunity, and prosperity.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleagues, beginning with the gentleman  from Louisiana (Mr. Johnson), my friend and the chairman of the  Republican Study Committee, a champion of free enterprise and a proud  opponent of socialism.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from  Louisiana for that stirring story, and I appreciate what he had to say.  Every generation in America has had to fight for freedom and fight for  free enterprise.   And I am reminded by a couple generations after the Founding Fathers  when our 16th President, Abraham Lincoln, in fighting for capitalism  freedom said this:         You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich. You cannot       strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. You cannot bring       about prosperity by discouraging thrift. You cannot lift the       wage earner up by pulling the wage payer down. You cannot       further the brotherhood of man by inciting class hatred. You       cannot build character and courage by taking away people's       initiative and independence. You cannot help people       permanently by doing for them what they could and should do       for themselves. Abraham Lincoln.    And now, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman), my  friend from the Commonwealth and a great patriot.    I thank my friend from Virginia for his passionate defense  of free enterprise and illuminating the true cost of socialism, and not  just the $93 trillion price tag that he mentioned, but the true cost,  which is the cost of our very freedom by empowering government at the  expense of the people.   At this time, to continue our discussion, Mr. Speaker, I would like  to recognize a true capitalist. Who better to defend the system of  capitalism than a man who is, himself, a businessman, an entrepreneur,  a risk-taker, a capitalist: my good friend and a terrific member of the  Financial Services Committee, Congressman Roger Williams.  [[Page H10010]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Texas for his terrific  statement in defense of the American Dream and capitalism and freedom.   Mr. Speaker, if I could inquire how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Speaker, at this time, I would like to recommend a true  patriot to his country; a veteran who has served his country; a man,  quite frankly, who has fought communism and socialism in Southeast  Asia; a great American hero from the great Hoosier State of Indiana,  Congressman  Jim Baird.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Baird).    Mr. Speaker, I want to personally thank the Congressman and  millions of Americans of his generation and those servicemen and -women  who answered the call and served their country and fought to defend our  freedom. Future generations of Americans are eternally grateful for his  service and sacrifice.   Mr. Speaker, at this time, I look forward to hearing from my good  friend from the State of Texas, Congressman Jodey Arrington, who, once  again, joins us in defense of freedom and traditional American values  of limited government and free enterprise and stands firmly in  opposition to the bankruptcy of socialism.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Arrington).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from the great State of  Texas for his vigorous defense of freedom, limited government, and  capitalism. I certainly appreciate his words and his friendship.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much remaining time I have.    Mr. Speaker, in the remaining time I have, I want to  address a couple of additional topics, one of which is that the  defenders of socialism and those who are trying to infect a new  generation with the lie of socialism, that it is somehow good for the  poor and that it is a system that is targeted to help the poor, this is  the greatest, perhaps, of all the lies of socialism.   We talked about the lie of socialism, that it could possibly be  democratic. We talked about how it is totally incompatible with  democracy. We talked about how it is incompatible with a free society.  But so many of the proponents of socialism and central planning say  that we need to address income inequality, that we need more equality,  more social justice.   As an author recently pointed out, socialism has been terrible at  helping the poor. It has been terrible at helping women advance. It has  been terrible for civil liberties. It has been terrible at helping the  environment. It has been terrible at attracting immigrants. It has been  terrible at tolerating and protecting minorities. It has been terrible  at fostering technology, architecture, and art. It has been terrible at  producing agriculture. Worst of all, it has been terrible at sharing  power and resources.    Indeed, it has done precisely the opposite, creating new ruling  classes that are far less adept, far less responsive, and far less  responsible than the ones they replaced.   Socialism is good at distributing poverty, sharing poverty, creating  and producing poverty. It is the worst possible solution to curing  poverty.   My friend from Texas made an allusion to Venezuela and how good of an  example that is to illustrate the moral bankruptcy of socialism when  actually put into practice.   The Venezuelan President is now a ruthless dictator who has cracked  down on free speech, prohibited mass political protests, and  confiscated firearms from anyone who is even remotely critical of him.  Thirteen percent of the country's population has now fled. Those who  have remained have been left so degraded by the government's price  controls that they have gone years without toilet paper, meat, and  other basic necessities and, as a consequence, have taken to eating zoo  animals for sustenance and scouring garbage bags for supplies.   According to the Pharmaceutical Federation of Venezuela, the country  is suffering through an 85 percent medicine shortage and a 90 percent  shortage of basic medical supplies. The child mortality rate has  increased 140 percent.   Ninety percent of Venezuelans now live in poverty. This year, the IMF  predicts inflation will hit 10 million percent. All of this is in a  country with the world's largest oil supplies, reserves greater than  those of the United States by a factor of 10.   Mr. Speaker, Venezuela is the classic example of how socialism  doesn't cure poverty. Socialism produces gut-wrenching poverty, misery,  deprivation, and shortages, in addition to the lack of liberty that it  affords its subjects.   I am certain that my colleagues on the other side, even those who  profess an allegiance to socialism, share our goal of lifting up those  who are struggling and providing them with security and with an  opportunity to live happy, healthy, and prosperous lives.   Those who say they want Medicare for All because they care about the  health of people or they want the Green New Deal because they believe  in  [[Page H10012]]  an environment worthy of our children, I don't question the sincerity.  What I fear from my colleagues who advocate these disastrous policies  is that they do not fully comprehend that the means they are asking the  government to employ to achieve those goals will produce the  deprivation, the environmental degradation, and the poverty which they  believe can be cured by disrupting market forces.   Indeed, the central planners believe prosperity is best achieved  through government intrusion into the market, socialization of  industries, and a redistributive model that disincentivizes personal  achievement and responsibility.   But tonight, we, the Republican Study Committee, come together in  this debate to express that we believe that the best way to achieve  economic security and prosperity is to expand opportunities, allow  innovation to thrive, and create an environment where hard work pays  off. It is not about giving each person an equal piece of the pie. It  is about growing the pie as much possible so that more people may  partake.   A growing economy that produces a strong labor market is the best way  to lift up people. This administration's current progrowth economic  policies continue to produce blockbuster job creation, higher wages,  strong economic growth, and upward mobility, the American Dream.   Last week, we saw another string of positive jobs reports, with  unemployment falling to 3.5 percent, a 50-year low. Unemployment for  African American males is at a 50-year low of 5.1 percent, and wages  continue to grow.   In every category of demographics, people are doing better because  they have been liberated through policies that unleash the creative  spirit of the American people and free enterprise.   If you care about the poor, if you really care about solving poverty,  consider the words of Catholic Priest Robert Sirico, the president and  cofounder of the Acton Institute. He sums it up nicely in his book  ``Defending the Free Market: The Moral Case for a Free Economy.'' If  you want to help the poor, he says, start a business.   Employ people. Give them a job. Allow them to achieve their God-given  potential by learning that work means an opportunity for them to  realize their God-given potential and help other people through their  own labor and their own creativity.   Free markets not only increase economic prosperity in general, but  they also provide better standards of living. This concept applies in  the United States and in jurisdictions around the world.   There is data to support this idea. Each year, the Cato Institute and  the Fraser Institute in Canada copublish, in coordination with 70 think  thanks across the world, the ``Economic Freedom of the World'' report.  The report measures economic freedom via five metrics: the size of  government, the legal system and property rights, the soundness of  money, the freedom to trade internationally, and the amount of  regulation.   The United States ranks in the top five countries for economic  freedom while Venezuela ranks dead last. The most recent report finds  that the nations in the top quartile of economic freedom had an average  per capita GDP of $36,000 in 2017, compared to $6,000 for bottom  quartile nations.   The poorest 10 percent of citizens in the most economically free  nations actually have an income that is two-thirds higher than the  average income in the least free nations. In the top quartile of  economically free nations, 1.8 percent of the population experiences  extreme poverty, compared to 27.2 percent in the least free nations.   If you want to cure poverty, unleash free enterprise.   The benefits of economic freedom do not just apply to wage and  employment metrics. Life expectancy in the most economically free  nations is 14 years longer than the least economically free nations,  and infant mortality is significantly lower.   Medicare for All, is that what you are for? Because if you are for  health, you should be for capitalism.                                time  1900    The report also finds that gender equality and political and civil  liberties are much higher in nations with high economic freedom than in  nations with low economic freedom.   The ill effects of socialism and their impact on the people subjected  to it are evident in country after country. Venezuela is the example  that I just gave, but there are other examples as well.   We probably don't have time to go through all of these examples, but  I do want to just say that it was Winston Churchill who famously said:  ``Those who fail to learn from history are condemned to repeat it.''   That is why, as we debate the merits of capitalism versus socialism  in our political discourse today, it is important that we remember  history, that we look to past actions of other countries and study  their results.   I wanted to get to three case examples--the United Kingdom, India,  and Israel--to show their experience with socialism and how disastrous  it was for their people, and, when they changed course and they  embraced capitalism and freedom, the prosperity that it delivered. We  will get to that on another evening.   But suffice it to say that, when you have market-based incentives  where you have, by and large, free trade, where you have low  regulation, where you have less taxes, where you have people who are  able to achieve their potential without undue interference from the  government, where you have market forces, you produce more, you become  more productive, and you provide for people who need assistance.   The U.S. economy today remains a shining example of how opportunity  and ingenuity in a market-based economy with appropriately tailored  regulation can drive prosperity for its citizens.   As we said before, unemployment is at a 50-year low. Why would we  want to abandon free market economics at a time when the country is  benefiting from it?   Industries from technology to energy, to manufacturing, to services,  they are booming. We are the leaders in innovation. We have an economy  that draws people from around the world who hope to make a better life  for themselves.   I will return to the wisdom of Austrian-British economist F. A. Hayek  when he said, in a famous warning, that political liberty is not  enough: ``Even a strong tradition of political liberty is no safeguard  if the danger is precisely that new institutions and policies will  gradually undermine and destroy that spirit. The consequences can of  course be averted if that spirit reasserts itself in time and the  people not only throw out the party which has been leading them further  and further in the dangerous direction but also recognize the nature of  the danger and resolutely change their course.''   What that warning says, what he means by that warning is it may not  come in the full-on proposal of socialism; it may come in incremental  form. But we must abandon those parties that are leading us further and  further down the road of serfdom in the dangerous direction away from  freedom and more towards central planning, reject it and move back  towards freedom.   Alexis de Tocqueville, when he observed early America, warned of the  modern welfare state: In a nation that prides itself upon the idea that  the people are sovereign, isn't it sad that the modern American left  wishes to deprive the people of that very sovereignty--of that very  self-government upon which this Nation was founded--and instead impose  upon the people an insidious form of servitude to bureaucratic rules  upon rules governing their every action and behavior, so much so until  the will of the individual is shattered, constantly restrained from  acting as he or she normally would in a free state, until the people  are reduced to ``a flock of timid and industrial animals, of which the  government is the shepherd.''   Mr. Speaker, I don't think any of us want to go down that road to  serfdom. I don't think any of us want to stamp out the freedom and the  self-government, the idea that we remain and must continue to be a  government only through the consent of the governed.   Tonight, my colleagues and I are defending freedom, defending  capitalism, defending free enterprise, defending entrepreneurship, and  opposing, vigorously, the corrupt and immoral idea of socialism.   Mr. Speaker, we appeal to the good sense of the American people at  this  [[Page H10013]]  time in our Nation's history. We appeal to the people that now is the  time to reassert the spirit of liberty; to throw out the party of  socialism and central planning, the party which is leading America  further and further in a dangerous direction with policies like  Medicare for All and the Green New Deal; to recognize the danger, and  to resolutely change their course to embrace the cause of freedom and  free enterprise.   And, Mr. Speaker, for anyone who knows any American who is tempted by  the lies of socialism, I ask that they share with them this debate  tonight, share with them the truth, share with them the truth that  freedom and capitalism is the answer to democracy; it is the answer to  upward mobility; it is the answer to poverty; it is the answer to soul- crushing deprivation and shortages, that the true way to care for those  who are less fortunate is to give people opportunity and freedom to  achieve their God-given potential.   Mr. Speaker, with that, we contend that we will continue this debate  until we secure for our children and our posterity the blessings of  liberty.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
