 Mr. Chair, this is a good amendment, and I would like to  mention two measures.   First, key provisions of my BURMA Act are included, as they were in  the last Congress. The Burmese security forces perpetrated genocide  against the Rohingya people, and those same forces are continuing to  terrify Burma's other ethnic minorities with horrific violence.   The victims deserve justice, and they deserve our unwavering support.  This measure will hold these military officials accountable for their  crimes and help support democracy in Burma.   Next, is my provision to prevent another phony emergency declaration  to push through arms sales, as the administration did in late May.   The administration misused the law and went around Congress to sell  more than $8 billion in arms to the Saudis and Emiratis.   This fix would make sure that an emergency declaration cannot be used  if the weapons won't be delivered for more than 3 months, because then  there was no emergency in the first place.   It is a commonsense reform that will protect Congress' role in the  arms sale process.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the en bloc.   I am also honored to join Chairman Smith as a cosponsor of amendment  No. 1. The American public deserves to know the impact of our military  operations abroad.   There must be more openness and transparency when tragedy occurs, and  civilian casualties are caused by U.S. military action.   Being open is our moral obligation and the right thing to do, and it  also strengthens our security. We are better equipped to tackle our  counterterrorism challenges when we have the full confidence of our  citizens and our international partners.   U.S. military operations depend on close relationships with host  nations, and we must do everything we can to ensure our partners that  we take civilian casualties seriously.   In the past, the Director of National Intelligence prepared reports  on civilian casualties and strikes outside areas of active hostilities.  This administration brought that sensible practice to a halt.   This amendment would restore the DNI's role. Restoring this  responsibility is a commonsense step to bring transparency back to our  counterterrorism operations, and I urge all of our colleagues to  support the amendment as well.                                time  1845
