 Madam Speaker, new data from the Department of Labor  released this week indicates that inflation in America remains at a 40- year high.   Numerous studies, including one by the San Francisco branch of our  Federal Reserve Bank, indicate that the reason why Americans  disproportionately are suffering from this inflation is reckless levels  of deficit spending by our Federal Government.   Only the United States Congress could respond to the situation with a  bill that increases Federal spending by over $700 billion at the same  time it increases taxes on Americans.   To add insult to injury, our own Congressional Budget Office, as well  as the University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business, and  hundreds of economists, tell us that this bill, the so-called Inflation  Reduction Act, will not actually reduce inflation at all.   We need to get our fiscal house in order and solve the reckless  spending that is causing this inflation instead of taking action that  makes the situation even worse. I urge a ``no'' vote.
