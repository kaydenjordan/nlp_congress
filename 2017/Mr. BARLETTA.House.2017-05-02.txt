 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1665) to ensure that the Administrator of the Federal  Emergency Management Agency considers severe local impact in making a  recommendation to the President for a major disaster declaration, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1665         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Disaster Declaration       Improvement Act''.       SEC. 2. LOCAL IMPACT.         In making recommendations to the President regarding a       major disaster declaration, the Administrator of the Federal       Emergency Management Agency shall give greater weight and       consideration to severe local impact or recent multiple       disasters. Further, the Administrator shall make       corresponding adjustments to the Agency's policies and       regulations regarding such consideration. Not later than 1       year after the date of enactment of this section, the       Administrator shall report to the Committee on Transportation       and Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of       the Senate on the changes made to regulations and policies       and the number of declarations that have been declared based       on the new criteria.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 1665, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The purpose of H.R. 1665 is to ensure that, in making a  recommendation to the President for a major disaster declaration, the  Administrator of FEMA looks at the intensity of the impact in a  localized area as well as the impact on other recent disasters.   My colleagues from Illinois are to be commended for working so  persistently on this bipartisan piece of legislation. Their Illinois  districts have been impacted by several devastating disasters, but each  time the communities were told that the damage was not severe enough to  warrant Federal disaster assistance.   In recent years, there has been more evidence of devastated small and  rural communities not receiving disaster assistance in a fair manner  compared to other larger communities and neighboring States. I know all  too well how devastating this can be for those affected by disaster, as  I am dealing with a similar issue in northeastern Pennsylvania.   In March, much of the area I represent was hit with a crippling  snowstorm that dumped as much as 30 inches of snow or more.  Municipalities had to exhaust much of their yearly budgets on snow  removal efforts and emergency services. However, due to the fact that  the statewide threshold needed for Pennsylvania to request  reimbursement funding from the Federal Government was not met, local  municipalities were left with massive holes in their budgets.   This bill helps ensure the severe, remote, and localized impact  endured by communities like those in Pennsylvania and Illinois get due  consideration and they get the help they need when disaster strikes.  The House adopted similar language last year when it passed the FEMA  Disaster Assistance Reform Act.   Again, thank you to the gentleman and gentlewoman from Illinois for  working with the subcommittee on this legislation to address the  concerns of their constituents and other communities in this situation.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Bost).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. LaHood).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  H.R. 1665, as amended, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1679) to ensure that the Federal Emergency Management  Agency's current efforts to modernize its grant management system  includes applicant accessibility and transparency, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1679         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``FEMA Accountability,       Modernization and Transparency Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. REQUIREMENTS.         (a) In General.--The Administrator of the Federal Emergency       Management Agency shall ensure the ongoing modernization of       the grant systems for the administration of assistance under       the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency       Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.) includes the       following:        (1) An online interface, including online assistance, for       applicants to complete application forms, submit materials,       and access the status of applications.        (2) Mechanisms to eliminate duplication of benefits.        (3) If appropriate, enable the sharing of information among       agencies and with State, local, and tribal governments, to       eliminate the need to file multiple applications and speed       disaster recovery.        (4) Any additional tools the Administrator determines will       improve the implementation of this section.        (b) Implementation.--To the extent practicable, the       Administrator shall deliver the system capabilities described       in subsection (a) in increments or iterations as working       components for applicant use.       SEC. 3. NO ADDITIONAL FUNDS AUTHORIZED.         No additional funds are authorized to carry out the       requirements of this Act. Such requirements shall be carried       out using amounts otherwise authorized.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  any extraneous material on H.R. 1679.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The purpose of H.R. 1679, the FEMA Accountability, Modernization and  Transparency Act of 2017, is to enhance FEMA grant applicants' access  to information.   I commend my colleague from Louisiana for working so hard for the  people of his State to tackle the challenges those communities and  individuals have been facing in the wake of last August's floods and  other disasters.   On average, FEMA distributes almost $6 billion a year in assistance  to individuals, communities, and organizations impacted by disasters.  That taxpayer money must be managed in an efficient and transparent way  to prevent duplication and provide disaster survivors with needed  access and visibility.   More efficient and transparent delivery of disaster assistance will  help speed disaster recovery and reduce the administrative burden on  applicants. This legislation requires the FEMA Administrator to include  online access and information sharing as the agency modernizes its  disaster grant delivery system.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  H.R. 1679, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1678) to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and  Emergency Assistance Act concerning the statute of limitations for  actions to recover disaster or emergency assistance payments, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1678         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.         (a) In General.--Section 705 of the Robert T. Stafford       Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5205)       is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)(1)--        (A) by striking ``Except'' and inserting ``Notwithstanding       section 3716(e) of title 31, United States Code, and       except''; and        (B) by striking ``report for the disaster or emergency''       and inserting ``report for project completion as certified by       the grantee''; and        (2) in subsection (b)--        (A) in paragraph (1) by striking ``report for the disaster       or emergency'' and inserting ``report for project completion       as certified by the grantee''; and        (B) in paragraph (3) by inserting ``for project completion       as certified by the grantee'' after ``final expenditure       report''.        (b) Applicability.--        (1) In general.--With respect to disaster or emergency       assistance provided to a State or local government on or       after January 1, 2004--        (A) no administrative action may be taken to recover a       payment of such assistance after the date of enactment of       this Act if the action is prohibited under section 705(a)(1)       of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency       Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5205(a)(1)), as amended by       subsection (a); and        (B) any administrative action to recover a payment of such       assistance that is pending on such date of enactment shall be       terminated if the action is prohibited under section       705(a)(1) of that Act, as amended by subsection (a).        (2) Limitation.--This section, including the amendments       made by this section, may not be construed to invalidate or       otherwise affect any administration action completed before       the date of enactment of this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 1678, as amended.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The purpose of H.R. 1678 is to establish a statute of limitations for  FEMA to recover disaster assistance payments. This bill would provide  some finality in disaster assistance, and it would minimize  administrative costs.   This is a bipartisan issue, and I appreciate my colleagues from  Florida for their continued leadership on this issue.   H.R. 1678 reinstates the 3-year statute of limitations on FEMA's  ability to reclaim funds when there is no evidence of fraud, waste, or  abuse.   In my district, I have seen FEMA tell a community that a project is  eligible for funding, allowing the town to move forward to complete a  disaster recovery project, only to have FEMA change its mind years  later and take the money back. Not only is this devastating to the  community and to disaster recovery, but the administrative time and red  tape involved in second-guessing is a waste of taxpayer dollars.   Again, my thanks to the gentlewoman from Florida and the gentleman  from Florida for their continued work on this issue and for introducing  this bill.   The House adopted similar language last year when it passed the FEMA  Disaster Assistance Reform Act.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Mast).    Mr. Speaker, I again urge my colleagues to vote ``yes''  on H.R. 1678, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.
