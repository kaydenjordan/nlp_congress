 Mr. Speaker, the Atlantic City High School track and  field team is comprised of some incredibly driven athletes.   Claudine Smith and Isaiah Whaley, both graduating seniors, were  especially impressive contributors to their team's success.   During her time on the team, Claudine won three State, seven south  Jersey, six Cape-Atlantic League, and six Atlantic County  championships. It is unbelievable. With these accomplishments closing  out her high school career, it is no wonder she was named the Press  Girls Outdoor Track and Field Athlete of the Year.   Isaiah, too, surpassed many records during his time. He broke his  school's 26-year-old record in the 400-meter dash and ranked number  five in the State of New Jersey for the event.   These students are incredibly talented, and their head coaches, Roy  Wesley, Jr., and Jonathan P. Parker, undoubtedly helped them develop  and grow in their sport.   To all the members of the Atlantic County track and field team, we  are immensely proud of your hard work and determination, and we can't  wait to see what you all achieve in the future.   We are proud of you in Atlantic County. We are proud of you in south  Jersey. We are proud of you in New Jersey. And we are proud of you in  the United States of America.                            ____________________
