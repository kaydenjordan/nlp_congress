 Madam Speaker, I was in my district over the  weekend. We had a couple of marches. We had a Women's March. We had a  march for MLK Day.   A man approached me, and he said: Representative Kirkpatrick, I work  for the National Park Service. I am furloughed. I have no income. I  have missed two paychecks.   He said: My 9-year-old son gave me his Christmas gift card to help  our family get by.   He had tears in his eyes, and I am tearing right now just telling  that story, because this shutdown is affecting families, children.   The instability that these children are feeling--and we don't talk  about that enough--is going to affect them for the rest of their lives.   We have got to open the government, and we have got to do it now.                            ____________________
