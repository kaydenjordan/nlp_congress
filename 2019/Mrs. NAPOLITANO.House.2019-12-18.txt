 Madam Speaker, I include in the Record my remarks  supporting the Articles of Impeachment against Donald Trump.   Madam Speaker, I rise to say no one is above the law, not even the  President. Today, we assert this truth, uphold our constitutional duty,  and hold President Trump accountable for his actions. To fulfill my  oath of office and protect the Constitution, I will vote to impeach  President Donald Trump.   President Trump abused the power of his office when he solicited help  in the 2020 election from Ukraine. He did this not to root out  corruption or with our nation's interests in mind, but to gain a  personal, political advantage in the election. The President withheld  $391 million in congressionally-approved military aid for Ukraine until  it agreed to investigate his political rival. This corrupt scheme put  at risk Ukraine's security as well as our own national security, and it  undermined the integrity of our elections. It is a clear abuse of  power.   President Trump then obstructed Congress, which sought truth and  accountability. He ordered the complete defiance of lawful subpoenas  for relevant documents and prohibited witnesses from giving testimony,  further violating the Constitution. This unprecedented blockade has  threatened our cherished system of Checks and Balances.   Madam Speaker, it is time to finally hold President Trump accountable  for these corrupt and unconstitutional actions. We must pass the two  articles of impeachment before us today to make certain no one is above  the law. I urge all of my colleagues to stand up for the Constitution  and join me in voting yes.
