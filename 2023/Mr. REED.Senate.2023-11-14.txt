 Mr. President, reserving my right to object, I believe we  must move forward with emergency funding for our allies--all of our  allies, not just the State of Israel but also Ukraine. We are in a  situation where both of these countries are under tremendous stress.  But it is very clear that the proposal before us, this unanimous  consent request to pass the bill including only funding for Israel, is  just ironically an attempt to deny funding for Ukraine. It is not  really about helping Israel; it is about making sure we don't continue  our support and commitment to Ukraine. That commitment is just as  vitally important to us as our solemn commitment to Israel.   If we fail to support Ukraine, we will send a very unfortunate  message to our adversaries: You can succeed in overrunning America's  allies if you simply wait us out.   My colleagues on the other side of the debate have been spinning a  false narrative that says: By providing support for Ukraine, we will  deny support for Israel. The truth is that the only obstacle to  providing help to both nations is them. The truth is also that the  United States is already supporting the State of Israel. The United  States has provided Israel with over $12.4 billion in military  assistance and missile defense funding over the last 3 years. In  response to the attacks of October 7, President Biden has moved two  aircraft carrier strike groups into the region. He ordered marines into  the region. U.S. forces have already engaged and shot down missiles  from adversaries in the region. We have also suffered more than 56  injuries of American military personnel because of actions against the  U.S. position in the Middle East.   We need to support Israel. We are supporting Israel. We will continue  to support Israel. But we cannot abandon Ukraine. They have lost  hundreds of thousands of civilians and military personnel.   The horrors of October 7 were grotesque. I was in Israel last month.  I saw the images--some that have not yet been released--of the  slaughter. It was traumatic for the entire State of Israel--in fact,  the Jewish community worldwide. But go to Ukraine. Go to Bucha. Dig up  the graves of people shot in the back of the head while their hands  were tied. You want to talk about atrocities? Those were atrocities  perpetrated by the Russians.   So we are fighting forces that are dark and evil in two fronts, and  we have to support all of those democratic nations--Israel and Ukraine.  They are struggling against the darkness.   This is not my opinion alone. Two weeks ago, Mike Pompeo, the former  Secretary of State for Donald Trump and a former Congressman from  Senator Marshall's home State of Kansas, wrote this about Ukraine:         Make no mistake: The outcome of this war will have a direct       impact on U.S. national security. Should Putin prevail--      whether on the battlefield or through a war of attrition that       leads to ill-conceived diplomacy--    And I would suggest that denying this aid is ill-conceived  diplomacy--         the war would be felt well beyond Ukraine's borders.    Indeed, I would add that if we fail to support Ukraine with funding  and equipment, then it is more likely that young American  servicemembers will be called upon to fight and perhaps die and suffer  in Eastern Europe because, as so many of my colleagues have suggested  and as Secretary Pompeo suggested, Putin will not be satisfied with  simply taking Ukraine, and we could see ourselves engaged in defending  one of our NATO allies.   I have a very simple sort of notion about American military policy,  having had the privilege to serve in our military. I would rather send  resources to a country fighting than send American soldiers to do the  fighting. And if we don't support Ukraine, that will happen.   Let me conclude by simply saying that it is time to get serious. We  have 3 days before our government runs out of funding. Israel needs our  support. Ukraine needs our support. American families and communities  are counting on us to deliver critical disaster assistance. They need  support for affordable, high-quality childcare. There are many needs we  must address. We have to move now but not by isolating our Ukrainian  allies. We are in the fight with them, and we will finish the fight  with them.   At this point, I would yield to Senator Durbin of Illinois.
