 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for not  only doing this but allowing me to be a part of it.   Mr. Speaker, I am a relatively new member of the committee, as the  chairman is aware. I have only served on it for about 13 months now. I  have only been in Congress for 3 years. One of the most frequent  questions that I get asked when I go back home is: What is the most  surprising thing that you have discovered since you have become a  Member of Congress?   I tell them the truth: The most surprising thing is also the most  encouraging thing, and that is that there really are a lot of good  people in Congress. There are a lot of people serving in Congress, a  lot of good people who work with staff and work as staff, who are good  people who truly want to do the right thing and who truly want to move  this country forward.   Yes, that is somewhat surprising. But more than anything, it is  encouraging. Sometimes I feel like as Members that we get kind of a bad  rap, that we are dysfunctional, that we don't get along, and that we  are not getting anything done. I get frustrated by that.   But I think about people like Ray Baum, and I think: If they only  knew somebody like this, somebody who is truly dedicated, who is truly  trying to do the right thing and to move this country forward, then  they would understand better.   You are not going to see that on the news. This is not going to be  reported that, oh, we have lost one of the good guys. That is not what  sells papers. That is not what drives up ratings. But it is what keeps  us going.   I really appreciate Chairman Walden's friendship with Ray and his  earlier going over the history because that is important. I really  appreciate the opportunity to add just a few words about, again, one of  the good guys.   In our lives, there are people and places that we remember. I know  that I will always remember Ray. He helped me when I became a Member.  It is tough being the new guy on the block, the low man on the totem  pole, but he was a great help to me and a great help to the committee.  We need more people like Ray Baum. We need more people like that up  here. He was really one of the good ones.   I thank Chairman Walden for giving me this opportunity to do this  tonight. This is special, and I want to just offer my thoughts and  prayers to the family and to the friends. He was indeed a good man.                                time  2100
