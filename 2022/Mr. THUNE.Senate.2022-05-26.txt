Like a lot of Americans, I cannot imagine the anguish these  children's parents are facing right now as they grieve for sons and  daughters whom they will never again drive to school or welcome home at  the end of the day.   I pray that the Lord will be with them in their suffering and that  they will receive the comfort and strength that they need.   My prayers are with the entire Uvalde community--the families of  those killed, the injured, the teachers, and students who suffered such  terror, the medical and law enforcement personnel who responded, and  all those reeling from this terrible attack.

Mr. President, today, I am honored to recognize the  extraordinary service of Brig. Gen. Gentry W. Boswell on the occasion  of his retirement. His 31 years of service to our Nation is the  reflection of a true and devoted public servant.   General Boswell received his commission in 1991 as a distinguished  graduate of the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps at Delta State  University, and he also earned a master of aeronautical science at  Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. In addition, General Boswell  studied at the Squadron Officer School, the Air Command and Staff  College, the Joint Forces Command Advanced Warfighting School, the Air  War College, the Keenan-Flagler Enterprise Leadership School, and the  Naval War College. General Boswell's distinguished military career  encompassed operational tours flying the B-1B, B-52, RC-135, and E-6B  aircraft, and he accumulated more than 4,900 flight hours, including  over 500 combat hours in Southwest Asia, the Balkans, and the Horn of  Africa.   South Dakotans were fortunate to have General Boswell fulfill five  separate military assignments at Ellsworth Air Force Base, serving as  assistant director of operations for the 77th Bomb Squadron from 1999  to 2002, director of operations for the 37th Bomb Squadron from 2007 to  2008, commander of the 28th Operations Support Squadron from 2008 to  2010, vice commander of the 28th Bomb Wing from 2012 to 2014, and  commander of the 28th Bomb Wing from 2015 to 2017.   During his assignments at Ellsworth AFB, General Boswell developed a  culture of putting the airmen first, and he engaged actively in  partnerships with civilian leadership in Rapid City and other Black  Hills communities to improve the quality of life for those in uniform  and their families. In addition, as commander of the 28th Operations  Support Squadron, General Boswell was instrumental in advancing the  expansion of the Powder River Training Complex. The expanded air space  represents the largest military operations area in the lower 48 States,  spanning the skies over North Dakota and South Dakota, Montana, and  Wyoming. This expansive training airspace allows Air Force pilots and  crews to perform the critical training they need in conditions that  closely resemble combat missions.   General Boswell's final assignment for the Air Force was serving as  the director of manpower, organization, and resources. He led the  management and oversight of the Air Force's manpower enterprise, which  encompasses more than 694,000 total force personnel and the programming  of more than $47 billion in annual funding.   General Boswell has received several prestigious awards for his  outstanding military service, including the Defense Superior Service  Medal, Legion of Merit with two oakleaf clusters, Defense Meritorious  Service Medal, Meritorious Service Medal with three oakleaf clusters,  and the Air Medal with two oakleaf clusters.   We are thrilled that General Boswell has chosen to retire in the  Black Hills of South Dakota, where he will have plenty of opportunities  to dedicate more time to hunting. I join all South Dakotans in  extending our congratulations to General Boswell upon his retirement  and for his outstanding military career.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today, I recognize Kate Lundberg, an  intern in my Washington, DC, office, for all of the hard work she has  done for me, my staff, and the State of South Dakota over the past  several months.
