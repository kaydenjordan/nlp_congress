 Mr. Speaker, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and  Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2024,  supports our rural communities and strengthens our national security  and food supply by continuing critical investments in agriculture  research, rural broadband, and animal and plant health programs.   The bill also provides sufficient funds to ensure the safety of food,  drugs, and medical devices, which is especially important after the  Biden administration's failure to protect our children from the baby  formula debacle last year at the FDA. It reins in harmful regulations  that dictate how poultry and livestock producers raise and market their  animals.   These provisions will be sure to help those farmers and agricultural  producers in my district and across Tennessee who are fed up with  bureaucrats in Washington telling them how to farm and tend to their  land and animals.                            ____________________
