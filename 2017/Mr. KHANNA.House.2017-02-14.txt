 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the freshman initiative on  civility. I thank Congressman Johnson for his leadership.   I want to echo the remarks of Congressman Suozzi and Congresswoman  Blunt Rochester about getting things done. We have disagreements on  many issues. I don't think I voted with the Republicans on almost any  issue since I have been in this body. On economic issues, I come from a  perspective of economic populism and a very different perspective than  Members on the other side.   But we also have areas of common agreement. Congressman Gallagher and  Congressman Arrington have talked about term limits, and that is an  area of potential agreement. Congressman Rooney has talked about  getting PAC money out of politics. Congressman Will Hurd has talked  about cybersecurity and tech jobs.   So my view is that, in areas where we disagree, we should disagree  with spirit and conviction, but that doesn't mean that there won't be  areas where we can agree.   And on a personal note, Congressman Fitzpatrick represents the  district where I was born and where my parents are, so I have to be  civil, certainly, to him and the other side.
