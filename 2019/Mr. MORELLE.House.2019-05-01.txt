 Mr. Speaker, I rise today because our Nation is facing a  crisis. Each day, 20 veterans take their own lives. That is over 7,000  veterans a year, more than the number of U.S. soldiers we lost in the  entire Iraq war.   We have a moral responsibility to do more to protect those who have  so courageously put their lives on the line to defend our country.   Recently, it was revealed that the Veterans Administration spent only  $1.5 million of its $6.2 million budget toward suicide prevention media  outreach in fiscal year 2018.  [[Page H3350]]    That is why I have introduced legislation called the Reach Every  Veteran in Crisis Act, to ensure those resources are used effectively  and efficiently to provide veterans with the support services they need  and so richly deserve.   It is my hope that this legislation will help our veterans during  their time of need and, hopefully, save the lives of our Nation's  heroes.   I encourage any veteran who is facing crisis or anyone who is  concerned about a loved one to call the Veterans Crisis Line: 1-800- 273-8255.                            ____________________
