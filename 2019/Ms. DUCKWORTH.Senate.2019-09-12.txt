 Mr. President, in this day and age, it would be easy  to grow cynical and simply tune out the noise of a 24-hour cable news  cycle that feeds off the latest Trump tweet. From Donald Trump's recent  decision to invite the Taliban to join him for a retreat at Camp David  for the weekend of the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks to his  earlier statements caught on tape, bragging about sexually assaulting  women, I fear that too many--including Members of this Chamber--have  become numb to this repeated debasing of the Presidency, numb to a  President who lacks even a hint of remorse or shame as he spews lies to  the people he was elected to serve.   We cannot afford to be numb. We cannot let this become normal. No, we  must hold Donald Trump accountable for his false promises and for his  lies. We must ask what happened to Mexico's paying for the wall. Trump  promised every American over and over again that they wouldn't have to  spend a dime on his wall, pledging that Mexico would pick up the tab  100 percent. He even said, ``It's an easy decision for Mexico: make a  one-time payment of $5-$10 billion.''   Of course, it wasn't so easy, and now Trump has done a 180, falsely  claiming that he never said Mexico would write that check, trying to  gaslight us all with every lie that he tells. We simply can't let him  get away with it.   The truth is that Donald Trump already revealed whom he really wants  to pay for his wall. He discloses it every time his administration begs  Congress to spend billions of your tax dollars building it. He doesn't  care that many who live on the border believe building a wall from sea  to shining sea is the least effective and most expensive way to secure  the border. Trump may not care, but that helps explain Trump's failure  to convince Congress to fund his vanity project--even when Republicans  controlled both Chambers for 2 years.   His outrageous response to his failure revealed another sad truth:  The Presidency hasn't changed Donald Trump one bit. President Donald  Trump is the very same old Donald Trump whose true character was  revealed on the leaked ``Access Hollywood'' tapes.   In Trump's mind, when you are the President, you can do anything.  Congress didn't appropriate funds for your ineffective wall? Well, just  grab funds that Congress authorized for more important programs. Tired  of failing to convince Congress to spend American tax dollars on your  wall? Well, just declare a fake emergency. Senate Republicans will let  you do it.   Listen, Trump's decision to build his vanity wall with funds stolen  from military construction projects and Homeland Security initiatives  isn't really about border security; it is about politics. If he  actually wanted to secure our Nation's border, he wouldn't be stripping  away funding from the dedicated men and women who are responsible for  defending it: the U.S. Coast Guard. Yet that is exactly what he has  done--ripped tens of millions of dollars away from Coast Guard  programs. He has ignored that his actions could endanger our national  security, and he has ignored that we are right in the middle of  hurricane season.    As if that were not bad enough, he has also defunded facilities that  are dedicated to cyber warfare operations and bomb defusing training.  He is slashing money from schools and childcare centers for our  servicemembers' children too.   Donald Trump told us over and over again that Mexico would pay for  his wall. That was a lie. Mexico isn't paying for his wall. Our  servicemembers and their families are. The families at Fort Campbell  are, as their children will now have to keep eating lunch in their  school's library because President Trump decided that revving up his  political base was more important than upgrading an aging military  school. My blood boils when I hear that the children of U.S.  servicemembers are being forced to learn in makeshift classrooms within  classrooms. No child should have to learn in that kind of environment.  In my view, that is the true national emergency.   Let me tell you about three other cases in which the President is  stealing money in order to pay for his wall. One is at the Channel  Islands Air National Guard Station in California.   The project that is losing funds will supply the Colorado Air  National Guard with an adequately sized and properly configured space  to support a Space Control Squadron functions in accordance with force  structure changes. The facility must provide adequate space to support  the squadron's operations, maintenance, security, command and  administration, and storage areas. The facility must have an  unobstructed view of the southern horizon.   The current situation is that this Space Control Squadron, most  likely happening at Peterson Air Force Base, does not currently exist,  and there is no adequate facility located at either Peterson or Buckley  Air Force Base for this Space Control Squadron.   The only solution that meets all mission requirements is to construct  a new facility on Peterson Air Force Base. If this facility is not  provided, the squadron will be unable to beddown the space control  mission and equipment, with operational and strategic mission impacts  due to inadequate facilities.   This is what he is stealing money from in order to build his vanity  wall.   A second project is at Fort Greely, AK. The impact of taking the  money from this project will mean that Fort Greely, AK, will not have  the enhancements and capabilities for the Ballistic Missile Defense  System.   The mission of the Agency is to develop and field an integrated,  layered Ballistic Missile Defense System to defend the United States,  our deployed forces, allies, and friends against all ranges of enemy  ballistic missiles in all phases of flight. This expansion project will  provide the BMDS with increased ground-based interceptor capabilities,  to allow for operational capability.   What happens if the funds are not provided? The planned enhancements  and capabilities of the Ballistic Missile Defense System to meet the  emerging threats will not be available for our Nation's homeland  defense.   He is stealing money away from our Nation's homeland defense to build  his vanity wall.   Finally, at Fort Huachuca, AZ, the current situation is that the  facilities do not meet the current mandatory criteria specified for  vehicle testing and maintenance facilities. The current facilities date  back to the 1930s and 1940s and have surpassed their estimated life  expectancies. The facilities violate current antiterrorism/force  protection standards. Existing utility systems, such as water, sewer,  electric, and gas, require replacement. There are no other suitable  buildings on the installation that are available in support of this  mission.   If they lose the funding for this project, the personnel will  continue to work in substandard and unsafe facilities. The motor pool  facilities do not comply with current life, safety building codes and  quality-of-life standards. The current HVAC, fire suppression, the  existing AT/FP and infrastructure deficiencies jeopardize the  personnel's health, security, and safety.   This is what he is taking money from to build this wall. The Senate  could put a stop to this. It is up to us and our actions, and this very  Chamber will determine whether the children of Fort Campbell, whether  the personnel at Fort Huachuca, and whether the staff at Fort Greely,  AK, can do their jobs. We can defend the power of the purse or we can  be complicit in its destruction.  [[Page S5466]]    Look, I am not naive. I know some don't share my outrage, that some  believe that overcrowded military schools, a decrease in our national  security defense, and our ability to defend against hostile ballistic  missiles are not a crisis, let alone a national disgrace. These Trump  loyalists cower to his bullying tactics, and in the coming days, they  will try to reward his abuse of power. They will not stop Trump and  return the stolen taxpayer dollars. Rather, they will argue that we  should dig even deeper into the Nation's funds to spend more of your  tax dollars to replace the money Trump stole. This is wrong. The  Constitution entrusts Congress to authorize and to appropriate funds,  not the President.   I urge all of my colleagues to join me in condemning this raid of  taxpayer funds. We must block these outrageous cuts that will harm  military readiness, weaken our border security, and hurt the families  of those who are brave enough to serve.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
