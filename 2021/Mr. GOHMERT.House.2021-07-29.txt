 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Florida for  yielding. I was quite shocked at the treatment we received. When people  who have oversight and are responsible for voting to fund or not fund  Federal facilities like the one we visited, I am not used to having  somebody make such an overt effort to hide everything they are doing to  the extent that they would lure us outside so they could lock the door.  And there were lawyers, there were defendants, there were people going  through the main entrance we did, yet because we are Members of  Congress, they locked the door after accusing us of being trespassers,  which is a crime. And so, we may want to look at who it is that was  calling us trespassers. Obviously they have got some serious training  that they need to go through.   But this is nothing new and this has nothing to do with January 6,  other than we have been alerted that there are people that are being  mistreated.   I have been alerted to people being mistreated before and took action  to see if that was true. I don't care what their political leanings  are. If they are being mistreated, then something needs to be done.   Back when President George W. Bush was in office and there were  abuses by the Justice Department, I was completely on the side of the  Democrats. There is no place for that kind of thing, abusing people's  civil rights. And we have been belittled here on the House floor, all  of us here, and accused of trying to belittle what occurred on January  6. No, there were some atrocious things that happened, and there needs  to be punishment for that. But there is and has been concern that there  were people that didn't even know they were doing anything wrong, and  in some cases were not doing anything wrong have had their homes  invaded and had their door busted open.   One constituent last week called my office here in Washington to say  that she was in east Texas on January 5, 6, and 7, all relevant times.  She had no thought of coming to Washington. She did have a picture of  Trump on Facebook. Her nephew texted her: Hey, I saw this picture. The  FBI is asking who it is, and I wondered if maybe she looked familiar.   And apparently, it looked very similar to this woman, and he thought  his aunt would get a kick out of that, so he sends the text with this  picture. And she says: Gee, it does look like me. LOL. Don't turn me  in.   Days later she has a visit from two FBI agents who demand to know  where she was January 6.   Well, now as I understand it, the only contact she had with the  events of January 6 was her nephew sending her that text message. And  then FBI agents show up. She was not that woman, and you could see the  difference. But somebody had to have been monitoring those text  messages.   That was something that got me bent out of shape back in the second  term of President Bush. You can't just go spying on American citizens.  It is not right. And I guess it is possible that they got a FISA  warrant to spy on an American citizen, but I would have hoped that the  FISA judges would be a little more circumspect after we found out how  abusive those FISA judges have been with just signing off on anything  the DOJ wants in the way of warrants.   The Constitution requires specificity, particularity. You have got to  describe the thing to be searched, the thing to be seized. And we had  seen from one that WikiLeaks let go on Verizon, they said: Yeah, we  just want everything Verizon has.   And the judge said: Oh, they want everything Verizon has on its  customers; okay. Signs the warrant.   We cannot keep a republic with judges that have that much disdain or  inconsideration of the Constitution they are sworn to follow. And the  fact that no FISA judge got bent out of shape after being lied to by  DOJ and the FBI is another indication we have got a tremendous amount  of cleaning up to do to save our republic.   I appreciate my friend for the time, and I appreciate you having this  Special Order and allowing me to participate.                                General Leave
