 Mr. Speaker, I am here today to recognize Katherine  Johnson, Dr. Christine Darden, Dorothy Vaughan, Mary Jackson, and the  hundreds of women in STEM who made incredible contributions to our  country and to the cause of scientific research and exploration.   Katherine and her team of mathematicians and engineers were pivotal  to one of our Nation's greatest triumphs: landing the first man on the  Moon. Yet, as Black women in America, they faced pervasive  discrimination. They were subjected to segregated facilities and their  careers were stifled by an explicit and implicit culture of racism and  misogyny.   I will also note that today is Equal Pay Day and that the gender pay  gap is even more stark for women of color. It takes a Black woman 7  months longer to earn what a man takes home in 1 year, which is why I  have been a strong supporter of the Paycheck Fairness Act.   I will further note that we were supposed to send the first all-woman  space walk on March 29 up into outer space, but we had to cancel that  trip because of lack of proper suits for women. We must do better.   Katherine Johnson, Dr. Christine Darden, Dorothy Vaughan, Mary  Jackson, and the hundreds of other women in STEM were never properly  recognized for their brilliance and determination, which is why I, as a  Member of Congress, am a cosponsor of the Hidden Figures Congressional  Gold Medal Act.                            ____________________
