 Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the Equal  COLA Act, which I reintroduced today.   The Federal Government's workforce is central to protecting our  national security and delivering critical services to hundreds of  millions of Americans. As such, it is essential that the Federal  Government attract and retain an effective workforce and, once their  service is complete, ensure retirees receive the dignified retirement  that they deserve.   Unfortunately, in 1986, Congress created a two-tiered system that now  prevents nearly 800,000 retired Federal employees from receiving a full  cost-of-living adjustment when consumer prices increase more than 2  percent from year to year.   In January, some Federal retirees will receive a 3.2-percent COLA.  However, other Federal retirees will receive only a 2.2-percent  increase due to this policy, which fails to protect retired employees  living on a fixed income.   That is why I am proud to reintroduce this legislation to fix this  unfair system and ensure that all retired Federal employees receive  full retirement benefits that keep up with the cost of living.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill to ensure  that retired Federal employees no longer pay the price of a misguided  law and that their benefits fully keep pace with the cost of living.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Mr. Warner):   S. 3195. A bill to designate the General George C. Marshall House, in  the Commonwealth of Virginia, as an affiliated area of the National  Park System, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and  Natural Resources.
