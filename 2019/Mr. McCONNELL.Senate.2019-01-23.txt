 Madam President, tomorrow the Senate will vote on the  plan put forward by President Trump to reopen the closed portions of  the Federal Government right away, increase security on our southern  border, deliver disaster recovery funding, and address some outstanding  immigration issues.   By way of reminder, this is a compromise measure that was carefully  designed to include the kinds of ideas Democrats have been eager to  support, including very recently. First and foremost, the legislation  would end this partial shutdown and bring all parts of the Federal  Government back online for the American people. Normal operations would  resume. Federal workers would receive backpay and continue to be paid.  This could happen quickly.   The bill also takes a compromise approach to the underlying  disagreement that brought us to this point. It would fully fund the  border security priorities identified by the men and women actually  working on the ground: investments in surveillance and security  technologies, in recruiting and training new Border Patrol agents, and,  yes, additional funding for physical barriers like the walls and fences  which Democratic Senators used to boast about voting for and which  President Obama's administration bragged about building.   Of course, the reality of a divided government is that negotiations  do not leave either side with their perfect plan. So the President went  out of his way to include additional items that have been priority  areas for Democrats. For example, the proposal would grant 3-year  lawful status for certain currently enrolled DACA recipients and  individuals under TPS. Finally, the White House proposal also includes  all seven of our regular order appropriations bills, the product of  bipartisan work in this body and in the House throughout last year.   So the President's compromise offer should command serious  consideration in both Houses of Congress. On day 33 of this partial  government shutdown, we have before us a bill to immediately reopen the  Federal Government, deliver all remaining full-year appropriations  measures, support disaster recovery efforts, fully fund comprehensive  border security priorities, and address some outstanding immigration  issues. It is hard to think of a good reason to oppose this, but my  Democratic friends are trying to come up with something--anything--to  justify prolonging the stalemate. I have a great deal of respect for my  friends across the aisle, but honestly this is getting downright  silly--downright silly.   Yesterday the Democratic leader announced that he was denouncing  President Trump's proposal because ``there were no serious negotiations  with any Democrat.'' It would appear my friend is offended that he  wasn't consulted while this compromise was under construction. So let's  stop and think about that for a minute.   For days--weeks now--the American people have seen the Democratic  leader and the Speaker of the House make a public strategy out of  refusing to negotiate. That has been their position; that we will not  negotiate.   They have said it publicly. They have announced they are not  interested in a negotiated solution to this impasse, not interested in  meeting the President halfway on immigration policy or anything else,  happy to keep the government closed unless and until everyone agrees to  move forward in their preferred manner with no concessions and nothing  for border security.   Now, that has been the Democrats' public stance. Our friends across  the aisle have said repeatedly that they have no intention to negotiate  out of the stalemate. The Speaker of the House joked that she would  allow $1--$1--for physical barriers like wall fencing. That is why they  have turned away from multiple opportunities to negotiate at the White  House in recent weeks.   So my friend across the aisle is attempting quite the two-step here.  First, the Democratic leader repeatedly said he wasn't interested in  any talks at this point, but then when President Trump puts forward a  proposal to move us forward, my colleague complains he wasn't  consulted.   Well, the President and the American people are picking up on the  strangeness of the Democratic leader's strategy of refusing to even  negotiate. Here is one headline from a newspaper editorial that echoes  this growing national sentiment. Here is what he said: ``Trump made an  offer--it's time for Democrats to start negotiating.''   This is from the Washington Post--the Washington Post:         [T]o refuse even to talk until the government reopens does       no favors to sidelined federal workers.        [A] measure of statesmanship for a member of Congress now       is the ability to accept some disappointments, and shrug off       the inevitable attacks from the purists.    There are signs that Democratic Members in both Chambers are starting  to come to the same conclusion, starting to reject their leaders'  refusal to even negotiate.   Here is what a few of our Democratic colleagues in the Senate have  said in the last few days:         I personally don't think a border wall is in and of itself       immoral.    Here is another:         Everybody is for border security. . . . There are places a       wall makes sense.    Here are a few of our Democratic colleagues over in the House:         If we don't compromise, the American people are the ones       who get hurt.    Another said:         If I had the opportunity to vote for some sort of deal, I       would.    Another said:         There is common ground. . . . We do have to figure out how       to secure our borders.    Even Speaker Pelosi's own House majority leader broke completely with  her extreme position in a television interview just yesterday. When  asked if he would personally be open to wall funding, Congressman Hoyer  replied:         Look, I think physical barriers are part of the solution.    That is the majority leader of the House of Representatives.   When the news anchor pressed him on Speaker Pelosi's statement that a  wall is immoral, Majority Leader Hoyer replied:         It depends on what a wall is used for, whether it's moral       or immoral. If it is protecting people, it is moral. That is       not the issue.    He went on:         We want to make sure that people who come into the United       States are authorized to do so. . . . We are for border       security and I think we can get there.    So more and more Democrats seem to be coming to the same collusion as  the rest of us. It is time to make a deal--time to make a deal.   Fortunately, a deal is on the table. It is a deal for everyone who  would rather reopen the government, invest in border security, and  secure more certainty for DACA recipients than sacrifice all that for  the sake of this radical new position that physical barriers, like  walls or fencing, are inherently immoral. So the President has produced  a fair compromise that pairs full-year government funding with  immigration policy priorities from both sides.   Enough political spite--enough. Enough showboating for ``the  Resistance.'' Enough refusing to join in talks and then complaining you  weren't consulted. Our Federal workforce and the American people  deserve a whole lot better than this.   I can't believe the bulk of our Democratic colleagues really see  opposing the President as more important--more important--to their  constituents than restoring full government function, paying our  Federal employees, securing the border, and more certainty for the DACA  population.   When we vote on the President's plan tomorrow, we will see what each  Senator decides to prioritize.                        Covington Catholic High School    Madam President, on one final and totally different matter, I need to  say a few words about something that took place this past weekend.   Last week, Kentuckians of all ages traveled to our Nation's Capital  to exercise our fundamental American rights to peacefully assemble and  petition the government.  [[Page S490]]    Unfortunately for the students of Covington Catholic High School,  their participation has resulted in threats on their lives.   Far-left activists and members of the national and State media  isolated a very few seconds of video footage from any shred of context,  and many decided it was time to attack and denigrate these young  people.   Because of what some highly partisan observers thought--thought--they  saw in a few seconds of confusing video, these kids, their school, and  their families were met with a deluge--a virtual deluge--of partisan  vitriol and hatred from people who never met them and had no idea what  had taken place. Some prominent figures even used this pile-on to  propose curtailing the First Amendment for groups with whom they  disagree, even targeting the students' hats.   How quickly some seem to forget why the Framers insisted on these  protections in the first place.   In a matter of hours, these students were tried, convicted, and  sentenced by the media, where accuracy is irrelevant and the  presumption of innocence does not exist. To their credit, some  apologized for their commentary upon learning more, but by that point  too much damage had already been done.   Because of the startling death threats against these students and  their families, Covington Catholic--which, by the way, is in Kentucky-- was closed yesterday. The school's administration is working closely  with law enforcement, but it is unclear when any sense of normalcy  might return.    This time, it is families in my home State who are paying the price  for exercising their freedoms. Sadly, this kind of fact-free rush to  judgment is becoming an all-too-often occurrence.   If we can learn anything from this weekend, here is what I hope it  is: When the rush for headlines takes precedence over the facts,  mistakes are made, and our rights as Americans are put at risk. This  trend is particularly troubling when young people are involved.                              Signing Authority    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senior Senator from  Alaska be authorized to sign duly enrolled bills or joint resolutions  today.    I object.    Madam President, I would like to take a moment to mark  the first anniversary of the tragic shooting at Marshall County High  School, which took place 1 year ago today in Benton, KY.   Bailey Holt and Preston Cope, both 15, began that morning just like  any other. Their parents and friends described Bailey and Preston as  bright kids with promising futures ahead, but this peaceful community  was shattered when a fellow student opened fire, taking Bailey and  Preston's lives, and leaving nearly 20 additional students wounded.   Their families were left to grieve, and for the past year, the  community has done its best to provide comfort and put the pieces back  together.   This evening, the Marshall County community will join together once  again to remember the victims and to continue the healing. As they do,  my prayers and those of all their fellow Kentuckians will be with them.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 11 a.m.,  Thursday, January 24; further, that following the prayer and pledge,  the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be  approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their  use later in the day, and morning business be closed; finally, that  following leader remarks, the time until 12:30 p.m. be equally divided  between the two leaders or their designees.    Madam President, if there is no further business to  come before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 2:05 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, January 24, 2019, at 11 a.m.                            ____________________
