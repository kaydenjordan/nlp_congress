 Mr. President, we just voted on Secretary Michael Regan  to be the new EPA Administrator. I want to congratulate him on his  vote. He is now the new EPA Administrator.   I sit on the Committee on Environment and Public Works. So we had  hearings for Mr. Regan--Administrator Regan, I guess we want to call  him now--and I have had a number of conversations with him. I actually  voted for him to move out of committee to come to the floor for this  vote that we took today.   I like to come down to the floor to explain my votes because  sometimes I support the Biden administration's Cabinet officials. I  introduced Secretary of Defense Austin at his confirmation hearing. I  served with him many years ago when I was a marine and he was a four- star general in the Army. I have a lot of respect for the Secretary of  Defense.   Then there are other times when I am a ``no.'' What I typically like  to do is come and explain the noes but not always. On this one, for  Secretary Regan, for Administrator Regan and his team, I want to  explain it because I will say that I was impressed with him. I think he  is qualified. He was essentially the EPA administrator for North  Carolina. Both of his Republican Senators introduced him at his hearing  and voted for him, I believe, today, and I have had good conversations  with him as well.   Here is the thing: I was trying to get commitments from him. Now,  this is very normal in the confirmation process. You work with the  nominees and try to get commitments. Sometimes they give them, and  sometimes they don't, but that is what we do--give advice and consent.  We have been doing this since the Founding Fathers wrote the  Constitution on what the Senate should be doing in these confirmation  processes that we are going through right now with the Biden  administration. So I wasn't asking for a lot in terms of commitments  from this administration for the great State of Alaska, but it was  important to me.   Why was it important to me?   Unfortunately, the Biden administration has launched a war on working  families in Alaska. Now, that sounds like a pretty dramatic statement,  ``a war on working families in Alaska.'' What I am looking for is a  ceasefire. My State, like a lot of States, is hurting economically. We  are doing very well and I am very proud of Alaska on the health side.  We are No. 1 in terms of vaccinations per capita in the country, which  is remarkable, if you have been to my State, as it is so huge and the  populations are so spread out, but we are working together, all of us,  and we are achieving really remarkable results. We have been No. 1 in  testing per capita throughout the whole pandemic, and we have had some  of the lowest per capita death rates throughout the whole pandemic. But  we are being really hit hard economically in the energy sector, the  tourism sector, and the commercial fishing sector.   So why am I looking for a ceasefire?   In the first 2 months of the Biden administration, there have been  eight Executive orders, if you include the recent statement by the  President and the Prime Minister of Canada, which had a focus on  Alaska, which have been focused on my State. Usually, it will be on  economic development projects and usually on access to Federal lands.  Eight. There is no State in the country that is getting that kind of  attention from this administration, and we are hurting. It is not even  close. Show me any other State represented in the U.S. Senate Chamber  that has eight Executive orders directed at your State. It won't exist.  Trust me--my constituents don't like all the attention.   So I want to ask the President--not the Presiding Officer but the  President: Mr. President, Mr. President Biden, sir, you were a U.S.  Senator for three decades. Let me just ask you this question: If a  Republican administration came into office and focused its attention on  shutting down Delaware with eight Executive orders inside of 2 months,  you would be on the floor every day like me, talking about it, asking  for some relief. That is all we are asking for--a ceasefire on the  hard-working families of Alaska.   This is what I asked Secretary Regan. A commitment on these is not a  big issue. I told him, if I could get a commitment on these things, I  would come down to the floor and give a speech in favor of his  confirmation.   One was of a very big energy project in my State that has been  permitted for almost 25 years. It started with the Clinton  administration, in a place called the National Petroleum Reserve of  Alaska, and was set aside by Congress for oil and gas development. That  is what the NPR-A is. We do it responsibly, better than any place in  the world, but this is a project that was started by the Clinton  administration and moved forward by the Bush administration. There was  a big NEPA environmental impact statement by the Obama administration,  called the Integrated Activity Plan for NPR-A, which was approved. It  was completely noncontroversial because that is what this part of  Alaska is set aside for. Then the Trump administration finalized a very  large but responsibly developed energy project. We started it this  winter with no controversy. It has estimates of 2,000 direct jobs, with  thousands more indirect jobs. All we wanted was a commitment to keep it  going. That is it--simple, status quo. Couldn't get it. Couldn't get  it.   There is litigation with regard to this project right now. About 200  people--almost 200 workers--have been sent home with pink slips during  a recession. Those were great jobs by the way. We tried to get a  commitment on this. We couldn't get it. By the way, 75 percent of those  2,000 jobs were union jobs and high-paying--building trades, laborers,  operating engineers, teamsters. They are great Americans, by the way.  Seventy-five percent. Noncontroversial. Twenty-five years of permits.  No one has been against this. So I just wanted a commitment on it. No.  Like I said, it is a war on working families.   Here is another one. Here is something that a lot of people don't  know about Alaska: 60 percent of the country's wetlands, of America's  wetlands, are in my State--six zero. Now, we have the most beautiful  State. We love our wilderness. We love the outdoors. We care about the  Alaskan environment more than anyone else and--trust me--more than  anyone else in the  [[Page S1474]]  EPA. That is for sure. We have 175 million acres of wetlands. So this  creates challenges.   Unlike most of the lower 48, we have not dredged and filled these  areas in the past. If you look at the east coast, at its environments-- no offense to some of my colleagues whose States are up the corridor  here--holy cow. And you wonder about my environment? Geez Louise. But  it is hard to do compensation for projects where you haven't had dredge  and fill before, because we have so many wetlands. So, in 2018, the  Corps of Engineers and the EPA had an MOU to address some of these  mitigation challenges. It wasn't controversial; it was creative. I  thought Secretary Regan thought it was creative when I talked to him  about it. So we just asked for a continuation of this. These are really  simple commitments, good ideas--couldn't get it from the Secretary.    Now, look, here's my own view. I think Mr. Regan wanted to--I  explained these to him. I think he was reasonable, someone who has done  this in his State and knows each State is unique. He cares about jobs.  He cares about environmental justice. That is a big issue in my State  when a lot of these communities that are getting targeted are actually  Alaska Native communities. They are killing jobs in those communities.  That is environmental justice; that is for sure. So my instinct was he  wanted to make these commitments, but I think he was told no. I don't  know that, but I'm pretty--well, I can't say. But I think he was told  no by the White House. This raises a much bigger concern about this  nominee.   My good friend, the esteemed Senator from West Virginia, Senator  Capito, was on the floor earlier. She also sits on the EPW Committee.  She is the ranking member on the committee. She gave a really important  speech on why she also voted no for Mr. Regan. And I think she had the  same feeling I did. He knows the issues, is qualified, cares about  different States' challenges. But she raised a concern that I want to  reiterate because I think it is going to be a really big concern, and I  think it is going to come to a head here soon, and that is this: There  is concern, not just among Republican Senators--it is all over the  press, and she cited it--that Mr. Regan, who is now the EPA  Administrator might not be the person in charge of the EPA. Now he's  Senate-confirmed. He is the one who has to come before the Congress for  hearings, for oversight, but what are we talking about here?   Well, the former EPA Administrator, Gina McCarthy, is in the White  House. She is out talking to the press all the time. She's an  unaccountable czar on these issues, working behind the scenes--and,  actually, not even behind the scenes. She was recently quoting about  herself, saying she's the orchestra leader of all of these issues.   Wait, what about the EPA Administrator? I thought he was the Senate- confirmed person nominated by the President. The big, big concern is  that he is not going to have the authority or the decision-making  capacity and is going to be told what to do by a shadow EPA working out  of the White House run by Gina McCarthy. That is not just me. That is  not just Senator Capito. That is all over the press. Read it. Inside  EPA--she was quoting from that, Senator Capito was. No transparency  there? All these previous Obama administration EPA alumnae in the White  House running it.   By the way, if I am the new EPA Administrator, Mr. Regan, I wouldn't  want that notion out there. But with all due respect, sir--and, again,  congratulations--it is out there, and you need to tamp this down  because it is going to come to a head.   Look, my State did not fare well under the Gina McCarthy EPA. There  is a long list: the waters of the United States--I won't get into the  details of the disrespect to my constituents. Armed EPA officials with  body armor, rifles, were going after gold miners and placer miners in  Alaska because they thought they were violating the Clean Water Act. No  kidding. Read about it. Chicken, AK--go Google that. We were not big  fans.   So I believe Mr. Regan wants to work with Alaskans. I believe he  understands the concept of cooperative federalism on these  environmental issues. I don't believe he would authorize armed guards  to terrify small placer miners in the interior of Alaska the way the  previous Administrator McCarthy did and talk to the press in a  blatantly disrespectful way to my fellow Alaskans. It was shameful, in  my view. But this issue is going to come to a head.   Who is in charge? Regardless of whether you are a Democrat or  Republican, if you voted for the EPA Administrator or you didn't, we  want him in charge because he is the Senate-confirmed official  nominated by the President, not an unelected official in the White  House who I guarantee wouldn't have been able to get confirmed. So it  is going to be a challenge.   And it is not just Gina McCarthy. We had an EPW hearing today, and I  raised the issue of the other czar--John Kerry, the former Senator. But  he is not confirmed. He hasn't been appointed to a Senate-confirmed  job. He and the President are at loggerheads on a really big issue.  President Biden, the President of the United States, recently in a  meeting reported by the press with labor leaders, said: I am all in on  natural gas. That is important. That is a huge issue for our  environment and our workers. The President of the United States said  ``I am all in on natural gas'' to the men and women who build  pipelines. He told them that recently in a White House meeting. He is  the President of the United States.   Now John Kerry--I think some people think he is President of the  world. He is flying around on his airplane right now, and he is telling  people he is not for natural gas. Well, I wonder who is going to win  that debate.   But this goes to this issue: These are going to come to a head. Who  is in charge here--the President of the United States or the President  of the world--on natural gas? I hope it is the President of the United  States because natural gas is going to be key for our workers, for our  environment, for our national security. And at the EPA level, who is in  charge? Mr. Regan? I hope so. Or Gina McCarthy? It is looking more and  more like she is in charge.   So that is why a number of us, despite being impressed, wanting to  work with the new EPA Administrator voted no, and I certainly hope that  the unaccountable team of McCarthy and Kerry in the White House are not  going to be running the policy, but it is going to be the people who  were actually confirmed by the U.S. Senate because that is the way our  system of government is supposed to work.   So, Mr. President, for those reasons, although I again want to  congratulate Mr. Regan, I respectfully declined to support his  nomination, and we will see. We will see who is going to be ultimately  in charge.   I want to work with him and his team. These issues are so important  to my State. I want him to help convince others in the Biden White  House for the ceasefire that my constituents need.   We need to get to work, and I am hoping he is going to be a  constructive partner in that regard                            ____________________     Mr. President, most mornings I get up kind of early,  and I go for a run on the Mall, run by the Capitol, this beautiful  building, the Senate, the House, the people's house, which recently was  open for all of us to enjoy. And now, as most Americans know, it is  ringed with gates and razor wire and troops. It looks a little bit like  the Green Zone in Baghdad, not the U.S. Capitol.   Here's the thing. When I go running--I do this most mornings; I did  it this morning--you see these wonderful National Guard men and women  who are serving their country still here behind the fence, behind the  razor wire. And they are literally about every 50 yards, sometimes  closer, standing post all night--all night--hundreds of them, American  soldiers.   They are doing their duty, and we all appreciate it. I talk to them.  I just say: Hey, how you guys doing? How is morale? You want to be  here? You think it is time to go home? I think it is time for you to go  home, and I am going to try and help you with that.   Now, look, most are stoic. They are tough. They are soldiers doing  their job. But make no mistake, they want to go home. They are standing  their post all night, 1, 2, 3 in the morning,  [[Page S1475]]  every 50 yards, for what? For what? I don't think they know what for,  and neither do I.   Now the assault that took place on our democracy on January 6 was a  dark day for our country, no doubt. I will remember that for the rest  of my life. But the Members of Congress did something really important  that same day. We reconvened right here in the U.S. Senate, even amid  some of the broken glass and smashed doors in the House. We finished  our constitutional duty to count the electoral college votes. The  rioters that day--who should be prosecuted--did not win. That was  important.   But that was 3 months ago, and our Nation's Capitol is still decked  in layer upon layer of barbed wire and metal fencing. More than 5,000  troops still roam the Capitol instead of being where they know they  should be: home with their families, back to their jobs--these are  National Guard members, so their work is obviously being disrupted--and  back to their States and their communities.   The cost of keeping them here since January at this juncture is over  a half billion dollars. But here's the thing: I pay close attention to  these issues. I keep asking: OK, I understand this; they were here  after the 6th, and they were here for the inauguration, but what is the  threat now? Give me an intel threat--a credible intel threat--that  requires 5,000 troops and razor wire all across the U.S. Capitol, the  people's house. What is the credible intel? I have not gotten any  credible intel that I am aware of.   We learned yesterday that the Secretary of Defense approved the  request for these soldiers to be here for another 60 days. Here is what  you didn't hear about in those reports. I have a lot of respect for the  Secretary of Defense. As a matter of fact, as I mentioned in my remarks  earlier, I introduced him at his confirmation hearing. But this  decision on whether there should be troops here or not is actually not  his decision. It is our decision. It is the Members of Congress's  decision. That is the threshold issue: Should we still have the troops  here? It is the majority leader's decision. It is the Speaker of the  House's decision. So why do we still have troops here? Why is the  Capitol still in high security lockdown?   I think it would be really important for the majority leader to come  to the floor and not only tell us but tell the troops, tell the  American people what is going on.   Remember, this is not our House. This is not our building. This  belongs to the people of America. We are privileged to be here,  certainly, but we need answers.   And I will tell you who else needs answers. The troops need answers.   My own view is we need to get these troops home. We need to tear down  the wall. We need to open the gate. And this is not just my view; this  is a widely held view. Democrats and Republicans all agree.   Just look around the Capitol Hill neighborhoods. These signs are  everywhere. So are other signs. ``Free the People's House.'' ``Don't  Fence the Capitol.''   What is happening right now--we all love our military. Our military  normally is a symbol of strength for America. But right now, the  military here is not a symbol of strength. We are telling the world,  through razor wire, that American democracy is fragile and that it is  afraid. American democracy is not fragile, and it is not afraid. So  these troops are a symbol not just to Americans but to the rest of the  world that the Capitol lives in fear or weakness.   There was evidently some kind of vague--it wasn't credible--threat on  March 4 from some nutjob group, QAnon--however the heck you pronounce  it--and we had the entire House on the other side of this great  building call it quits, went home, and said: We are not going to do any  work. That is exactly the wrong answer. That is not what we did on  January 6.   So what we need is we need our leaders in the House and in the Senate  to come down here and tell us why we are still in an armed camp. One  can't help but wonder if there is something else going on here. Why do  the leaders of the House and Senate still want thousands of troops and  razor wire around the Capitol? I hope they don't fear the people they  represent. I don't fear my constituents. Is there intel that they have  that we don't know about? How long can we expect this green zone in our  Nation's Capital to continue? The American people need answers.   But here is the key issue. At the end of the day, this is a law  enforcement problem. It is not a military problem. To make it a  military problem is dangerous. If the Capitol Police need more  officers, then let's have that discussion, but we are a citizen- controlled government, and our military, whom I respect so much, should  not be used for an extended period of time here on the Capitol grounds  to handle a law enforcement issue, especially at the most important  symbol of democracy in America, probably the most important symbol of  democracy in the world.   So here is what we need to do. It is time to tear these walls down,  open these gates, and send our brave National Guard troops home.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
