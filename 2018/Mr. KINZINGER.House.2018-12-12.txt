 Mr. Speaker, we have got a lot of really important  issues we talk about every day out here. I want to talk about something  that is happening a few thousand miles away but affects us all. I want  to talk about what is going on in Syria.   Mr. Speaker, I remember back, I think, in 2011 being in Israel and  standing in the Golan Heights and looking over towards Syria, and our  guide at the time made the comment that there is a little disturbance  over there. There was some concern about where that was going to lead,  and we all know what has happened since.   There is a lot of attention focused on Yemen right now, but in Syria  there are 500,000 Syrian civilians who have been killed by a brutal  dictator, Bashar al-Assad, 50,000 of which are children. Some of those  children, in spectacular displays, were murdered by the use of chemical  weapons, and I give great credit to our President and this  administration for responding, as an America that believes in morals  and strength should, by bombing and destroying some of the facilities  that did that and holding to our red line.   But the war hasn't stopped, and the egregious nature of the war  continues. I actually believe that the nature of that war is creating  another generation of terrorists, people who feel that they don't have  hope, people who feel that they don't have opportunity. And when hope  and opportunity don't exist, people turn to extremes, and this is one  case.   I want to talk specifically, though, about a really sad situation, a  lady from Chicago, an American citizen, Layla Shweikani, who was  murdered by the Assad regime. She was Chicago born and, a few years  ago, basically made the decision that she had a passion for the people  of Syria and decided to go and be an aide worker in Eastern Ghouta.   Two years ago she disappeared. We know that she was put into Assad's  prison camps and tortured for 10 months--an American, by the way-- before being transferred to a military court.   Unfortunately, a few weeks ago our worst fears were confirmed: Miss  Layla was actually tortured to death and executed on December 28, 2016,  the first American we know who was tortured and killed by Bashar al- Assad.   We know there are other Americans in captivity, and we know this is  something that needs to be addressed.   Mr. Speaker, there are some in our Government, in this Chamber and in  the other Chamber, that express sympathy to Bashar al-Assad and believe  the antiquated theory that oppression of civilians is the only way to  prevent terrorism.   I would argue that, in an age of information, in an age of knowledge,  oppression only leads to more terrorists. Oppression leads to  hopelessness, to a lack of opportunity, and to turning to the only  option they know at that time, which may be ISIS or al-Qaida, because  they don't see any other opportunity or hope.   Mr. Speaker, these people in our Government who express sympathy,  while I believe that is something they have to answer with their  creator ultimately someday, I am curious now what the response of  everybody is when we find out that an American woman was tortured and  killed in the prison camps of Assad.   We have a bill called the Caesar Syria Civilian Protection Act.  Caesar was a brave hero from Syria who took tens of thousands of  pictures of torture victims of Assad, smuggled them to the United  States, brought them in front of my committee in Foreign Affairs, and  showed some of these pictures.   There was an act that would sanction many members of the regime that  was passed unanimously out of Foreign Affairs, passed out of the House,  largely supported in the Senate, and is being held up by a junior  Senator from Kentucky.    I call on the other side of this blessed Capitol to pass the Caesar  Syrian Civilian Protection Act. I call on the administration--as they  said they support this--to sign this, put this on the Resolute desk.   We talk a lot about the importance of women and equality, and I  couldn't agree more; but in that debate, I think it is important to  remember that, in Syria, an American civilian woman was tortured to  death.   We look in places like Afghanistan and know the oppression of women  that occurred there. We know that America stands for something greater,  and it is not just through the use of the military but through what we  believe and what we stand for and the light that we shine.   Mr. Speaker, this is a terrible situation, Miss Layla's death, but  let us learn from it and let us go forward, and let the people of Syria  be free.                            ____________________
