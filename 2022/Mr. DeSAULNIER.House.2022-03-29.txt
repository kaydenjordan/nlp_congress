 Madam Speaker, Americans are living longer than ever  before--about 30 years longer, on average, than a century ago. To quote  the founder of the Stanford Center on Longevity, ``longevity is . . .  among the greatest opportunities we have had in human history.''   Those extra years mean more time spent with family and friends and  enjoying retirement.   Unfortunately, while life expectancy increases, Americans are falling  behind on retirement savings.   More than 4 in 10 American adults have less than $25,000 saved for  retirement.   And the coronavirus pandemic has made it worse. According to a recent  study, 1 in 5 Americans said they are saving less for retirement due to  the pandemic's impact on their finances.   We need to act now to correct course to improve retirement savings.   The Securing a Strong Retirement Act is a comprehensive, bipartisan  bill that eliminates many of the hurdles to workers enrolling in and  remaining in retirement savings plans.   As a former small business owner and as the current Chair of the  Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions Subcommittee, I have seen  firsthand how reforms like the ones in this bill can help people live  happier lives into their retirement.   Importantly, this legislation incorporates the RISE Act, which I was  proud to co-author with the Chairman of the full Committee Chairman  Scott, Ranking Member Foxx, and the Ranking member of my HELP  Subcommittee Mr. Allen. Through that effort, we can:   Help part-time workers join an employers' retirement savings plan;   Incentivize workers to participate in retirement plans with small  financial incentives; and   Through the ``Retirement Lost and Found'' database at the Department  of Labor help workers locate their hard-earned retirement savings as  they move from job to job.   I am proud to have played a part in this significant and bipartisan  effort, and will proudly vote in support of this legislation.
