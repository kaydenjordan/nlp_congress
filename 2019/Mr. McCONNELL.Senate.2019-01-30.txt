 Mr. President, as I have discussed several times, the  Strengthening America's Security in the Middle East Act is a  consequential legislative package that would strengthen vital  partnerships and reaffirm our active role in matters of global concern.  I am proud to support it. I was also proud to lay down an amendment  yesterday that would allow the Senate to speak equally forcefully on  critical subjects in American foreign policy.   The United States is engaged in Syria and Afghanistan for one simple  reason: because our enemies are engaged there. Real dangers to us and  to our allies still remain in both of these nations. So we must  continue to confront them there. Fortunately, we are not alone. We are  joined in the counter-ISIS coalition by 78 other partners, and in both  Syria and Afghanistan, local fighters are bearing the brunt--the  brunt--of the work.   But American leadership is absolutely essential, and that is what  this amendment is all about. My amendment is not partisan. It expresses  views and concerns from Senators on both sides of the aisle, and it  certainly isn't political. I intended it as an opportunity for the  Senate to debate and vote on some of the more consequential matters of  the day, and I expected this institution to rise to the occasion.   I was a Senator on September 11, 2001. I don't want America to ever  live through another day like that--none of us do.   I have also been here in the Senate for the 17 years since--17 years  of American engagement in worldwide efforts to combat terrorism. It  hasn't been easy navigating American interests through this complicated  and troubled region. It hasn't been easy adapting to an entirely new  way of warfare against enemies that have proven adaptive themselves.   It is understandable that as we get further from September 11, many  would grow tired of our military efforts a long way from home, but as  decisions from the Obama administration have made painfully clear,  leaving too abruptly carries its own grave risks.   Had President Obama known that ISIS would emerge in the wake of his  withdrawal from Iraq and flourish in the chaos of the Syrian civil war,  I suspect he might have done things differently. Perhaps he would not  have abandoned Iraq so precipitously, ignored the growing terror  threats in Syria, or allowed Assad to steamroll over his now-infamous  ``red line.''   We can't undo this unfortunate history, but we certainly cannot  afford to repeat it. So it has been a welcome contrast to see the Trump  administration make huge progress reinvigorating our fight against al- Qaida in Afghanistan and ISIS in Syria. Unshackling our military has  led to progress on the ground, greater pressure placed on the  terrorists, and new opportunities for diplomatic and political  solutions that have opened up as a result of the pressure that we have  applied.   So what we must remember is how hard won these gains have been. Our  response to this progress must not be to take our foot off the gas  pedal but rather to keep up those strategies that are clearly working.   Our partnership with Iraqi security forces and the Syrian Democratic  Forces have stripped ISIS of much territory in those two nations, but  we have not yet defeated ISIS. We have not yet defeated al-Qaida in  Afghanistan. Civil wars continue to rage in both Syria and Afghanistan.  There are still cauldrons--cauldrons--of sectarianism, extremism, and  terror.   President Trump is right that this cannot be America's fight alone.  The threats that ISIS and al-Qaida pose are global. That is why many  countries are with us in this fight. There is more that those partners  can and should do to keep up direct pressure on terrorists and on  outside actors who interfere with diplomatic efforts to resolve these  wars.   Putin's Russia and the ayatollahs in Tehran need to pay a real price  for their attempts to back butchers--butchers--like the Assad regime,  Hezbollah, and the Taliban.   We also need to understand that if we withdraw too soon--too soon--we  will  [[Page S756]]  create vacuums in Syria and Afghanistan. We know from experience that  Russia and Iran would be only too happy to fill those vacuums.   If we truly care about containing Russia, the battleground is not  only on Twitter or Facebook but also in the world of old fashioned  geopolitics.   So my amendment would offer Senators the ability to speak on all  these subjects. I honestly did not expect this would be controversial  stuff. I didn't expect that my colleagues across the aisle would make a  partisan stand and try to block this straightforward ``sense of the  Senate'' amendment when it really just restates--restates--what most of  us thought was a broad bipartisan consensus about American leadership  in the world, but that is what our Democratic colleagues did.   They tried to block it. Democrats objected to a vote on this  amendment, apparently because it would expose a rift among their own  membership--a division between those Senate Democrats who still  subscribe to the vision for America's leadership and their colleagues  who have abandoned those principles at the urging of the very far left  or are too afraid to take either position--either one. It is quite the  split. It shows how caught up my Democratic colleagues are in the  partisanship of this moment.   My amendment simply reemphasizes the expertise and counsel offered by  experts who have served Presidents of both parties. It is a mainstream  amendment with 19 cosponsors, but apparently a significant portion of  today's Democratic Party isn't sure--isn't sure--they believe in these  principles any more. They would rather try to squash the debate and  dodge the vote altogether.   Well, that is not going to work. These are exactly the kinds of  issues the Senate should be debating. The Senate has a special role in  foreign policy.   Americans are serving in harm's way in Syria and Afghanistan. The  American servicemembers, diplomats, and aid workers in those conflict  zones all deserve to know whether their elected officials support their  efforts or whether we no longer believe their tireless efforts serve  our national interest.   Our constituents deserve to know which Senators welcome a thorough  debate over Syria and Afghanistan and which are simply trying to duck  the debate. Well, despite my Democratic colleagues' attempt, I can  assure the American people that they are going to learn precisely that.  I filed cloture on the amendment yesterday afternoon, and we will vote  on it. Regardless of whatever political contortions the far left may be  demanding from Senate Democrats, the American people are going to learn  exactly where their Senators stand. Our institution will not shrink  from this important duty.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on an entirely different matter, I  spoke for the first time, yesterday, on the subject that House  Democrats have crowned as their signature effort for this Congress-- H.R. 1, also known as the ``Democratic Politician Protection Act.''  Speaker Pelosi and her colleagues are advertising it as a package of  urgent measures to save American democracy. What it really seems to be  is a package of urgent measures to rewrite the rules of American  politics for the exclusive benefit of the Democratic Party.   Yesterday, I gave a brief tour through several of the most bizarre  components of their proposal. Today, I would like to focus on just one  of the legislation's major victims--the American taxpayer.   H.R. 1 would victimize every American taxpayer by pouring their money  into expensive new subsidies that don't even pass the laugh test. In  several new ways, it would put every taxpayer on the hook to line the  pockets of candidates, campaigns, and outside consultants.   Do you look forward to bumper stickers, robocalls, attack ads, and  campaign mail that descend on the country in seemingly endless cycles?   Speaker Pelosi must think you do, because she wants you to pay for  these things with your tax dollars. You get the opportunity, with your  money, to pay for attack ads and bumper stickers and the rest. This  bill creates brand-new government subsidies--government subsidies--both  for political campaign donors and for the campaigns themselves.   The Federal Government would start matching political donations the  same way some employers match gifts to charity. You would be literally  funding attack ads for the candidates you disagree with. How about  that--your money funding ads for the candidates you disagree with?   Maybe that is why every Democrat opposed our tax cuts for middle- class families and small businesses. They were counting on that money  to pull off this stimulus package, if you will, for campaign  consultants.   And for what reason? To increase the competition? Well, studies have  shown that incumbents win just as often in taxpayer-funded elections as  they do when campaigns are funded with private money.   To reduce corruption? Hardly. Jurisdictions that have toyed with  taxpayer-funded political systems have turned out to be replete with  misappropriation, personal use, straw donors, and public corruption  scandals.   So I remain curious why, exactly, the ``Democratic Politician  Protection Act'' wants to offer the American people's money to  thousands of candidates that run for the House of Representatives every  2 years, whether they support these candidates or not. They want  citizens to bankroll political materials that they totally disagree  with.   But they aren't stopping there. Democrats also want taxpayers on the  hook for generous new benefits for Federal bureaucrats and government  employees.   Their bill would make election day a new paid holiday for government  workers and create an additional brandnew paid leave benefit for up to  6 days for any Federal bureaucrat who decides they would like to hang  out at the polls during any election. Just what America needs--another  paid holiday and a bunch of government workers being paid to go out and  work, I assume, for our colleagues on the other side on their  campaigns.   This is the Democrats' plan to ``restore'' democracy--a brandnew week  of paid vacation for every Federal employee who would like to hover  around while you cast your ballot? A Washington-based, taxpayer- subsidized clearinghouse for political campaign funding? It is a power  grab that is smelling more and more like exactly what it is.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, in Kentucky's oldest town sits a  beautiful and historic building on the top of a hill. Beaumont Inn,  with its name taken from the French for ``beautiful mount,'' is my  State's oldest Southern country inn. The Harrodsburg establishment is a  beacon of hospitality with a distinguished history, and I would like to  take a moment to mark the centennial anniversary of this treasured  Kentucky landmark.   When the main building of today's Beaumont Inn was constructed around  1845, no one could have perceived the incredible future in store, but  then again, the location had already had a notable history. An original  wooden structure on the site was believed to be the childhood home of  John Marshall Harlan, future Kentucky attorney general and Associate  Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.   For many years afterward, the site served as a series of schools for  women, including the Greenville Institute, the Daughters College, and  finally as Beaumont College until 1916. The next year, the grounds were  purchased by an alumna of the Daughters College, Annie Bell Goddard,  and her husband Glave. In 1919, the Goddards opened the new 31-room  Beaumont Inn, and the same family has proudly operated this wonderful  Kentucky establishment ever since.   Throughout the next century, Glave and Annie Bell's descendants have  welcomed countless guests to the inn, preserving this historic  building, its picturesque scenery, and the tradition of  [[Page S765]]  Southern hospitality. Beaumont Inn grew, both in physical size and in  prestige, even earning inclusion onto the National Register of Historic  Places. Some of the new buildings include the Greystone House, Bell  Cottage, and Goddard Hall, which honors Beaumont's founder. Not only is  the inn a charming destination, but it is also a museum filled with  interesting artifacts of Kentucky and American history. Today, the inn  is operated by the fourth and fifth generation of the Goddard family,  Chuck and Helen Dedman and their son, Dixon.   It is beyond question that quality cuisine is a vital aspect of all  Southern hospitality. As a pinnacle of a traditional Bluegrass  experience, Beaumont Inn sets a high bar. Visitors are drawn to its  main dining room by the famous ``yellow-legged'' fried chicken and 2- year-old Kentucky-cured country ham. The inn's cornmeal batter cakes  are a breakfast favorite. In recognition of its culinary excellence,  Beaumont Inn has earned some of the highest accolades in this field,  including the America's Class Award from the James Beard Foundation.  Visitors can also enjoy a Kentucky bourbon at the Owl's Nest lounge or  at the Old Owl Tavern, named one of the best bourbon bars in America.  As Kentucky leads the Nation in a bourbon revival, the inn has also  become an official stop of the Kentucky Bourbon Trail. These amenities  reaffirm the strong bonds between this historic institution and one of  the Commonwealth's signature industries. In fact, the New York Times  published an article about the storied history of Kentucky Owl Bourbon,  recently revived by the Dedman family.   I look forward to my next visit to Beaumont Inn, and I would like to  thank the Dedman family for their tireless efforts to preserve this  Kentucky treasure. Their stewardship of this historic site and long- term vision helps connect our Commonwealth's past to its bright future.  As Beaumont Inn celebrates 100 years of excellence, I would like to  extend my best wishes to the Dedmans, the staff, and all who enjoy this  beloved institution.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. Thursday,  January 31; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; further, that following leader  remarks, the Senate resume consideration of S. 1, and that  notwithstanding rule XXII, the Senate vote on the motion to invoke  cloture on the McConnell amendment No. 65 at 3:30 p.m. and that the  mandatory quorum call be waived.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask that it stand adjourned under the previous  order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 3:16 p.m., adjourned until  Thursday, January 31, 2019, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
