 Mr. Speaker, having just honored many fallen veterans at  ceremonies across the 17th Congressional District for Memorial Day last  week, I rise today to recognize the life of a truly exceptional man,  Colonel Edmund ``Beau'' Mason Riely.   Beau was a man whose dedication to service, family, and faith has  left a legacy that will endure far beyond his years.   Born in Fort Bragg and raised in Croton-on-Hudson, New York, Beau was  a beacon of strength and leadership from his youth, whether on the  football field or in the ROTC program at Georgetown University.   As a distinguished officer in the 82nd Airborne Division, a graduate  from the U.S. Army Ranger School, a battalion commander at Fort  Benning, and a faculty member at the National War College, Beau  exemplified the very best of our Nation's values.   Beau had a propensity for praising others and was reticent to accept  credit for his accolades. In Beau's eyes, there was always something  greater than himself: his faith, his family, and his commitment to  service.   A loving father, he spent much of his time with his beloved wife,  Renie, his cherished children, coaching their sports teams, helping  with Scouts, and teaching Sunday school.   He was a husband, a father, a beloved son of Ed and Patricia, and a  brother whose love radiated to those around him, leaving a profound  impact.   Beau will be missed by all, those whose lives he touched and by a  grateful Nation that he served.                            ____________________
