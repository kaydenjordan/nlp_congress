 Mr. Speaker, the two amendments that I have in the en bloc  concern horses.   One concerns wild horses and a more humane way to deal with the wild  horse population. Right now, the Bureau of Land Management uses  helicopters, rounds them up, and puts them in pens for the rest of  their lives. This would be a more humane practice and cost only 10  percent of their budget, and it would certainly be something the  Rolling Stones would be for, ``Wild Horses.''   The other is one that would give money for an audit on the soring  practices of Tennessee walkers, an inhumane practice that has gone on  for a long time. We need to be considerate of our four-legged friends,  and this would support the walking horses.   Mr. Speaker, I am thankful to see these included in the en bloc, and  I am pleased to see this progress.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Lowey for yielding. I  appreciate the opportunity to speak.   In this en bloc amendment, there are four amendments that I offered.  I have offered them for 4 years. They have been accepted, now, for 2  years. They are emoluments amendments. They will say we can't spend  money at businesses that the President owns.   Well, we shouldn't. No President should be in the business of getting  money from the government, and it wasn't until Donald Trump became  President that this became a problem.   He does it at his hotels. He does it at his golf clubs. He has done  it having airplanes stop at different airports than they normally do  for refueling so they will end up having to spend the night at his golf  club in Scotland. And recently, it came up that he asked his Ambassador  to England to get one of his golf clubs in Scotland the opportunity to  host the British Open and make a ton of money.   The Presidency should be about serving the country and serving the  people and supporting democracy, not about supporting yourself and  putting money in your pocket.
