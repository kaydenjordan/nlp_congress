 Mr. Speaker, as dean of the Georgia  delegation, I regret to inform the House that our former colleague, the  Honorable James Roy Rowland, Jr., passed away. He was a beloved  husband, father, and friend. I had the honor of working with him and  serving with him in the Georgia State legislature as well as here in  this House of Representatives.   He was courageous in his convictions and a steadfast advocate for  better healthcare for all Americans, especially our military veterans.   He served in the House from 1983 through 1995. During that time, he  was a member of several committees including the Veterans' Affairs,  Armed Services, Public Works and Transportation, and Government  Operations, as well as the Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and  Control and the Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families.   We were both Distinguished Eagle Scouts, and I had the pleasure of  presenting him with that award in 2014. In attendance were many current  and former congressional colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans. It  was a testament to the warmth and care he embodied as well as his  bipartisanship.   I noted at the time that the trail that Eagle Scouts walk never ends.  Such was the life of J. Roy Rowland who became an Eagle Scout in 1942.  He went on to serve the U.S. Army and was a veteran of World War II. He  was a physician, an author, a philanthropist, and a public servant who  made our community and our world a better place to live in so many  ways.   He led a distinguished and honorable life, and he will be greatly  missed. Our  [[Page H4562]]  thoughts and prayers go out to his wife, Luella, his children, and his  entire family.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that this House observe a moment of silence in  remembrance of the late Honorable James Roy Rowland, Jr.                            ____________________
