 Mr. Speaker, as a practicing physician in the Louisiana  and Mississippi delta, I have some of the best patients, but some of  the poorest. They can't afford to see me because they can't afford  ObamaCare, increased costs, skyrocketing premiums, high deductibles. I  can't cure a disease if I can't see the patient. The cost is just too  high for ObamaCare.   We have heard about Medicaid expansion here today. That is a second- class insurance for first-class people. I can't get my patients to see  a specialist. They have to go to the hospital. They have to go to the  emergency room. Prices go through the roof.   I have heard my colleagues on the other side of the aisle reference  the Hippocratic Oath. With all due respect, I don't think they would  know what the Hippocratic Oath says if their life depended on it. Guess  what? It does. Google it.   Let me educate you. Let me educate our colleagues. It says I will  always seek a path to a cure for all diseases. ObamaCare will not let  me do that.   We have got to do better. We cannot cram people into a healthcare  system that has failed just so politicians can thump their chest and  have some type of mysterious victory that is hollow and very, very  small.   We need to pass this American Health Care Act. ObamaCare has failed.  It is a sham of an insurance. Americans deserve better. We deserve  better as Americans. My patients deserve better.
