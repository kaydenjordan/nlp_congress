 Mr. Speaker, this is a tough one today.  I rise to remember Sheriff Wes Barr, who passed away on October 1. Wes  was a beloved member of the Springfield community, who impacted many  through his law enforcement career and charity work.   Wes' story is one of true American spirit. He lived in the former  John Jay housing project in Springfield until he was 13. After  graduating from Southeast High School, Wes enlisted in the United  States Marine Corps.   Afterwards, he served as a correctional officer before he began his  career in law enforcement. He served as an officer in Loami,  Illiopolis, and Chatham before joining the Sangamon County Sheriff's  Office in 1991, eventually serving his one term, where I got to serve  with him, as sheriff from 2014 to 2018.   Wes and his wife, Sherry, are well known for their generous hearts  and extensive charity work with several organizations. For years, and  where I first met Wes, Wes led the local Toys for Tots drive,  collecting thousands of toys for children in need.   In every aspect of his life, Wes put others before himself. He lived  to serve others and, for so many, he was a role model and a mentor. Wes  had a compassion for people and a determination to give back to his  community. Words cannot describe how much he will be missed.   The thoughts and prayers of Shannon and me are with the entire  central Illinois community and especially his wife, Sherry, during this  difficult time.                            ____________________
