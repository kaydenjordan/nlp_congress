 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Bishop).           Paying Tribute to Two Oakland County Sheriff's Deputies     Mr. Speaker, 39 years ago, a collective nightmare was  foisted  [[Page H67]]  upon the people of the nation of Iran, and so when roughly 2 weeks ago,  while on recess, I became aware of the courage manifest in the action  of the Iranian people in standing up to a brutal totalitarian regime, I  immediately contacted our office and suggested that we secure this  Special Order hour, and reached out to a number of my colleagues,  several of whom join me today, to speak loudly and clearly on behalf of  the United States and the nearly 6 million people represented by myself  and the individuals who will speak here today in support of those who  would stand up and risk their very existence for those most basic human  rights, which we as Americans take, tragically, for granted.   As I stand in this well, Mr. Speaker, in cities that the bulk of  Americans have never heard of, in Isfahan and Karaj and Tabriz and  Mashhad and Tehran, indeed, tens of thousands stand in the face of a  regime with a record of destroying not only freedom but life itself in  the instance of those who would stand up and demand freedom, stand up  and demand basic human rights and dignity.   Mr. Speaker, to put this into perspective, if you were to take the  population of the nation of Iran circa 1979 and compare it to the  population of the United States circa 1941 and then align the numbers  of Americans killed in combat during the entire Second World War, it  would proportionally be roughly equal to the number of people who have  given their lives at the hands of the brutal Iranian regime inside the  borders of Iran. Think about that for a moment. Roughly 60,000 during  the coup d'etat revolution in 1979, about 12,500 from 1981 to 1984,  almost 33,000 during the 1988 uprising. We don't know how many were  murdered in 2009, when this Nation stood silent as Iranians, brave,  took to the streets to demand self-determination and toleration; that a  regime should not be able to dictate how one worships, who one marries,  what one believes; that people should be given basic rights to self- determination.    Today, we know very little about what is going on in Iran except for  the brave women and men who are confronting challenges that we, by  virtue of the fortune of our birth as Americans, will hopefully never  have to confront. We know that roughly 50 have been murdered; we know  that roughly 3,000 are imprisoned.   This time, I will not be silent. I have spoken with Iranian Americans  of all different facets from a number of different groups. I ask these  Iranian Americans, as well as those resisting within Iran and Iranians  disbursed across the globe, to set aside their political differences  and join together for the common goal of deposing a regime that murders  its own sons and daughters to a tune that is comparable to the total  number of American combat deaths during the Second World War. Enough is  enough.   Today, I stand beside an image of Habib Khabiri. Habib was the former  captain of the Iranian national soccer team. He and 40 others were  executed in 1984 at the Evin Prison for having the temerity to  criticize their government. He was 29 years old. The evidence indicates  that he was tortured before he was executed.   In fact, again, as we stated earlier, over 12,000 people were  executed by the Islamic Republic Security Forces just from 1981 to  1984.   Next is a young woman who tragically became something of an  international folk hero for those who were paying attention, in that  she had the temerity to stand and protest during the Green Revolution  in 2009, suggesting that the Iranian people had a right to self- determination, when she was publicly, on film, murdered in the streets,  26 years old. The United States remained silent. The second of three  children from a middle class neighborhood, she had the courage to stand  up and point out injustice when she saw it, and paid with her life.  Indeed, the protesters with whom she marched shouted, ``America, you  are either with us or with the mullahs,'' and we did not respond.   Today, I am responding. This administration is responding.   The Iranians, with whom I have spoken across a diverse sect of  opposition, do not want tanks and bombers and missiles, nor do I,  having worn the uniform of this Nation, but while we can't rule out any  particular alternatives, all they ask is a word of support; that when  we act legislatively in this body and in the Chamber down the hallway,  we have the follow-through to ensure that our actions are backed up;  that unlike the 1990s, when the Iran Sanctions Act was passed, we don't  let our so-called European allies turn a blind eye as their corporate  entities continue to do business with the IRGC that uses the money  generated through this business not only to murder their own citizens  but to fund the likes of Hezbollah, and fast forward to current day,  create instability, peril, death, and destruction literally across the  entire region from the Mediterranean to the Khyber Pass.   There is no blind eye being turned this time.   Next we see Shekar Mohammadzadeh. A nurse, she was arrested,  imprisoned, and tortured for rendering medical assistance to other  Iranian brothers and sisters who were brutalized by the revolutionary  guards in the streets of Iran. She was tortured viciously at Evin  Prison, served a significant portion of a prison sentence, 7 of 15  years, before being executed along with nearly 33,000 others circa  1988.   Now, three names, three faces, three stories, probably 30 seconds to  a minute on each. Let me put this into perspective, Mr. Speaker. If we  were to take 5 minutes to show the pictures and speak briefly on every  individual murdered by the mullah regime in Iran, we would be here for  over a year going 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.   I don't stand here saber rattling, suggesting American military  action. I stand here suggesting that what my Iranian-American friends  and what people of Iranian dissent who are dissidents throughout the  world have suggested to me is that if the American Government will  stand up and say, ``We stand with you against these mullahs,'' that is  the support that they need to continue the movement to see that there  is a regime change, which leads to self-determination and democracy in  Iran and the lifting of a dark cloud of terror from across the globe.   Don't believe me? I was born in 1972, and I have grown up with the  perpetual mention of Hezbollah. There are those who think that  Hezbollah is something that has been around for a long time, but I  point out today that Hezbollah is actually younger than the mullah  regime; that, in fact, the mullah regime created Hezbollah; and  Hezbollah has the unique distinction of being one of a very few  terrorist entities that has actually killed human beings on every  single inhabited continent on planet Earth.   No trade with Iran, no money to the IRGC; no money to the IRGC, no  money to Hezbollah; no money to Hezbollah, we have self-determination  in Lebanon, we have less of an oppressive interference in Iraq, we have  more stability in Syria, and we have freedom in Iran. Enough is enough.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for standing with me today, and I  ask the American people and my colleagues to take the time to inform  themselves about places like Isfahan and Karaj and Tabriz and Mashhad,  and to think about the women and men who have the courage to walk  through the threshold of a door of a home where, when they leave, they  know full well they may very well not come back.   The time is now, the cause is just, the mullah regime must go. Enough  is enough.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Curtis).                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Yoho).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Rothfus).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Budd).    Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from North Carolina  (Mr. Budd) for his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Duncan).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Duncan) for his remarks.   Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Gohmert).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Gohmert), who is my good friend, for speaking.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Rohrabacher).    Mr. Speaker, I will conclude. If we were to spend 5  minutes on each of the individuals murdered by the Iranian regime since  that regime took power some 39 years ago, we would be here 24/7 for  over a year. If we were to name each country and spend 1 day where Iran  and their proxies, such as Hezbollah, have taken human life, we would  literally be here for months, 1 day per country.   Mr. Yoho articulated basic concepts of natural law, that people are  endowed by their Creator with fundamental rights to include the right  to life, the right to freedom, and the right to pursue happiness.   Mr. Duncan, Mr. Rothfus, and Mr. Rohrabacher spoke to the JCPOA, and  the circumstances surrounding it, how our Nation turned its back on the  multibillion-dollar criminal enterprise wholly subsidized by Iran that  is Hezbollah, making a bad deal, ignoring trafficking of deadly  narcotics throughout the world and, indeed, in our own country to get a  worse deal.   I stand with my colleagues who renounce the JCPOA, and I would point  out that it is my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, the broad  bipartisan opposition to the JCPOA, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of  Action, which I have referred to repeatedly, and only somewhat  jokingly, as the ``Joint Comprehensive Piece of Something, JCPOS.''   But if you want to see the JCPOA go away, the best way to do that is  to empower the people of Iran to empower themselves, and that is why I  thank my colleagues, one and all, for standing with me here today to  speak loudly and clearly. Mr. Speaker, it is my hope that people  watching at home will take to social media where the youth of Iran have  fomented this revolution, that hashtags such as #freeiran,  #iranprotests and #iran will pick up steam, that the world can  communicate with those who risk their very lives to assert their basic,  fundamental, and Creator-granted rights of  [[Page H72]]  life, liberty, and the right to pursue happiness by showing them that  we support them.   Mr. Speaker, I would point out that Mr. Gohmert so articulately spoke  to the role of Rouhani in Iran and the fawning Western media that  speaks to his role as a moderate. Mr. Speaker, Mr. Rouhani, quite  literally, represents the mullahs, and so, as such, that would be as if  suggesting that Mr. Goering or Mr. Goebbels was a moderate Nazi. There  is nothing moderate about the leadership of this regime.   So with this, I conclude: Americans have been killed by Iran or its  proxies in this country, in Lebanon, in Iraq, in Kenya, and in  Tanzania. People have given their lives at the hands of Iran in  Australia, Argentina, Syria, Israel, Germany, the United Kingdom, in  Tanzania, Malaysia, Afghanistan, Yemen, and Saudi Arabia. It is time  for this to end. Enough is enough.   I would quote Edmund Burke: ``All that is necessary for evil to  triumph is for good men to do nothing.''   This time we will not stand idly by. Enough is enough.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
