 Mr. Speaker, my thoughts and prayers also go to  the victims of the Las Vegas shooting.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to address another subject that, unfortunately,  came up last week.   Mr. Speaker, as one of ten naturalized United States citizens in  Congress, I rise today to express strong objections to the Department  of Homeland Security's new policy to collect the social media account  information of naturalized citizens.   In accordance with this new rule, the DHS will include social media  alongside basic information, such as biometrics, Social Security  numbers, and contact information in naturalization records. This is  unprecedented.   There is no evidence that tracking social media accounts of  naturalized citizens will in any way make the United States more  secure.   Rather than target naturalized citizens, the President should work  with Congress to reform our immigration system and ensure that all  Americans, natural born or naturalized, are able to work, study, and  pursue the American Dream.                            ____________________
