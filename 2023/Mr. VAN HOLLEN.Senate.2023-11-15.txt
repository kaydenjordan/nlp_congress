 Mr. President, November 19, 2023, marks the World Day  of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims, WDoR, commemorating the  millions of people killed and injured by the devastating cost of car  crashes. On this day, communities across the Nation and globe gather to  call for action against the roadway safety crisis, recognizing that  these are not isolated incidents but rather widespread problems with  known solutions. This day also serves as a powerful reminder of the  critical work of emergency responders in saving lives and as a moment  to stand in solidarity to recognize how road traffic deaths and  injuries deeply impact our community. Now is the time to take decisive  action. By investing in proven, tangible measures and enacting  legislation, we can prevent further loss of life. Our Nation must  invest in advanced technology and the redesign of our roadways to spare  more families the tragedy of losing a loved one.   Like other issues that are uniquely American, the U.S. failure to  protect all road users, especially pedestrians and cyclists, makes us  stand out among developed nations. According to the World Health  Organization, the United States ranks 47th out of 54 in traffic  fatality rate among high-income nations. In 2021, there were 42,915  deaths due to roadway crashes in the U.S., the highest figure since  2005. This highlights the lack of progress that has been made in  addressing these preventable losses.   As we solemnly observe this day, we are reminded of the profound  message behind this year's poignant theme: Safe Streets for All. Since  its inception in 1995 and its subsequent adoption by the United Nations  for global observance on November 15, 2005, the WDoR has become a  catalyst for change across continents. It is a day that compels us to  reflect on the heartbreaking losses experienced by families worldwide  due to unsafe road conditions.   Our call to action is clear and urgent: We must not only remember but  also advocate for immediate change. This means demanding from our  leaders a steadfast commitment to invest in and reimagine our  infrastructure. By fostering the creation of safer vehicles,  redesigning our roadways, and ensuring walkable and bike-friendly  communities, especially for those communities that have been  persistently marginalized, we can transform our streets into corridors  of safety rather than peril.   In honoring the lives tragically cut short by traffic accidents, we  confront the profound loss of family members, partners, and cherished  friends, alongside the burdens of caring for those left with permanent  disabilities. Yet it is in our collective commitment to act that we  find the truest form of remembrance, ensuring such tragedies become  rare exceptions. Rejecting complacency, we honor the victims by  embracing our shared duty to prevent further needless interruptions of  life stories on our roads. As a community, both local and global, we  are called to forge a path toward safer streets, decisively acting to  protect every life and using the memories of those we have lost as a  catalyst for real and enduring change.                            ____________________
