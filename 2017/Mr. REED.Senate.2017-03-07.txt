 Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Cybersecurity  Disclosure Act of 2017 along with two members of the Select Committee  on Intelligence, Senator Collins, and the ranking member, Senator  Warner. In response to data breaches of various companies that exposed  the personal information of millions of customers, our legislation asks  each publicly traded company to include--in Securities and Exchange  Commission, SEC, disclosures to investors--information on whether any  member of the board of directors is a cybersecurity expert, and if why  having this expertise on the board of directors is not necessary  because of other cyber security steps taken by the publicly traded  company. To be clear, the legislation does not require companies to  take any actions other than to provide this disclosure to its  investors.   Many investors may be surprised to learn that board directors who  participated in the National Association of Corporate Directors, NACD,  roundtable discussions on cyber security late in 2013 admitted that  ``the lack of adequate knowledge of information technology risk has  made it challenging for them to `effectively oversee management's  cybersecurity activities.' '' More recently, in Deloitte's 10th Global  Risk Management Survey of Financial Services Institutions, published  this month, 42 percent of respondents considered their institution to  be less effective in managing cybersecurity. And according to the 2016- 2017 NACD Public Company Governance Survey, ``fifty-nine percent of  respondents reported that they find it challenging to oversee cyber  risk, and only 19 percent of respondents said that their boards possess  a high level of knowledge about cybersecurity.'' Indeed, Yahoo in its  most recent annual report, which was filed with the SEC last week,  disclosed that ``the Independent Committee found that failures in  communication, management, inquiry and internal reporting contributed  to the lack of proper comprehension and handling of the 2014 Security  Incident. The Independent Committee also found that the Audit and  Finance Committee and the full board were not adequately informed of  the full severity, risks, and potential impacts of the 2014 Security  Incident and related matters.'' The 2014 Security Incident here refers  to the fact that ``a copy of certain user account information for  approximately 500 million user accounts was stolen from Yahoo's network  in late 2014.'' This is particularly troubling given that data breaches  are on the rise. Indeed, 2016 was a recordbreaking year for data  breaches, which increased 40 percent from the prior year to 1,093  breaches according to the Identity Theft Resource Center.   Investors and customers deserve a clear understanding of whether  publicly traded companies are prioritizing cyber security and have the  capacity to protect investors and customers from cyber-related attacks.  Our legislation aims to provide a better understanding of these issues  through improved SEC disclosure.   While this legislation is a matter for consideration by the Banking  Committee, of which I am a member, this bill is also informed by my  service on the Armed Services Committee and the Select Committee on  Intelligence. It is through this Banking-Armed Services-Intelligence  perspective that I see that our economic security is indeed a matter of  our national security, and this is particularly the case as our economy  becomes increasingly reliant on technology and the Internet.   For example, when he was Director of National Intelligence, James  Clapper, appeared before the Armed Services Committee in 2015 and  testified that ``cyber threats to the U.S. national and economic  security are increasing in frequency, scale, sophistication and  severity of impact.'' He further said that ``[b]ecause of our heavy  dependence on the Internet, nearly all information communication  technologies and I.T. networks and systems will be perpetually at  risk.''   Indeed, retired Army GEN Keith Alexander, who is the former commander  of the United States Cyber Command and former Director of the National  Security Agency, appeared before the Armed Services Committee this  month and stated that ``while the primary responsibility of government  is to defend the nation, the private sector also shares responsibility  in creating the partnership necessary to make the defense of our nation  possible. Neither the government nor the private sector can capably  protect their systems and networks without extensive and close  cooperation.''   With mounting cyber threats and concerns over the capabilities of  corporate directors, we all need to be more proactive in ensuring our  Nation's cyber security before there are additional serious breaches.  This legislation seeks to take one step toward that  [[Page S1642]]  goal by encouraging publicly traded companies to be more transparent to  their investors and customers on whether and how their boards of  directors are prioritizing cyber security.   I thank Harvard Law School professor John Coates, MIT professor Simon  Johnson, Columbia Law School professor John Coffee, and the Consumer  Federation of America for their support, and I urge my colleagues to  join Senator Collins, Senator Warner, and me in supporting this  legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Franken, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr.          Durbin, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Markey, Ms. Warren, Mrs. Murray,          Ms. Baldwin, Ms. Heitkamp, Ms. Hirono, Mr. Brown, Mr. Booker,          and Mrs. Shaheen):   S. 550.
