 Mr. President, the people spoke loudly last fall. For too  long, the Obama administration ignored the common sense of those who  managed the lands and our natural resources. Now is the time for that  power to be put back into the hands of the folks who know it best; that  is, the people of Montana, not Washington, DC. And the Bureau of Land  Management's Planning 2.0 rule is no different.   The resolution we are debating today, H.J. Res. 44, would block the  implementation of a rule that would fundamentally change the land  planning process at the BLM. It would be for the worst.   During the Obama administration's final days in office, they put  through many midnight rules costing a total of $157 billion, including  this rule shift which was issued on December 12, 2016, which  fundamentally changes the land planning process. The rule shifts the  planning and decisionmaking away from those who know the land best,  away from BLM regional field offices, and back to BLM Headquarters in  Washington, DC. That is the exact opposite direction that land  management should be going, and that is why this rule must go also.   This rule limits the voice of our local and State governments, and it  strengthens the voice of folks who are living far away from the lands  that are impacted.   Montana farmers, Montana ranchers, Montana miners, the Montana  electric co-ops, Montana conservation districts, and Montana county  commissioners have all expressed a concern for this rule and have urged  congressional action. And there can't be a more commonsense list of  Montanans than that list I just mentioned. In fact, even the western  Governors are concerned. As recently as February 10, 2017, our own  Governor of Montana, Steve Bullock, and Governor Daugaard from South  Dakota urged Congress to direct BLM to reexamine the rule. ``Governors  are concerned that BLM's emphasis on landscape-scale planning may lead  to a resulting emphasis on national objectives over state and local  objectives.'' ``Collectively, these changes severely limit the  deference Governors were previously afforded with respect to RMP  development.'' That is what our Governors are saying. I am quoting our  Governors from the West.   There needs to be more balance in Federal land management. For the  last 8 years, we have been out of balance. Oil and natural gas  development on Federal lands dropped significantly under President  Obama. In fact, for natural gas, we have seen an 18-percent decrease,  while oil production on private and State lands doubled, versus the  same on Federal land.   Montana has nearly 2 million acres of public land that are  inaccessible to the public. Our farmers and ranchers in Montana need a  more balanced partnership with the Federal land managers. They deserve  more input in the development of land management policies, not less. By  the way, our Federal forests in Montana are in dire need of more active  management.   So where do we go next? There is no disagreement that revisions need  to be made. Let's take this rule back to the drawing board and do it  right. Let's work with our new Secretary of the Department of the  Interior, Ryan Zinke, a Montanan, and President Trump to restore more  western commonsense to land management.   I urge my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 44.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  recess until 2:15 p.m. and that the time during the recess be charged  equally to both sides on the joint resolution.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 12:35 p.m., recessed until  2:15 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer  (Mr. Flake).                            ____________________
