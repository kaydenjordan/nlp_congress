 Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment. The  most important thing we can do right now is to get the vaccines  distributed. One of the problems we have is that about 40 percent of  Americans are still saying they are uncomfortable getting the vaccine.  Part of that is because we haven't been able to get a proper public  awareness campaign out there--not with politicians but with folks with  white coats and people who are respected and trusted on this issue--to  say it is necessary for us because these are safe and effective, and by  getting these vaccines in place, we can turn things around.   I support the amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 716     Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 816 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Colleagues, this amendment shouldn't even be necessary,  but it is.   We are being asked to spend another $1.9 trillion to deal with the  coronavirus pandemic, and yet we have no idea how much of the $900  billion that we just enacted 5\1/2\ weeks ago has gone out the door. We  don't know. We don't know how it has been used.   For that matter, we don't know how much of the roughly $2 trillion of  additional coronavirus funding has gone out the door. So we need to  have that information to be able to legislate responsibly, to be sure  that we are doing the right thing here to help the folks whom we  represent.   I am going to ask for a voice vote on this. I hope we get it, but I  would also like to yield to my colleague from West Virginia, Mr.  Manchin.
