 Madam Speaker, today, I rise in support of H.R. 2326,  the Navy SEAL Chief Petty Officer William ``Bill'' Mulder (Ret.)  Transition Improvement Act.   First, I thank my colleagues, Congressmen Levin and Bilirakis, for  all their hard work on this bipartisan bill and for their leadership on  the Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity.   I am honored to have helped introduce this important legislation,  which will improve the military's Transition Assistance Program and  help to ensure that our men and women in uniform can successfully  transition to life in the civilian world at the end of their service.   H.R. 2326 will streamline the transition process and allow the VA to  partner with third-party organizations that teach veterans critical  job-seeking skills. By creating a pilot program for transition training  off-base, this bill will also make that stressful transition process  more convenient and accessible for servicemembers and their families.   Finally, this legislation will allow policymakers to more effectively  adjust the program to the needs of our veterans by directing an  independent assessment of its effectiveness and by expanding the VA's  access to Federal employment data.   The bottom line is, we have a responsibility to our servicemembers to  make sure that they are equipped with the tools to succeed both on the  battlefield and when they return.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  join me in supporting this legislation and ensuring every veteran has  access to the support that they have earned.
