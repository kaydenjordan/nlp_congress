 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   Under the previous order, all remaining time for debate on H.J. Res.  83 has been yielded back.   The joint resolution was ordered to a third reading and was read the  third time.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution having been read the  third time, the question is, Shall the joint resolution pass?    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The assistant bill clerk called the roll.
