 Mr. Speaker, 2 days ago, President Trump and Vice  President Pence delivered solemn speeches about the attacks on 9/11,  talking about how much they care about the victims of al-Qaida's attack  on our country, but they are now standing up to protect the 20,000 to  40,000 al-Qaida and other jihadist forces in Syria, threatening Russia,  Syria, and Iran with military force if they dare attack these  terrorists.   This is a betrayal of the American people, especially the victims of  al-Qaida's attack on 9/11 and their families, first responders, and to  my brothers and sisters in uniform who have been killed or wounded in  action and their families.   For the President, who is Commander in Chief, to act as the  protective big brother of al-Qaida and other jihadists must be  condemned by every Member of Congress.                            ____________________
