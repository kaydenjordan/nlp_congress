 Mr. President, the end of every Congress brings with it  the reality that fellow colleagues in the Senate will no longer serve  with us when the new Congress convenes in January. As we rush to  complete the work of this Congress and in our eagerness to return home  to spend time with our families for the holidays, it is important that  we pause to thank departing Members for their years of public service  to their constituents and to the country. On December 15, I spoke on  the floor to commend the Senate service of my fellow Pennsylvanian,  Senator Pat Toomey.   Senator Pat Leahy of Vermont has served nearly 48 years in the  Senate, and his list of accomplishments is as long as his tenure. I  first got to know Senator Leahy when I was a new Senator and a junior  member of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Foresty, a  committee that Senator Leahy once chaired. I was able to work with him  and learn from him about all issues related to the dairy farming, which  is of particular importance to both Vermont and my home State of  Pennsylvania. Senator Leahy is also known, among other things, for his  fierce commitment to human rights around the world, his long-time work  advancing the cause of justice on the Judiciary Committee, his  outstanding work on the Appropriations Committee, his fierce defense of  the Senate as an institution, and, most of all, as the greatest  advocate for the people of Vermont that the State has ever known. He  has also found time for his personal passion of photography and to  appear in five Batman movies. The Senate as an institution and I  personally will miss serving with Pat. My  [[Page S9624]]  wife Terese and I have been blessed by our friendship with Pat and his  wife Marcelle.   The end of this Congress also marks the end of Senator Richard Burr's  time in the Senate. I have worked with Senator Burr on the Committee on  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, on which we both sit. We have  found common ground on a number of issues, most notably our shared  interest in bio-defense and pandemic preparedness, upon which we have  worked jointly for years. We led the effort in the Senate to pass the  ABLE bill in 2014, which allows people with disabilities and their  families to save for care and accommodations related to their  disabilities. We also worked to advance out of committee a bipartisan  pregnancy discrimination bill, which I still hope to get over the  finish line this week. We have also disagreed at times, for example,  when we both advocated for our respective States to receive critical  title I education funding. I also served with Senator Burr on the  Senate Select Committee on Intelligence where, as the senior Republican  on the committee, he helped to steer the committee through the  treacherous waters of the Russia report detailing Russia's efforts to  interfere in the 2016 election and to aid Donald Trump's candidacy.  Even when the elements of his own party pressured him to do otherwise,  Senator Burr stood up for American democracy and put country before  party.   Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri is also retiring. In agreement or  disagreement, Senator Blunt has been an honest broker, one who worked  to try and find common ground and who was honest when he could not. In  the past year, he and I have worked successfully to sort through some  challenging issues related to pregnancy discrimination and the  Congressional Accountability Act. The details of the legislation here  are not as pertinent here as the manner in which he engaged in the  issue--respectfully, substantively, and productively. He and I have  also worked together on adoption issues for many years and together  lead a bill to make the Adoption Tax Credit refundable, which allows  many more low-income families to benefit. He has been an excellent  partner in that effort. I regret that we have not been able to enact  that bill into law prior to his retirement, but I will continue to seek  its passage in the coming Congress. Finally, Roy and I have worked for  years to build and repair bridges in smaller, rural areas of our  respective States by allocating additional funds to so-called off- system bridges.   I did not have the privilege of working with Senator Richard Shelby  of Alabama when he was a member of the Democratic Caucus in the 1980s,  before my time in the Senate. Regardless, Senator Shelby and I have  been neighbors on the third floor of the Russell Senate Office  Building, which means that we often find ourselves walking to vote on  the Senate floor at around the same time. Early in my career, I found  myself delivering to Senator Shelby's office a box of ice cream from  the legendary Creamery at Penn State, the result of lost bet between  Penn State and the top-ranked Alabama football team in 2010. Most  recently, Senator Shelby was critical to bringing back the ability of  Senators to advocate for community projects in their home State through  the appropriations process. As the senior Republican on the  Appropriations Committee, Senator Shelby has been unwavering in his  belief that Senators understand the critical needs of their communities  and should have the opportunity to advocate for them. Due to Senator  Shelby's efforts to bring back congressionally directed spending and my  advocacy for worthy projects throughout Pennsylvania, communities large  and small are addressing critical local needs, from early childhood to  infrastructure to healthcare, among others.   Senator Rob Portman of Ohio is also retiring from the Senate this  year. Ohio shares a border with Pennsylvania, and, not surprisingly, we  share many of the same concerns. For example, we both believe in the  critical importance of our manufacturing base to the American economy  and the need to support the workers upon whom our manufacturing might  is built. We have both been critical of China and its efforts to  undermine the American manufacturers and workers, especially in the  case of steel production. Senator Portman and I have partnered to  protect some of the last American manufacturers of electrical steel  from deliberate Chinese market distortion. I have also worked with  Senator Portman and his fellow Ohioan Senator Sherrod Brown on several  iterations of legislation called Leveling the Playing Field to help  manufacturers respond to unfair market competition from China and  Chinese enterprises operating under the protection of the Chinese  Government. I also want to note that Senator Portman and I have a  shared interest in children's mental health and teamed up recently on  S. 4757, the Investing in Kids' Mental Health Now Act, a bill to  increase the availability of mental health resources for children.   Finally, I wish to note the departure of Senator Jim Inhofe of  Oklahoma from the Senate. A member of the Senate since 1994, Senator  Inhofe is known first and foremost as a champion of our military and  the men and women who serve our nation. He has served on the Senate  Armed Services Committee capably for decades, most recently as the  senior Republican on the panel. This year, we honored Senator Inhofe by  naming the annual defense authorization bill after him. I am especially  grateful to Senator Inhofe and the Armed Services Committee for  including the Global Food Security Act in the FY23 Defense  authorization bill, which will strengthen our country's effort to  promote food security around the world and also fight extremism and  political unrest around the world. This good national security bill is  one of many ways in which Senator Inhofe's leadership on issues related  to the continent of Africa will continue far after his retirement, as  16 of the 20 countries targeted by the Global Food Security Act's  development program are in Africa. Senator Inhofe and I also share a  deep concern for the brave Afghans seeking freedom from the Taliban and  recently joined together to write to the Biden administration urging it  to do all that it could to assist with the evacuation of the students  and guardians of the Marefat School, the first coeducational school in  Afghanistan and a leading beacon of efforts to promote the education  and equity of girls in Afghanistan. Our efforts helped the successful  evacuation of hundreds of children and their families who were at risk  under the Taliban's brutal regime.   As each of these retiring members leave the Senate for the last time  and go home to their families for the holidays, I want to wish them my  heartfelt thanks for their years of service to the Senate and to the  country.                            ____________________
