 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs.  Kiggans), my friend.                           Honoring Law Enforcement  [[Page H2445]]         Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Virginia for her  support of police and for her service representing the people of her  State.   Mr. Speaker, the United States is close to defaulting on its debt.  That would be the first time in our Nation's history.   The situation we face today was fully avoidable. The Biden  administration's reckless spending and economic illiteracy over the  past 2 years have propelled our debt crisis and driven inflation to a  40-year high.   The American people have directly felt the impact of this  administration's negligence toward an effective and practical economic  policy.                                time  1130    It is well past time for our government to rein in reckless spending  and work together toward returning to a balanced budget, a concept that  both parties used to agree to strongly for decades.   Through the years, policy negotiations were a key part of many debt  ceiling agreements. Throughout our Nation's history, we have negotiated  spending deals and reforms many times by using the debt ceiling vote as  a constructive catalyst to action.   Yet, for over 100 days, despite promises to the contrary, President  Biden has refused to take this opportunity and willingly and  effectively negotiate with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.   Over the past 3 months, while the President has been unresponsive,  Speaker McCarthy has been hard at work, alongside House Republicans and  with support from our Republican colleagues in the Senate, to ensure  that we address this debt crisis in a timely, responsible manner.   We have done our part here in the House by passing the Limit, Save,  Grow Act, which responsibly raises the debt ceiling while addressing  the other key issues our Nation faces today.   Finally, in recent hours, with less than 2 weeks to go, President  Biden has surfaced and engaged in a conversation with Speaker McCarthy.  This is good news.   President Biden, join House Republicans in a sensible and responsible  agreement this week and avoid driving our Nation even further into  economic chaos.                 President Al-Assad Readmitted to Arab League     Mr. Speaker, recently Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was  invited back into the Arab League after 12 years of being in exile. I  can't tell you how incredibly frustrating and disappointing this is to  many, particularly the innocent people of Syria who have endured more  than a decade of war, murder, and torture.   Assad's readmittance to the Arab League sends the wrong signal. It  sends the signal to the rest of the world that his atrocious war crimes  against his own citizens over the past 12 years are acceptable.   A recent Reuters article had the headline ``Arabs Bring Syria's Assad  Back into Fold but Want Action on Drugs Trade.'' Well, that is rich,  because the only reason that there is an epidemic in the drug trade in  the Gulf and the region is because of Assad.   Assad turned to Russia and Iran to maintain his death machine, and  now the Captagon drug trade led by his cousins, led by his military, is  providing an independent source of funding for his regime while he  poisons his neighbors, takes their money and fuels terrorism in the  region; and yet he is invited back to the Arab League meeting. It is  preposterous.   My bill that passed in last year's National Defense Authorization Act  was called the CAPTAGON Act and requires the U.S. Government to develop  a multilateral and all-of-government approach to disrupting and  dismantling the production of the Captagon drug right in the heart of  Syria.   Recently the Treasury Department, along with our ally, the United  Kingdom, took steps to sanction key actors in Assad's inner circle who  are producing and trafficking Captagon. This is a good step, but it is  months late, Mr. Speaker.   It is in the right direction of disrupting and dismantling the  trafficking networks associated with this illicit drug, but it is just  a start, and it comes years after we know the deadly impact of Captagon  on the region, on families, but also the fueling of terror by Assad  through the billions of dollars transferred from that illicit  trafficking.   It is critical that governments across the globe continue to show  their support for the Syrian people by denouncing those who seek to  normalize relations with this repulsive regime. Granting Assad  admittance to the Arab League once again sends the opposite message. It  rewards barbaric behavior.   The United States Government has an obligation to sanction Assad in  our efforts to dismantle the Captagon drug trade and hold Assad  accountable for his war crimes. That is why I am pleased this week to  cosponsor the Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia Subcommittee  Chairman   Joe Wilson's new bill, H.R. 3202, the Assad Regime Anti- Normalization Act.   This bill was passed this week unanimously in the House Foreign  Affairs Committee. Congress will act where this administration has  continuously failed to consistently do so. I look forward to supporting  this bill on the House floor and seeing it signed into law.    Commemorating 70-Year Alliance Between United States and Republic of                                   Korea     Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 70th anniversary of  the alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea.   To commend this momentous occasion, Speaker McCarthy and Leader  McConnell invited Republic of Korea President Yoon to visit the House  Chamber and address Congress in a joint meeting.   From the ashes of the Korean conflict to now one of the world's  largest and most successful economies, the Republic of Korea is a  testament to America's dedication to support market economics and  democracy.   The successful alliance between the U.S. and the Republic of Korea  has maintained peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific  region for those past seven decades.   Now more than ever, it is critical that the U.S. continue to support  our ally in their efforts to protect their vibrant democracy and  prosperous economy from the daily threats from North Korea and the  growing aggression from the Chinese Communist Party.  [[Page H2446]]    I thank President Yoon for his leadership, for the tenacity of the  Korean people to come from an authoritarian republic to truly a  democratic one and for building one of the top 10 largest economies in  the world. That is an amazing transformation over those seven decades.   Together, we will continue to promote freedom and prosperity in the  Indo-Pacific region and around the world.                       Arkansas Tornado Relief Efforts     Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the efforts of central  Arkansas during the recovery period after a devastating tornado hit our  district last month.   Our neighbors immediately began to work hand in hand, neighbor to  neighbor to rebuild our community. Many volunteered and worked  tirelessly to set up emergency shelters in our local schools and  churches to ensure those impacted by this severe storm had safe housing  in the wake of the tornado.   The response of our leaders at the State, county, and city level was  invaluable and to be commended. The incredible efforts and active  emergency response from Governor Sarah Sanders, Pulaski County Judge  Barry Hyde, Little Rock Mayor Frank Scott, Jr., Mayor Terry Hartwick of  North Little Rock, Mayor Jeff Elmore of Jacksonville, and Mayor Mary Jo  Heye-Townsell of Sherwood, and many, many others all saved lives and  accelerated the recovery process.   Not only did we witness their outstanding response and an outpouring  of local volunteers, but we saw the swift action of our first  responders and essential businesses.   Entergy Arkansas began repairs to the local power grid as soon as the  storms passed, and many of our linemen and -women worked countless  hours to restore power even when they themselves were affected. One  lineman I met with was in his bed at the time of the tornado, and the  roof was torn off his apartment. After a day off from that tragedy, he  was out there working 16 hours a day to connect the power to his  neighbors. Countless time was put in neighbor for neighbor.   Entergy Arkansas' corporate office also donated $50,000 to the  American Red Cross to be used toward tornado recovery efforts, with an  additional pledge of up to $50,000 matching employee donations.   The Arkansas Foodbank did an incredible job of delivering food,  water, and other necessary items throughout our communities to ensure  those affected by the storms were supported with necessary goods.   Additionally, our local restaurants and businesses all donated  hundreds of meals and supplies to those in need.   I thank our community for demonstrating generosity and thoughtfulness  during a time of great need. They simply demonstrated that core value  that we all take pride in as Arkansans and Americans.                Congratulating Frank Thomas on His Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the exceptional  career of Frank Thomas, who retired in March from Stephens, Inc., a  financial services firm headquartered in Little Rock, Arkansas.   Frank graduated from the University of Arkansas in 1976 and was the  first news director at KUAF, the local Razorback radio station.   He quickly rose from local radio to national politics, working for  former U.S. Senator David Pryor as his chief of staff.   After Frank's time in public service, he felt drawn home to Arkansas  and has worked for Stephens for the past 27 years.   Stephens has long believed that Arkansas is truly the land of  opportunity, and Stephens has invested in and benefited from its long  association with our State. In fact, Stephens helped a little-known  company called Walmart launch their initial public offering and become  the largest retailer in the world.   I thank Frank for his service and his lifelong commitment to Arkansas  and the Second Congressional District and our Nation. I wish Frank, his  wife, and his family many, many happy years ahead.    Congratulating Cathy Owen on Her Induction Into Arkansas Women's Hall                                  of Fame     Mr. Speaker, today I rise to congratulate my dear friend of  some five decades, Cathy Owen, on her induction into the Arkansas  Women's Hall of Fame.   Cathy is a trailblazer and role model for women in banking in  Arkansas, having served the banking community for over 50 years. She  has been with Eagle Bank for over 40 of those years in various roles,  most recently as chairwoman since 2012.   During her time at Eagle Bank, she has worked tirelessly to build the  bank into a large, respected community bank. Over the years, she and  her team have been dedicated to customer service and developing  outstanding products and services.   Outside of her achievements in the banking industry, she remains an  active leader in our community. She is a generous volunteer and  supporter of Baptist Health Foundation, Fifty for the Future, and the  North Little Rock Chamber of Commerce, among many other endeavors.   I have had the privilege of working with Cathy in the industry for  decades during my time in banking. I am proud to call Cathy a friend. I  thank her for her many years of outstanding service in the community  and congratulate her on this well-deserved induction into the Arkansas  Women's Hall of Fame.      Command Sergeant Major Steven Veazey Retiring From Arkansas Army                               National Guard     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my friend and a  true example of a leader, Command Sergeant Major Steven Veazey. I wish  him a happy and healthy retirement.   Command Sergeant Major Veazey, an Arkansas native, has been serving  in the Arkansas Army National Guard since 1979, and has retired after  44 years of service.   The positive impact he has made in the Arkansas Army National Guard  is undeniable, and he has set the standard for what it means to be a  noncommissioned officer.   Over the years, the command sergeant major deployed to Bosnia and  Iraq. His awards and decorations include the Legion of Merit, the  Bronze Star Medal with one oak-leaf cluster, the Meritorious Service  Medal, and the Army Commendation Medal with two oak-leaf clusters.   Steven exemplifies leadership, not only as a command sergeant major,  but as a leader in our community, serving as a member of the East Union  Missionary Baptist Church, The American Legion, and as past president  of the Sheridan Rotary Club.   His wife, Leanna, has been his steadfast partner for the past 43  years and the cornerstone of support. Together they have raised two  children, Tasha and Steven.   Over the past 9 years, I have been so grateful for his friendship and  leadership. I treasure our time together since my service in Congress,  from paying tribute to a young soldier or an airman for a job well done  or saluting those who paid the ultimate sacrifice.   My best wishes, Steven, for your well-deserved retirement.                    Arkansas Museum of Fine Arts Reopening     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the reopening of our  magnificent Arkansas Museum of Fine Arts. The museum, located in  downtown Little Rock, reopened on April 22 after almost 4 years since  closing for renovation and expansion.   After years of planning, the museum has been reimagined into a  beautiful work of art itself. The architecture firm Studio Gang led the  design which preserves historic elements of the building but includes  other critical interesting and tasteful elements, making it into one of  the most influential museums in the country.                                time  1145    The museum has much to offer from the visual and performing arts to  full art educational experiences. The goal is to create a cultural  space where our community can engage with a diverse portfolio of  artistic perspectives and come together to see the beautiful temporary  exhibitions and participate in the wonderful array of educational  courses.   I thank all involved for their efforts in making this renovation  possible and congratulate the Arkansas Museum of Fine Arts for this new  chapter in their history in our State.                           Congratulating Jim Keet     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my friend Jim  Keet on being named Arkansan of the Year.   Throughout his life, Jim has been an outstanding and active member of  our  [[Page H2447]]  State civic affairs, and particularly in central Arkansas.   Jim served both in the Arkansas House of Representatives and in the  Arkansas State Senate in the 1990s.   In addition to his years of public service, he is one of our State's  most successful entrepreneurs. He is president of the Keet Management  Company and chairman of JTJ Restaurants, where he has operated 155  restaurants over the past five decades.   Beyond his success in business and politics, he has served on the  board of directors for 20 years at Easterseals Arkansas. Easterseals is  an organization that seeks to empower those with disabilities to have  fulfilling lives and to become active members of their communities.   As the founder of the Arkansan of the Year award while with  Easterseals Arkansas, this honor comes full circle now for Jim.   His tremendous work ethic and dedication to improving the lives of  Arkansans deserves this recognition. I am proud to call Jim a friend  and congratulate him on this exceptional honor.             Army National Guard International Sniper Competition     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Staff Sergeant  Benjamin Cotten and Staff Sergeant Allen Smith of the Arkansas Army  National Guard for winning this year's International Sniper  Competition.   This competition allows soldiers to display their abilities in a  rigorous environment designed to put their extensive training to the  test against 35 international teams.   The team, including New Mexico Army National Guard member Erik  Vargas, competed three days straight testing their shooting skills,  physical endurance, and problem solving as they took on a variety of  scenarios with multiple weapon systems.   Staff Sergeant Smith enlisted in 2003 and Staff Sergeant Cotten in  2006. Both have deployed to Iraq, and they have served as sniper team  leaders and marksmanship instructors with Army National Guard.   In addition to serving their country, they serve our communities as  firefighters. Their leadership abilities and mental fortitude earned  them this competition, and I am honored to add these men to my  recognition for this outstanding accomplishment across 35 very  competitive international teams.                         Congratulating Mack McLarty     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate my friend Mack  McLarty for receiving the Legacy of Leadership Award at the 35th annual  Arkansas Business of the Year ceremony.   Mr. McLarty is chairman of The McLarty Companies and was White House  chief of staff under President Bill Clinton. Mack also served on the  National Petroleum Council and the Council on Environmental Quality at  the request of President George H.W. Bush.   While chief to President Clinton, Mack advised on a wide range of  international and domestic issues, such as the 1993 deficit reduction  package, the North American Free Trade Agreement, and multiple trips as  it relates to attending the G7 economic summits.   Today, Mack is a respected senior adviser in both the public and  private sectors and a prominent public speaker who shares his thoughts  and experiences in the realm of U.S. trade and foreign policy.   Along with this recognition for his public service, Mr. McLarty was  awarded the Secretary of State's Distinguished Service Medal and the  Center for the Study of the Presidency Distinguished Service Award.   I congratulate Mr. McLarty on this recognition and thank him for his  lifetime of public service at the national level and at home in  Arkansas.                      Arkansas State Coding Competition     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Arkansas School  for Mathematics, Sciences, and the Arts, Conway High School, eStem  Charter High School, Little Rock Central High School, and North Little  Rock Center for Excellence for advancing to the State coding  competition.   Out of more than 160 teams, these five are part of the 16 teams that  were selected to advance to the State competition.   The top three finishing teams will receive monetary awards of $2,000  for first place, $1,000 for second place, and $500 for third place for  each member of the team.   The money will be placed in a 529 college savings plan account to  help those students with their journey toward earning a college degree.   I thank ARCodeKids for providing the grant money for the winning  teams, and I congratulate the students for qualifying for the State  competition. I wish them the best of luck.                        Congratulating Steven Helmick     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Steven Helmick of  Donald R. Roberts Elementary in Little Rock for being named the 2023  Arkansas Elementary School Principal of the Year.   Mr. Helmick is known for his outgoing personality and willingness to  do whatever it takes to inspire his students, including running a mile  for each of the 168 fifth graders at his elementary school and camping  out on the school's roof.    Steven Helmick has turned Roberts elementary into one of the highest  achieving elementary schools in Arkansas receiving a grade of A from  the State education leadership.   I congratulate Mr. Helmick on his well-deserved award and the  outstanding work as principal of Roberts Elementary.                         Recognizing Margaret Gaines     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Margaret Gaines who  celebrated her 100th birthday on February 19 of this year.   Margaret Gaines has been a resident of central Arkansas her entire  life. She grew up in Griffithville, Arkansas, and currently resides in  Searcy where she has lived for the past 62 years.   Throughout her life, Margaret has seen and remembers many historic  events, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal and  President John F. Kennedy's visit to Arkansas to dedicate the Greers  Ferry Dam in Heber Springs.   Mrs. Gains believes the secret to her long life is plenty of exercise  from gardening, which she learned to do during the Great Depression.  She still grows a garden every year.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Margaret Gaines a very happy 100th birthday.                           Recognizing James Chance     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the fire chief from  the Enola Area Fire Department, James Chance, who is preparing to  retire.   James is no ordinary fire chief. He is a volunteer who has been with  the Faulkner County department since 1973 and became chief in 1983.   When James first started at the Enola Area Fire Department, they had  a single brush truck to use as an engine, tanker, and rescue, and the  department did not have an ISO rating. Now, the department has three  stations, 11 fire trucks, and has an ISO rating of five.   According to his peers, James responded to every emergency, despite  how urgent or not it was. He spent two nights at 2 a.m. putting up  barricades on flooded roads during bad storms or responding to the  tenth false medical alert alarm in the middle of the night.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Chance for over 50 years of selfless service  to the citizens of Faulkner County, and I congratulate him on his  retirement.                         International Paper Company     Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate 125 years of the  International Paper Company.   International Paper, IP, was founded in January 1898, and they  celebrated their 125th anniversary in January--an incredible milestone  in our Nation.   Their company is committed to providing essential products that  people depend on, including being one of the world's largest producers  of fiber-based products.   Essential paper and paper products are important in our everyday  lives, ensuring goods are protected and keeping consumers safe. They  are a driver of local economic development in our great State. There  are over 550 IP employees and 6 facilities throughout Arkansas, 150 of  which work at the Conway Graphics Plant.   I congratulate International Paper for their 125 years of service,  and I look forward to their continued impact on Arkansas and around the  world.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H2448]]                                ____________________
