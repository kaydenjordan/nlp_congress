 Mr. Speaker, I rise and add my voice to support H.R.  7846. I thank Ranking Member Bost, Chairman Takano, and especially  Ranking Member Nehls on this subcommittee for his great work on it.   I would also like to add my voice in support of H.R. 7939. I am  honored to speak today in support of our military servicemembers and  their families.   America's warriors are always on the move, and their spouses often  change duty stations every 2 to 3 years in order to keep their families  together and remain close in supporting their servicemembers.   Requiring the spouses of servicemembers to operate under entirely  arbitrary tax standards prioritizes bureaucracy over bravery and  undermines the support we provide our servicemen and -women. That is  why I am deeply grateful for the support of many of my colleagues who  joined me in introducing the important language of the Military Spouse  Tax Act into H.R. 7939, the Student Veteran Emergency Relief Act,  ensuring that military spouses will be able to keep their home domicile  for State income tax purposes if they so choose.   This policy change provides much-needed financial stability to the  families of those risking their lives in defense of our lives and  liberties.
