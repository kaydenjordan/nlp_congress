 Madam Speaker, for decades, the issue of homeless LGBTQ- plus youth hasn't gotten the attention it deserves, even as it is  estimated they make up between 20 and 40 percent of all homeless youth  in the United States.   That is why I am so proud that the Federal omnibus recently passed by  Congress included $3 billion for 360 Youth Services in Naperville so  that they can launch a youth-affordable housing resource center to  provide youth-specific housing and homelessness prevention services in  DuPage, Kane, Will, and surrounding counties.   In the 11th Congressional District, we value our young people of all  gender identities and sexual orientations. I am proud of what 360 Youth  Services has planned for this funding.   Altogether, our office secured nearly $19 million for very worthwhile  projects in Illinois' 11th Congressional District that will benefit our  entire community. This will be taxpayer money well spent.                            ____________________
