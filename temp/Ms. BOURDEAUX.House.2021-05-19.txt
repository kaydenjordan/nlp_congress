 Madam Speaker, like so many of us in this Chamber, I  spend a lot of time on the road driving from event to event.   As someone who represents the metro Atlanta area, I have spent far  more hours than I care to admit sitting on I-85 in bumper-to-bumper  traffic. My staff have all had the experience of being on the phone  with me as I pull off the road and try to find a spot with a strong  signal in order to call into events because there is just no way I will  make it in time with all the traffic.   Congestion is one of the issues we all hear about with frequency. It  is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. It is a question I get  frequently, regardless of whether I am at a townhall, speaking to a  Chamber of Commerce, or visiting a small business: What is being done  to ease congestion?   This question is particularly important as we continue to have a  national conversation on infrastructure. Having spent my career in  public policy and public finance, I know how important it is that we  make smart investments today to set us up for success tomorrow.   That is why recently I rolled out my infrastructure agenda. I call it  FutureFit The Suburbs.   FutureFit The Suburbs is a vision to address our growing needs in the  suburbs to make smart investments now to prepare for the next century,  from preparing for the impact of climate change to building the transit  system of tomorrow.   This agenda focuses on the needs of fast-growing suburbs, recognizing  the need for transit and congestion relief in order to maintain  economic viability while addressing the climate crisis, and doing all  of it in a way that leverages public-private partnerships in a fiscally  responsible manner.   The key is to do well by doing good. This initial launch of FutureFit  The Suburbs contains four initiatives.   First, I am proud to be introducing a new piece of bipartisan  legislation today, the Build Up the Suburbs Act, along with Congressman  Carlos Gimenez from Florida, and my Georgia colleague, Congresswoman  Lucy McBath.   Imagine a regional bus rapid transit system that would run along our  major highways and express lanes, developing an electric bus equivalent  of commuter rail to help people get from suburban hubs to major  commercial hubs while skipping the traffic. The Build Up the Suburbs  Act would fund exactly that.   The next time you need to go to the airport, wouldn't it be easier if  you didn't have to budget in an extra hour or two just to get there?   Tomorrow, I will be introducing the National and Regional Greenways  Act to provide funding for the construction and expansion of greenways  across the country, corridors of land connecting disparate communities  with beautiful recreational space and environmentally friendly travel  routes, thereby reducing congestion and emissions.   This program would support projects like the visionary Chattahoochee  River Greenway, a proposed multiuse path that would run along the  Chattahoochee River in Georgia.   Beyond immediate transit priorities, FutureFit The Suburbs focuses on  how we can be smart in leveraging the power of public-private  partnerships to maximize available resources. For example, as more and  more shopping goes online, retail malls, and the large plots of land  that they sit on, are going unoccupied and unused, taking up valuable  real estate. Through low-interest and guaranteed loan programs, these  areas can be restored in a way that serves the community.   Finally, creating a national infrastructure bank would provide  Federal seed money to leverage significant private sector investment in  major infrastructure projects. Private investment is on the sidelines  and looking to invest in our roads, bridges, broadband, and electric  charging infrastructure.   Change is coming, whether we like it or not. We can make smart  investments now that enhance our quality of life, or we can spend a lot  more time, money, and effort retrofitting the same projects years down  the road.   By investing now, we can help slow the effects of climate change,  create jobs, and position the suburbs for success in the years to come.                            ____________________
