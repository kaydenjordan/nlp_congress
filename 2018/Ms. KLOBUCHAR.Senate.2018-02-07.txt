 Madam President, I know the leaders are coming down  shortly, but I thought I would get started, and I will return when they  are finished with their remarks.                               Secure Elections    Madam President, 271 is the number of days left before the 2018  elections. Only 271 days to go--a little more than 9 months--and we  still cannot assure American voters that our elections are secure. That  is unacceptable, and that is on us.   We know what happened in 2016. There was no debate about the facts.  On January 6, 2017, intelligence reports made clear that Russia used  covert cyber attacks, espionage, and harmful propaganda to attack our  political system.   Six months later, on June 21, the Department of Homeland Security  confirmed that Russia launched cyber attacks against at least 21 State  election systems and illegally obtained emails from local election  officials.   This week, we also learned that voter systems in Illinois were  hacked, and the information on thousands of voters was exposed to the  Russians. Our national security officials have sounded the alarm. This  is just the beginning.   Last week, CIA Director Mike Pompeo said he has ``every expectation''  that Russia will target the U.S. midterm elections. The former Director  of National Intelligence, James Clapper, said: ``I believe Russia is  now emboldened to continue such activities in the future both here and  around the world, and to do so even more intensely.''   Yet we have made no real progress in Congress toward shoring up our  election systems. Just 41 days from now, Illinois--a State that  Russians successfully hacked in 2016--will hold a primary for the  midterm elections. So why haven't we acted? There is no excuse, and  that is because there are six solutions on the table. Many of them are  bipartisan.   First, States need support to protect their voting systems from cyber  attacks. Right now there are more than 40 States that rely on  electronic voting systems that are at least 10 years old. Think about  that. Ten years ago, we were using flip phones. Now we have smartphones  that we update regularly to keep pace with the emerging technology.   So we need to provide States the resources to update their election  technology because our voting systems haven't kept pace with the times,  much less the sophistication of our adversaries.   In addition, our election officials need to know exactly what they  are up against. It took the Federal Government nearly a year to notify  those 21 States targeted by Russian-backed hackers, and today many  State and local officials still feel like they are in the dark.   That is why Senators Lankford, Harris, Graham, and I have introduced  legislation that will bring State and local election officials, cyber  security experts, and national security personnel together to provide  resources and guidance on how States can best protect themselves from  cyber attacks.   Second, we need reliable backup measures in place when something goes  wrong. Each State administers its own elections. Our decentralized  election process is both a strength and a weakness. It is a strength to  have multiple States using multiple systems. Then there can never be  one centralized place to hack. We saw this in 2016. Russian hackers  attempted to breach the systems of many States but were only successful  in one.   I will continue my remarks after the leaders are finished. I know  they have a major announcement, but I would just end with this. This is  a pivotal moment for our country. We will not give up on our free  elections and the freedom those elections deserve. If the worst happens  in 2018, it is on us, not just Russia. How does the saying go? Hack me  once, shame on you. Hack me twice, shame on us. We know what we can do.  We must put the resources into the State elections, and we must protect  the elections.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Majority Leader    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.                               Budget Agreement    Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I am pleased to announce that our  bipartisan, bicameral negotiations on defense spending and other  priorities have yielded a significant agreement.   I thank my friend the Democratic leader for joining me this afternoon  and for the productive discussions that have generated this proposal.   The compromise we have reached will ensure that, for the first time  in years, our Armed Forces will have more of the resources they need to  keep America safe. It will help us serve the veterans who bravely  served us, and it will ensure funding for important efforts such as  disaster relief, infrastructure, and building on our work to fight  opioid abuse and drug addiction. This bill is the product of extensive  negotiations among congressional leaders and the White House. No one  would suggest it is perfect, but we worked hard to find common ground  and stay focused on serving the American people.    First and foremost, this bipartisan agreement will unwind the  sequestration cuts that have hamstrung our Armed Forces and jeopardized  our national security. Secretary Mattis said: ``No enemy in the field  has done more harm to the . . . readiness of our military than  sequestration.''   For years, my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee, led  by Chairman John McCain, have spoken out about these damaging cuts. In  the face of continuing and emerging threats, these cuts have left us  unable to realize the potential of our missile defense capabilities.  They have whittled down our conventional forces, laying an undue burden  on forward-deployed personnel and their families. And they have shrunk  our fleet to its lowest ship count in nearly three decades. We haven't  asked our men and women in uniform to do less for our country. We have  just forced them to make do with less than they need. This agreement  changes that.   In addition, this bill will provide for our returning heroes. Too  often, underfunded, overcomplicated bureaucracies fail to deliver the  care our veterans deserve. The Trump administration and Congress-- thanks to the leadership of Chairman Isakson--have made important  progress for veterans in the past year. This agreement will expand on  those steps.   This agreement will also bolster our ongoing national struggle  against opioid addiction and substance abuse. It will fund new grants,  prevention programs, and law enforcement efforts in vulnerable  communities all across our country.   It also provides funding for disaster relief efforts. Last year,  powerful storms crippled Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands and  damaged mainland communities from Florida to Texas. Thanks to the  efforts of Members such as Senators Cornyn, Cruz, Rubio, and others,  this bill will get more help on the way.   The agreement will clear the way for a new investment in our Nation's  infrastructure--a bipartisan priority shared by the President and  lawmakers of both parties.   This bill does not conclude the serious work that remains before  Congress. After we pass it, the Appropriations Committees will have 6  weeks to negotiate detailed appropriations and deliver full funding for  the remainder of fiscal year 2018, but this bill represents a  significant, bipartisan step forward. I urge every Senator to review  this legislation and join us in voting to advance it.   I particularly want to thank my friend the Democratic leader. I hope  we can build on this bipartisan momentum and make 2018 a year of  significant achievement for Congress, for our constituents, and for the  country that we all love.                                 Immigration    Now, on one final matter, as I have said publicly many times, our  upcoming debate on DACA, border security, and other issues will be a  process that is fair to all sides. The bill I move to, which will not  have underlying immigration text, will have an amendment process that  will ensure a level playing field at the outset. The amendment process  will be fair to all sides, allowing the sides to alternate proposals  for consideration and for votes. While I obviously cannot guarantee the  outcome, let alone supermajority support, I can ensure the process is  fair to all sides, and that is what I intend to do.  [[Page S672]]                           Recognition of the Minority Leader    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.                               Budget Agreement     Madam President, we are very pleased by this  bipartisan work and what this will mean for our country. I thank both  leaders for their work.                               Secure Elections    Madam President, I want to finish the remarks that I started before  the leaders took the floor pertaining to another issue that is very  important to this country, and that is the issue of the elections in  2018.   I mentioned the importance of the bill that Senator Lankford and I  are leading, along with Senators Harris and Graham, that would give-- along  [[Page S673]]  with House support, Republican and Democratic support--some much needed  resources to the States to help them with their equipment. Many of the  States have not updated their election equipment in over 10 years.   I also mentioned the reliable backup measures that we are going to  need for things like a paper ballot system. Ten of our States don't  have that. If they were hacked, there would be no backup to prove what  had happened. That must change.   Third, we have to make sure our elections are free from foreign  influence campaigns. We know that the Russian disinformation reached  more than 126 million Americans through Facebook alone. And while $1.4  billion was spent on online political ads in 2016, we still don't know  how much Russia actually used to purchase those ads, although we do  know they bought Facebook ads in rubles to influence the 2016 election.   Today, online platforms are dwarfing broadcast, satellite, and cable  providers. The largest internet platform has over 210 million American  users. The largest cable provider only has 22 million subscribers. That  is why Senators McCain and Warner and I have introduced the Honest Ads  Act, simply putting in a level playing field. So if money is spent on  political ads, the same rules that apply to print, radio, and TV apply  to online media companies, and that is a disclaimer, and that is simply  a disclosure of both candidates' ads and also issues--defined by  statute--of national legislative importance. If my radio station in  Thief River Falls, MN, is able to track their ads, and the press is  able to see them, and opponents' campaigns are able to see them, that  should be able to be done by some of America's most brilliant  companies. We must fix that.   Fourth, we need to make sure our elections are free from foreign  money. About $184 million in dark money was spent in the 2016  Presidential election. Senator Whitehouse has a bill that would ban  campaign contributions and expenditures by corporations that are  controlled, influenced, or owned by foreign nationals. Senator Blunt  and I have a bill that would use existing credit card protocols to help  verify that online donations are only coming from Americans. If Amazon  can check your credit card against your home address, campaigns and  PACs should be doing the same to verify that online donations are truly  from the United States.   Fifth, we must send Russia a message that this behavior is  unacceptable. We need to make it clear to Russia that we will not  tolerate their interference in elections. That is why I have said time  and again that we need to impose the Russia sanctions that passed the  Senate with overwhelming bipartisan approval. This is about sending the  Russian Government a message: There will be consequences if you  interfere with our elections. We will impose sanctions against those  who engage in business with the Russian defense and intelligence  sectors--two parts of the Russian Government responsible for  orchestrating the attacks on our election systems.   The Senate voted 98 to 2 for those sanctions, and this administration  has not implemented them. It makes no sense to me that the  administration does not stand with 98 out of 100 Senators on this. When  we don't do the sanctions, we are announcing to the world that there  are no consequences to foreign governments that interfere in American  elections. By doing that, we simply embolden them.   My colleagues also recently introduced a bipartisan bill that would  require mandatory sanctions against countries that interfere in U.S.  elections. Deterrence is key, and imposing additional sanctions would  send a strong message to Russia and any other country that seeks to  undermine our democracy.   Sixth, we must understand the full extent of Russia's role in our  2016 election. That is why Senator Cardin introduced a bill to  establish an independent commission with one goal: to examine Russian  cyber operations and interference in the 2016 elections, because  understanding what happened in the past will help us prevent attacks in  the future.   All of these tools would help secure our elections, and so many have  bipartisan support. I am not just talking about the Senate; Republican  and Democratic former national security officials support these  policies. Republican and Democratic State and local election officials  want Federal resources to protect election security. Republican and  Democratic House Representatives do too. Representative Meadows, the  leader of the House Freedom Caucus, and Democratic Congressman  Jim Langevin introduced a companion to one of these election security  bills that I am leading. It was Republican Senator Marco Rubio who said  that once they went after one party in one election, the next time it  will be the other.    Our whole country is based on free elections and the freedom to  participate in our democracy. Our Founding Fathers set up a system so  that we would be free of foreign influence. In fact, our whole country  began because our country wanted to be free of foreign influence.   Now is the time to put politics aside and come together to secure the  future of our elections. So whether you are a four-star general, a  fourth grade teacher, or a computer engineer at Foursquare, this is an  issue that should unite us.   In 1923, Joseph Stalin, then General Secretary of the Soviet  Communists, was asked about a vote in the Central Committee of his  party. Stalin was unconcerned about the vote. After all, he explained  that who voted was ``completely unimportant.'' What was  ``extraordinarily important'' was who would count the votes and how.   It is 95 years later, and sometimes it seems as though we are back at  square one. Who voted is important. And if we suppress a vote or if  people aren't allowed to vote or if the wrong people have voted or they  are calculated the wrong way, that means that they had their way. What  he acknowledged back then is that who counts the vote matters.   We have to decide who is going to count America's vote. Is it going  to be America, or are we going to let another country influence our  elections and be able to count them themselves?   Russia, as we know, is not our only threat. Our adversaries will  continue to use cyber attacks. These attacks may not involve  traditional weapons of war, but they can be just as disruptive and  destructive.   As I said in closing before the leaders took the floor, the 2018  elections are just 271 days away. We need to protect our election  systems. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in an interview just  yesterday that Russia is already trying to influence the U.S. midterm  elections and that Russia has a lot of different tools at its disposal.  So I ask my colleagues, why don't we start having some tools at our  disposal, laws at our disposal that will actually do something about  this, resources supported by the head of the Freedom Caucus in the  House that will help to strengthen our State election equipment? That  is what we need. Hack me once, it is on them; hack me twice, it is on  us.   The 2018 elections are just hundreds of days away. It is time we take  action, and we will have opportunities in the next few weeks to put  some resources into this.   I will remind you that the cost of the bill that Senator Lankford and  I have, which we have paid for by unspent grant money, is 3 percent of  the cost of one aircraft carrier. If these other countries are viewing  this as a form of warfare, at least we can put the resources of 3  percent of one air carrier into this challenge.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tillis). The Senator from South Carolina.                                  Tax Reform     Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my  colleagues Senator Ernst, Ranking Member Stabenow, and, of course,  Senator Grassley. Senators Grassley and Ernst have been such leaders on  ag issues in their State.   I come to join Senator Grassley, not only from the other side of the  aisle but also, as far as Iowa and Minnesota are concerned, across the  border. Our States have rivalries in football and many other things,  but one thing we always agree on is having strong people to be the  voice of agriculture at the USDA.   I supported Secretary Perdue when President Trump nominated him, and  I believe he needs a team to be able to do the complicated work of  agriculture. At a time when we have seen difficulty in everything from  the dairy industry to cotton, to issues with prices for so many of our  commodities, to just only a few years ago the avian flu that was such a  threat to the poultry industry in Minnesota and Iowa, the thought that  we wouldn't have an Under Secretary in place for farm production and  conservation--such an important part of the work of the USDA right  now--is just unbelievable to me.   As the nominee for Under Secretary in this area, Mr. Northey would be  tasked with guiding some of the USDA's most important agencies that  interact with farmers and ranchers on a daily basis, including the Farm  Service Agency--which is so important to my farmers when they have  questions about how they are supposed to sign up for things and complex  programs; they  [[Page S691]]  are small farmers trying to do their job, and they need that Farm  Service Agency--the Natural Resources Conservation Service, and the  Risk Management Agency.   As we prepare to write and pass a bipartisan farm bill, Mr. Northey's  technical and legal assistance from the USDA is going to be critical.  The absence of an Under Secretary for this critical mission area also  has a domino effect that is leaving important USDA agencies without  leadership and without guidance. This is not good governance.   Secretary Perdue picked him because he was someone who had served as  a State agriculture commissioner. As Senator Ernst has pointed out, he  is not someone who has lived inside the beltway his whole life. This is  someone who knows a State that has a lot of ag.   When he came before the Senate Agriculture Committee last October, I  had the opportunity to question him about his priorities for the USDA.  He has spent his entire life in agriculture. He knows farmers, he knows  rural economy, and he knows what is needed.   I appreciated the fact that he honestly answered questions about the  renewable fuel standard. He sees it, as I do in Minnesota, as a  homegrown economic generator.   We are a State that is right next door to North Dakota. We appreciate  their ethanol and their oil industries. These are part and parcel of  Minnesota and our country's energy. That being said, we see biofuel as  an economic generator. We want to make sure we are keeping strong  industries alive so the farmers and the workers of the Midwest are  taking part in energy just as much as the oil industries in the  Mideast.   The final rule for 2018 and 2019 that went through two  administrations kept volume requirements for ethanol steady and made  some improvement in blend targets of advanced biofuels. The final rule  was a declarative statement by the administration that renewable fuels  are simply an important part of our transportation fuel supply and an  important part of our economy, but that is not what this is about.   Our friend from Texas, Senator Cruz, has decided to hold up the  nomination of someone who has done nothing but serve our country and  serve the State of Iowa as the agriculture secretary there--the  agriculture commissioner--with merit.   I don't believe we should be holding nominees hostage. It is not  something I have done as a Senator. Senator Cruz and I have debated  this in the past when he held up the Ambassadors to Norway and Sweden-- two Ambassador positions that were very important to Iowa and Minnesota  because of our Scandinavian populations, and yet we went for years  without Ambassadors to those really important allied countries. We went  for years with two qualified people who could have taken over a year  before, who had unanimously gone through--just like this nominee--the  Foreign Relations Committee without objection. Yet Senator Cruz was  concerned about the naming of a street in front of the Embassy of  China, which was completely unrelated.   So while I appreciate his representing interest in his State, and I  appreciate the fact that we have to have legitimate debates about  energy and energy policy, I just don't believe you should be holding  qualified nominees hostage.   In the case of the Ambassadors to Norway and Sweden, we were  ultimately triumphant because people from the Republican side of the  aisle and the Democratic side of the aisle came together and said:  Enough is enough. We need people who are qualified to fill these  important positions in our government.   That is exactly what is happening again. This is a qualified nominee,  and the Senate should not be a place where someone with his  qualifications should be blocked for an important position just as we  are considering the farm bill, just as we are dealing with disaster  recovery all over the Nation, including in places like Texas and  Florida. I just don't believe in this scorched-earth policy. I believe,  as we do on the Agriculture Committee, in working things out. We work  things out. We may have differences of opinion, but we let people fill  an important position like this.   I am glad our colleague from Texas has remained through this  discussion, with his friend from the Midwest, and we just hope some of  that Midwestern common sense will come his way. Like Senator Grassley,  I visit every county in Minnesota every year--all 87 counties--and I  can tell you that when I want to hear what the farmers think, I listen  to Senator Grassley, but, most importantly, I listen to the people in  my State. They want to have a USDA that is functioning and working and  ready for all the issues we are confronting right now in agriculture  and the United States.   Thank you very much.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.    Mr. President, once again, I rise to talk about the  Dreamers.   I thank Senator Durbin for his leadership. I know the leader will be  coming in shortly, and I will yield when he arrives.   I thank Senator Durbin for leading the Dream Act with Senator  Graham--for negotiating for years and years to get support on the  Republican side of the aisle, for never giving up, and for telling the  stories, as we have just heard, to bring this home to people--so people  understand that this is not just a number, that this is not just a  statistic, that this is not just someone whom you call a name. These  are people who are part of the United States of America. Ninety-seven  percent of them work or are in school. The average age they were  brought over was 6\1/2\ years old.   Like Senator Durbin, Senator Graham, and many of my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle, I am and always have been committed to passing  a legislative solution to protect Dreamers. I appreciate the Presiding  Officer's interest in this issue and the group that we have, the Common  Sense Caucus, that has been working together in debating this and  trying to come together to allow for the Dreamers to have a path to  citizenship, to allow them to stay in our country, to stop the  deportation of what would be something like 800,000 people--something  the President of the United States has firmly said he does not want to  do. He wants to see a path to citizenship along with increased border  security.   I see that the leader has arrived, and I will continue my remarks  when he has completed his.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I will continue my remarks about the  importance of passing the Dream Act and the work of the Common Sense  Caucus, in which the Presiding Officer has been involved, to try to  find a path forward to protect these Dreamers while understanding the  combination that we could have for increased border security at the  same time.   What you have going on right now in our country is fear, as Senator  Durbin has pointed out, with over 800,000 people who have been here, as  I said, through no fault of their own and with 97 percent of them  working or in school. Just yesterday, I met with the Catholic  Conference--people from the Catholic Church in my State--and some of  the Dreamers, and I heard again of the account of someone who is in  school and is doing well, who wants to work, and who wants to stay in  our State. When I hear these stories, I am always reminded of the  oldest Dreamer I ever met, Joseph Medina, who was born in Mexico.   He came over to this country and didn't know he had been brought over  to the country illegally. His parents had died. He grew up in Sleepy  Eye, MN--a little town. He decided to sign up to serve our country  during World War II. He then found out he was undocumented. When I met  him at age 99, in his words, back then, the military took you over to  Canada for a night, and you stayed in a hotel. You came back, and you  were a citizen because they wanted you to serve in the military. He  then served bravely under General MacArthur. He came back to the United  States and got married and had a son. That son served our country in  the Vietnam war.   I met their entire family and stood with them in front of the World  War II Memorial when he was 99 years old--Joseph Medina--along with two  other Dreamers, who were two kids from a Minnesota suburban high school  who wanted to join the Air Force, but, at the time, they were not able  to. He wanted them to be able to serve our country just as he had  served our country. He died just this last year at age 103. I am doing  it for him and for the 6,000 Dreamers who live in Minnesota.    As we know, we have been seeing them lose their DACA status since the  administration's decision. Not only would this mean deportation if we  don't do something about this, it means people will basically be led  away from their jobs--people who are teaching school, who are working  at jobs in our hospitals and in our neighborhoods, and suddenly they  will not be able to work. We cannot let that happen in America, and I  cannot let that happen in our State. That is why we must continue this  work. We must get this done and the sooner, the better.   The Dream Act is based on a simple principle. Dreamers were brought  to the United States as children and only know this country as their  home, and they should be given the opportunity to contribute to our  Nation and become citizens.   Passing the Dream Act isn't just the morally right thing to do, which  the majority of Americans agree with, it also makes economic sense. One  recent study estimated that ending DACA could cost the country over  $400 billion over the next 10 years. It would cost Minnesota more than  $376 million in annual revenue and have an immeasurable impact on  families who would be ripped apart.   The unemployment rate in my State is in the 3-percent range, and this  population is working in our State and an important part of our State's  employment force, just as our legal refugees are. That is why this  rhetoric and some of the things we are hearing about Dreamers isn't  good.   I truly appreciate those Republicans in the Senate, including the  Presiding Officer, who have been willing to work with us on this issue  and talk to the people in their States to try to come together on  passing some version of the Dream Act and allowing these Dreamers to  stay.   We will continue this fight. We stand in support of the Dream Act, we  stand in support of those Dreamers, and we work every single day to  find a solution.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.
