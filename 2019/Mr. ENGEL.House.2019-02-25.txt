 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 501) to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize and  enhance the poison center national toll-free number, national media  campaign, and grant program, and for other purposes.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 501.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 501, the Poison Center  Network Enhancement Act.   This bill, which I have coauthored with the gentlewoman from Indiana,  Congresswoman Susan Brooks, reauthorizes for an additional 5 years the  national network of poison control centers, known as PCCs, which play a  critical role in the fight to end the opioid crisis.   Our country's 55 poison centers are staffed by trained toxicologists,  pharmacists, physicians, and nurses who are available 24 hours a day, 7  days a week, 365 days a year to provide real-time lifesaving assistance  via a national toll-free number, which is 1-800-222-1222. Some 330  million people are served by these critical centers, while handling 2.6  million cases.   In 2017, someone called a poison center roughly every 12 seconds in  our country. More than 90 percent of those calls were due to poison  exposure in someone's home, and more than half of all cases involved  children under the age of 12. That is why speedy access to poison  centers is such an invaluable resource, especially for parents.   Poison centers also save hundreds of millions in Federal dollars by  helping to avoid the unnecessary use of medical services and shortening  the length of time a person spends in the hospital, if hospitalization  due to poisoning is necessary.   It is clear that these centers are a smart public health investment,  but they are also an integral part of our response to the opioid  epidemic.   Since 2011, poison centers handled nearly 200 cases per day involving  opioid misuse. Data from poison centers helped to detect trends in the  epidemic, and experts helped educate Americans about the crisis in ways  that could potentially save the lives of their loved ones.   The Upstate New York Poison Center, for instance, used the New York  State Fair to educate New Yorkers about proper use of naloxone, the  overdose reversal drug. This bill would make sure that activities like  this can continue.   Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege of coauthoring the last poison  center reauthorization signed into law in 2014, and I am pleased to  have worked on this important bill.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Brooks for partnering with me on  this legislation, as well as Congresswoman DeGette and Congresswoman  Herrera Beutler for being original cosponsors. Let me also thank  Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member Walden for their assistance in  bringing this bill to the floor today.   As I mentioned earlier, in Westchester County, New York, much of  which I represent, 124 people died due to opioids in 2016. In the  Bronx, part of which I also represent, more New Yorkers died of  overdoses than in any other borough in New York City.   We must do more to end this epidemic, and I am pleased to see this  legislation moving forward as part of that effort.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 525) to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to direct the  Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a public-private  partnership for purposes of identifying health care waste, fraud, and  abuse.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 525.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 525, the Strengthening  the Health Care Fraud Prevention Task Force Act of 2019. This  bipartisan bill would authorize the Healthcare Fraud Prevention  Partnership, and improve and expand the task force's ability to fight  waste, fraud, and abuse throughout our healthcare system.   The Healthcare Fraud Prevention Partnership is a public-private  partnership between the Department of Health and Human Services,  insurance companies, Federal and State law enforcement agencies, and  State healthcare agencies. The partnership aims to improve the  detection and prevention of healthcare fraud by facilitating the  exchange of data and information between the public and private sectors  on fraud trends and successful antifraud practices.   The legislation we are considering today would authorize the  partnership, require the partnership to report regularly to Congress,  and give the agency new tools to enhance and expand its capabilities.   We must continue to work on a bipartisan basis to enhance our fraud  detection capabilities.   I support this legislation and I urge my colleagues to continue to  work together to find meaningful solutions to root out fraud, waste,  and abuse in our healthcare system.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.

[[Page H2055]]         The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the       mutual understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction       over the subject matter contained in this or similar       legislation, and the Committee will be appropriately       consulted and involved as the bill or similar legislation       moves forward so that we may address any remaining issues       within our jurisdiction. The Committee also reserves the       right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or       similar legislation.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming this understanding, and would ask that a copy of       our exchange of letter on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of H.R. 525.

I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees from your committee to any House-Senate       conference on this legislation.        I will ensure our letters on H.R. 525 are entered into the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of the bill.       I appreciate your cooperation regarding this legislation and       look forward to continuing to work together as this measure       moves through the legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                Frank Pallone, Jr.,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to work together to find  meaningful solutions to root out waste, fraud, and abuse in our  healthcare system, and I yield back the balance of my time.
