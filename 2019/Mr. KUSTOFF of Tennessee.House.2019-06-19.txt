 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my  profound frustration with the majority on the Rules Committee. I am  disappointed that the majority has chosen to cut members out of the  process.   I worked with colleagues across the aisle to introduce a bipartisan  amendment to address the epidemic of Asian carp infestation in the  Mississippi River and its tributaries. This invasive species has  invaded the Tennessee and Cumberland River basins and continues to  threaten our rural economies and native fisheries that thrive off of  the recreational and sporting industries.   Without a doubt, it is a major problem in my home State of Tennessee,  as well as Kentucky, Alabama, and Mississippi. If these States continue  to get cut out of the process, the problem will only get worse.   I want to thank Members from both sides of the aisle who fought hard  for this amendment, only to have it thrown out at the last minute. We  deserve the opportunity to have the concerns of our constituents heard  and addressed, but unfortunately, the process is broken.   I thank the gentleman for yielding time.
