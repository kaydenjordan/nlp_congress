 Mr. President, as we all know, over the last year,  coronavirus relief has dominated our work here in the Congress. To the  surprise of some, Republicans and Democrats have worked closely  together to bolster our response on both the public health and economic  front so we can bring an end to this crisis as quickly as possible. Not  surprisingly, there were some disagreements along the way--there always  are--but both sides understood the importance of action and reaching a  bipartisan deal.   Part of the reason was pure function. With a divided government,  every piece of legislation involves compromise. You are forced to work  with folks on the other side of the aisle to reach an agreement. That  is a good thing because that is what it requires to reach the  President's desk and earn the President's signature.   But the reasons for working together on COVID-19 relief are more than  just the practical or functional requirements. Over the last year, I  have spoken with countless Texans who have faced incredible challenges  and dealt with unimaginable hardship. There are folks who have lost  their jobs and have lost loved ones, who fought this virus on the  frontlines in hospitals, and who have tried to support their  communities throughout this crisis. I know  [[Page S424]]  colleagues throughout the Chamber have heard similar stories from their  constituents back home because every State and every community has been  impacted by this virus.   Regardless of politics, we all realize this virus has taken a  devastating toll on the American people, and we need to remain  committed to providing relief. There have been big disagreements, of  course, about the best way to do that, but in the end, if we share the  same goal--to bring an end to this pandemic as quickly as possible and  minimize the pain and suffering of the American people--we can figure  out how to make this happen.   That common goal has led to five bipartisan relief packages that have  represented the best ideas of each party.   None of these bills are perfect, but I am sure both sides will agree  that, in the end, every COVID package that has been signed into law has  received overwhelming bipartisan support. As a matter of fact, none of  the bills have received less than 90 votes, and one passed unanimously.  That is spending close to $4 trillion. That is a remarkable, remarkable  accomplishment.   In the beginning, President Biden appeared to agree that a  continuation of this bipartisan approach was the best for the country.  After all, his campaign was built on a theme of unity, and he has  consistently talked with great eloquence about the need to heal our  divisions and work together and compromise.   To his credit, he has met with a number of our Republican colleagues  at the White House earlier this week to discuss what a compromise  package might look like. Ordinarily, that would be seen as an  encouraging development. We have a Congress with a record of bipartisan  COVID-19 bills and a President who talks about the desire to broker  deals that could win the support of both political parties.   But, unfortunately, what might seem like good news and a positive  development really isn't because in the mix you have the Democratic  leader, who is not on board with the President's call for unity and  bipartisanship.   Less than 24 hours after the bipartisan meeting at the White House  and just 15 days after the President's inauguration, the majority  leader laid the foundation to pass President Biden's massive $1.9  trillion package with zero Republican votes. They are not interested in  doing the hard work it takes to build consensus. Rather than take the  normal legislative process, which was used for each of the bipartisan  bills that had previously passed, the Democratic leader is preparing to  use the budget reconciliation process to pass this controversial  legislation.   And please note: We passed a $900 billion bill in December, and only  20 percent of the money that we appropriated is even out the door yet.   This is not the time to try to make political statements. This is the  time to try to parse where the needs are and to target those resources  to the people who need them--not a time to pass your liberal outbox and  agenda.   So, unfortunately, this reconciliation process is designed not to  encourage bipartisanship, not to encourage negotiation, not to get  bipartisan buy-in. In short, it is not designed to achieve unity at  all--just the opposite.   Well, after spending almost a trillion dollars this December, just  about a month ago--again, with only 20 percent of that money actually  out the door and on the way to the people who need it--our Democratic  colleagues are prepared to spend nearly double that amount when a huge  portion of the previous funding hasn't even reached its intended  target.   As of a couple of weeks ago, States had spent just $4 billion of the  $68 billion we appropriated for K-12 schools--$4 billion of the $68  billion. And what do our Democratic colleagues want to do? They want to  continue to shovel money out the door.   The CDC, the Centers for Disease Control, has distributed only about  a third of the $9 billion we have already appropriated for vaccine  distribution--only a third. And then there are tens of billions of  dollars in unspent funds for everything from COVID-19 testing to the  Paycheck Protection Program. So it is hard for me to see--and I am sure  I am not alone--the justification for spending tens of billions of  dollars more in places where previous funding is still waiting to be  spent.   There is also the question of whether the current funding is even  serving its intended purpose. Federal funding has helped K-12 schools  prepare for a safe reopening, and in Texas these have been used to  update the ventilation systems, purchase masks and personal protective  equipment, and make other investments in classroom safety.   But there are other school districts across the country that have  gladly accepted that funding but have zero plan to reopen their schools  to in-person education. They have capitulated to the teachers unions  that have demanded that schools stay closed. Some have said they refuse  to go back until all students are vaccinated--not all teachers but all  students. There is not even a vaccine approved for people under the age  of 16, but that is the demand of the teachers unions, who have showed  zero interest in their students but a lot of self-interest.   Some of these districts have gladly accepted the funding to prepare  for a safe reopening and, in many cases, have put their teachers at the  front of the line for vaccines, but somehow the teachers unions are  appalled at the idea that schools would actually use these tools to get  children back in the classroom.   Before we pass another multitrillion-dollar spending bill and add to  our rapidly growing national debt, we need to determine where the needs  truly are and whether the teachers unions are on board with our goal to  get children safely back into the classroom, which is our goal.   I will not support a COVID-19 relief proposal that sends hard-earned  taxpayer dollars to places where they already have billions that they  haven't even spent yet. One great example is additional funding for  schools. Our Democratic friends would provide $130 billion more for K- 12 education when there is still $64 billion remaining from the money  we appropriated in December. They want to spend $130 billion more when  there is still $64 billion available to be spent.   Well, even that is a high number because the CDC, the Centers for  Disease Control, estimated that schools only needed about $22 billion.  In other words, they have almost three times more than they already  need, according to the CDC, but our Democratic friends want to spend  another $130 billion.   I will be the first person to advocate for additional relief when and  where it i needed, but this massive relief package creates more  problems than solutions. I continue to believe that targeted relief  bills are the most effective way to support our country without driving  up unnecessary spending.    Somebody is going to have to pay this money back, and we shouldn't be  frivolous about the way we spend it. If there is a need, let's do it.  But if there is not a need, it is reckless and irresponsible to  continue to shovel money out the door. If there is a need to reinvest  in critical areas like unemployment benefits, the reopening of schools,  vaccine distribution, or the Paycheck Protection Program, we can and we  should replenish those funds through targeted proposals; and I would  hope, as before, we would be able to proceed on a bipartisan basis.   While Senator Schumer is clearly on the warpath to get this massive  relief to the Senate on a partisan vote, at least one of our Democratic  colleagues has shown some hesitation about going along with his plan.  Senator Manchin, the Senator from West Virginia, said this week he  wouldn't vote for a COVID-19 package that wasn't bipartisan. I hope he  will stick by his guns.   Congress has passed five overwhelmingly bipartisan COVID-19 bills  last year. We have overcome disagreements before, and I have no doubt  that we could, if we were to try, do so again.   This crisis has affected Americans in red States and blue States  alike. It would be a shame for the Democratic leader to shut out half  of this Chamber in an effort to claim a reckless win for his party.   We need to remember, just like the teachers who teach our students,  they need to keep their focus on the children and on their education  needs and their safety, and we need to keep our attention on our  constituents and what their needs are and try to be responsive to their  needs--not try to gain some partisan advantage at their expense.   I yield the floor.  [[Page S425]]     I call up my amendment No. 558 and ask it be reported by  number.    Mr. President, the amendment I offered would create a  deficit-neutral reserve fund to provide additional resources to our  Nation's law enforcement officers.   We know that the money provided by the Federal Government could be  used for a number of reasons, like deescalation training, crime  victims' outreach programs, mental health and drug treatment programs  to reduce recidivism, and the like. This money could also be used to  support the efforts to combat domestic and international terrorism.   I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment. We have a chance  to show that we back the blue by voting yes on this amendment. I ask my  colleagues to vote for it.                          Vote on Amendment No. 558    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
