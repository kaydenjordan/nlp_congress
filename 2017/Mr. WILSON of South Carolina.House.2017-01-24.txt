 Madam Speaker, this week marks National  School Choice Week, an opportunity to recognize the importance of  providing families choice in education.  [[Page H620]]    As the husband of a retired schoolteacher and the grateful father of  four sons and eight grandchildren, I know firsthand the benefit of  school choice. We should strive for education that recognizes the  individual needs of our students.   Last week, I was appreciative to visit schools to experience school  choice at work. I visited a charter school, a public school, and a  homeschool group. Thank you to Mark Brown, principal of Horse Creek  Academy in Aiken; to Dr. Bill Coon, principal of Meadow Glen Middle  School in Lexington; and Wendy Hoyle, the president of the Aiken Area  Home Educators. You make a remarkable difference for students.   I believe that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos will make a very  positive difference in the tradition of Education Superintendent Molly  Spearman of South Carolina.   In conclusion, God bless our troops and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
