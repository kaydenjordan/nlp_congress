 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I will remind my friend on the other side of the aisle,  the God-given right every one of us has, according to the Declaration  of Independence, is life, and that is what we are arguing about here  today.   Are we going to take protective measures that save lives?   This bill does that. I talk about the ABCs of gun control. A,  reinstate the Assault Weapons Ban; B, universal background checks; and  C, closing the gun show loophole.   Those three practical measures will save lives. And because I support  ABC, I get an F every year from the NRA, and I am proud of that grade  every year.                                Point of Order
