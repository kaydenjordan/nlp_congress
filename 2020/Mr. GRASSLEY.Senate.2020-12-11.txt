 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1  minute in morning business.    Mr. President, I speak about Iowans who are well noted  for things wherever they live in Iowa, but I am particularly proud to  speak about a person from Cedar Falls, IA, a town I know well because I  have lived my entire 87 years on a farm 8 miles from Cedar Falls.   This week, NASA announced that Raja Chari from Cedar Falls, IA, has  been selected for a team of astronauts that will go to the Moon as part  of the Artemis mission.   The Artemis mission will land astronauts on the Moon in the year  2024, with the goal of establishing a long-term presence. Raja Chari  will be a part of this effort that will ensure America's continued  leadership and preeminence in space.   I congratulate Raja on his accomplishments and wish him and all the  astronauts who are part of this mission great success.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
