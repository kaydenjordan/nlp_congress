 Mr. President, this Friday will be a joyous  occasion at Congregation B'nai Tzedek in Potomac, MD--a Shabbat dinner  to celebrate Rabbi Stuart Weinblatt's 70th birthday. His Excellency  Michael Herzog, Israel's Ambassador to the United States, will be the  guest speaker at the dinner. Rabbi Weinblatt founded Congregation B'Nai  Tzedek 34 years ago with just a few families. Today, the Conservative  synagogue is thriving, with 650 families. The growth and well-being of  Congregation B'Nai Tzedek is a testament to Rabbi Weinblatt's vision,  persistence, and charismatic leadership.   Rabbi Weinblatt graduated from the University of Maryland with high  honors in history. While he was an undergraduate, he helped to  establish the Jewish Studies Program and represented the student body  to the Maryland State government. He was ordained at the Hebrew Union  College in Cincinnati. Rabbi Weinblatt has been an adjunct professor at  Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, DC, teaching Jewish history,  Bible, and theology. He is widely recognized as a gifted teacher,  speaker, and author. ``Washington Jewish Week'' readers have voted him  the ``Best Rabbi in Washington'' on numerous occasions. The ``Forward''  newspaper recognized Rabbi Weinblatt as ``One of the Most Inspiring  Rabbis in America'' in 2016. He received the Jewish Community Relations  Council of Greater Washington's ``Pillar of the Community'' award and a  ``Man of the Year'' award from the Greater Washington Chapter of ORT,  the global Jewish educational network that prepares students for  careers in science, technology, engineering, and math--STEM.   Rabbi Weinblatt has served as president of the Washington Board of  Rabbis, chaired the National Convention of the Rabbinical Assembly in  Jerusalem and in Washington DC, and chaired the prestigious Annual  Israel Bonds' Ambassador's Ball. He authored ``God, Prayer and  Spirituality,'' a compilation of his sermons, writings, and articles.  He is known for his effective use of humor, even when dealing with his  own cancer, which he chronicled in ``Living in the Shadow of Death: A  Rabbi Copes with Cancer,'' a book one reviewer described as ``a  comforter to others . . . [and] also a valuable tool for clergy and  health care professionals who interact with and counsel individuals in  similar situations.'' He is a frequent columnist for the Jewish News  Syndicate, often commenting on the State of Israel.   Rabbi Weinblatt is president of the Rabbinic Cabinet of the Jewish  Federations of North America and has served as director of Israel  Policy and Advocacy for the Rabbinical Assembly. He heads the Jewish  National Fund's ``Rabbis for Israel.'' In these roles, Rabbi Weinblatt  has played a critical role in strengthening the enduring bond between  our two democracies, whose diplomatic partnership will celebrate its  75th anniversary next May. Today, in a world in turmoil, in the Middle  East region and beyond, our bilateral relationship is more important  than ever, and Rabbi Weinblatt can be justly proud of the role he has  played in securing this bond.   The mission statement of Congregation B'nai Tzedek emphasizes the  collective responsibility to do ``tikun olam,'' to give ``tzedekah,''  and to perform ``mitzvot'' regularly ``as a means of supporting Jewish  causes and all people in need.'' The Congregation is committed to  making Jewish values relevant and meaningful in today's world and,  under Rabbi Weinblatt's inspired leadership, it succeeds. On behalf of  my Senate colleagues, I would like to join the families of Congregation  B'nai Tzedek; Rabbi Weinblatt's wife Symcha, his children, and  grandchildren; his rabbinical colleagues; Ambassador Herzog; and  everyone else fortunate to know him as a friend or mentor in wishing  him a happy 70th birthday, ``ad me'ah v'esrim!''                            ____________________
