 Mr. President, I rise to honor the United Nations World  Food Programme, which is receiving the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize today.   The Nobel Peace Prize is awarded to those ``who shall have done the  most, or the best work, for fraternity between nations, for the  abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and  promotion of peace congresses.''   The World Food Programme, WFP, the largest humanitarian organization  focused on eliminating global hunger and increasing food security,  truly embodies those ideals.   The organization was awarded the honor for ``its efforts to combat  hunger, for its contribution to bettering conditions for peace in  conflict-affected areas, and for acting as a driving force in efforts  to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict.''   Those efforts, when put into numbers, show just what an enormous  impact WFP has as a last line of defense between hungry people and  starvation. Each year, the organization provides more than 15 billion  meals to 100 million people in more than 80 countries. It was the  world's largest nongovernmental provider of school meals, reaching 18  million children in 59 countries in last year.   The logistical challenges of accomplishing this goal may seem  overwhelming to most but not to the WFP. The organization has it down  to a science. WFP's 18,000 staff has over 5,000 trucks, 120 aircraft,  and 20 ships on the move daily, bringing food to those who need it  most.   The WFP's executive director, David Beasley, is a good friend of  mine. His commitment to serving a higher calling is inspirational. I  couldn't be more pleased that the spotlight is pointed on the work of  the WFP under David's dedicated leadership.   David will be the first to tell you that despite this honor, the  WFP's work is far from complete. After the announcement, he said, ``The  good news is we're feeding 80 million people on any given day in 80  countries. The bad news is it's getting worse out there--the famine,  the droughts, the conflicts.''   While that assessment is spot-on, I would add one more factor to the  list, the coronavirus pandemic. According to the WFP, the COVID-19  pandemic has the potential to double the number of people facing acute  hunger to 270 million people. It may also lead to emergence of famine  in multiple countries.   The pandemic makes the lifesaving work of the WFP all that much more  vital. In a world where 60 percent of people suffering from chronic  hunger live in countries affected by violence, additional nutritional  access constraints only serve to make food a more powerful weapon of  war. The WFP's efforts to overcome that challenge and bring food to the  hungry in conflict zones makes the organization well-deserved of the  honor of a Nobel Peace Prize.  [[Page S7419]]    Eliminating hunger at home and abroad takes an all-hands-on-deck  approach. It requires leaders with visionary solutions and supporting  team members who are willing to put in the hard work to bring about  meaningful change. David Beasley and his team at the WFP embody these  principles. I congratulate them and offer my continued support as we  work together toward a world where hunger is no longer an issue.                            ____________________
