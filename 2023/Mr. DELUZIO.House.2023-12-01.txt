 Mr. Speaker, plenty of my colleagues claim to have the  best high school football. Of course, they will be wrong because  western Pennsylvania is second to none.   When Jack Lambert took his place in the Hall of Fame, he called folks  in western Pennsylvania a proud, hardworking people who love their  football and their players.   It was true then, and it is true today.   It doesn't matter if we are cheering for the Steelers or for WPIAL  contenders under the Friday night lights. On any field, football is  serious business in western Pennsylvania.   I congratulate the WPIAL champions from my district for bringing home  the hardware: Beaver Falls, North Allegheny, and Aliquippa High  Schools.   A special congratulations to the Quips on their record 20th WPIAL  title victory.   Good luck this weekend to all the teams battling it out for the State  playoffs and for the State title.                            ____________________
