 Madam President, I rise today to support the  nomination of Janet Yellen, a dedicated public servant and world- renowned economist, as Secretary of the Treasury.   Janet Yellen's extensive background in economics and accomplished  career in the field led her to Chair the Federal Reserve, where she  served with distinction in the aftermath of the great recession. Ms.  Yellen brought a steady hand and wisdom befitting her experience to her  responsibilities at the helm of the Federal Reserve, and as a member of  the Banking Committee, I always appreciated her frank testimony and  thoughtful analysis.   In her new role as Treasury Secretary, she will inherit an economic  crisis caused by a mismanaged pandemic. She will be charged not only  with providing historic relief in close coordination with Congress, but  also with building back better to create the conditions for a dynamic  economy that harnesses the potential of each and every American. I am  confident in her ability to take on these urgent challenges. I look  forward to voting yes on her nomination and working closely with her in  the years ahead to ensure that we build an economy that works for  everyone.    Madam President, I was proud to vote in support of  Lloyd Austin to serve as our next Secretary of Defense. I cast my vote  with confidence that he will capably lead the Department of Defense  through this difficult period in our Nation's history.   As a four-star general, Lloyd Austin was tasked with leading the  drawdown of American troops from Iraq and helped bring 150,000 U.S.  soldiers home. He demonstrated the logistical mastery that will be  necessary to help lead the nationwide effort to vaccinate against  COVID-19. Through his remarkable life and trailblazing career, he has  gained the experience and perspective required of this office, and now,  he has broken one more barrier as the first African-American Secretary  of Defense in our Nation's history. I am confident he will ensure that  our Armed Forces reflect and respect the diversity of our Nation and  that everyone in our military upholds the oath they take to protect our  Constitution.   I have made no secret of my concerns about the troubling trend of  Congress granting waivers to allow recently retired officers to serve  as Secretary of Defense, and I voted against such a waiver for Lloyd  Austin as I did when that question was previously put before the  Congress. Nevertheless, I believe once Congress speaks on the issue of  a waiver, each Senator must evaluate the nominee on his or her merits  alone. By that measure, Lloyd Austin is superbly qualified. He has the  confidence of the President and is the right person for this moment. I  support his confirmation.                            ____________________
