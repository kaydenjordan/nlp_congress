 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I first want to start by thanking the chair and the  ranking member.   But for a moment, I would like to address another issue. I want to  pause to honor the life of Dr. Charles Krauthammer.   Dr. Krauthammer was a widely respected conservative thinker. He wrote  columns for which he won a Pulitzer Prize. Paralyzed since college, he  wrote the most vigorous commentary of our age. He was a Harvard- educated psychiatrist and had the perfect training to analyze our  politics.   He passed away yesterday, leaving behind a family that loved him,  colleagues that admired him, and grateful friends and readers like  myself.   If I had to think about this, Charles was a good friend of mine. He  had a beautiful mind, and he had a wonderful, wonderful way about him.  Simply put, I loved this man. I loved his work. I would marvel over not  just what he said, but how he would say it.  [[Page H5516]]    He had a unique ability to take the issue of the moment and place it  perfectly in the context of bigger things. ``America is the only  country founded on an idea,'' he would say, and his vocation was the  defense of that idea.   As great as his intellect was, there was absolutely no arrogance  about him. Charles was good company, so gracious, so curious. Take any  topic and he had already thought through his argument, your argument,  and all the counterarguments before you even got started thinking. He  was always willing to enjoy the fight, but with good cheer--he enjoyed  it; he reveled in it; he excelled at it.   Charles used his immeasurable gifts to contribute to our civic  discourse--and he did it civilly--and we are all the better for it. We  will be wiser for what he has done for us. I only hope and pray that we  can try to emulate his spirit and his sense of wonder and civility.   The House and this Nation are in his debt. Our prayers are with his  family.   Mr. Chair, I rise to express my wholehearted support for H.R. 6.   Today, our Nation is fighting a grave opioid epidemic. It is a threat  to a generation of young people and the very fabric that holds our  communities together. But to me, this legislation is about hope.   I have had the honor of speaking with and knowing three brave  Wisconsin families who have dealt with this, families that I have  gotten to know over the course of time.   Kyle Pucek is a guy I know from Janesville. He had an ankle injury  treated with opioid medication, just like a lot of people have. He  developed a dependency and eventually turned to heroin. He is now  clean, and he works with nonprofits in Janesville to encourage others  to seek treatment. He is helping make sure people don't make the  mistakes he made. He is making a huge difference.   Michelle Jaskulski has two sons, former high school athletes, who  became addicted to heroin. They are in recovery. She understands the  loneliness that comes with being a mother in this situation. She  understands how isolating it can all feel. Now she advocates for more  resources to fight this epidemic and supports other families so that  they don't feel like they are facing this fight alone, like she did.   Jason Simcakoski was a marine who served our country. He went to a VA  hospital looking for help for his anxiety. He was overprescribed  opioids, and he lost his life. His family has made it their mission to  ensure that others do not experience the same fate.   This is the heart of America. After suffering such unspeakable pain,  these families overcame. Now they are making it their mission in life  to make sure others have a place to turn to and that others don't have  to go down the path they went.    Asking for help is not a sign of weakness; it is actually an act of  strength. We all have a role to play in this, and it begins with  reaching out, with listening, and with being there for one another. All  of our institutions at every level should emulate and encourage this  kind of fellowship. We should make sure to make clear that no one is  alone, that every life matters.   This bill has the perfect title: SUPPORT for Patients and Communities  Act. It is bipartisan. It is high time we do it. It is a very, very  strong and good step in the right direction. It will advance treatment  and recovery; it will improve prevention; it will give resources to  communities; and it will fight deadly drugs like fentanyl.   So I thank Chairman Walden and Chairman Brady. I also thank Mr.  Pallone and Mr. Neal. I thank all the members of the Energy and  Commerce Committee and the Ways and Means Committee.   Let's not stop here. Let's not stop until we have instilled hope in  all of those who may be struggling. Let's not stop until we have ended  this epidemic.   I urge the entire House to vote ``yes.''                                time  1000
