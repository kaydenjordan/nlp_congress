 I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Ossoff), the Senator from  Michigan (Mr. Peters), and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are  necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Ossoff), the Senator from  Michigan (Mr. Peters), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) and the  Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Ossoff), the Senator from  Michigan (Mr. Peters), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the  Senator from Virginia (Mr. Warner) are necessarily absent.    Madam President, the Senate will soon vote on 10 judicial  nominees--nine for district courts and one for the Ninth Circuit  appeals court--as we continue the critical work of restoring balance to  our Federal judiciary.   Before briefly speaking on their records, I want to offer a few broad  observations. I continue to be impressed by the experience,  qualifications, and professional diversity that we see among President  Biden's judicial nominees.   Looking at these 10 in particular: Nine currently serve as either  State court or Federal magistrate judges; three have worked for county  or State governments; two have previously served as Federal public  defenders; one has served as a Federal prosecutor, while another has  worked in various roles at the Justice Department; one has worked for a  leading civil rights organization; and several have worked in private  legal practice.   The judiciary is stronger when our judges come from an array of  professional backgrounds, including those that have been historically  underrepresented on the bench. Furthermore, all 10 of these nominees  are highly qualified, with broad experience and distinguished records.  Each of them has demonstrated their commitment to impartiality and  evenhandedness. And they will be ready upon confirmation to fully  dedicate themselves to the demands of the bench.   First is Judge Linda Lopez, nominated to the U.S. District Court for  the Southern District of California. For the past 3 years, Judge Lopez  has served as a magistrate judge in the Southern District of  California, where she has presided over seven bench trials. Prior to  her appointment, Judge Lopez spent 25 years as a criminal defense  attorney, first in private practice and then as a Federal public  defender for more than a decade. During this time, she appeared in  court frequently and tried 11 jury trials.   With such extensive trial experience, both on and off the bench, it  is no surprise that Judge Lopez received a unanimous rating of ``well  qualified'' from the American Bar Association. She has the strong  support not only of her home State Senators--Senators Feinstein and  Padilla--but also of top Federal prosecutors in the Southern District  of California, including the Deputy U.S. Attorney and Criminal Division  Chief.   We will also vote on Judge Jinsook Ohta's nomination to the Southern  District of California. Judge Ohta is currently a judge on the San  Diego Superior Court, where she handles family law cases involving  domestic violence, child custody, and child support--among many other  issues.   Prior to assuming the bench, Judge Ohta spent nearly a decade with  the consumer protection section of the California Attorney General's  Office. In this role, she handled major cases involving healthcare  fraud, illegal robocalls--and oversaw an investigation into Facebook's  violations of consumer privacy rights.   Judge Ohta has been rated ``well qualified'' by the ABA, and she has  the strong support of Senators Feinstein and Padilla, her home State  Senators.   Judge Ohta's family immigrated to the United States from South Korea  when she was young, and she grew up in New York City before attending  Yale University and New York University School of Law. If confirmed,  Judge Ohta would be the first Asian-American woman to serve on the U.S.  District Court for the Southern District of California. Judge Ohta's  wide-ranging legal experience makes her exceptionally well qualified to  be a district court judge.   Next is David Urias, nominated to the District of New Mexico. Mr.  Urias is a highly skilled litigator who is well versed in a number of  practice areas, including criminal law, civil rights law, election law,  and immigration. He also has experience representing a broad range of  clients, from families of victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, to  hedge fund managers, to plaintiffs from low-income backgrounds.   In addition to having the strong support of his home State Senators-- Senators Heinrich and Lujan--Mr. Urias has been rated unanimously  ``well qualified'' by the ABA. Given Mr. Urias's broad expertise and  his experience representing a wide range of clients, he understands the  importance of ensuring that every voice is fairly heard in our Nation's  courts.   Next is Judge Maame Frimpong, nominated to the Central District of  California. Judge Frimpong currently serves as a Superior Court judge  in Los Angeles County. During her time on the Superior Court, she has  presided over approximately 30 jury trials and thousands of hearings in  misdemeanor and felony matters. In this role, Judge Frimpong has  demonstrated the acumen and temperament that is required of our  Nation's judges. And she is yet another example of both the  professional and demographic diversity that President Biden's nominees  are adding to our Federal courts.   The ABA has unanimously rated Judge Frimpong ``well qualified'' to  serve as a district court judge. Judge Frimpong has the strong support  of her home State Senators--Senators Feinstein and Padilla--and she has  my support as well.   We also will consider Judge Jane Beckering's nomination to the  Western District of Michigan. Judge Beckering has served as a judge on  the Michigan Court of Appeals since 2007. Prior to assuming the bench,  she spent 17 years as a litigator in private practice, where she  appeared regularly in both State and Federal courts and tried three  jury trials to verdict.   In reviewing her record, I am particularly impressed by Judge  Beckering's judicial approach. She has stated, ``My judicial philosophy  is that judges should take off their partisan hats when they sit on the  bench and treat all comers fairly and impartially . . . they should  make their rulings based on the rule of law, not on a political  agenda.''   That is exactly the perspective we should be looking for in nominees  to the Federal bench. Judge Beckering received a unanimous ``well  qualified'' rating from the ABA and has the strong support of her home  State Senators, Senators Stabenow and Peters.   Next is Judge Shalina Kumar for the Eastern District of Michigan.  Judge Kumar has served on the Sixth Judicial Circuit for Oakland  County, MI, since 2007. She is currently the chief judge on this  court--the second largest trial court in Michigan--and served in this  role on a temporary basis beginning in 2010, 8 years before her  official appointment. Over the past 14 years, she has presided over  more than 10,000 cases and approximately 100 jury or bench trials on  civil, criminal, and juvenile matters. Before joining the bench, Judge  Kumar was a skilled litigator.   Given her long and distinguished career as a State court judge and  her litigation experience, it is unsurprising that Judge Kumar received  a unanimous rating of ``well qualified'' from the American Bar  Association. She likewise has the strong support of Senators Stabenow  and Peters. Once confirmed, she will also be the first Federal judge of  South Asian descent to serve in Michigan.   We will also vote on Judge Jennifer Thurston's nomination to the  Eastern District of California. Since 2009, Judge Thurston has served  as a magistrate judge for the Eastern District of California. And last  year, she was elevated to the position of chief magistrate judge. She  has presided over at least 30 trials and 400 bench trials, and she has  issued hundreds of judgments involving a range of issues, including  civil rights, voting rights, employment discrimination, and criminal  cases.   Given Judge Thurston's experience as a long-time jurist, she will be  ready from day one to take on the challenges of the Eastern District of  California, which has one of the highest caseloads in the country.  Judge Thurston was rated unanimously ``well qualified'' by the American  Bar Association. And she has the strong support of her home State  Senators, Senators Feinstein and Padilla.  [[Page S9286]]    We will also be voting on Judge Kate Menendez's nomination to the  District of Minnesota. Judge Menendez has served the District of  Minnesota as a Federal magistrate judge since 2016. She was appointed  to that role by the district's sitting Federal judges, a reflection of  Judge Menendez's record, qualifications, and dedication to  impartiality.   Before assuming the bench, Judge Menendez served for nearly two  decades as a Federal public defender, gaining considerable trial and  appellate experience. Importantly, she has demonstrated that she  understands the difference between the role of an advocate and that of  a judge. She received a unanimous rating of ``well qualified'' from the  American Bar Association and has the strong support of Senators  Klobuchar and Smith.   We will also consider the nomination of Judge Mary Katherine Dimke  for the Eastern District of Washington. For nearly 6 years, Judge Dimke  has served as a U.S. magistrate judge in the Eastern District of  Washington, based in Yakima, WA. In this role, Judge Dimke has presided  over hundreds of matters, including approximately 400 civil cases that  have gone to verdict or judgment.   Prior to assuming the bench, Judge Dimke, a first-generation college  graduate, spent her legal career as a Federal prosecutor. During this  time, she prosecuted a wide range of crimes, with a particular focus on  fraud and complex financial crimes. The ABA has unanimously rated Judge  Dimke ``well qualified'' to serve as a district court judge, and she  has the strong support of her home State Senators, Senators Murray and  Cantwell.   Finally, we have Judge Gabriel Sanchez, nominated to a California  seat on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Sanchez is an  experienced litigator and appellate jurist with a proven track record  of impartial, evenhanded decision-making.   He received his undergraduate and law degrees from Yale and a  master's degree from Cambridge University. After graduating, he clerked  for Judge Richard A. Paez on the Ninth Circuit. Judge Sanchez worked as  a civil litigator in private practice for 5 years before serving in the  California State government, where he advised then-Governor Jerry Brown  on litigation, legislation, appointments, and various policy measures,  including criminal justice reform.   For example, he helped California develop and implement a response to  a 2011 Supreme Court holding ordering the State to reduce its prison  population. He served admirably to ensure California met its  constitutional obligations while also prioritizing public safety. In  2018, Judge Sanchez was appointed to serve on the California Court of  Appeal, First Appellate District. The court has appellate jurisdiction  over virtually all final judgments and orders issued by 12 counties in  California.   During his time on the bench, Judge Sanchez has filed or joined in  nearly 500 opinions in cases almost evenly split between civil and  criminal matters. So his judicial experience has been broad and varied.  Judge Sanchez also has the strong support of his home State Senators-- Senators Feinstein and Padilla--and was rated unanimously ``well  qualified'' by the ABA. He is an exceptional nominee with impeccable  credentials, and his evenhanded approach to justice will serve him well  on the Ninth Circuit.   I urge all of my colleagues to support these outstanding judicial  nominees. Every one of them has been rated ``well qualified'' by the  American Bar Association. They will bring much-needed professional and  demographic diversity to the bench. They will be impartial and  evenhanded in the administration of justice. And they will always be  faithful to the rule of law.                      nomination of mary katherine dimke     I announce that the Senator from California (Mrs.  Feinstein), the Senator from Virginia (Mr. Kaine), the Senator from  Georgia (Mr. Ossoff), and the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) are  necessarily absent.
