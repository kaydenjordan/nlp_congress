 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 593, which will  rename the Department of Veterans Affairs, as you have heard, the  community-based outpatient clinic in Hinesville as the John Gibson, Dan  James, William Sapp, and Frankie Smiley VA Clinic.   Mr. Speaker, I have the honor and privilege of representing the First  Congressional District of Georgia. We have much to be proud of in the  First Congressional District of Georgia. We have a strong military  presence in our district. We are home to Hunter Army Airfield, to Kings  Bay Naval Base, and to Fort Stewart.   Fort Stewart is located in Hinesville, Georgia, in Liberty County.  Whenever I travel to Fort Stewart, whenever I travel to Liberty County,  I know that they know what they are talking about when they talk  about military affairs.    I submit to you that the community of Hinesville, Georgia, supports  their military as much if not more than any community in America.   However, I have to be quite honest with you. Last fall, I was called  to a meeting with them and with some community leaders in Liberty  County and they told me they wanted to name a VA clinic in Hinesville  after four veterans who gave the ultimate sacrifice during the Vietnam  war.  [[Page H5708]]    When I went into that meeting, I was skeptical. We can't do this. We  can't rename a VA clinic anyway, much less after four individuals. I  have to tell you when I left that meeting, not only was I convinced,  but I was committed to making this happen.   Mr. Speaker, you heard the bios that Chairman Bost just read of these  young men all in their 20s, all of them with their life ahead of them,  all of them gave the ultimate sacrifice. Let's think of what they could  have experienced in their life--children, graduations, family memories,  but they gave their lives, all four of them gave their lives, so that  we can enjoy the freedoms that we enjoy in this country.   I sat through that meeting that day and I listened to the families. I  listened to their friends tell the stories of their loved ones. I was  convinced this needs to happen. Each of them made an incredible  sacrifice on behalf of their country and on behalf of their community.  They serve as righteous examples of patriotism and selflessness that  are deserving of being memorialized permanently by naming the  Hinesville clinic after them.   This effort is supported by the families and by the community, and we  believe that all four deserve to be memorialized for their  extraordinary sacrifice and their valor.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the community members in Liberty County, in  Hinesville, the local elected officials who brought this idea to our  attention.   Secondly, I thank the Disabled American Veterans Southeast Georgia  chapter, The American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the  Georgia State Department of Veterans Affairs for their support as well.   Last, but not least, I thank the entire Georgia delegation,  Republican and Democrat, the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, and all  the staff involved for their diligent work in getting this bill to the  floor.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I look forward to  working with my friends in the Senate to bring this piece of  legislation to passage and signed into law.   Mr. Speaker, last weekend we celebrated Veterans Day. These four  weren't with us to celebrate Veterans Day, but what they did gave us  the opportunity to celebrate Veterans Day. Let's at least do this for  the family and for the memory of these four heroes who gave the  ultimate sacrifice.                                time  1745     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  beloved city of Savannah, which has been recognized as one of the best  places to retire in the United States by HGTV.   Since I have been a resident of Georgia's First District my whole  life, I know that it is the best place to live and retire, but it is  nice to see Savannah receiving the national recognition it deserves.   Affordability plays a pivotal role in the city earning this  distinction, with the cost of living notably below the national  average, as well as the absence of estate taxes.   Other key factors that contributed to the city's rankings include its  delightful weather, tax-friendly area, and convenient and accessible  transportation.   Our historic city squares, riverfront dining, musical and artistic  amenities,  [[Page H5716]]  and southern charm make it the perfect place to live and retire.   I have done that all my life and intend to retire there, as well.                            ____________________
