 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1, the For  the People Act.   As a former voting rights attorney, I have seen firsthand the  devastation on the faces of Americans when they are denied their  ability to make their voice heard in our elections because they missed  an arbitrary deadline or have shown up to their old polling place. It  is heartbreaking, and it is not who we are as a nation.   With today's vote on the For the People Act, we, as a Congress, have  an opportunity to affirmatively expand access to voting. This bill  would do so by allowing for automatic and same-day voter registration  and establishing a national early voting period, while also enacting  key reforms that will make our elections more secure and that will  ensure Americans and only Americans take part in them.   I am proud that two bills that I introduced, the Know Your Polling  Place Act and the Shell Company Abuse Act, which would make our  democracy more accessible and more secure, are included in today's  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to return political power to  everyday Americans and to vote for this legislation.                            ____________________
