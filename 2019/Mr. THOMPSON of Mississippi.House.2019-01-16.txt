 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from  New York for yielding me the time.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 268, a bill to help our  country recover from another year of devastating natural disasters.   In 2018, Americans across the country faced extreme hardship due to  hurricanes, wildfires, and other catastrophic events. From Hurricanes  Michael and Florence in the Southeast to historic wildfires in the West  and volcanic activity in Hawaii, no part of our Nation was spared.   Last week, the President responded to these events by callously  proclaiming on Twitter that he plans to stop aid to wildfire survivors  in California. This behavior is not in the spirit of our great Nation.  The funding provided in this bill would show the American people that  we stand with them, even if the President does not.   Importantly, in response to Hurricane Maria, it provides $600 million  to Puerto Rico for debris removal and restoration of its electric grid.   Additionally, the bill provides much-needed funding to communities  across the Nation for Head Start, farmers who suffered crop losses, and  Americans with housing needs.   I have firsthand knowledge of the challenges after a devastating  hurricane. It took years and sustained commitment from the Federal  Government to help my community recover from Hurricane Katrina. H.R.  268 will help put our fellow Americans in Puerto Rico on a critical  path to recovery.   Additionally, I support the McGovern amendment to prevent the  President from raiding the Army Corps of Engineers' funds to build his  border wall.
