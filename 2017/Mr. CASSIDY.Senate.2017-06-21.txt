 Mr. President, I am also here to comment, as Senator  Cornyn has, on the state of play, if you will, and the repeal and  replacement of ObamaCare. I think sometimes the American people feel  like collateral damage as Republicans and Democrats go back and forth  as to what is the best policy.   I am a physician, a doctor who worked in a public hospital for the  uninsured for decades before I went into politics. I guess from my  perspective, the primary thing is not Republican versus Democrat, but  that patient who is struggling to pay her bills, her premiums, or the  fellow who can't afford medicine. What are we doing for them?   There is a gentleman who went on my Facebook page--again, cutting  through this kind of political noise. This is Brian from Covington, LA:         My family plan is $1,700 a month, me, my wife and 2       children. The ACA has brought me to my knees. I hope we can       get something done. The middle class is dwindling away. Can       everyone just come together and figure this out?    If that is not a plaintive plea of someone who is drowning under the  cost of premiums for insurance, which he knows he has and, as a  responsible father and husband, he will work to pay for--nonetheless,  he says that he is being crushed by these high premiums.   The American people need relief. We have to lower those premiums. I  have always said, though, that whatever we do must pass the Jimmy  Kimmel test; that is, to say that if Brian's wife or children or he  himself has a terrible illness, there will be adequate coverage to pay  for the care their family would need for that member of their family  with that terrible disease. It kind of brings us to where we are now-- two aspects to what we are considering.   By the way, when folks say that we are redoing one-sixth of the  economy, that is not true. The Affordable Care Act, ObamaCare, again,  attempted to address one-sixth of the economy that is healthcare. We  are focused on the individual market, which is about 4 percent of those  insured, and Medicaid. We are not touching Medicare. We are not  touching the employer-sponsored insurance market. It is important to  realize that this is not as comprehensive as the Affordable Care Act.  It is something far more focused.   Let's first talk about Medicaid. I am very concerned about what has  been proposed for Medicaid, but also concerned about current law  regarding Medicaid. Under the Medicaid expansion in the Affordable Care  Act, States got 100 percent of all the cost of the patients enrolled  for the first 4 to 5 years. As you might expect, States were quite  generous in their payments for these patients as they contracted with  Medicaid-managed care companies to care for them, so much so that those  folks enrolled in Medicaid expansion. Taxpayers are paying 50 percent  more than taxpayers are paying for those in traditional Medicaid. And  States enrolled roughly 20 million people in the Medicaid expansion  program. The combination of enrolling so many people in the Medicaid  expansion program and paying 50 percent more than for traditional  Medicaid means that when States finally have to foot 10 percent of the  bill, which they will by 2020--when States have to finally foot that 10  percent of the bill, they cannot afford that 10 percent.   Unfortunately, under the Affordable Care Act, State taxpayers will  not be able to pay what in California is $2.2 billion extra per year as  the State's 10-percent share. Similarly in Louisiana, my State, our  taxpayers--me, my colleagues, my friends, my neighbors--would be on the  hook for $310 million per year. Our State is having a budget crisis  because we can't afford $300 million. Now it is a $310 million  recurring bill every year.   One thing that is not said is that Medicaid expansion in its current  format is not sustainable. We have to do something--again, to preserve  benefits for that patient. We have to take care of that patient, but we  have to make it sustainable, both for the Federal taxpayer and the  State taxpayer. By the way, whoever is watching this is both a Federal  and State taxpayer. You are getting caught both ways.   Let me speak a little bit about the process. If you want to speak  about Medicaid, we just laid it out. Let's speak a little about the  process, as much has been said about it. I don't care for how the  process transpired, but I certainly understand Leader McConnell's  concerns that Democrats would not collaborate. I find that a sorry  state of affairs.   What do I mean by that? Susan Collins and I, and four other  Republican Senators, put forward a bill that would allow Democratic  States to continue in the status quo--to get the money they would have  ordinarily received under the Affordable Care Act and to continue a  system--as much as they desire to have--for the whole Nation.   The minority leader, Chuck Schumer, condemned our bill before we  filed it, meaning before he had a chance to read it. Without reading  our bill, he condemned it, even though his State of New York would have  been allowed to continue in the program that they are currently in and  receive the dollars to support that program. He condemned the bill  before he read it, even though it would have allowed his State to  continue in the status quo.   Similarly, we approached other Senators--10, at least, on my part.  None would help us with our bill, even though their State could have  continued in its current status quo, receiving the income it currently  receives. That tells me that even a good faith effort to reach across  the aisle was not going to get cooperation. That is too bad, and that  is why, I think, there is kind of a political back-and-forth in which  the patient--the American like Brian, struggling to support and cover  his family--gets lost in the crossfire. A goodwill bill, designed for  States to do that which they wish to do, would not even be considered  by the other side.   I have always pointed out that if even two Democrats had walked into  Mitch McConnell's office and said ``We will work with you to pass a  bill,'' they could have gotten far many more things for their State  than saying ``No, we have not been invited to the party; therefore, we  will not participate.'' I say that as an observation, not as a  criticism, but also as an explanation to the American people of how we  have ended up in this position.    Now, as to the bill that will be before us, I have not seen the  written language. I reserve judgment until I have seen that, but I will  say that there are some things I like. If our desire, again, is to take  that patient, the American citizen, and make sure his needs or her  needs are met--a family such as Brian described here who cannot afford  their current premiums--there are things in this bill which will lower  those premiums. There is the so-called cost-sharing reduction payments  for the next couple of years that would continue to provide certainty  to the insurance companies so that when they market insurance on the  individual market, there would be certainty. They would be able to know  those dollars are coming from the Federal taxpayer to support folks for  the next couple of years, and they could lower their premiums  accordingly.   There will be a so-called State Stability Fund that going forward,  States  [[Page S3670]]  could use to create what was called the invisible high-risk pool--a  reinsurance program, if you will--so that if you are a patient on  dialysis, a patient with cancer, very expensive to care for, you would  continue to get the care you require, but everyone else in that  insurance market has their premiums lowered because there is a little  bit of help for those folks with those higher cost conditions. By that,  we lower premiums.   President Trump, when he was running for President, said he wanted to  continue coverage, care for those with preexisting conditions,  eliminate the ObamaCare mandates, and lower premiums. What I have seen  or, at least, heard is we are on the path to fulfilling President  Trump's pledge. Now, again, reserving judgment until I have seen  written language, I will say that what I have seen so far keeps the  patient as the focus, would address someone like Brian, the needs of  his family, the needs of their pocketbook as well as their health, and  build a basis so that going forward, States would have the ability to  innovate, to find a system that works best for them.   On behalf of those patients, I hope that we as a Senate--whatever our  party--are successful. I hope going forward we, as a Senate, no matter  what our party, put the patient as the focal point, hoping that our  combined efforts--again, no matter what our party--will address her  needs or his needs, both financially and particularly for their health.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
