 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10  minutes.    Mr. President, I rise in support of the FIRST STEP Act.  This legislation, as the title says, is an important first step toward  desperately needed criminal justice reform.   I thank Senators Durbin, Grassley, and Lee, as well as my good friend  and colleague, Senator Cory Booker, for advancing this bipartisan  compromise. I want to particularly recognize the junior Senator from  New Jersey, who has been relentless in his efforts to bring moral  urgency to this issue, and I think we can thank Senator Booker for his  passion and his devotion to justice.   The need for criminal justice reform was an issue constituents  consistently and frequently raised with me as I crisscrossed New Jersey  over the past year. From Woodbury to Paterson, to Newark, and  everywhere in between, I heard from faith leaders calling for solutions  to a mass incarceration crisis that has disproportionately torn apart  communities of color. Indeed, the NAACP found that, nationally, African  Americans and Hispanics make up approximately 32 percent of the U.S.  population, but they represented 56 percent of all incarcerated people  in 2015.   I also heard from young people pushing for drug policy reform so  fewer students charged with marijuana offenses lose access to Federal  financial aid.   I met with leaders like former New Jersey Governor Jim McGreevey,  whose work with New Jersey Reentry Corporation helps formerly  incarcerated individuals--especially those struggling with addiction-- find jobs and avoid ending up back in prison.   I met with African-American law enforcement organizations, like the  Bronze Shields, about their efforts to build positive relationships in  their communities and address challenges like racial profiling and  uneven enforcement.   The FIRST STEP Act will not solve all of these problems--far from it.  I certainly would have liked to see more concrete reforms to Federal  minimum mandatory sentences. However, I am pleased to support a bill  that reverses some of the most detrimental effects of Federal mandatory  minimum sentences.   As a longtime proponent of the Second Chance Act, I am also glad to  see provisions reauthorized under this bill that will give nonviolent,  low-risk offenders and their families greater hope for a brighter  future. Under the FIRST STEP Act, more Americans in the Federal prison  system will finally get their second chance.   While most offenders are incarcerated at the State level, we know  Federal mandatory minimums for drug offenses are among the harshest in  the Nation. According to The Sentencing Project, half of the U.S.  Federal prison population is serving time for a drug offense, the vast  majority of them nonviolent.   Under this legislation, low-risk offenders will be able to earn  credit by completing anti-recidivism programs that help better prepare  them for life after prison. Inmates can then apply these credits for  early placement in a halfway house, home confinement, or other types of  early release. We know that when prisoners are equipped with the right  tools and resources, they are better able to reintegrate into society  and avoid old behaviors that could result in them winding up back  behind bars. That is not only good for them, it is good for their  families and good for their communities.   These provisions are important back-end reforms, but I will not stop  calling for greater reforms on the front end--the enforcement side of  the equation. This is a serious problem in New Jersey. In July 2017,  The Sentencing Project reported that racial disparities in New Jersey's  marijuana arrests were at an alltime high. In 2013, African Americans  were arrested for marijuana possession three times as often as their  White counterparts, despite marijuana use being similar among racial  groups.   The disparities extend far beyond arrest rates. Recently, a 6-month  investigation by NJ Advance Media found ``hard evidence of racial  disparities in police use of force across New Jersey.'' The data  revealed African Americans are three times likelier to face some type  of police force compared to Whites. Even more troubling, African- American children faced a disproportionate amount of force. From 2012  through 2016, of the more than 4,600 uses of force against people under  the age of 18, slightly more than half were African American. Yet  African-American children account for only 14.5 percent of New Jersey's  child population.   I don't highlight these statistics to denigrate our police force  because the men and women who serve in law enforcement put their lives  on the line every day to protect our communities, and their bravery  will always have my respect, support, and admiration. I do highlight  these statistics because they reveal a larger need for greater front- end criminal justice, sentencing, and police reforms that ultimately  share our goal of building safe and thriving communities.   Passing the FIRST STEP Act is just that--a first step. It cannot be  the only step. We have so much more work to do to fix a broken criminal  justice system that leaves too many Americans behind.   The FIRST STEP Act does not address structural racism and racial  disparities in our criminal justice system, nor does it completely  alleviate some of the draconian sentences still in place for drug  offenses.   What this legislation will do is to make a positive difference in the  lives of thousands of Federal inmates working to turn their lives  around and earn a second chance. I urge my colleagues to support this  bill. I have always believed that the Federal policies we set can have  a ripple effect across the Nation. May the passage of the FIRST STEP  Act by Congress spur States across America to take additional steps  forward--steps that, together, may advance our Nation's long march for  equality and justice under the law.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
