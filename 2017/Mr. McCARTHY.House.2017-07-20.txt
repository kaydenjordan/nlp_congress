 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning  hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until  6:30.   On Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m.  for morning hour and noon for legislative business.   On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business.   Madam Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next  week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business  tomorrow.   Now, one suspension worth highlighting is H.R. 3218, the Forever GI  Bill, sponsored by Representative Phil Roe. This bipartisan legislation  will remove the 15-year cap for benefits that forces veterans to use it  or lose it, while enabling vets to take advantage of innovative new  models like nanodegrees and massive open online courses.   Education in the 21st century is a process of lifelong learning, and  I look forward to the House passing this important reform on behalf of  the men and women who bravely serve our Nation.   In addition, the House will use the Congressional Review Act to  disapprove of the CFPB rule on arbitration agreements. This rule hurts  consumers at the expense of class-action trial lawyers, and we will  work with our colleagues in the Senate to overturn this misguided  regulation.   The House will also consider H.R. 3219, the Make America Secure  Appropriations Act, sponsored by Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen.                                time  1215    Madam Speaker, this is vital that we demonstrate our commitment to  America's servicemembers and uphold our constitutional duty to provide  for the common defense.   This security package includes the committee's marked and reported  bills for Defense, Energy and Water, Legislative Branch, and Military  Construction and Veterans Affairs.   Among many positives, the bill gives a 2.4 percent pay raise for our  troops, increases funding for our Capitol Police, ensures greater  oversight and accountability at the VA, and fully funds the President's  request for a wall along our southern border.   As always, Members are advised that late-night votes are likely next  week during the consideration of this appropriations package.   Finally, Madam Speaker, additional legislative items are possible in  the House, and I will be sure to notify Members of any additions to our  schedule.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me  time, and I thank him for his question.   Madam Speaker, he is correct that, as of today, all 12 appropriations  bills will be done from committee, marked up in subcommittee and full  committee, and I want to thank the Appropriations Committee for their  work. They achieved something that has not been achieved before in the  timeline that they were given, and it is extraordinary the work they  were able to do.   It is correct in the Make America Secure minibus package that we are  bringing, that that package covers over 66 percent of our total  discretionary spending.   As the Rules Committee has noted, the bill will come under a rule, so  it will be a structured rule. We assume that there will be hundreds of  amendments, as the gentleman knows, just like in the NDAA, more than  200 amendments.   I would like it noted there were more Democratic amendments than  there were Republican amendments in the process that we worked through,  and that is why I expect there will be late votes next week as well.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me  time, and I thank him for his note that sometimes we have more  Republican ideas usually that come to the floor, and I think ideas are  good.   Madam Speaker, I do intend to bring the rest of the appropriations  bills through this floor and get them done to send them to the Senate.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me  time.   Madam Speaker, as the gentleman knows, the President campaigned  across America to the American public about making sure our borders are  secure. Many Members on both sides of the aisle know the challenges we  have along the border. The President requested and this fully funds the  President's request.   As I look back in history along this line about border security,  there are  [[Page H6133]]  many times in history it shows, just a short history ago, of those who  have voted for it. Hillary Clinton has voted for border security as  well on the wall, Barack Obama, Joe Biden, and Chuck Schumer.    This will be an amendment made in Rules for the bill.    Madam Speaker, as the gentleman knows, I do not speak  for the Rules Committee. It will be their process and their  determination. It is a committee. They will decide as a committee.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   He brings up a point about the security of our border. It was a  debate nationally, but it wasn't a new debate. It is a debate that  actually happened on this floor a short amount of time ago. We all  remember the Secure Fence Act. It was actually debated right before I  was elected.   We got veto-proof majorities in both the House and Senate. Sixty-four  Democrats voted for that bill on this floor, 80 of 100 Senators.   I would like to note once again, who were those Senators who voted  for this? It was Hillary Clinton; at the time, Senator Barack Obama;  Senator Joe Biden; and Senator Chuck Schumer. So it is not a new  challenge.   But the gentleman will be thankful that we have taken the new  technology and also applied it within this bill for border security. We  have levees. We have dams as well. We have taken the ideas on all  sides. The American public has requested this. I can't promise what the  Rules Committee will do, just as I would never ask you to promise what  one of the committees is going to do.   Just as you quote my book--and I don't get upset with you quoting my  book. You should buy it and read it more. Buy more books. The whole  staff should be reading my book.    And just to clarify, I get no royalties. The Wounded  Veterans get the money, and I am thankful that you buy it.   But if I may finish with this, the Rules Committee will act. The  American public expects us to act. We utilize technology. We utilize  levees. We utilize dams. And I will tell you, many of those ideas come  from your side of the aisle.   It is requested not just from Members on your side of the aisle, but  Democrats and city councils and others that are along the border.   So, yes, we are taking action, just as we said we would do. The Rules  Committee will find the right place to apply it, and we will be able to  have the discussion on the floor.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet on Monday, July 24, 2017, when  it shall convene at noon for morning-hour debate and 2 p.m. for  legislative business.
