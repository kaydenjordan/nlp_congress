 Madam Speaker, the bill before us rightly commemorates  June 19, 1865, the day Major General Gordon Granger arrived in  Galveston, Texas, announcing the end of the Civil War, and the formal  end of slavery. It is effectively freedom day for the last enslaved  Americans.   Of course, that was only in law. In practice, America failed to  secure the blessings of liberty for those formerly enslaved Americans.  Instead, when Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, the assassin  effectively muted reconstruction.   Leaders, like Pennsylvania Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, rightly  called for a much more aggressive reconstruction, but he failed to  persuade his colleagues. The long struggle in defense of freedom is  part of America's history.   At our founding, in the Declaration of Independence, our Founders  eloquently stated that all people are endowed by their Creator with  certain unalienable rights, that among them are life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness.   Winning the revolution offered the potential for leaders like John  Adams to rightly persuade their colleagues to end slavery, but they  failed. Their failure set the stage for the Civil War, and the failure  to complete reconstruction meant 100 years of Jim Crow, and separate  but equal, that continued into my dad's lifetime.   America's failure to rightly recognize our painful and often unjust  history has meant ongoing division, open wounds that continue to  fester.   So, today, let us not fail to persuade our colleagues. Let us  recognize this holiday. I mean, it should, however, be known as Freedom  Day or simply Juneteenth, not National Independence Day, which  recognizes the Declaration, not freedom, but the Declaration of  Independence. I hope we can correct that in the future, but let's not  allow perfect to become the enemy of this good bill, and I urge its  passage.
