 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my  remarks before the vote.    Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to  support the nomination of Lauren King to serve as judge for the U.S.  District Court of Western Washington. I am pleased to have recommended  her to President Biden.   As a citizen of the Muscogee Nation, Ms. King will be the first  Native American Federal judge from my home State and only the sixth- ever Native judge in our country's history.   She is extremely well qualified and has an abundance of Tribal court  experience, something that is very important in my State. We are home  to 29 federally recognized Tribes, and it is long overdue that our  Federal court system includes those who have deep understanding and  appreciation of Tribal trust responsibilities and Federal Indian law.   Ms. King has extensive litigation experience and is a recognized  leader in Tribal law. She has been a pro tem appellate judge for the  Northwest Intertribal Court System since 2013. She has also served as a  commissioner on the Washington State Gambling Commission and chairs her  law firm's Native American Law Practice Group.   A graduate from the University of Washington and the University of  Virginia School of Law, she has also taught Federal Indian law at  Seattle University. She has earned the support of the National Congress  of American Indians, the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, and  other leading Native organizations.   I know she will make an excellent addition to our court in the  Western District of Washington, and I urge my colleagues to support her  nomination.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
