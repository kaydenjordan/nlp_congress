The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as       amended, and any further amendment thereto to final passage       without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with       or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Hastings), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  to include extraneous material on House Resolution 577, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring this rule  forward on behalf of the Rules Committee. The rule provides for  consideration of H.R. 469, the Sunshine for Regulations and Regulatory  Decrees and Settlements Act, and H.R. 732, the Stop Settlement Slush  Funds Act.   The rule provides for 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled  by the chair and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee for each of  the bills under consideration, and also provides for a motion to  recommit on both bills. Additionally, the rule makes in order six  amendments to each bill, respectively, representing ideas from Members  on both sides of the aisle.   Yesterday, the Rules Committee received testimony from Judiciary  Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte and Representative Jamie Raskin. In  addition to the discussion of the underlying legislation at the Rules  Committee, I previously joined my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee  in a robust debate of the major components of these bills at Judiciary  markups earlier this year.   I introduced H.R. 469 to address a problem that, unfortunately, has  become all too common: the practice of regulating behind closed doors  and absent public input through what is known as sue and settle  agreements.   H.R. 469 also includes the Judgment Fund Transparency Act, introduced  by Representative Chris Stewart, and the Article I Amicus and  Intervention Act, introduced by Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob  Goodlatte.   The rule also provides for consideration of the Stop Settlement Slush  Funds Act, which was introduced after an extensive investigation by the  House Judiciary Committee found that the Department of Justice was  systemically circumventing Congress and directing settlement money to  activist groups.   The legislation provided for by today's rule strengthens the balance  of power and Congress' Article I authority, which we have allowed  executive agencies to erode over time.   Regardless of the political party in power, Congress has a  constitutional obligation to carry out its duties and ensure that the  legislative branch writes the law. When Congress fulfills its role as  intended, the Federal Government is more responsive to the needs of the  electorate and more accountable to our citizenry.   My legislation, the Sunshine for Regulations and Regulatory Decrees  and Settlements Act, otherwise known as sue and settle, addresses the  problem of regulation through litigation. We have seen this problem  explode in recent years, particularly under the previous  administration.   Mr. Speaker, I could offer you dozens of examples of this abuse, yet  my time would expire long before I could list them all. A few  particularly notable examples, however, highlight the enormous costs  and burdens that regulation through litigation can impose on  unsuspecting Americans.   The infamous Utility MACT and Boiler MACT rules resulted from sue and  settle cases. They carry price tags of $9.6 billion and $3 billion in  costs and compliance, respectively.   The Chesapeake Bay Clean Water Act rules boast a whopping $18 billion  in compliance costs. These rules also resulted from covert sue and  settle maneuvers.   I don't think it is fair to ask hardworking job creators, farmers,  and ranchers of northeast Georgia--or anywhere in this Nation, for that  matter--to foot the bills for policy that bureaucrats secretly put in  place.   I am sad to report that the prevalence of these sue and settlement  agreements have only grown in recent years. The second term of the  previous administration brought us 77 sue and settle cases related to  the Clean Air Act. By comparison, President Clinton's second term  witnessed 27 sue and settle cases, and President Bush's second term saw  28 such cases.   But let me also say just right there, Mr. Speaker, that it doesn't  matter which administration or which party is in the White House. This  is not a bill that is designed to go for one party or another. It is  simply saying that there is an Article I of the Constitution, and that  is the legislative branch that writes the laws, and then the executive  is to enforce the laws, not write them. I want to make it clear--and I  know it is going to be talked about that this is not, but I do want to  make it clear that this is for any administration.   The Obama administration's penchant for circumventing Congress and  its constitutional authority was incredible, and its legacy has  endured. The weight of these improper agreements hangs around the necks  of American businesses, employees, farmers, and ranchers.   Fortunately, the Trump administration has recognized the impropriety  of this practice and is taking steps to start curbing abuse of sue and  settle agreements and the Federal rulemaking process. In fact, EPA  Administrator Scott Pruitt recently issued a directive to increase  public engagement in policymaking at the EPA.   This is a critical step and one that I applaud, but it doesn't negate  the need for Congress to act decisively. In fact, it only highlights  it. Congress has a right and an obligation to defend its constitutional  prerogatives.   Like the Sunshine for Regulations and Regulator Decrees and  Settlements Act, the Judgment Fund Transparency Act will make our  government more accountable to the people by providing real  transparency. The Judgment Fund Transparency Act is based upon the  principle that the American people have the right to know how their  government is spending their hard-earned tax dollars.    The Judgment Fund was created over 50 years ago as a way to provide  for efficient payment of lawful claims against the U.S., but it has  become a permanent appropriation shrouded in secrecy.   While many payments out of the Judgment Fund are both legitimate and  appropriate, the fund remains the subject of egregious abuse. For  example, last year, the administration paid Iran $1.3 billion out of  the Judgment Fund--primarily in the form of foreign currency--as a  payment for the interest that had accrued on Iranian assets  [[Page H8088]]  that had been frozen because Iran sponsors terrorism without shame. As  you might imagine, the Obama administration stonewalled congressional  efforts to investigate those payments.   This much-needed legislation would not only ensure that such payments  could not be hidden from Congress and the Americans they represents, it  outright prohibits payments to state sponsors of terrorism and foreign  terrorist organizations, which should be one of the least controversial  actions ever to grace the floor of this House.   As I have said before, transparency and accountability are the best  remedies for a government run amuck. Title III of H.R. 469, Chairman  Goodlatte's legislation, the Article I Amicus and Intervention Act,  will further strengthen Congress' powers under Article I and, in doing  so, will help restore checks and balances between the three branches of  government.   When the Federal courts are deciding important matters regarding the  Constitution, congressional powers, and Federal law, it is critical  that Congress have the opportunity, should it deem the action  necessary, to file an amicus or otherwise intervene in pending  litigation.   The need for this legislation is compounded when, as was the case  during the previous administration, the executive branch decides not to  defend constitutionality of Federal law. This leads our adversarial  legal system without anyone to litigate significant cases and shifts  interpretation of the Constitution from the courts to the executive  branch.   This provision will ensure that the House, like the Senate, has a  statutory right to file amicus briefs or intervene when Congress'  powers and responsibilities are called into question.   The Article I Amicus and Intervention Act, like the other bills  contained in this measure, is an important step toward restoring  government transparency, balance, and accountability.   Mr. Speaker, you might be able to detect a theme that is emerging  here today. My colleagues and I are working hard to ensure the American  people have a government by the people and for the people. We are  working to restore the balance of powers that our forefathers put into  place and to ensure that the executive overreach that was the hallmark  of the previous administration won't be able to undermine transparency  in the future.   In that vein, the rule also provides for consideration of the Stop  Settlement Slush Funds Act. The Stop Settlement Slush Funds Act  prevents the Department of Justice from subverting Congress' power of  the purse by prohibiting settlements that direct payments to a  nonvictim third party. Again, the misdirection of funds to irrelevant  third parties is a problem that we have seen grow and that must be  addressed.   Under the previous administration, the Department of Justice funneled  nonvictim third party groups as much as $880 million. The Department of  Justice did this by collecting money from parties who had broken the  law and then using that money to create a slush fund for special  interest groups rather than sending the money to victims of illicit  activity.   The Department of Justice allowed the ``donations'' required under  the settlements to count as double credit against defendants' payment  obligations. Let me say that again. The Department of Justice allowed  the ``donations'' required under the settlements to count as double  credit against defendants' payment obligations.   Interestingly, in some settlements under the previous administration,  credit for direct relief to consumers was counted only as dollar for  dollar, indicating the importance the Department of Justice places on  directing these funds to nonvictim third party groups.   The Department of Justice's policy move actually incentivized the  funneling of money to nonvictim groups rather than the people who were  injured. The slush fund scheme actually disadvantaged victims in favor  of special interests.                                time  1230    For example, the Department of Justice negotiated settlement  agreements to the tune of millions of dollars with major banks for  misleading investors over mortgage-backed securities.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        October 24, 2017, on page H8088, the following appeared:  Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Utah (Mr. Stewart) from the Second District. He is a  sponsor of the Judgment Fund Transparency Act.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen), from Georgia's 12th Congressional  District, to speak on these issues of Article I.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, there are many things that this body can do better. My  friend from Florida outlined his opinion of what those may be. He also  outlined his opinion of what will be a nice Georgia victory come  Saturday, this weekend, in Jacksonville. I do appreciate his  acknowledgement of what will be coming.   But I think there are also some other things that we need to discuss,  and we can talk about that. I will take, first off, the issue of the  Judiciary Committee on which I serve, which I believe, frankly, I have  the privilege of serving on what I believe are two of the hardest- working and longest-hour committees on this Hill, and that is the Rules  Committee and the Judiciary Committee. Chairman Goodlatte is very  thoughtful.   We can disagree, Mr. Speaker, and I can understand my friend's  frustration on issues of closed bills which do come and have been under  both parties, but today's bills are not one of those. These two bills  both have amendments that are offered on the floor by both parties.  There are Republican amendments and there are Democrat amendments. This  is not one of those.   So I think, from the perspective of how process and regular order-- and we can go through those--I would stand with my chairman and  Chairman Goodlatte on that issue that we are working toward, and it is  something that really matters here.   I think also, as we look at this, it is talking about grasping of  straws. One of the things is we can get sidelined many times on looking  at what could be or want to be and what we want to focus on. But also,  it is a matter--as I come down here in this role many times, let's  focus on the line right now, let's focus on the minute ahead, let's  focus on the next vote, and that is  [[Page H8094]]  talking about these bills in this process.   I thought it was interesting to say that these are solutions in  search of a problem. It is really interesting to me that, undoubtedly,  these solutions in search of a problem--I think the problem is when  they have, especially under sue and settle, $9.6 billion annual cost,  $500 million in the first year cost; Oil and Gas Rule, $738 million  annually; $632 million annually for the Florida Nutrient Standards and  Estuary Flowing Waters Rule; Boiler MACT, $3 billion. I mean, I could  go on. And $90 billion for reconsideration of 2008 ozone.    Let's make it very clear what sue and settle does. Sue and settle  does not take the power for an agency to enter into a consent decree.  Consent decrees are used often. The problem with this one is that when  you have two parties on the same page suing, in essence, what amounts  to one so that they can get a desired result without talking to the  others who were affected, that is just wrong.   It is like me taking another congressman, or you, Mr. Speaker, and  saying: You know, let's work out a deal.   But the reality is it is going to affect my friend from across the  aisle, but we are not going to tell him. We are simply going to say: We  are going to work our deal out. We are going to go to the Court. We are  going to get the Court to sign off on it and we are going to implement  everything that we have without proper insight and oversight.   That is all that we are asking for. It is called fairness. I am not  sure how you could be against that, unless you like the idea of writing  regulatory law in cubicles down the street instead of here on the floor  of the House.   The other issue I see here is this issue of slush funds. We have  talked about this, and the gentleman put 10 pages into the Record. He  can put 49 into the Record; he can put 550 into the Record of eligible  agencies for this money.   The problem is not eligible agencies. Number one, they are not  victims. Number two, they are not part of the suit, yet we are giving  it at sometimes double the rate to the offenders. Those that the  Justice Department said were doing wrong--let's get this clear. Like in  the housing issue--said you are doing wrong in this mortgage issue.   But what we are going to do, instead of giving the money at 1:1 back  to victims, we are going to give it at 2:1 if you go to our preferred  charity in donation form. It sounds like to me the only people who are  getting problematic here are the victims of it; and the others of these  pages of people who may or may not have political leanings or religious  leanings or anything else, they are the recipient of the lottery.   They said, ``We will go help these people; give us money,'' instead  of saying this is an issue that needs to be dealt with in a settlement  to the victims.   It also has been said that this is just giving money to help those in  those areas so that they can get back on their feet. But it also went  further than that. There were two instances in particular that I can  come up with: the Housing Council, which this body said we are not  funding any longer, yet the administration used these donations to  circumvent the appropriations process and fund it. That is not the role  of the executive branch. That is an article I role.   The electric vehicle subsidy, $2 billion, again, this body said no.  They said: No worries. We will go get a settlement. We will just take  the donations and we will fund something that Congress has already said  no on.   So it is easy to paint with broad strokes and say this is not  important, this does not matter. But for some of us it does matter.   Those stories--why people are so upset when they look at this town is  they just remember what their old civic books told them: that there was  a Congress, there was an executive branch, and there was a judicial  branch; each required all to do their part.   If we decide that it is too far down the road, let's bind the hands  of the executive branch. We will do whatever. This is nothing except  Congress saying this is what we are going to do. It is saying, this is  what matters for us. And we may call it cheap; we may call it little;  we may call it solutions in search of a problem, but you talk about the  businessowners and the industries and the States who had to pay out on  these sue and settle agreements.   When you talk about the millions--the billions that were sent to  Iran, I think there will be a lot of people, when you look at both  sides of this case, who will say: Yes, Congress, I want you to stop  this because this is the way it should be set up.   That is why these bills are on the floor today. That is why we are  taking them up. That is the reason we are bringing them forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the  underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 577 Offered by Mr. Hastings         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . . [and] has       no substantive legislative or policy implications       whatsoever.'' But that is not what they have always said.       Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative       Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th       edition, page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the       previous question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is       generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority       Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule  [[Page H8095]]       [a special rule reported from the Committee on Rules] opens       the resolution to amendment and further debate.'' (Chapter       21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: ``Upon rejection of       the motion for the previous question on a resolution reported       from the Committee on Rules, control shifts to the Member       leading the opposition to the previous question, who may       offer a proper amendment or motion and who controls the time       for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  during consideration of H.R. 469, pursuant to House Resolution 577, the  amendment I have placed at the desk be in order in lieu of the  amendment printed in part A of House Report 115-363 and numbered 2.
