 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material in the Record on this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, when I last had the honor to  host a Special Order, the House was debating the merits of tax reform,  and in that debate, supporters of the tax reform promised higher wages,  a stronger economy, greater opportunity, and shared prosperity.   Six months after President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act  into law, the results are in, and we can now confidently say that the  days of a weak and sluggish economy are behind us. America is again a  rising Nation. America is again a Nation where families are able to  keep more of what they  [[Page H4764]]  earn. America is growing and advancing to the economic prosperity that  our workers and our businesses well deserve.    But the American people don't need us to tell them that because they  are feeling the effects of tax reform every single day. Capital One,  Wells Fargo, Waste Management, JetBlue, Comcast, American Airlines,  Walmart, BB&T, and Nationwide Mutual Insurance are among the hundreds  of businesses, large and small, across this land that have given pay  raises and bonuses and 401(k) match increases to their hardworking  employees because of the historic tax reform that we were able to  achieve.   These bonuses are not going just to a lucky few, because the  statistics are in as well. More than 4 million Americans, and counting,  have already received tax reform bonuses. Thanks to tax reform, at  least 95 utilities have lowered their rates, and that means that some  87 million Americans not only have more money in their pockets, they  are paying lower electric bills and gas bills and water bills, and that  really matters.   Additionally, unemployment is down and confidence is up. We are  looking at 3.8 percent unemployment rate. It is the lowest it has been  in nearly 20 years, and 90 percent of Americans are experiencing a  higher take-home pay.   According to the Gallup Poll organization, nearly 7 in 10 Americans  believe now is a good time to find a quality job, and they were not  incorrect in that assumption. There are now more job openings in  America than there are Americans seeking jobs. America is back.   For years, the previous administration attempted to control the  American economy from Washington, but the results speak for themselves.  The free enterprise system inevitably outperforms central planning  because it places its confidence in the people instead of in the  government.   The economic principles put in place by this Congress have had an  immeasurable impact. It is continuing every day, and hardworking  Americans are enjoying more of the fruits of their labor, industry is  growing, and the Nation is becoming more confident as the economy  strengthens.   For the remainder of this hour, Mr. Speaker, a number of Members of  this Congress are going to address this same issue, and I would now  yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Speaker, I now yield to another  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Higgins) of the Third District.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, and I  yield to the gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. Jenkins).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  her expertise and testimony.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Crawford).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Womack).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Iowa (Mr. Young).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Kansas (Mr. Estes).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and all  my colleagues who have participated tonight in this Special Order.   I have spoken quite a bit, we all have, about the national benefits  of tax reform, because I think the wage increases and the job creation  and the business investment and the consumer confidence should not be  ignored, and I am so grateful that has been highlighted tonight. But I  also want to talk about what tax reform means to our folks back home in  Louisiana and in my Fourth Congressional District.   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce predicted that enacting the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act would lead to the creation of more than 13,000 jobs in  Louisiana and effectively give middle class families in our State a  raise of roughly $2,000. But I would like to highlight the benefits the  U.S. Chamber specifically predicted for my constituents in the 15  parishes, or counties as they are known everywhere else in the country,  in northwestern and west Louisiana. That is my district.   We have over 53,000 taxpayers in the Fourth District of Louisiana  that will be able to claim a larger child tax credit, just by one  example. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act increased the child tax credit from  $1,000 per child to $1,600 per child.   Nearly 50,000 taxpayers in the Fourth Congressional District derive  their income from small businesses, and we know the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act reduces taxes for small businessowners. Everyone ultimately will  benefit from that.   For small businessowners, tax reform implements a new, lower, 9  percent tax rate on the first $75,000 of net business income for owners  earning less than $150,000. Tax reform reduces taxes on small business  investment overall by creating a new 25 percent small business tax  rate.   Over 4,000 taxpayers that used to have to pay the alternative minimum  tax will no longer have to do that. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as we  know, eliminated the AMT.   Even the stress that comes from filing taxes is now going to be  reduced. What used to take many, many hours for most Americans has now  been reduced substantially.   The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act doubled the standard deduction, meaning  that many taxpayers will have much simpler returns to fill out now  every year and could potentially even file their returns on a document  the size of a postcard. Yes, it is true.   And 6 months after enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the good  news just keeps coming in. We can scarcely keep up with all the happy  headlines that have come out of this. That is exactly what we hoped,  exactly what we predicted, and it is all coming to pass.   But rather than just talking about the sum of the benefits, I would  like to talk about a specific success story, because when we relate  this to real people and what it means to real, average, everyday,  hardworking Americans, that is where we understand the real benefit.   I want to talk about the success story of Canal Coffee shops, owned  and operated by Bossier City native Rodrick James.   Starting in 2016, Mr. James and Priscilla Mayfield opened their  anchor store in downtown Kinder, Louisiana, and quickly saw success in  the coffee shop and light lunch business model.   Remarkably, Mr. James built his business from the ground up without  taking a small business loan.   He expanded his business to include shops in Oberlin and Shreveport,  Louisiana. And now with the implementation of pro-growth policies, Mr.  James has announced that he plans to open a fourth and then a fifth  store in the very near future.   The self-described entrepreneur is anxious to make a difference, and  he said: ``The latest tax reform bill will definitely be good for me. I  am growing''--my business is growing--``and  [[Page H4768]]  this tax relief will help me continue that growth.''   He continued: ``I pay my employees well already, but there is a lot I  can do to grow faster with the extra money.''   See, our district is full of small businessowners like Rodrick James.  They are working long hours. They are sacrificing. They are playing by  the rules. They are giving their all to achieve their own version of  the American Dream.   In fact, that is how we define the American Dream. If you are willing  to sacrifice, you are willing to work hard, you are willing to play by  the rules, you ought to be able to make a better life for yourself and  your family, for your children that come after you, and now we are  enabling that again.   This Congress has delivered a fairer, simpler Tax Code that has  allowed small businessowners, just like Rodrick, to keep more of their  hard-earned dollars and reinvest in their employees, businesses, and  community.   Mr. James served our Nation in the U.S. Army for 8 years before  becoming a businessowner, and now he strives to remain community- focused. He has donated over $7,000 to students in our area, and as his  business continues to grow, we are certain he is going to continue to  sow those good seeds back into the community.   His story is truly inspiring. It embodies the essence of what it  means to be an American. I am proud to represent him and his business  right here in this Congress.   All around the Fourth District, throughout Louisiana, and every  corner of our great Nation, you can find remarkable people who share  Mr. James' experience. Their dreams, that they work hard every day to  achieve, can become even bigger with tax reform. This is a big thing  for the country.    As my colleagues have said and reiterated here tonight, Mr. Speaker,  America is back, and we are humbled to have been a part of it.   I am grateful to all my colleagues who participated in this Special  Order this evening. For all the reasons we have articulated, we just  want to highlight, once again, that this is an important and proud  moment for our Nation, and we are all truly grateful to have been a  part of this history.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
