 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the en bloc group  of amendments including mine, bipartisan amendment No. 318, to increase  funding for the Indian Community Development Block Grant.   This is about creating jobs and addressing housing needs in Indian  Country.   For far too long, native communities have experienced poverty and  overcrowded, dilapidated housing at a rate much higher than the rest of  the Nation.   My bipartisan amendment would help Tribes address these longstanding  challenges by increasing funding for the Indian Community Development  Block Grant by $5 million.   Boosting funding for this program is a small yet meaningful step to  improve housing and economic opportunities in Indian Country.   But we can't stop there. We must continue our work to improve housing  in native communities.   I thank Representatives Young, Haaland, Moore, Gabbard, and Huffman  for cosponsoring this amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I urge its adoption.
