 Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment, which  is included in this en bloc package.   My amendment would protect the Office of the Special Envoy to monitor  and combat anti-Semitism and ensure its continued operation.   Anti-Semitism not only still exists today, but it is on the rise in  many places around the world. Just last month, a motorist in France  yelled, ``Kill the Jew,'' as he advanced with a knife toward a Jewish  male who was wearing a Star of David necklace.   Keeping this office intact, appointing a special envoy, and providing  adequate staff is incredibly important as we continue to fight anti- Semitism around the world.   I would like to thank my colleagues for including my amendment in the  en bloc package, and I ask them all to join me in voting for it.
