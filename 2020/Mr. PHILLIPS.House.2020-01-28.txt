 Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5338) to authorize the Secretary of State to pursue public- private partnerships, innovative financing mechanisms, research  partnerships, and coordination with international and multilateral  organizations to address childhood cancer globally, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5338         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Global Hope Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Approximately 300,000 children aged 0 to 19 years old       are diagnosed with cancer each year.        (2) The most common categories of childhood cancers include       leukemia, brain cancer, lymphoma, and solid tumors, such as       neuroblastoma and Wilms tumor.        (3) Most childhood cancers can be cured with generic       medicines and can be cost-effective for all income levels.        (4) In the United States, the survival rate for children       diagnosed with cancer is over 80 percent. In many developing       countries, the mortality rate of children diagnosed with       cancer is around 80 percent. In some parts of Africa, the       mortality rate reaches 90 percent.        (5) In September 2018, the World Health Organization       announced a new effort--the Global Initiative for Childhood       Cancer--with the aim of reaching at least a 60-percent       survival rate for children with cancer by 2030, thereby       saving an additional 1,000,000 lives.       SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress as follows:        (1) The work of the United States on infectious disease       remains the core tenet of United States work on global       health.        (2) As the United States and international partners       continue to succeed in lowering incidences of infectious       diseases, global mortality rates of non-communicable diseases       will become an increasing burden that must be addressed.        (3) The United States should work to support the goals of       the World Health Organization Initiative for Childhood       Cancer, helping increase survival rates for children with       cancer.       SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.         The United States shall seek to--        (1) increase political commitment for childhood cancer       diagnosis, treatment, and care globally;        (2) support efforts to increase the survival rate of       children with cancer globally;        (3) support efforts to train medical personnel and develop       the capabilities of other existing healthcare infrastructure       to diagnose, treat, and care for childhood cancer;        (4) improve access to affordable and essential medicines       and technologies that treat childhood cancer;        (5) elevate and prioritize efforts to reduce the mortality       rate of childhood cancer in international organizations such       as the United Nations;        (6) pursue research and research partnerships with       international institutions to identify low-cost interventions       and best practices to diagnose, treat, and care for childhood       cancer in the United States and globally; and        (7) improve partnerships with international health       ministries and pharmaceutical companies to facilitate efforts       for broader, global clinical trials for medicines to treat or       care for childhood cancer in the United States and globally.       SEC. 5. AUTHORIZATION.         The Secretary of State, in coordination with the heads of       relevant Federal departments and agencies, is authorized and       encouraged to--        (1) pursue public-private partnerships, other research       partnerships, and innovative financing mechanisms to address       childhood cancer globally; and        (2) coordinate with appropriate agencies of the United       Nations and other relevant multilateral organizations to       address childhood cancer globally.       SEC. 6. REPORT.         Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to the       Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives       and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a report       that includes the following:        (1) An assessment of opportunities for United States       engagement in global efforts to increase the worldwide       survival rate of children with cancer.        (2) An assessment of efforts taken by the United States to       support efforts to increase the worldwide survival rate of       children with cancer.        (3) An assessment of existing programs funded by the United       States that could be expanded to support efforts to increase       the worldwide survival rate of children with cancer.        (4) An assessment of how such increased international       engagement could positively affect--        (A) survival rates of individuals with childhood cancer in       the United States; and  [[Page H589]]         (B) reductions in the rates of infant and pediatric       morbidity and mortality.       SEC. 7. COST LIMITATION.         No additional funds are authorized to be appropriated to       carry out the provisions of this Act.       SEC. 8. CHILDHOOD CANCER DEFINED.         In this Act, the term ``childhood cancer'' means cancers       formed or diagnosed in individuals under the age of 20.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 5338.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, the measure before us is a wonderful bipartisan bill  written by Ranking Member McCaul and supported by Chairman Engel.   Every year, more than 300,000 children from all around the world are  diagnosed with childhood cancer, and their lives are instantly turned  upside down.   Among them is my very own daughter, Pia, who was diagnosed with  Hodgkin's lymphoma when she was 14 years old. While she has since been  cured and is among the very lucky ones, as a father, I know all too  well the horror that devastates way too many families around the world  every single day.   The Global Hope Act works to leverage the resources developed in the  United States to explore public-private partnerships in the fight  against childhood cancer all around the globe.   It calls on the Secretary of State to coordinate these activities  across the executive branch on this very important initiative and to  submit a report assessing current efforts and future opportunities to  end such heart-wrenching suffering.   This is a good and very commonsense bill to expand the global fight  against childhood cancer. I commend the ranking member for his  outstanding work on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to join me in  supporting it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Speier), my friend and co-chair of the Childhood  Cancer Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume for the purpose of closing.   Madam Speaker, childhood cancer is devastating; yet, many types can  now be treated effectively and at relatively low cost. It is incumbent  on all of us to make sure the United States' policy is working toward  this end and doing what we can to stop the suffering.   The Global Hope Act is a good measure that leverages the resources  developed here in the United States to explore public/private  partnerships to fight childhood cancer all around the globe.   I am very grateful to Ranking Member McCaul for his dedication and  tireless work on this cause.   I am proud to support this, and I urge all my fellow Members to do  the same.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to  the resolution (H. Res. 752) supporting the rights of the people of  Iran to free expression, condemning the Iranian regime for its  crackdown on legitimate protests, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.   The text of the resolution is as follows:                                H. Res. 752         Whereas, on November 15, 2019, popular protests against the       Iranian regime began and rapidly spread to at least 100       cities throughout the country, in the most significant       antigovernment protests in Iran since June 2009;        Whereas the protests began in response to an announced       increase on the price of fuel and protesters have expressed       numerous economic grievances, while also calling for the       structural reform of the political system and condemning       current and former Iranian leaders;        Whereas reports indicate that Iranian security forces have       used lethal force in arresting more than 7,000 people and       killed hundreds of people in connection with the protests;        Whereas reports indicate that Iranian Government       authorities have, in many instances, refused to return       victims' bodies to their families and that security forces       have removed bodies from morgues and transferred them to       unknown locations;        Whereas, on November 16, 2019, Iranian authorities began       implementing a near-total shutdown of internet services,       stopping nearly all means of online communications for people       inside Iran, to preclude the sharing of images and videos of       deadly violence being used by security forces;        Whereas section 103(b)(2)(B) of the Comprehensive Iran       Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (22       U.S.C. 8512(b)(2)(B)) authorizes licensing services relating       to personal communications over the Internet, to improve the       ability of the Iranian people to speak freely;        Whereas General License D-1 authorizes the provision of key       communication tools to the Iranian people with the aim of       ensuring that the Iranian people can freely access the       internet;        Whereas, on November 16, 2019, Iran's Interior Minister       Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli said that the Iranian regime will no       longer show ``tolerance'' and ``self-control'' toward the       protesters;        Whereas, on November 17, 2019, Iranian Supreme Leader       Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called the demonstrators ``villains''       galvanized by foreign enemies and domestic insurgents and       ordered Iranian security services to ``implement their       duties'' to end the protests;        Whereas, on November 18, 2019, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary       Guard Corps deployed to the city of Mahshahr and engaged in       mass repression, reportedly killing as many as 100 people;        Whereas several laws provide authorities to designate and       sanction elements of the Iranian regime involved in       significant corruption or serious human rights abuses,       including the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability,       and Divestment Act of 2010, the Countering America's       Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, and the Iran Threat       Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012;  [[Page H591]]         Whereas the Iranian regime was implicated in a March 2018       plot in Albania and June 2018 plot in France against Iranian       opposition activists;        Whereas Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its       Basij militia have been sanctioned by the United States for       planning and carrying out serious human rights abuses against       the Iranian people, including for the cruel and prolonged       torture of political dissidents;        Whereas in August 2018 the United States criminally charged       two persons for acting as illegal agents of the Government of       Iran for having conducted surveillance on Jewish and Israeli       facilities and Iranian political dissidents;        Whereas the regime has routinely violated the human rights       of Iranian citizens, including by implementing ongoing,       systematic, and serious restrictions of freedom of peaceful       assembly and association and freedom of opinion and       expression, including the continuing closures of media       outlets, arrests of journalists, and the censorship of       expression in online forums such as blogs and websites;        Whereas the Department of State's 2018 Human Rights Report       on Iran noted ``severe restrictions on free expression, the       press, and the internet, including censorship, site blocking,       and criminalization of libel; substantial interference with       the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of association,       such as overly restrictive nongovernmental organization (NGO)       laws; egregious restrictions of religious freedom;       restrictions on political participation; widespread       corruption at all levels of government'';        Whereas, on November 18, 2019, Secretary of State Mike       Pompeo stated that, ``The United States is monitoring the       ongoing protests in Iran closely. We condemn strongly any       acts of violence committed by this regime against the Iranian       people and are deeply concerned by reports of several       fatalities. . .The Islamic Republic must cease violence       against its own people and should immediately restore the       ability of all Iranians to access a free and open       Internet.'';        Whereas, on November 22, 2019, the United States imposed       sanctions on Iran's Minister of Information and       Communications Technology for his role in shutting down       internet access in Iran;        Whereas, on November 18, 2019, the Office of the German       Chancellor stated that, ``It is legitimate and deserving of       our respect when people courageously air their economic and       political grievances, as is currently happening in Iran. The       Iranian government should respond to the current protests       with a willingness to engage in dialogue. . .We urge the       government in Tehran to respect freedom of assembly and       expression.'';        Whereas, on November 20, 2019, the French Foreign Ministry       stated that, ``France is following the demonstrations taking       place in Iran with concern. It expresses its deep concern at       reports that a large number of demonstrators have been killed       in the last few days. It reaffirms its attachment to respect       for the freedom of expression and to access to means of       communication, as well as to the right to demonstrate       peacefully. France calls on Iran to comply with its       international human rights obligations, in particular the       International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.'';        Whereas, on November 21, 2019, the European Union stated       that, ``The protests in several Iranian cities over the past       days have, according to reports, led to serious loss of life       and left many people injured. We convey our condolences to       the families of victims and wish a speedy recovery to those       injured. Socio-economic challenges should be addressed       through inclusive dialogue and not through the use of       violence. We expect Iran's security forces to exercise       maximum restraint in handling the protests and for protestors       to demonstrate peacefully. Any violence is unacceptable. The       rights to freedom of expression and assembly must be       guaranteed. We also expect the Iranian authorities to ensure       the free flow of information and access to the internet.'';        Whereas, on November 26, 2019, Secretary of State Michael       Pompeo stated, ``The Iranian people are once again on the       streets because of the regime's poor economic management. And       instead of addressing their grievances, Tehran has responded       with violence and blaming those outside of the country.'';        Whereas, on December 8, 2019, the High Representative of       the European Union Josep Borrell Fontelles stated that, ``A       growing body of evidence indicates that despite repeated       calls for restraint, the Iranian security forces'       disproportionate response to recent demonstrations has led to       high numbers of deaths and injuries. For the European Union       and its Member States, the widespread and disproportionate       use of force against nonviolent protestors is       unacceptable.'';        Whereas, on December 8, 2019, the High Representative of       the European Union Josep Borrell Fontelles stated that ``A       growing body of evidence indicates that despite repeated       calls for restraint, the Iranian security forces'       disproportionate response to recent demonstrations has led to       high numbers of deaths and injuries. For the European Union       and its Member States, the widespread and disproportionate       use of force against nonviolent protestors is       unacceptable.'';        Whereas Iran is a member of the United Nations, voted for       the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and is a signatory       to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,       among other international human rights treaties;        Whereas in violation of these and other international       obligations, Iranian regime officials continue to violate the       fundamental human rights of the Iranian people;        Whereas the Iranian regime has a long history of violent       repression of dissent, including--        (1) in 1988, the Iranian regime carrying out the barbaric       mass executions of thousands of political prisoners by       hanging and firing squad for refusing to renounce their       political affiliations and in some cases for possessing       political reading material, including prisoners of       conscience, teenagers, and pregnant women;        (2) in 1999, the Iranian regime brutally suppressing a       student revolt that was one of the largest mass uprisings up       until that point in the country since 1979;        (3) following voting irregularities that resulted in the       2009 election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, the Iranian       regime brutally suppressing peaceful political dissent from       wide segments of civil society during the Green Revolution in       a cynical attempt to retain its undemocratic grip on power;       and        (4) beginning in December 2017, and continuing for several       months after protests erupted in more than 80 cities, the       Iranian regime suppressing such protests with repressive       force that resulted in at least 25 deaths and 4,000 arrests;        Whereas, on January 9, 2018, the House of Representatives       overwhelmingly passed H. Res. 676, a resolution supporting       the rights of the people of Iran to free expression and       condemning the Iranian regime for its crackdown on legitimate       protests;        Whereas, on December 5, 2019, the Department of State       identified the Great Tehran Penitentiary (Fashafuyeh) and       Qarchack Prison as entities responsible for gross violations       of internationally recognized human rights in Iran and       subject to the imposition of sanctions under section 106 of       the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act       (22 U.S.C. 9405);        Whereas, on January 8, 2020, the Iranian military shot down       a civilian airliner Ukrainian Airlines Flight 752 in a       surface-to-air missile strike, killing 176 civilians aboard;        Whereas for three days, the Iranian military denied that it       shot down Ukrainian Airlines Flight 752 before admitting       responsibility on January 11, 2020;        Whereas peaceful protestors amassed throughout Iran on       January 11, 2020, and subsequent days, decrying the       Government of Iran's downing of the Ukrainian airliner,       subsequent campaign of lies and obfuscation, and continued       undemocratic practices; and        Whereas in response to peaceful protests throughout early       January 2020, Iranian Government forces fired live rounds and       used brutal tactics against civilians in a manner well-      documented by international human rights organizations,       media, and scores of Iranians: Now, therefore, be it        Resolved, That the House of Representatives--        (1) stands with the people of Iran that are engaged in       legitimate and peaceful protests against an oppressive,       corrupt regime;        (2) condemns the Iranian regime's serious human rights       abuses against the Iranian people, significant corruption,       and destabilizing activities abroad;        (3) commends the statements of support for the protesters       from the executive branch and key allies;        (4) calls on all democratic governments and institutions to       clearly support the Iranian people's right to live in a free       society;        (5) demands that the Iranian regime abide by its       international obligations with respect to human rights and       civil liberties, including freedoms of assembly, speech, and       press;        (6) urges the Administration to work to convene emergency       sessions of the United Nations Security Council and the       United Nations Human Rights Council to condemn the ongoing       human rights violations perpetrated by the Iranian regime and       establish a mechanism by which the Security Council can       monitor such violations;        (7) encourages the Administration to provide assistance to       the Iranian people to have free and uninterrupted access to       the internet, including by broadening General License D-1;        (8) calls on companies to reject requests by the regime to       cut off the Iranian people from social media and other       communications platforms;        (9) respects the proud history and rich culture of the       Iranian nation and fully supports efforts by the people of       Iran to promote the establishment of basic freedoms that       build the foundation for the emergence of a freely elected,       open, and democratic political system;        (10) supports the right of Iranian dissidents to assemble,       without fear of persecution and violence, whether in Iran or       internationally; and        (11) urges the President and the Secretary of State to work       with the international community to ensure that violations of       human rights are part of all formal and informal multilateral       or bilateral discussions with and regarding Iran.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 752.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, since November, Iranian protesters have flooded the  streets, demonstrating against corruption, high fuel, and high food  prices. Protests flared up in recent weeks after the government of Iran  took responsibility for downing a Ukrainian airliner after, of course,  initially denying it.   Peaceful protesters have been met with violence and brutality from  the Iranian regime. Over 1,500 people have been killed, and thousands  more injured.   For decades, this has been the horrifying standard practice of the  regime, heinous human rights abuses and significant corruption, even  targeting Iranian dissidents abroad.   We must send a clear message now to the protesters that we stand with  them. Today's resolution shows that solidarity; that we stand for the  rights of the Iranian people to free expression, and we condemn the  regime for its crimes.   Today, we urge the President and the Secretary of State to work with  the international community to ensure that violations of human rights  are part of all formal and informal, multilateral or bilateral  discussions with and regarding Iran.   Sending a strong message of support is important, but the United  States must do more to help the Iranian protesters. The administration  should help the Iranian people access free and uninterrupted internet,  including broadening General License D-1, the Treasury Department's  license of personal communication devices and software that helps  Iranians access the free flow of information.   The administration should also welcome, not deny, Iranian visitors to  the United States, because giving Iranians an opportunity to experience  our great country for themselves is the best way to counter anti- American sentiment and fear.   There is much that we can do to help the protesters, and we must  start today with this resolution. I urge all my colleagues to join me  in passing this great measure.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Deutch), the author of this important resolution, and the  chairman of the Subcommittee on the Middle East, North Africa, and  International Terrorism.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ruiz), my friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume for the purpose of closing.   Madam Speaker, Iranian people want the same thing that Americans  want: peace, opportunity, and security. It is critical that we now  support the peaceful protestors in Iran today.   Today's resolution shows that we stand in solidarity with the Iranian  people in their struggle against the cruelty of their regime, and I  hope all Members will join me in supporting this important measure.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4331) to modify and reauthorize the Tibetan Policy Act of  2002, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4331         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(d) Religious Persecution in Tibet.--Section 620(b) of such       Act (22 U.S.C. 6901 note) is amended by adding at the end       before the period the following: ``, including with respect  [[Page H595]]       to the reincarnation system of Tibetan Buddhism''.        (e) United States Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues.--      Section 621 of such Act (22 U.S.C. 6901 note) is amended--        (1) in subsection (c) to read as follows:        ``(c) Objectives.--The objectives of the Special       Coordinator are to--        ``(1) promote substantive dialogue without preconditions       between the Government of the People's Republic of China and       the Dalai Lama or his representatives or democratically-      elected leaders of the Tibetan community leading to a       negotiated agreement on Tibet and coordinate with other       governments in multilateral efforts toward this goal;        ``(2) encourage the Government of the People's Republic of       China to address the aspirations of the Tibetan people with       regard to their distinct historical, cultural, religious, and       linguistic identity;        ``(3) promote the human rights of the Tibetan people;        ``(4) promote activities to preserve environment and water       resources of the Tibetan plateau;        ``(5) encourage sustainable development in accordance with       section 616(d), cultural and historical preservation, health       care, education, and environmental sustainability projects       for Tibetan communities in Tibet; and        ``(6) promote access to Tibet in accordance with the       Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-      330).'';        (2) in subsection (d)--        (A) in paragraph (5), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (B) by redesignating paragraph (6) as paragraph (8); and        (C) by inserting after paragraph (5) the following:        ``(6) provide concurrence with respect to all projects       carried out pursuant to assistance provided under section       616(e);        ``(7) seek to establish international diplomatic coalitions       to--        ``(A) oppose any effort by the Government of the People's       Republic of China to select, educate, and venerate Tibetan       Buddhist religious leaders in a manner inconsistent with       Tibetan Buddhism in which the succession or identification of       Tibetan Buddhist lamas, including the Dalai Lama, should       occur without interference, in a manner consistent with       Tibetan Buddhists' beliefs; and        ``(B) ensure that the identification and installation of       Tibetan Buddhist religious leaders, including any future       Dalai Lama, is determined solely within the Tibetan Buddhist       faith community, in accordance with the universally-      recognized right to religious freedom; and''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(e) Personnel.--The Secretary shall ensure that the       Office of the Special Coordinator is adequately staffed at       all times to assist in the management of the responsibilities       of this section.''.       SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY REGARDING THE SUCCESSION OR                     REINCARNATION OF THE DALAI LAMA.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) Notwithstanding that Tibetan Buddhism is practiced in       many countries including Bhutan, India, Mongolia, Nepal, the       People's Republic of China, the Russian Federation, and the       United States, the Government of the People's Republic of       China has repeatedly insisted on its role in managing the       selection of Tibet's next spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama,       through actions such as those described in the ``Measures on       the Management of the Reincarnation of Living Buddhas'' in       2007.        (2) On March 19, 2019, Chinese Ministry of Affairs       spokesperson reiterated that the ``reincarnation of living       Buddhas including the Dalai Lama must comply with Chinese       laws and regulations and follow religious rituals and       historical conventions''.        (3) The Government of the People's Republic of China has       interfered in the process of recognizing a successor or       reincarnation of Tibetan Buddhist leaders, including in 1995       by arbitrarily detaining Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, a 6-year old       boy who was identified as the 11th Panchen Lama, and       purporting to install its own candidate as the Panchen Lama.        (4) The 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, issued a statement       on September 24, 2011, explaining the traditions and       spiritual precepts of the selection of Dalai Lamas, setting       forth his views on the considerations and process for       selecting his successor, and providing a response to the       Chinese government's claims that only the Chinese government       has the ultimate authority in the selection process of the       Dalai Lama.        (5) The 14th Dalai Lama said in his statement that the       person who reincarnates has sole legitimate authority over       where and how he or she takes rebirth and how that       reincarnation is to be recognized and if there is a need for       a 15th Dalai Lama to be recognized, then the responsibility       shall primarily rest with the officers of the Dalai Lama's       Gaden Phodrang Trust, who will be informed by the written       instructions of the 14th Dalai Lama.        (6) Since 2011, the 14th Dalai Lama has reiterated publicly       on numerous occasions that decisions on the successions,       emanations, or reincarnations of the Dalai Lama belongs to       the Tibetan Buddhist faith community alone.        (7) On June 8, 2015, the United States House of       Representatives unanimously approved House Resolution 337       which calls on the United States Government to ``underscore       that government interference in the Tibetan reincarnation       process is a violation of the internationally recognized       right to religious freedom . . . and to highlight the fact       that other countries besides China have long Tibetan Buddhist       traditions and that matters related to reincarnations in       Tibetan Buddhism are of keen interest to Tibetan Buddhist       populations worldwide''.        (8) On April 25, 2018, the United States Senate unanimously       approved Senate Resolution 429 which ``expresses its sense       that the identification and installation of Tibetan Buddhist       religious leaders, including a future 15th Dalai Lama, is a       matter that should be determined solely within the Tibetan       Buddhist faith community, in accordance with the inalienable       right to religious freedom''.        (9) The Department of State's Report on International       Religious Freedom for 2018 reported on policies and efforts       of the Government of the People's Republic of China to exert       control over the selection of Tibetan Buddhist religious       leaders, including reincarnate lamas, and stated that ``U.S.       officials underscored that decisions on the reincarnation of       the Dalai Lama should be made solely by faith leaders.''.        (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United       States that--        (1) decisions regarding the selection, education, and       veneration of Tibetan Buddhist religious leaders are       exclusively spiritual matters that should be made by the       appropriate religious authorities within the Tibetan Buddhist       tradition and in the context of the will of practitioners of       Tibetan Buddhism;        (2) the wishes of the 14th Dalai Lama, including any       written instructions, should play a determinative role in the       selection, education, and veneration of a future 15th Dalai       Lama; and        (3) interference by the Government of the People's Republic       of China or any other government in the process of       recognizing a successor or reincarnation of the 14th Dalai       Lama and any future Dalai Lamas would represent a clear       violation of the fundamental religious freedoms of Tibetan       Buddhists and the Tibetan people.        (c) Holding Chinese Officials Responsible for Religious       Freedom Abuses Targeting Tibetan Buddhists.--It is the policy       of the United States to consider senior officials of the       Government of the People's Republic of China who are       responsible for, complicit in, or have directly or indirectly       engaged in the identification or installation of a candidate       chosen by China as the future 15th Dalai Lama of Tibetan       Buddhism to have committed--        (1) a gross violation of internationally recognized human       rights for purposes of imposing sanctions with respect to       such officials under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights       Accountability Act (22 U.S.C. 2656 note); and        (2) a particularly severe violation of religious freedom       for purposes of applying section 212(a)(2)(G) of the       Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(2)(G)) with       respect to such officials.        (d) Department of State Programming To Promote Religious       Freedom for Tibetan Buddhists.--Consistent with section 401       of the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act       (Public Law 114-281; 130 Stat. 1436), of the funds available       to the Department of State for international religious       freedom programs, the Ambassador-at-Large for International       Religious Freedom should support efforts to protect and       promote international religious freedom in China and for       programs to protect Tibetan Buddhism in China and elsewhere.       SEC. 4. POLICY REGARDING THE ENVIRONMENT AND WATER RESOURCES                     ON THE TIBETAN PLATEAU.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) The Tibetan Plateau contains glaciers, rivers,       grasslands, and other geographical and ecological features       that are crucial for supporting vegetation growth and       biodiversity, regulating water flow and supply for an       estimated 1.8 billion people. Global warming threatens the       glaciers in Tibet that feed the major rivers of South and       East Asia, which supply freshwater to an estimated 1.8       billion people.        (2) Rising global temperatures--especially in the Tibetan       Plateau where the average temperature has increased at twice       the global average--will result in variable water flows in       the future.        (3) The construction in Tibet of large hydroelectric power       dams intended to be used in part to transmit power to Chinese       provinces outside of Tibet, as well as other infrastructure       projects, including the Sichuan-Tibet railroad, may also lead       to the resettlement of thousands of Tibetans and transform       the environment.        (4) The grasslands of Tibet play a significant role in       carbon production and sequestration and Tibet's rivers       support wetlands that play a key role in water storage, water       quality, and the regulation of water flow, support       biodiversity, foster vegetation growth, and act as carbon       sinks.        (5) Rising temperatures and intensifying evaporation, can       affect the water supply, cause desertification, and       destabilize infrastructure on the Tibetan Plateau and beyond.        (6) Traditional Tibetan grassland stewardship practices,       which can be key to mitigating the negative effects of       warming on the Tibetan Plateau, are undermined by the  [[Page H596]]       resettlement of nomads from Tibetan grasslands.        (7) The People's Republic of China has approximately 20       percent of the world's population but only around 7 percent       of the world's water supply, while many countries in South       and Southeast Asia rely on the rivers flowing from the       Himalayas of the Tibetan Plateau.        (8) The People's Republic of China has already completed       water transfer programs diverting billions of cubic meters of       water yearly and has plans to divert more waters from the       Tibetan plateau in China.        (b) Water Resources in Tibet and the Tibetan Watershed.--      The Secretary of State, in coordination with relevant       agencies of the United States Government, should--        (1) pursue collaborative efforts with Chinese and       international scientific institutions, as appropriate, to       monitor the environment on the Tibetan Plateau, including       glacial retreat, temperature rise, and carbon levels, in       order to promote a greater understanding of the effects on       permafrost, river flows, grasslands and desertification, and       the monsoon cycle;        (2) engage with the Government of the People's Republic of       China, the Tibetan people, and nongovernmental organizations       to encourage the participation of Tibetan nomads and other       Tibetan stakeholders in the development and implementation of       grassland management policies, in order to utilize their       indigenous experience in mitigation and stewardship of the       land and to assess policies on the forced resettlement of       nomads; and        (3) encourage a regional framework on water security, or       use existing frameworks, such as the Lower Mekong Initiative,       to facilitate cooperative agreements among all riparian       nations that would promote transparency, sharing of       information, pollution regulation, and arrangements on       impounding and diversion of waters that originate on the       Tibetan Plateau.       SEC. 5. DEMOCRACY IN THE TIBETAN EXILE COMMUNITY.         (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:        (1) The 14th Dalai Lama advocates the Middle Way Approach,       which seeks genuine autonomy for the six million Tibetans in       Tibet.        (2) The 14th Dalai Lama has overseen a process of       democratization within the Tibetan polity, beginning in Tibet       in the 1950s and continuing in exile from the 1960s to the       present and to address the needs of the Tibetan people until       such time as genuine autonomy in Tibet is realized, the 14th       Dalai Lama devolved his political responsibilities to the       elected representatives of the Tibetan people in exile in       2011.        (3) In 2011 and again in 2016, members of the Tibetan exile       community across some 30 countries held elections to select       political leaders to serve in the Central Tibetan       Administration parliament and as chief executive, elections       which were monitored by international observers and assessed       to be free and fair.        (4) The Dalai Lama has said that the Central Tibetan       Administration will cease to exist once a negotiated       settlement has been achieved that allows Tibetans to freely       enjoy their culture, religion and language in Tibet.        (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) Tibetan exile communities around the world should be       commended for the adoption of a system of self-governance       with democratic institutions to choose their leaders;        (2) the Dalai Lama should be commended for his decision to       devolve political authority to elected leaders in accordance       with democratic principles; and        (3) as consistent with section 621(d)(3) of the Tibetan       Policy Act of 2002 (22 U.S.C. 6901 note), the United States       Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues should continue to       maintain close contact with the religious, cultural, and       political leaders of the Tibetan people.       SEC. 6. SUSTAINABILITY IN TIBETAN COMMUNITIES SEEKING TO                     PRESERVE THEIR CULTURE, RELIGION, AND LANGUAGE.         The Secretary of State should urge the Government of Nepal       to honor the Gentleman's Agreement with the United Nations       High Commissioner for Refugees and to provide legal       documentation to long-staying Tibetan residents in Nepal who       fled a credible threat of persecution in Tibet in order to       allow them to more fully participate in the economy and       society of Nepal.       SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.         (a) Office of the United States Special Coordinator for       Tibetan Issues.--There is authorized to be appropriated       $1,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2021 through 2025 for       the Office of the United States Special Coordinator for       Tibetan Issues.        (b) Tibetan Scholarship Program and Ngawang Choephel       Exchange Programs.--        (1) Tibetan scholarship program.--There is authorized to be       appropriated $675,000 for each of the fiscal years 2021       through 2025 to carry out the Tibetan scholarship program       established under section 103(b)(1) of the Human Rights,       Refugee, and Other Foreign Relations Provisions Act of 1996       (Public Law 104-319; 22 U.S.C. 2151 note).        (2) Ngawang choephel exchange programs.--There is       authorized to be appropriated $575,000 for each of the fiscal       years 2021 through 2025 to carry out the ``Ngwang Choepel       Exchange Programs'' (formerly known as ``programs of       educational and cultural exchange between the United States       and the people of Tibet'') under section 103(a) of the Human       Rights, Refugee, and Other Foreign Relations Provisions Act       of 1996.        (c) Humanitarian Assistance and Support to Tibetan Refugees       in South Asia.--Amounts authorized to be appropriated to       carry out chapter 9 of part I of the Foreign Assistance Act       of 1961 and the Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1962       for each of the fiscal years 2021 through 2025 are authorized       to be made available for humanitarian assistance, including       food, medicine, clothing, and medical and vocational       training, for Tibetan refugees in South Asia who have fled       facing a credible threat of persecution in the People's       Republic of China.        (d) Tibetan Autonomous Region and Tibetan Communities in       China.--There is authorized to be appropriated $8,000,000 for       each year of the fiscal years 2021 through 2025 under chapter       4 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C.       2346 et seq.) to support activities which preserve cultural       traditions and promote sustainable development, education,       and environmental conservation in Tibetan communities in the       Tibet Autonomous Region and in other Tibetan communities in       China.        (e) Assistance for Tibetans in India and Nepal.--There is       authorized to be appropriated $6,000,000 for each of the       fiscal years 2021 through 2025 under part I of the Foreign       Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.) for programs       to promote and preserve Tibetan culture and language       development, and the resilience of Tibetan communities in       India and Nepal, and to assist in the education and       development of the next generation of Tibetan leaders from       such communities.        (f) Tibetan Governance.--There is authorized to be       appropriated $3,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2021       through 2025 for programs to strengthen the capacity of       Tibetan institutions and strengthen democracy, governance,       information and international outreach, and research.        (g) Voice of America and Radio Free Asia.--        (1) Voice of america.--There is authorized to be       appropriated $3,344,000 for each of the fiscal years 2021       through 2025 to Voice of America for broadcasts described in       paragraph (3).

(3) Broadcasts described.--Broadcasts described in this       paragraph are broadcasts to provide uncensored news and       information in the Tibetan language to Tibetans, including       Tibetans in Tibet.       SEC. 8. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on H.R. 4331.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman McGovern, along with Mr. Smith, Mr.  Suozzi, and Mr. Meadows, for authoring this very important bill to  update U.S. policies that support the preservation of Tibetan culture  and faith as well as the environment of the Tibetan Plateau, which is  vital not just to the Tibetan people, but also to the Himalayan  ecosystem.   I also thank Speaker Pelosi, who has been a tireless champion of the  Tibetan people for many years. She has a long history of shining a  spotlight on human rights abuses in China and has ensured that this  Chamber does its part to defend our values.   The Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2019 updates existing  legislation from 2002 to make sure our policies keep pace with the  challenges facing Tibet today. This legislation comes at a very  critical time for the Tibetan people as they seek to preserve their  cultural and religious identity.   The Chinese Government has repeatedly asserted that it has a role to  play in the selection of the next Dalai  [[Page H597]]  Lama. This is analogous to the Government of Italy announcing that it  can ignore Catholic tradition and unilaterally decide who the next Pope  should be. Such disregard for the Tibetan faith is an undue violation  of international religious freedoms.   This bill sends a very clear message to Chinese officials that, if  they interfere in the selection process for a future Dalai Lama or  other Tibetan Buddhist leader, they can be sanctioned by the United  States for violating human rights.   The Tibetan Policy and Support Act also reauthorizes programs to  preserve Tibetan culture and environment.   The Tibetan Plateau is home to 10 major Asian river systems feeding  10 different Asian states, and these resources are being threatened by  large-scale hydroelectric projects. These rivers are of immense  importance to the livelihood of not only Tibetan communities, but also  the nearly 2 billion people in South and East Asia.   I urge all Members to join me in supporting this very good measure to  continue underscoring our support for the Tibetan people.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                      Committee on the Judiciary,                                   Washington, DC, January 10, 2020.      Hon. Eliot L. Engel,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Affairs,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Engel: This is to advise you that the       Committee on the Judiciary has now had an opportunity to       review the provisions in H.R. 4331, the ``Tibetan Policy and       Support Act of 2019'' that fall within our Rule X       jurisdiction. I appreciate your consulting with us on those       provisions. The Judiciary Committee has no objection to your       including them in the bill for consideration on the House       floor, and to expedite that consideration is willing to forgo       action on H.R. 4331, with the understanding that we do not       thereby waive any future jurisdictional claim over those       provisions or their subject matters.        In the event a House-Senate conference on this or similar       legislation is convened, the Judiciary Committee reserves the       right to request an appropriate number of conferees to       address any concerns with these or similar provisions that       may arise in conference.        Please place this letter into the Congressional Record       during consideration of the measure on the House floor. Thank       you for the cooperative spirit in which you have worked       regarding this matter and others between our committees.            Sincerely,                                                    Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                    Committee on Foreign Affairs,                                   Washington, DC, January 24, 2020.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on Judiciary,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler: I am writing to you concerning H.R.       4331, the Tibetan Policy and Support Act of 2019. I       appreciate your willingness to work cooperatively on this       legislation.        I acknowledge that provisions of the bill fall within the       jurisdiction of the Committee on Judiciary under House Rule       X, and that your Committee will forgo action on H.R. 4331 to       expedite floor consideration. I further acknowledge that the       inaction of your Committee with respect to the bill does not       waive any future jurisdictional claim over the matters       contained in the bill that fall within your jurisdiction. I       will also support the appointment of Committee on Judiciary       conferees during any House-Senate conference convened on this       legislation.        Lastly, I will ensure that our exchange of letters is       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the bill. Thank you again for your       cooperation regarding the legislation. I look forward to       continuing to work with you as the measure moves through the       legislative process.            Sincerely,                                                    Eliot L. Engel,                                                          Chairman.     Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the author of this important bill and the  chairman of the Rules Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  New York (Mr. Suozzi), my friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   The United States has a longstanding record of bipartisan support for  the Tibetan people. Religious tolerance is an American principle, an  American value, and one that we must express around the entire world.   I am pleased that we are moving forward with a measure today that  updates United States policy so that we are not just continuing, but we  are strengthening this support.   I hope all Members will join me today in supporting this important  measure that shows our commitment to preserving Tibet's unique culture,  lands, language, and religion.   I am also proud of the bipartisan work that this Chamber has passed  on China human rights. This is the third bill this Chamber has passed  in recent months, the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, and now  this bill on Tibet.   I urge support for this bill and passage in the Senate of each of  these terribly important measures.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member McCaul for his  important words.   Madam Speaker, I am honored to yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), our distinguished Speaker  of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2153) to support empowerment, economic security, and  educational opportunities for adolescent girls around the world, and  for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2153         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.         (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Keeping       Girls in School Act''.        (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act       is as follows:  Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents. Sec. 2. Appropriate congressional committees defined. Sec. 3. Findings. Sec. 4. Sense of Congress. Sec. 5. Secondary education for adolescent girls. Sec. 6. Global strategy requirement. Sec. 7. Transparency and reporting to Congress.       SEC. 2. APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES DEFINED.         In this Act, the term ``appropriate congressional       committees'' means--        (1) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on       Appropriations of the House of Representatives; and        (2) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on       Appropriations of the Senate.       SEC. 3. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) Adolescence is a critical period in a girl's life, when       significant physical, emotional, and social changes shape her       future.        (2) Adolescent girls are particularly vulnerable to HIV/      AIDS, child, early and forced marriage, and other forms of       violence which are detrimental to their futures, as evidenced       by the following statistics:        (A) Each year, 380,000 adolescent girls and young women       become newly infected with HIV, more than 1,000 every day,       and comprise the fastest-growing demographic for new       infections in sub-Saharan Africa.        (B) Each year, 12,000,000 adolescent girls around the world       are married before their 18th birthday, and more than       650,000,000 women alive today were married as children.        (C) Child marriages often interrupt schooling, limit       opportunities, and impact the physical, psychological and       social well-being of such girls. If there is no reduction in       child marriage, the global number of women married as       children is projected to increase by 150,000,000 by 2030.        (D) One-quarter to one-half of girls in developing       countries become mothers before the age of 18, and girls       under 15 are five times more likely to die during childbirth       than women in their 20s.        (3) Approximately 130,000,000 girls around the world are       not in school, and millions more are failing to acquire basic       reading, writing, and numeracy skills.        (4) Girls between the ages of 10 and 19 are three times       more likely than boys to be kept out of school, particularly       in countries affected by conflict.        (5) Due to discriminatory gender norms and expectations,       disparities in access to safe and quality education manifest       early in a girl's life and continue to become more pronounced       throughout adolescence.        (6) Girls living with disabilities are less likely to start       school and transition to secondary school than boys living       with disabilities and other children, and just 1 percent of       women with disabilities are literate globally.        (7) While two-thirds of all countries have achieved gender       parity in primary education, only 40 percent have achieved       gender parity in secondary education.        (8) Adolescent girls who remain in school are more likely       to live longer, marry later, have healthier children, and, as       adults, earn an income to support their families, thereby       contributing to the economic advancement of communities and       nations.        (9) Since July 2015, more than 100 public-private       partnerships have been formed between the United States       Government and external partners to support innovative and       community-led solutions in targeted countries, including       Malawi and Tanzania, to ensure adolescent girls receive a       quality education.        (10) The United States Global Strategy to Empower       Adolescent Girls, published in March 2016, has brought       together the Department of State, the United States Agency       for International Development, the Peace Corps, and the       Millennium Challenge Corporation, as well as other agencies       and programs such as the President's Emergency Fund for AIDS       Relief (PEPFAR), to address the range of challenges       preventing adolescent girls from attaining an inclusive and       equitable quality education leading to relevant learning       outcomes.        (11) According to the United States Global Strategy to       Empower Adolescent Girls, which is the first foreign policy       document in the world solely dedicated to the rights and       empowerment of girls globally, ``[w]hile the Millennium       Development Goals improved outcomes for girls in primary       education, they also highlighted the need for a targeted       focus on adolescents and young adults, particularly regarding       the transition to and completion of secondary school''.        (12) PEPFAR, through its DREAMS (Determined, Resilient,       Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe) Initiative, has       worked to address a number of the specific barriers to       education that adolescent girls face.       SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) every child, regardless of place of birth, deserves an       equal opportunity to access quality education;        (2) the United States has been a global leader in efforts       to expand and improve educational opportunities for those who       have been traditionally disenfranchised, particularly women       and girls;        (3) gains with respect to girls' secondary education and       empowerment have been proven to correlate strongly with       progress in gender equality and women's rights, as well as       economic and social progress, and achieving gender equality       should be a priority goal of United States foreign policy;        (4) achieving gender parity in both access to and quality       of educational opportunity contributes significantly to       economic growth and development, thereby lowering the risk       for violence and instability; and        (5) education is a lifesaving humanitarian intervention       that protects the lives, futures, and well-being of girls.       SEC. 5. SECONDARY EDUCATION FOR ADOLESCENT GIRLS.         (a) Authority.--The Administrator of the United States       Agency for International Development may enter into       acquisition, assistance, or results-based financing       agreements, including agreements combining more than one such       feature, for activities addressing the barriers described in       subsection (b) that adolescent girls face in accessing a       quality secondary education. Such activities shall--        (1) set outcome-based targets to demonstrate qualitative       gains;        (2) use existing United States Government strategies and       frameworks relevant to international basic education and       gender equality, including evidence-based interventions, to--        (A) integrate new technologies and approaches, including to       establish or continue public-private partnerships or to pilot       the use of development impact bonds (the results of which are       verified by an independent evaluation);        (B) to the greatest extent possible, apply quasi-      experimental and scientific, research-based approaches;        (C) promote inclusive, equitable and sustainable       educational achievement; and        (D) support a responsible transition to education systems       that are sustainably financed by domestic governments; and        (3) ensure that schools provide safe and quality       educational opportunities and create empowering environments,       so that girls can enroll in and regularly attend school,       successfully transition from primary to secondary school, and       eventually graduate having achieved learning outcomes and       positioned to make healthy transitions into adulthood.        (b) Specific Barriers.--The barriers described in this       subsection include--        (1) harmful societal and cultural norms;        (2) lack of safety at school or traveling to school,       including harassment and other forms of physical, sexual, or       psychological violence;        (3) child, early, and forced marriage;        (4) female genital mutilation;        (5) distance from a secondary school;        (6) cost of secondary schooling, including fees, clothing,       and supplies;        (7) inadequate sanitation facilities and products available       at secondary schools;        (8) prioritization of boys' secondary education;        (9) poor nutrition;        (10) early pregnancy and motherhood;        (11) HIV infection;        (12) disability;        (13) discrimination based on religious or ethnic identity;       and        (14) heavy workload due to household tasks.        (c) Coordination and Oversight.--        (1) In general.--The United States Agency for International       Development Senior Coordinator for International Basic       Education Assistance, in coordination with the United States       Agency for International Development Senior Coordinator for       Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment and the Ambassador-      at-Large for Global Women's Issues  [[Page H602]]       at the Department of State, shall be responsible for the       oversight and coordination of all activities of the United       States Government carried out under this section.        (2) Development of agreements.--In the development of       results-based financing agreements described in subsection       (a), the Senior Coordinators shall consult with the United       States Agency for International Development Innovation,       Technology, and Research Hub or any successor center that is       responsible for developing innovative tools and approaches to       accelerate development impact.        (3) Coordination with other strategies.--Activities carried       out under this section shall also be carried out in       coordination with--        (A) the United States Global Strategy to Empower Adolescent       Girls described in section 6; and        (B) the United States Government Strategy on International       Basic Education, including its objective to expand access to       quality basic education for all, particularly marginalized       and vulnerable populations.        (d) Acceptance of Solicitations for Awards.--The       Administrator of the United States Agency for International       Development shall seek to accept solicitations for one or       more awards, pursuant to the authority in subsection (a), to       conduct activities under this section beginning not later       than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act.        (e) Monitoring and Evaluation.--The Administrator of the       United States Agency for International Development shall seek       to ensure that activities carried out under this section--        (1) employ rigorous monitoring and evaluation       methodologies, including ex-post evaluation, to ensure that       such activities demonstrably close the gap in gender parity       for secondary education and improve the quality of education       offered to adolescent girls;        (2) disaggregate all data collected and reported by age,       gender, marital and motherhood status, disability, and       urbanity, to the extent practicable and appropriate;        (3) adhere to the Policy Guidance on Promoting Gender       Equality of the Department of State and the Gender Equality       and Female Empowerment Policy of the United States Agency for       International Development; and        (4) use, to the extent possible, indicators and       methodologies identified by the Interagency Working Group for       the Strategy on International Basic Education.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 2153.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the Keeping Girls in School  Act, and I want to thank my dear friend and colleague, Representative  Lois Frankel, for her hard work on this bill.   Access to education should not depend on whether a child is a boy or  a girl. Yet around the world, 130 million girls are kept out of school.  Fifteen million girls of primary school age will never enter a  classroom.   Think of what that means for their futures and for their ability to  lead prosperous lives.   We know what a difference just a few years of school makes. On  average, when a girl in the developing world receives 7 years of  education, she marries 4 years later and has fewer children. Better  educated women tend to be healthier and live longer, and women with  secondary school education earn almost twice as much as those with no  education at all.   When women and girls have access to education, they lift up their  entire communities. In societies that make strides in education  equality, we see better health outcomes, improved economic well-being,  and greater security for everyone. That is why getting more girls in  classrooms should be a foreign policy priority of the United States of  America. It is the right thing to do. It also helps drive stability and  prosperity in the long run.   But today, too many still face barriers like harassment, early  marriage, disabilities, and lack of access to hygiene. These barriers  conspire against girls succeeding, particularly adolescent girls.   This bill highlights those barriers to keeping girls in school all  around the world and requires USAID to support activities addressing  them throughout their existing work and into the future.   I am very proud to support H.R. 2153, and I am grateful to Members on  both sides of the aisle for helping push it forward.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Florida (Ms. Frankel), who is the author of this important bill  and my dear friend.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Pennsylvania (Ms. Houlahan),  [[Page H604]]  my friend and colleague on the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume for the purpose of closing.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank you, Congresswoman Frankel, for your  hard work on this measure. You have been a tireless advocate for women  and girls here at home and all around the world.   I also want to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Waltz), my  colleague, who had brought his daughter here to the floor moments ago  in a heartwarming gesture. I, too, am a father of two extraordinary  daughters, Daniela and Pia. They have received the blessings of  education and know how lucky they are. They, like me and like so many  of us here in the U.S. House of Representatives, know how important it  is to extend that same blessing to every girl around the world. That is  why this is one of those areas in which American leadership is vitally  important.   The benefits of supporting education for women and girls are as clear  as can be. But more than that, helping more people live up to their  potential and to pursue their dreams is a great reflection of our  values, the values that should be at the very center of American  foreign policy. Girls' education must be made a strategic development  priority.   This is a good measure, which I am pleased to support, and I urge all  of my colleagues to do the same.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
