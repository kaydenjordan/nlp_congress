 Mr. Speaker, the National Defense  Authorization Act passed the House Armed Services Committee with an  overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 60 yes to 1 no. I am grateful for the  leadership of Chairman Mac Thornberry, with Speaker Paul Ryan, promoted  by Defense Secretary James Mattis.   The NDAA being considered today provides a critical increase in  topline funding to support troops and readiness  [[Page H4591]]  recovery, consistent with President Donald Trump's commitment to  rebuild the military as he keeps his promises.   This legislation makes major reforms to the Pentagon bureaucracy,  while adding more military personnel to all services. The NDAA also  includes the largest pay increase for the military in 9 years.   As chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness, I  am grateful that this legislation promotes rebuilding the military and  supports readiness recovery by rehabilitating and replacing worn-out  equipment, overcoming the crisis in military aviation, restoring  America's strength at sea, and rebuilding crumbling military buildings  and other infrastructure.   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill that supports  the men and women in uniform, along with military families, to promote  peace through strength.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank Congressman  Mike  Gallagher for his military service and now service in Congress.   I am grateful to speak in support of Congressman  Mike Gallagher's  amendment that would require the executive branch to create a strategy  to address the abuse of visa programs used to enter the United States  to conduct political activity and establish groups in support of the  Chinese Communist Party.   Organizations like the Confucius Institute and the Thousand Talents  program are clear examples as to why Congressman Gallagher makes  perfect sense, and it is critical to our national security. Confucius  Institutes are currently active in 103 college campuses, despite Li  Changchun, a member of the Chinese Communist Party's Politburo Standing  Committee, calling the institutes ``an important part of China's  overseas propaganda setup.''   Additionally, FBI Director Christopher Wray described the Confucius  Institutes operating in the United States as exploiting the very open  research and development environment we have, which we all revere, but  they are taking advantage of it.   Unfortunately, my amendment, cosponsored by Congressman Gallagher and  Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler, dealing with organizations like the  Confucius Institutes was not ruled in order. It is critical that the  whole-of-government China strategy include vulnerabilities within our  academic community, and for this reason, I urge everyone to support  Congressman Gallagher's amendment.
