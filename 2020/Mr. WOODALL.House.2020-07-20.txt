 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank my friend from Colorado for yielding me the time.   One of these days, Mr. Speaker, he is going to come down here and he  is going to leave out that he yields the time for the purposes of  debate only, and he and I are going to solve most of the ills that  confront this institution. I think we could do that together. I  appreciate him, because he is my friend. I appreciate his friendship  and his yielding me the time today.   Mr. Speaker, as the first Georgian to take the floor today, I want to  tell my colleagues, on behalf of the entire Georgia delegation, that we  appreciate the prayers and the thoughts that you all have been sending,  not just to Mr. Lewis' family and his staff, but to all of us as well.   One of my favorite parts of this job, Mr. Speaker, is talking to  young people. I will speak to any student group that wants to come  through that will invite me out because I love having an opportunity to  influence young minds and answer those completely without shame,  questions that folks ask. But the one thing I have always asked my  staff to do is not schedule me after   John Lewis has talked to those  young people, because once   John Lewis has entered a room and had a  chance with those young minds, anybody else is going to be a distant  second at best.   Mr. Lewis has been a leader in Georgia on causes good and right for  my entire lifetime. In fact, Mr. Lewis was elected to Congress before I  even graduated from college. Most of the time I spent with him was as a  staffer on Capitol Hill.   And I remember after getting elected, he was sitting over to my left,  as he often was, and I went up and I said: Mr. Lewis, I just want to  introduce myself. I am   Rob Woodall. I just came in in John Linder's  seat, and I just am excited to be with you.   He said: Rob, I know exactly who you are, and please don't call me  Mr. Lewis. Call me John.   John would invite the delegation over to his home to visit and talk  about things--not the things that divide us, but the things that unite  us. We can't afford to lose the uniters in this institution or in this  country, and we have lost one in   John Lewis.   I will have a chance, as part of the Georgia delegation, to recognize  him more later today. I am grateful to the Speaker for making that time  available, but please know how much we all appreciate your outreach to  John's staff and all of us.   Mr. Speaker, it is fitting, thinking about being a uniter, that we  are down here talking about the NDAA today. If you will recall, last  year, when we were doing the NDAA, I had very few nice things to say.  It had generally been a partnership exercise here, and for myriad  reasons that both the chairman and the ranking member on Armed Services  regretted, it became a partisan exercise last year. It came out of  committee on almost a strictly partisan vote. It came across the floor  on almost a strictly partisan vote.   This is a bill that it has not mattered who led the United States  House or who led the United States Senate or even who was in the White  House. For 60 years now, each and every year, the Congress comes  together and we produce a blueprint for our Nation's national security.   I love that about this bill, and I love that about this institution.  I love that about what it means for the leadership of the civilian  government that we get past partisanship every single year.   And to my Democratic friends' credit, as they lead this institution,  by the time the NDAA bill got back to the floor after conference, it  passed on a voice vote here in the House. We had brought ourselves back  together again.   This year, Mr. Speaker, it has returned to that partnership bill that  it has always tried to be. We had the chairman, Mr. Smith, and our  ranking member, Mr. Thornberry, up in the Rules Committee last Friday,  and they both attested to that fact: this is not the bill that either  of them would have drafted, but it is the bill that they have come  together and passed unanimously out of their committee.   And, again, to my Democratic colleagues' credit, they have named the  bill after our ranking member, Mac Thornberry, to recognize his  lifetime of service to our men and women in uniform.   That is the kind of thing that doesn't get a lot of publicity back  home. Folks aren't going to sit around and celebrate that, but it is a  big deal that Republicans are in the minority on Capitol Hill, but that  leadership in service to others, as Mac Thornberry has done for our men  and women in uniform, doesn't have a partisan label on it; and our  Democratic colleagues have seen fit to honor him in this way, and I am  grateful to them for that.   We have a lot of amendments here, as you have heard already, Mr.  Speaker, and I wish that we had been able to do this in two separate  rules so that we could have come together and supported NDAA and then  had our differences on the other measures that are also included in  this rule.    Coming out of Coca-Cola country, it would be okay with me if the  grocery stores decided that, in this time of pandemic, they only had  time to just stock the Coca-Cola on the shelves and they weren't going  to make time to stock the Pepsi because it was just too dangerous and  not enough time to make that happen. But they haven't. They have  decided they are going to put it all on the shelves, and they are going  to try to get back to normal. We have got to try to get back to normal,  too.   I know my friend, the chairman of the Rules Committee, is on the  floor today, and he has got a lot of responsibility on his shoulders.  We have gotten into the habit, during this pandemic, of putting a lot  more things in a single rule than we used to do. I am hoping that we  will start to swing that pendulum back as we all grapple collectively  to get to a new normal because, besides the National Defense  Authorization Act, we have got a lands bill  [[Page H3102]]  here today. It came to us from the Senate. I understand my friends  don't want to amend it because it has come to us from the Senate. I  would like to put the House stamp of approval on it. I would like to  put some House improvements on it.   We had an opportunity in the Rules Committee, Mr. Speaker. This lands  bill is exactly as my friend from Colorado described. It provides a new  funding stream, a mandatory funding stream for land acquisition through  the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a fund that I support, funding  that I have supported.   But we have a maintenance backlog on our Federal lands, and this year  we are not going to have the resources to fund those maintenance  backlogs at our normal paltry level, much less at the elevated level  that they need to occur, and this bill is going to exacerbate that  problem. Rather than funding a maintenance backlog, it is going to  purchase more land that we don't have enough money to maintain already.   We had an opportunity to massage that around to make sure that we  were funding the Land and Water Conservation Fund and we were also  providing the stewardship to those lands that the Land and Water  Conservation Fund has already acquired. We didn't have a chance to do  that in the Rules Committee.   We are going to have a previous question opportunity, when we defeat  the previous question, to come back and further improve this lands  bill. I hope that my colleagues will give us that opportunity. I  appreciate that the Senate has sent us this language, but I do believe  we can improve it before we send it to the President's desk.   And then, finally, we have bills that again, with the best of  intentions, affect our Nation's childcare system. It is absolutely,  positively true that we cannot get our parents back to work if we can't  get our children back into the classroom or back into the childcare  center. We must make all of these things work in concert together.   These bills are coming to us under an emergency designation. I sit on  the Budget Committee, Mr. Speaker, and what that means is the normal  rules don't apply.   Childcare has been a challenge in this country, not just during the  pandemic, but for decades. It is an issue that is worthy of this  Congress' attention. It is also worthy of getting it done right,  because we can only spend each dollar once. Once that dollar is gone,  if we don't spend it efficiently, we are not going to be able to serve  children as well as we would like to. We are not going to be able to  serve parents as well as we would like to. These childcare provisions  did not go through a process that gave us an opportunity to  participate.   Both bills that were testified on before the Rules Committee had  Budget Committee referrals. The Budget Committee has been meeting, but  we have not had one word of conversation about these priorities. That  does not produce the best product.   Again, it may be done with the best of intentions, but it cannot  possibly produce the best product to ignore committees of jurisdiction  and to ignore disparate voices as we are all grappling with childcare  challenges back in our district, COVID-related challenges back in our  district.   So, Mr. Speaker, as you take time today and, hopefully, for many days  into the future to celebrate the difference-making that   John Lewis  did--not just for my community, not just for my State, not just for our  country, I would argue he made a difference on the global stage--take a  moment to celebrate that, for all the partisan headlines that are in  the news, there is a lot of good partnership, collaborative give-and- take going on behind the scenes to try to make the world a better  place, to try to make American policy better policy.   I hope my colleagues will support the NDAA bill when it gets to the  floor of this House after this very aggressive amendment process, and I  do hope my colleagues will defeat this rule so that we can separate the  NDAA from these items that require much more of the House's attention,  and then we can rush those to the floor as soon as we have had an  opportunity to perfect those, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I know the heart of which my chairman speaks. I believe  it is wrongheaded to craft a military budget and then figure out what  kind of mission that budget can support.   I think the question is what are we asking of our men and women in  uniform, what is the mission, and then let's commit to funding that  mission in a full-throated way.   We had an opportunity in this bill to vote on what the definition of  the mission is, whether or not we were going to allow the Authorization  for Use of Military Force from 2001 to continue to perpetuate the  forever wars that my friend who chairs the Rules Committee mentioned.  We are not going to have an opportunity to vote on that today, and I  regret that, as I know the chairman does.   Mr. Speaker, I know that we are hoping to have an opportunity to  discuss that in the future in a more full-throated way, but I would  urge my colleagues--and I sit on the Budget Committee--please don't  craft a budget and figure out then what you can ask our men and women  in uniform to do. Figure out what it is you are asking our men and  women in uniform to do, and then fund that to the best of our  abilities.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Cole), the ranking member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Shimkus).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Stauber).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I mentioned earlier that if we defeated the previous  question today that we would have an opportunity to add some additional  language to the lands bill.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the  amendment I am about to discuss in the Congressional Record immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, when we have a natural disaster on our  public lands, we have an opportunity, right after that disaster, to go  in and salvage some of the timber that has fallen, some of the timber  that has been affected. But there is a clock on how long we have to get  that done, and so many of the processes that are in place normally, to  seek approval for harvesting timber on public lands, remain in place in  these natural disasters, in these times of crisis.   Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will add an  amendment to the rule to make in order a discussion on creating a  categorical exclusion for salvage operations.   Now, I know there are differences between Department of the Interior  lands and Department of Agriculture lands. Former Governor of the great  State of Georgia Sonny Perdue, now the Secretary of Agriculture, the  lands that he is in charge of are not lands designed to be preserved;  they are lands designed to be managed. It is an agricultural product  that is supposed to produce timber for the American people.   Even though it is a catastrophe that damages that timber, that  encroaches upon the productivity of those lands, an opportunity to  salvage what little may be available to be salvaged should be one that  we avail ourselves of or, at the very least, should be a topic of  discussion today.   So, Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to help me to defeat the  previous question. Let's add this amendment to the rule.   As I mentioned earlier, we already have everything and the kitchen  sink in this rule already. One more section 7 isn't going to  disadvantage us or slow us down more than a single hour, and we will be  able to have this very important conversation about maximizing the  asset that the American people have entrusted us to manage and to  protect.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I want to again thank my friend from Colorado, both for his  partnership on the Rules Committee and his courtesy here on the floor  today.   I understand the urgency about which he just spoke. I offered an  [[Page H3106]]  amendment in the Rules Committee, Mr. Speaker, that we withdraw what  they call martial law. That is the ability for the House to move with  great haste.   The House rules require that we pace ourselves so that the body has  an opportunity to review the rules that the Rules Committee produces,  the legislation that comes out of committees. We have these timelines  in place.   Since the COVID crisis began, over 100 days ago, we have been  operating under what they call martial law, where the Speaker, in his  or her wisdom, can do almost anything with great haste on the floor of  the House. Both parties do that in times of crisis so that the House  can be responsive in the way that my friend from Colorado has  discussed.                                time  1115    There comes a time, however, Mr. Speaker, when we need to recognize  that if we have been sacrificing efficacy in the name of efficiency,  that might have been the right answer on day one of the crisis and that  might have been the right answer on day 30, maybe even day 60, maybe  even day 90, but there is going to come a time in the same way that we  have asked our food service personnel, our sanitation personnel, our  law enforcement personnel, and our first responder personnel--you go  right down the list of folks doing critical jobs in America. We are not  asking them to shortcut those jobs. We are asking them to perform those  jobs to the very best of their abilities.   We can do better here.   Now, my friend from Colorado mentioned that we stuff these things all  into a single provision, and it does save us 1 hour of additional  debate. It does save us 1 hour.   Now, in the grand scheme of things, I might say having a more  deliberative process would be worth 60 minutes of this body's time. We  didn't have our first day of session in June until the very last week  of June, so I think we could find the time. But that is not really my  biggest concern.   My biggest concern, as the ranking member of the Rules Committee  mentioned, is the bills that have been stuffed into this bill that  haven't been the product of regular order. And I don't mean regular  order where we have to talk about everything and delay it ad infinitum.  I am talking about regular order where thoughtful, serious legislators  actually have a chance to make a difference and things aren't written  by a select few in leadership behind closed doors.   In a crisis, leaders have to lead. And I don't fault the majority for  circling the wagons and doing what they needed to do to respond in the  way that they thought was appropriate. I might have disagreed with  them, but they have a responsibility and an obligation to lead.   We are entering a time, Mr. Speaker, where we need to recognize that  we are the deliberative body. This is where the American people come to  have their voices heard, and we must open up the process so that that  can happen.   Mr. Speaker, I mentioned earlier that we did a pretty good job on the  National Defense Authorization Act. Again, it passed out of committee  56-0. That is not because everybody agreed. That is not what happens in  legislating. It is that everybody came to a place where they were  comfortable and they did the negotiating they had to do to satisfy that  higher priority of defining America's national security needs and  goals.   I have the list of amendments that have been made in order by this  bill, Mr. Speaker. You can see the list of bipartisan amendments. I  feel pretty good about that. There are a lot of numbers you see on this  page, bipartisan amendments that are going to be made in order in the  National Defense Authorization Act. There are almost as many--in fact,  as many as the Democratic amendments that were made in order under this  rule. You see that is a lot of Democratic amendments that were made in  order, too, and I am glad we had bipartisan, and I am glad the majority  was able to continue to improve upon what they have done.   This is the list of Republican amendments that have been made in  order. It is not a screen tear, Mr. Speaker. It is just that this is  only how many there are. We in the Republican majority, 2017 when I had  an opportunity to lead a subcommittee there and 2018, we would make  more Democratic amendments in order than Republican amendments because  Republicans were leading, so, by definition, fewer Democratic voices  could be included in the regular process. We weren't able to do that  today, and I regret that.   But I want to recognize, because I think it is important to  recognize, Mr. Speaker, I have a lot of constructive counsel for my  friends on the other side of the aisle about how they can do better,  and any time they want to come to me and partner with me on that  leadership, I am available to them to do that. I don't think we are  going to get to where I want to go by the end of this Democratic  majority, and I think when the Republican majority takes over in  January, that is going to be my opportunity to get us back to where I  want us to be.   But this bill, this National Defense Authorization Act, this  bipartisan work product, this collaborative effort to support our men  and women in uniform, as my ranking member mentioned, can be improved  on the floor of this House or that partnership can be destroyed on the  floor of this House.   The leadership on the Democratic side of the aisle on the Rules  Committee has a very difficult job trying to find those amendments that  can help to improve the bill without destroying the bill, and I want to  recognize the real sweat equity that folks put in to trying to keep the  poison pills away and trying to find those ideas that needed to be  discussed and not to destroy our partnership.   Let's support this National Defense Authorization Act, Mr. Speaker.  Let's defeat this rule but support the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
