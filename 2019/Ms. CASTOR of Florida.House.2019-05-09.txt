 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague and friend  from Florida for yielding the time.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the rule and the two very  important bills the House of Representatives will consider.   The first is H.R. 986 by my colleague, Representative Kuster from New  Hampshire, that will work to protect our neighbors who have preexisting  health conditions, like cancer or heart disease.   Unfortunately, the Trump administration is trying to weaken those  protections. They are doing so in the courts and through Congress. So  it is very important that the House of Representatives pass into law  protections for our neighbors with preexisting conditions.   In fact, the name of the bill is ``Protecting Americans with  Preexisting Conditions Act.'' Passing this bill will help keep  healthcare accessible and affordable for all Americans.   The second bill is also very important, H.R. 2157. It provides about  $17 billion in disaster relief to Americans who need it, who have  suffered through horrendous natural disasters.   It was October 10, 2018, when Florida took a direct hit from  Hurricane Michael. It was one of the most powerful storms to make  landfall in the United States. It slammed into the panhandle and caused  tremendous damage and destruction.   To help meet disaster needs, the House of Representatives, the  Democratic-led House, one of the first bills we passed was a disaster  relief package on January 16, 2019. It passed by a wide margin with a  bipartisan vote. Unfortunately, it ran into opposition from the Senate  and the White House.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues now to come back together in a  bipartisan way and use this bill to break the logjam in the Senate and  keep the focus on our fellow Americans who need disaster assistance.   Disaster relief used to be bipartisan. We need to return to those  days and pass it in a timely manner.                                time  1245     Mr. Chair, I rise today to stand up for my  neighbors--including those with preexisting conditions--by supporting  H.R. 986, the Protecting Americans with Preexisting Conditions Act.  Health care in American should be affordable and accessible to all.  Passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 ensured that our neighbors  with a preexisting condition, like asthma, heart disease or cancer,  would no longer be denied insurance.   It is unfortunate that the President and Republicans in Congress have  made it their mission to sabotage the affordable health care of  hardworking families, including gutting protections for people with  preexisting conditions and take away affordable, quality health care  from millions of Americans. I am cosponsoring the Protecting Americans  with Preexisting Conditions Act to safeguard Americans from the Trump  administration's efforts to undo the affordability and  comprehensiveness of our  [[Page H3531]]  health care. H.R. 986 will overturn the Trump administration's  expansion of Section 1332 waivers that were originally included in the  Affordable Care Act to give states flexibility to experiment with  insurance reforms that could improve the health and well-being of  citizens. Unfortunately, the administration would instead use those  waivers to weaken standards put in place to protect the health of  Americans--especially our neighbors with preexisting conditions.   H.R. 986 would end the administration's push of Americans into sub- par and deceptive junk plans that many times exclude coverage for  preexisting conditions. These plans do not provide basic benefits or  financial protection standard and would return patients to the days  when they would discover only when they get sick or God forbid get a  cancer diagnosis that their plan imposes unreasonable limits on  coverage and excludes vital benefits. They discriminate based on age,  health status and gender.   Democrats will not allow the Trump administration and Congressional  Republicans to drive premiums higher in the individual market and rip  coverage away from those that need it the most. I want to thank my  colleague Rep. Kuster for helping lead this charge and I urge my  colleagues to support H.R. 986 and support our neighbors with  preexisting conditions.
