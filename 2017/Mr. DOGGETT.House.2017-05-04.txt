 Mr. Speaker, the harsh indifference of these Republicans  to the well-being of so many Americans is startling. Trump may  temporarily bury the lies central to this plan with a tweet storm--with  fake news. But these Republicans who follow him will not be able to  find an excuse as one family after another suffers.   Today's surprise attack on American health care has been widely  condemned by healthcare professionals across the country and those who  represent the disabled and sick, like the American Cancer Society and  the March of Dimes.   Jimmy Kimmel, know that your baby was fortunate, but others born with  a disability will face the barrier of preexisting conditions.   They didn't listen to the AARP, which knows that those Americans too  young for Medicare by a few years will get socked with unaffordable  premiums. They don't know what this monstrosity of a bill costs to the  taxpayer. They don't know how many families will lose coverage or how  many jobs will be lost. They don't really know what is in this bill.  They know only that the Pied Piper of Trump Tower is playing a tune  today and they must dance.   There is much talk about high-risk pools. The real high-risk pool is  the one that everyone who votes for this outrageous proposal is about  to plunge into.
