 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from  Texas for her hard work on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, the success and security of America's economy depends on  the  [[Page H813]]  strength of our workforce. That is why the America COMPETES Act  connects students and workers with the skills they need to succeed in  high-tech industries while strengthening our economy's competitiveness  in the years ahead.   The investments in this bill increase equitable access to computer  science education and postsecondary STEM pathways. The legislation also  builds on bipartisan support for apprenticeships by creating nearly 1  million new registered apprenticeship opportunities over the next 5  years.   The America COMPETES Act also includes protection so the jobs created  in this bill will pay a decent wage.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation provides investments that we need to  secure a brighter future for our Nation's workers and our economy. I  urge my colleagues to support this critical legislation.
