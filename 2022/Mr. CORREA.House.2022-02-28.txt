 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S.  [[Page H1156]]  3706) to provide for the application of certain provisions of the  Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000 for  fiscal year 2021.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 3706         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. COUNTY ELECTIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2021 UNDER THE                     SECURE RURAL SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY SELF-                    DETERMINATION ACT OF 2000.         Sections 102(b)(1)(D), 102(d)(1)(F), and 102(d)(3)(D) of       the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act       of 2000 (16 U.S.C. 7112(b)(1)(D), 7112(d)(1)(F),       7112(d)(3)(D)) shall be applied for fiscal year 2021.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 3706. This bill makes  important corrections to the recently passed Secure Rural Schools  reauthorization. Without these corrections, counties would not have the  choice of electing to receive SRS payments or electing to receive  Federal timber harvest receipts. Rather, they would have to take SRS  payments.   Furthermore, the current reauthorization does not allow counties to  elect their allocations in advance of their fiscal year 2021 payments,  meaning all eligible counties would receive 80 percent Title I funds,  20 percent Title II funds, and no Title III funds.   While Title I payments, used for roads and schools, will be the bulk  of the payment either way, it is important to ensure that counties get  access to Title III funds. Title III funds are important because they  can be used for specified county purposes. These purposes can include  law enforcement on Federal land, search and rescue, and wildfire risk  reduction.   This fix will help timber-dependent counties across the country and  ensure continued support for roads, schools, law enforcement, and  environmental benefits.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time and urge  adoption of this bill.
