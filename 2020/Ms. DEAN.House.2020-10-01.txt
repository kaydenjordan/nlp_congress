 Madam Speaker, more than 207,000 Americans are dead, and  there is no end in sight. One in six Americans is jobless.   These are not just numbers. These are people. They have lost their  livelihoods, their health, their careers. Many have lost everything. It  did not have to be this way.   Our Nation had its first confirmed COVID case in January, and yet 9  months later, there is no national testing strategy, no leadership from  the White House.   We have a President who would rather save face, save power to  himself, than save lives, who corrosively continues to play politics as  people die.   We are a Nation in crisis. People are in despair.   Government has a role to play. We must act with urgency and decency  as we support one another with direct cash relief, funds for State and  local governments, widespread testing, and the guarantee of free COVID  treatment and vaccines for all.   Let us live up to Elijah Cummings' command: ``We are better than  this.''  [[Page H5123]]                                ____________________
