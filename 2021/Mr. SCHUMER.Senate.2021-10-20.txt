 Mr. President, I understand that there are six bills at  the desk due for a second reading en bloc.    In order to place the bills on the calendar under the  provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further proceeding en bloc.    Thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, for over 240 years, the story of American  democracy has been an inexorable march toward universal suffrage-- toward the realization of that sacred principle that all citizens  should have a voice in selecting their leaders.   The grand ideal had humble beginnings. At the time of the  Constitution's ratification, hardly 1 in 10 Americans would have been  even eligible to vote.   If you were not White, not a landowner, not a male, and not a  Protestant, chances were that the democracy did not apply to you;  chances were that you were cut out of the political process.   It took over two centuries of Americans marching, fighting, and dying  for the promise of freedom to expand to our citizens, regardless of  race or gender or creed, the right to vote.   But for every two steps forward, sometimes there are those who try to  pull us one step back. Unfortunately, we find ourselves today in the  midst of such a struggle.   Across the country, the Big Lie--the Big Lie--has spread like a  cancer, as many States across the Nation have passed the most draconian  restrictions against voting that we have seen in decades. If nothing is  done, these laws will make it harder for millions of Americans to  participate in their government.  [[Page S7094]]    If there is anything worthy of the Senate's attention, if there is  any issue that merits debate on this floor, it is protecting our  democracy from the forces that are trying to unravel it from the inside  out.   That is why this afternoon, the U.S. Senate will vote to begin debate  on the Freedom to Vote Act.   The Freedom to Vote Act is a balanced, effective, and commonsense  proposal that will fortify our democracy and protect Americans' right  to vote. It sets basic standards for all Americans to vote safely and  securely, no matter what ZIP Code they live in. It adopts proven  reforms that will protect voters from both parties, whether they live  in blue States or red States or purple States. It fights back against  the power of dark money in politics and ends the toxic practice of  partisan gerrymandering. And, all the while, it respects the rightful  authority of States to carry out their elections.    At its core, the Freedom to Vote Act rests on a simple principle:  Americans must be able to freely choose their leaders, and those  leaders must be accountable to the people, not to well-heeled donors.   These are policies all Americans can get behind. When was the last  time we heard Americans cheer about dark money in our elections or the  pervasiveness of partisan gerrymandering? What sort of voter would  willingly choose to make voting harder--arbitrarily harder--when it  should be easy, safe, and secure? The Freedom to Vote Act would provide  long-overdue remedies for all these concerns.   Now, crafting this bill, as you know, Mr. President, was no easy  feat. It took months of hard work, compromise, and gathering feedback  from experts on sensible policies that have been proven to work. I want  to thank all of my colleagues who dedicated their energies to making  this moment possible, and I want to especially thank Senator Manchin  for his hard work over the past few weeks. He has reached across the  aisle to try and find a way for the Senate to do its work in a  bipartisan fashion. I thank him for his commitment to finding  bipartisanship on a subject that, by all accounts, should be bipartisan  to its core and has been for much of our history.   Now, today's vote is a cloture vote simply on a motion to proceed. It  presents Senators with a simple question: Should the Senate even  debate--debate--voting rights? That is what this is about, simply a  debate and an important one to be sure.   No Republican is being asked to sign their name to this or that  policy today, but they are being asked to come to the table and have a  discussion and allow amendments. I want to be clear. If Republicans  join us in proceeding to this bill, I am prepared to hold a full- fledged debate worthy of the U.S. Senate. The minority will have the  chance to have their voices heard.   The Senate has already voted on more amendments than in any year  under former-President Trump, and on this legislation, again Republican  Senators would be able to offer amendments. But for that to happen, we  have to get on the bill today.   What we can't accept is a situation where one side is calling for  bipartisan debate and bipartisan cooperation while the other refuses to  even engage in a dialogue. If our Republican colleagues don't like our  ideas, they have a responsibility to present their own. It is ludicrous  for any Republican to assert that the Federal Government has no role to  play in safeguarding elections when State laws disenfranchise American  citizens.   I invite them to read the Constitution of the United States of  America, which precisely empowers Congress to regulate the ``times,  places, and manners'' of holding elections. I invite them to look at  modern American history, when the Senate stepped into the breach  numerous times when Jim Crow States sought to restrict the right to  vote.   There is a long and hallowed tradition of the Senate, often in a  bipartisan coalition, working to protect access to the franchise, and  today our colleagues should vote to begin debate for how we can add to  that legacy. But what Republicans should not do--they must not do--is  squelch any chance--any chance--for the Senate to debate something as  critical, as sacrosanct, as American as the right to vote. The clock is  ticking on our chance to take meaningful action.   Our experiment in democracy has been the greatest feat of self-rule  in all of modern history. We cannot allow it to backslide here in the  21st century. Today, we have a chance to begin debate on how we can  prevent that from happening, but Republicans must join us in the debate  and vote to allow debate to proceed. I urge my colleagues to vote yes.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on another matter, BBB, Build Back  Better, even as we work to push legislation in defense of our  democracy, Senate Democrats are also making good progress on reaching  an agreement on President Biden's Build Back Better plan.   Yesterday, Senate Democrats had a very spirited and very positive  caucus lunch to go over the latest outstanding items before we can all  reach a deal. We walked out of that lunch united in our desire to reach  an agreement this week. I believe we can get it done, and I want to  thank all my colleagues for their leadership, diligence, and focus on  reaching an end result. We are going to keep talking to each other all  week long until we get the job done.   Later this morning, I will speak again with the Speaker and with the  White House to go over the latest details of the President's proposal.  I have spoken to the President just about every day and Speaker Pelosi  several times a day about these issues. I will continue meeting with my  caucus to try and keep us all on the same page because be on the same  page we must. Everyone is going to have to compromise if we are going  to find that legislative sweet spot we can all get behind.   Nobody will get everything they want, but no matter what, our final  proposal will deliver the core promise we made to the American people:  We will take bold action against the climate crisis while creating  millions of new, good-paying jobs; we will expand economic opportunity  and lower costs for working Americans; and we will cut taxes for  working and middle-class Americans while asking the wealthy to pay  their fair share. In short, we will deliver on a bill that dramatically  improves the lives of millions and millions and millions of American  families.   We are getting closer to an agreement. We want to finalize a deal by  the end of this week, but we all must keep moving together.                            ____________________     Mr. President, and finally on nominations, yesterday, I  was proud to announce my recommendation of a great New Yorker and a  great friend to serve as the next U.S. Ambassador to Jamaica, Nick  Perry, of my hometown of Brooklyn. I cannot think of a better person to  represent our country in Jamaica than Assemblyman Perry. If confirmed,  he would be the first-ever Jamaican-born American to hold that post.   I always ask folks when I am in Brooklyn, ``What is the biggest  island in the Caribbean?'' I tell them it is a trick question. They  guess, ``Well, maybe it is Haiti; maybe it is Barbados; maybe it is  Cuba.'' I say, ``No, it is Brooklyn,'' which has more Caribbean  immigrants than anywhere else.   So Nick Perry's nomination is great news for our community and our  country. For decades, Assemblyman Perry has served Brooklyn by doing  things the old-fashioned way: working hard, never resting on his  laurels, and earning the trust of the people he represents. He is a  true American success story: an immigrant, a veteran of the Army, and a  graduate of Brooklyn College. I know he will do excellent work as our  next Ambassador.   From Patrick Ewing to KRS-One, from Vice President Kamala Harris to  Congresswoman Yvette Clarke, to the late General Powell, Jamaican  Americans hold a key place in our Nation's rich legacy. Nick Perry will  continue adding to this legacy, as he has for decades, and I am proud  to support him as a nominee for Ambassador.   And, finally, today, the Senate will also move forward on Catherine  Lhamon to be Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the Department of  Education. All her career, Ms. Lhamon has  [[Page S7095]]  been an unshakeable champion for civil rights and for all students who  want a fair shake in their education. This would be the second time she  serves as Assistant Secretary, so she has the experience, the  leadership, and the dedication to stand up for students from all walks  of life--something sorely lacking under the previous administration.   I look forward to confirming her nomination.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I change my vote to no.   The VICE PRESIDENT. On this vote, the yeas are 49, the nays are 51.   Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted  in the affirmative, the motion is not agreed to.   The motion was rejected.                             Motion to Reconsider     Madam President, I enter a motion to reconsider the  failed cloture vote.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The motion is entered.    Now, Madam President, I want to be clear about what just  happened on the floor of the Senate. Every single Republican Senator  just blocked this Chamber from having a debate--simply a debate--on  protecting Americans' right to vote in free and fair elections.   A little over a year ago, our country held the safest, most  accessible, most on-the-level elections in modern history. Our former  President could not accept defeat with grace. He refused to show  fidelity to the democratic process.   Instead, he told a Big Lie--a Big Lie that has now poisoned-- poisoned--the roots of our democracy. Capitalizing on this malicious  lie, his acolytes in conservative-controlled legislatures are now  passing laws across the country making it harder for younger, poorer,  urban, and non-White Americans to participate in our elections.   These laws are a direct attack on our fundamental liberties as  American citizens. If there is anything--anything--worthy of the  Senate's attention, it is unquestionably this.   And yet, given the chance to respond to an obvious problem, given the  chance to merely debate these latest threats against the franchise,  Senate Republicans voted unanimously--unanimously--to block any  opportunity for action.   Let there be no mistake, Senate Republicans blocking debate today is  an implicit endorsement of the horrid new voter suppression and  election subversion laws pushed in conservative States across the  country. By preventing the Senate from functioning as it was intended,  Republicans in this body are permitting States to criminalize giving  food and water to voters at the polls. Republicans are saying it's OK  to limit polling places and voting hours and shut the doors to more  expansive vote by mail.   I mean, my God. Why aren't all of my colleagues outraged by these  laws?   Frankly, we haven't heard a clear explanation from Republicans at all  because they refused for this Chamber to even hold a debate. It is  ludicrous--ludicrous--for them to simply state that the Federal  Government has no role to play here. They should read the Constitution  of these United States of America. It precisely empowers Congress to  regulate the ``times, places, and manners'' of holding elections. The  Congress--us. Sometimes the Federal Government has been the only  recourse when States conspire to shut voters out.   Madam President, the fight to protect our democracy is far from over  in the United States Senate. Senate Democrats have made clear that  voting rights is not like other issues we deal with in this Chamber.  This isn't about regular old politics. It is not just about even  regular old policy. It is about protecting the very soul of this  Nation, about preserving our identity as a free people who are masters  of our own destiny.   Republican obstruction is not a cause for throwing in the towel. As  soon as next week, I am prepared to bring the John Lewis Voting Rights  Advancement Act here to the floor.   What we saw from Republicans today is not how the Senate is supposed  to work. This is supposedly the world's greatest deliberative body,  where we debate, forge compromise, amend, and pass legislation to help  the American people. That is the legacy of this great Chamber. The  Senate needs to be restored to its rightful status as the world's  greatest deliberative body.   Now, in the aftermath of the Civil War, and as the Nation began the  colossal work of Reconstruction, America was more divided than at any  point in history. It was hard to imagine that a single nation could  endure after the bloody conflict of the four previous years.   At the time, the Republican Congress set to work on granting newly  freed slaves the basic freedoms that had long been denied to them.  These freedoms were eventually enshrined in the 14th and 15th  Amendments, granting due process and the right to vote to all citizens,  regardless of color or race.   Today, these amendments rank as some of the greatest and most revered  accomplishments in congressional history. They are proof that our  country is capable of living up to its founding promise, if we are  willing to put in the work.   But at the time, the minority party in both Chambers refused to offer  a single vote for any of the civil rights legislation put forward  during Reconstruction. Not one vote. Not one vote. They argued these  bills represented nothing more than the partisan interests of the  majority--a power grab, they said, from vengeful northerners.   But that didn't stop the majority. If expanding basic freedoms meant  going it alone, that was something they were willing to do. Today, we  feel the same way.   To the patriots after the Civil War, this wasn't partisan; it was  patriotic. And American democracy is better off today because the  patriots in this Chamber at that time were undeterred by minority  obstruction. Again, today, we feel the same way.   Today, the question before the Senate is how we will find a path  forward on protecting our freedoms in the 21st century.   Members of this body now face a choice. They can follow in the  footsteps of our patriotic predecessors in this Chamber, or they can  sit by as the fabric of our democracy unravels before our very eyes.                            ____________________     I ask unanimous consent that the Senate resume  consideration of the Lin nomination.   The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there objection?   Without objection, it is so ordered.   The clerk will report the nomination.   The senior assistant bill clerk read the nomination of Tana Lin, of  Washington, to be United States District Judge for the Western District  of Washington.
