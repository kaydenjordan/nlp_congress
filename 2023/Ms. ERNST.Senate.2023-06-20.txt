 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Family Health Chiropractic of Sanborn, IA, as the Senate Small Business  of the Week.   Dr. Stacy Carlin founded Family Health Chiropractic in 2008 following  her graduation from the Palmer College of Chiropractic in Davenport.  The original location for her practice was in Waterloo, which she began  after Dr. Carlin and her husband Patrick moved to Cedar Falls following  graduation. In 2018, Patrick became the Hartley-Melvin Sanborn School  District superintendent. Dr. Carlin opened the Sanborn location that  year and traveled between the two locations until June 2019 when she  sold the Waterloo practice. Family Health Chiropractic continues to  operate at the former Vander Haag Museum building in Sanborn.   Dr. Carlin is a member of the International Chiropractic Pediatric  Association--ICPA. In 2012, she became a certified specialist in  pediatric and pregnancy care following 200 additional hours of training  through the ICPA's Academy Council of Chiropractic Pediatrics--CACCP-- and Webster Certification. Throughout her 15-year career, she has  treated patients of all ages, including patients as young as newborns.  Family Health Chiropractic is also a dedicated member of the Sanborn  Chamber of Commerce and active in the O'Brien County community. Family  Health Chiropractic hosted a ``Cookies with Santa'' event at the  Sanborn Community Center and sponsored ``Safe Kids Day'' at the Sanborn  Fire Station in 2022. The O'Brien County Economic Development  Corporation spotlighted Family Health Chiropractic in September 2022  for their dedicated service to continuing economic growth in the  county.   Family Health Chiropractic's commitment to providing care to patients  of all needs in Northwest Iowa is clear. I want to congratulate Dr.  Carlin, and the entire team at Family Health Chiropractic for their  continued dedication to the field of chiropractic medicine in rural  Iowa. I look forward to seeing their continued growth and success in  Iowa.                            ____________________
