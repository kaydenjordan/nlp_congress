 Madam Speaker, 234,088 illegal immigrants crossed the  southern border last month. That is a record-breaking number that I  take no pleasure in saying aloud. This surpassed the previous record of  221,303 set just in March.   In President Biden's first 15 months in office, Federal law  enforcement officials have stopped more than 2.75 million people  attempting to cross into the U.S. illegally. To put things in  perspective, that is more than the entire population of the Nashville,  Tennessee, metropolitan area.   Despite continuously breaking these records, the President has shown  absolutely no serious desire to stem the flow of illegal immigration,  as evidenced by his rescission of title 42 and his stopping of  construction on the border wall.   Madam Speaker, President Biden must do better.                            ____________________
