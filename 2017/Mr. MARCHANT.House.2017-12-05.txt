 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the Concealed  Carry Reciprocity Act.   The constitutional rights of law-abiding gun owners in my north Texas  district do not end when they cross State lines. The Second Amendment  protects the right of my constituents--and of all Texans and people  throughout our country--to keep and bear arms.   This week the House will vote on legislation allowing gun owners with  a State-issued concealed carry license to freely travel between State  lines.   Many States already acknowledge the concealed carry permit of another  State. The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act simply ensures the rights of  private citizens be upheld regardless of the State that they are in.   I cosponsored this legislation, and I will continue to stand up for  it. I urge the passage of this bill that will protect our  constitutional rights.                            ____________________
