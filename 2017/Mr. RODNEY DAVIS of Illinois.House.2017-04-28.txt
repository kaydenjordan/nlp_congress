 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor  Mannie Jackson, a legendary basketball player at both the University of  Illinois and Edwardsville High School, on his induction into the  Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.   Born in a railroad boxcar in southern Missouri, Mannie excelled at  Edwardsville High School before attending the University of Illinois.  He was one of the first African-American letter winners and starters  for the Illini. After graduating, Mannie played for the Harlem  Globetrotters.   While Mannie was a tremendous player, he also purchased the  Globetrotters and helped revive the franchise, leading the team to 12  straight years of double-digit growth.   Mannie also continued his career as a philanthropist. He founded the  Illinois  [[Page H2960]]  Academic Enrichment and Leadership Program at the University of  Illinois and has partnered with leaders at Lewis and Clark Community  College to create the Mannie Jackson Center for the Humanities.   I have had the privilege of meeting Mannie on multiple occasions and  have nothing but admiration and respect for what he does to help  others. It is an honor to congratulate him on his induction to the  Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, but I am even more proud to recognize  all of the contributions he has made to this world.                            ____________________
