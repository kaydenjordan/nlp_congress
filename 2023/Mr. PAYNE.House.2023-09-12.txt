 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the lack of  leadership from the House Republicans.   Today, we should be discussing how to fund our government and prevent  devastating service shutdowns for millions of Americans. Instead,  Republicans want to waste taxpayer dollars on a pointless impeachment  inquiry. Even House Republicans say there is no evidence for it.   Instead, they should look to President Biden as an example of true  leadership. His policies brought the economy back after the COVID-19  shutdown. They are repairing and rebuilding roads and bridges  nationwide. They are making America more energy independent, and they  are protecting American technology around the world.   Let us get back to doing the work of the American people and stop  using taxpayer dollars for revenge politics and unpopular political  agendas.                            ____________________
