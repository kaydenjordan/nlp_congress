 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I will speak on leader time. I know that  the Senators from Colorado and Virginia wish to follow.                            ____________________     Mr. President, yesterday, the Trump administration made  a terribly wrong decision to terminate the DACA Program. The Dreamers  came to this country through no fault of their own. Many know no other  country but this one. They work every single day in our businesses.  They go to our schools. They serve in our military. They are a boon to  our economy. All they want is to live, work, and contribute to this  country like generations have done before. They want to be Americans,  as so many people do, because we are such a great country.   Congress has the ability and, I believe, the responsibility to act  and to protect those Dreamers before the program is completely  terminated in 6 months. Why not do it right now? President Trump has  called on Congress to act; so why don't we?   I would ask my friend the majority leader and Speaker Ryan to put a  clean Dream Act on the floor in both Chambers in September. Every  Democrat is ready to vote for that legislation. We know many  Republicans in both Chambers would vote for it as well. It would likely  pass without much fuss. But if we can't get that to happen, we will add  it to vehicles that are moving--legislative vehicles--until we get it  done. It is that important to us and to America. We could solve this  problem tomorrow, rather than letting the fear of deportation hang over  the heads of 800,000 Dreamers, who are studying and working, and some  are in the military serving in the United States today.   So I would like, again, to say to Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan:  Put a clean Dream Act on the floor in a bipartisan vote. This body-- and, I believe, the House--is ready to pass it.   In a short time, Leader McConnell, Speaker Ryan, Leader Pelosi, and I  will head to the White House to meet with President Trump. We have a  lot we need to get done this month: an extension of government funding,  raising the debt ceiling, passing aid for the victims of Hurricane  Harvey, and protecting the Dreamers. So far, we Democrats haven't heard  much in the way of a plan to accomplish all these goals from the  Republican leadership, who hold the majority in both Houses of  Congress, as well as the President's seat. I hope that this changes  this morning. I look forward to hearing the President's plan and the  Republican majority's plan for accomplishing all these things that  Congress must accomplish in September.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, first, I want to thank my colleague from  Hawaii for her outstanding words. She comes from a State like mine that  thrives on diversity, welcoming people from all over the globe and  making us stronger, and she has been a symbol of that herself as well  as all the millions of wonderful people she represents in Hawaii.   I rise this afternoon alongside my colleague from Hawaii, my  colleague from Washington State, and others to make a case for the  swift passage of the Dream Act. There are 800,000 Dreamers living in  our country today, hard-working folks who came to this country through  no fault of their own. To many, America is the only country they have  ever known. More than that, they contribute so much to our country.  They work in our companies, go to our schools, even serve in our  military. All they want is to live and work and contribute to our great  country. Why wouldn't we want them to?   The President's decision yesterday to end DACA threw their futures in  doubt, threatening to rip apart families and telling people who have  worked so hard to become Americans that they have to leave the country.  The President's DACA decision is also bad economics. It would deprive  thousands of employers that rely on these hard workers.   The Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute estimates that ending DACA  would cost employers over $2 billion in 2 years alone. The Center for  American Progress found it would drain $433 billion from our GDP over  10 years. That is why more than 500 business leaders--some of the  leading business people in our country--have signed on to a letter in  defense of DACA. That is why Microsoft recently said that protecting  the Dreamers was their No. 1 legislative goal, greater than a cut to  the corporate tax rate. That is how much Dreamers mean to them  personally and to their bottom lines.   The economic consequence of ending DACA would be far-reaching and  likely devastating. There would also be a devastating moral cost if we  didn't pass the Dream Act to protect these kids.   I am reminded of a young woman, Kirssy Martinez, who was brought to  this country from the Dominican Republic as a very young child and grew  up in my city, in the borough of the Bronx. After graduating high  school in New York City, Kirssy was stuck in the shadows. She worked  small jobs as a waitress and as a babysitter. Though she was a good  student coming out of high school and even had a few scholarship  offers, she couldn't attend college because she didn't have a green  card.   The DACA Program granted her temporary legal status. She worked hard  to scrape together enough for loans and enrolled in Bronx Community  College. A few years ago, I spoke at her graduation, where she was the  covaledictorian of her class. I watched her. What a wonderful young  lady. She had a perfect GPA, 4.0.   Kirssy represents what we think of as the best of our country. She is  part of what makes America great. Like generations before her, she  wants to study hard, work hard, and give back to her community. What  kind of country would we be--what kind of country have we become if we  say that Kirssy and 800,000 hard-working folks just like her are not  welcome.   Congress has a responsibility to act. I know the Presiding Officer  sees it that way as well, and I very much appreciate it. We should do,  as soon as we can, whatever we can.   I repeat what I said to the majority leader and the Speaker of the  House this morning at the White House: Put a clean Dream Act on the  floor in both Houses. It will receive bipartisan support. I believe it  would pass by significant margins in each House. We could remove the  fear of deportation and give peace of mind to 800,000 Dreamers if only  our leadership would put the bill on the floor. It is that simple. If  we don't see a clean Dream Act in September, we, as the minority, are  prepared to attach it to legislative vehicles in the fall until it  passes.  [[Page S4987]]    These Dreamers are Americans in their hearts. They ought to become  Americans in the law books as well, and we Democrats will not rest  until that happens.   Thank you, and I yield the floor.
