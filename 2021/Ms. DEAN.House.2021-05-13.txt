 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2547.   First, I would like to thank and lift up Chairwoman Waters for  bringing up and authoring this important package, H.R. 2547, the  Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement Act, and for including two of  my bills in this legislation. We must work to ensure that debt  collection is fair, transparent, and free from harassment.   One of my two bills is in this package. It is the Fair Debt  Collection Practices for Servicemembers Act. It will protect our heroes  from unfair and aggressive debt harassment. These debt collection  practices are manipulative and can interfere with soldiers' careers,  like contacting their superior officers or threatening a rank  reduction.   Unfortunately, these practices do not stop with the servicemember.  Debt collectors also target military spouses, unfairly burdening our  military families who have sacrificed so much.                                time  1300    The language in this bill would specifically prohibit debt collectors  from  [[Page H2283]]  conveying any threat to a servicemember, or his or her dependents, to  have his or her rank reduced, their security clearance revoked, or  prosecution occur under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.   These tactics must stop; our servicemembers, men and women, make  extraordinary sacrifices on our behalf. I thank all the veterans and  servicemembers who work in my office, Tim, Dave, and Timmy, and my own  two brothers who have fought to protect our country.   I recognize and appreciate the bipartisan support for this bill.   My second bill in this package was written to correct an unfair  practice a constituent brought to our office's attention. A constituent  reached out for help getting a private student loan discharged because  her daughter had become completely and totally permanently disabled.  The mother was left with the remaining balance of the daughter's  private student loans as a cosigner.   The lending company said it was their policy to forgive the debt for  the borrower but not for the cosigner of the original agreement.  Further research by my office staff revealed there was no legal  operating standard for discharging private student loans for cosigners  after a permanent and total disability.   This is wrong. No one can anticipate permanent disability, and we  should work to decrease the burden that these people and their families  face, which is what the Private Loan Disability Discharge Act will  accomplish.   This legislation will require private student loan lenders to  discharge the loan balance for both the borrower and the cosigner if  the borrower becomes totally and permanently disabled.   This bill does not punish private lenders; it ensures all lenders are  following the same rules.   Both of these bills are about fairness and respect to the lender and  consumer, following the spirit of the entire Comprehensive Debt  Collection Improvement Act.   This bill would protect servicemembers, small and minority-owned  businesses, student loan borrowers, and those with disabilities,  medical debt, and more.   This package will place consumers and people first.   Again, I thank Chairwoman Waters for her leadership, and I urge all  of our colleagues to join me in supporting this important consumer and  constituent protection legislation.
