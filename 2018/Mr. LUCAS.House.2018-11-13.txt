 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman  from Oklahoma, the Honorable Kevin Hern, be permitted to take the oath  of office today.   His certificate of election has not arrived, but there is no contest  and no question has been raised with regard to his election.    Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, it is a tremendous pleasure  today to introduce our newest colleague from Tulsa, Oklahoma, the great  First District of Oklahoma.   Having been a special election baby myself a long time ago, the  pressure, the significance of our colleagues when they stand before you  in the unique way that they are sworn in is tremendous. So the advice  that I have given Congressman Hern I will try and practice myself:  brevity.   Born on an Air Force base, worked all of his life, earned a degree in  engineering and an MBA degree. The thing I love the most, perhaps, is a  hog farmer at one point in his career and a very successful  restaurateur.   Kevin is an individual who is a reflection of the great First  District of Tulsa. He is a reflection, I think, of what we need and  want in a Member of this United States House of Representatives.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield to our newest colleague from Oklahoma  (Mr. Hern).
