 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2480) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets  Act of 1968 to include an additional permissible use of amounts  provided as grants under the Byrne JAG program, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2480         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Empowering Law Enforcement       to Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act''.       SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZED USE OF BYRNE JAG FUNDS.         Section 501(a)(1) of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe       Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3751(a)(1)) is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(I) Programs to combat human trafficking (including       programs to reduce the demand for trafficked persons).''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous materials on H.R. 2480, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Today, Mr. Speaker, we continue our battle against the scourge of  human trafficking with H.R. 2480, the Empowering Law Enforcement to  Fight Sex Trafficking Demand Act. This bill, introduced by our  colleague, Congresswoman Hartzler of Missouri, adds antihuman  trafficking efforts as an allowable use for funds under the Byrne JAG  program, the Justice Department's flagship grant program for State and  local governments and law enforcement. It specifies that the JAG funds  may be used for demand reduction operations.   Mr. Speaker, there is no question that the fight against human  trafficking starts at the local level. It infects every community, and  our local officials and law enforcement are on the front lines in this  battle. They are in the best position to assess how to address this  issue in their communities and how to use these taxpayer dollars.   As part of any comprehensive approach in combating trafficking, local  government and law enforcement must address what many call the demand  issue; that is, going after those who are buying young victims off the  street and, very often, off the internet. This is simple economics  applied to a horrific crime.   Human trafficking is driven by the demand for commercial sex, and  this is costing victims their sense of worth and their dignity. By  deterring demand, traffickers will have fewer buyers and may abandon  their illegal and horrifyingly reprehensible activity.   These demand reduction operations and programs are most often carried  out at the local level, and it is important to ensure local governments  have the tools they need to prevent this destructive crime by deterring  people from buying victims.                                time  1530    We cannot tolerate sex trafficking and must be able to act swiftly to  combat this horrific crime. H.R. 2480 ensures our communities will be  able to do just that.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congresswoman Hartzler for introducing  this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support her bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to  the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), the chief sponsor of  this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  thank Members on both sides of the aisle for their hard work on this,  especially the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler) for taking the  lead on this, also the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Clay), as well as  the ranking member of the full Judiciary Committee, Mr. Conyers; and of  the subcommittee, Ms. Jackson Lee; and the subcommittee chair, Mr.  Sensenbrenner.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this very  important legislation that will help direct important resources to  State and local governments to reduce demand for sex trafficking, and  help to maybe protect and save a few young people and other people from  this horrible crime.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
