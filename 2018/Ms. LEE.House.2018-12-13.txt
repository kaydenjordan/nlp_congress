 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight my new bill, the  Ronald V. Dellums Memorial Fellowship for Women of Color in STEAM and  National Security Act.   I am thrilled to introduce this forward-looking bill which will  create a pipeline for women of color working in the STEAM fields  through new national security fellowships.   This bill is named after a great statesman and former chair of the  [[Page H10191]]  House Armed Services Committee, my mentor, my former boss, the late  Congressman Ron Dellums. Congressman Dellums broke barriers as the  first Black chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. He was also  an avid champion of diversity at all levels.   In the 1970s, he hired me to work on his staff as one of the only  women of color in a senior role on Capitol Hill. He was a pioneer and a  visionary who understood the need for elevating women of color in every  field.   That is why my bill, which has the support of organizations like the  Civic Engagement and Leadership Institute for Everyone is so important.  It will help honor Ron's legacy, build greater diversity in national  security, and create much more STEAM opportunities for women of color.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me by cosponsoring my bill,  the Ronald Dellums Memorial Fellowship for Women of Color in STEAM and  National Security Act.                            ____________________
