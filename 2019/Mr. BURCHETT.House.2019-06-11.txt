 Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of  H.R. 962, the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, and ask for  its immediate consideration in the House.    Mr. Speaker, if this unanimous consent request cannot  be entertained, I urge the Speaker and the majority leader to  immediately schedule the Born-Alive bill because survivors of abortion  deserve protection, and the American people deserve a vote on this  bill.    Mr. Speaker?    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee  on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 962.    Mr. Speaker?  [[Page H4424]]     Mr. Speaker, I suggest to you that Congress is out of  order when we fail to protect the least amongst us.
