 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   The problem is that this is not the way we are supposed to go about  the business of oversight. Contempt resolutions are generally something  that happens deep inside and deep within an ongoing investigation when  the committee has run up against brick walls and has exhausted all  possibilities before then.   That is certainly not the case here. We are in the middle of an  investigation into Federal agencies that are complying with our  requests. This is absurd.                                time  1515    The Oversight and Reform Committee has held six transcribed  interviews with witnesses. Another one is on the way within days. The  Commerce Department and the Justice Department have produced over  31,000 pages, documents, combined--14,000 from Commerce and 17,000 from  Justice. These are not things that happen when we are talking about  Federal agencies that are stonewalling an investigation. That simply is  not what is happening here.   This investigation has only been going on for a couple of short  months. I would like to remind this Chamber that it wasn't too long ago  that then-Ranking Member Cummings was cautioned himself against  pursuing a resolution of contempt in 2012, and that was after a year of  stonewalling by the Obama administration. We are just a couple of  months into this one.   If these Federal agencies were legitimately stonewalling an  investigation, as the Obama administration did, I would certainly feel  differently, and I am sure others here would, as well. But they are not  stonewalling, and the facts simply don't support this contempt  resolution.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues not to support this.
