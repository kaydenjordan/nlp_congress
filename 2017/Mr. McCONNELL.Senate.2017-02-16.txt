 Mr. President, in just a few minutes we will have an  opportunity to confirm the nominee for the Office of Management and  Budget. I had several things to say about him yesterday. Now I want to  talk about the nominee we can advance after that confirmation vote.   Let me start by saying this. We all want clean water. We all want  clean air. Promoting these goals is supposed to be the mission of the  Environmental Protection Agency, but under the Obama administration,  the agency's leadership prioritized partisan politics instead. It  pursued policies that often put political benefits ahead of  environmental ones. It ignored laws. It acted beyond its authority. It  even treated middle-class coal families as enemies and then attacked  them without a real sense of compassion.   The nominee before us, Oklahoma attorney general Scott Pruitt, thinks  it is time for the EPA to get back to the business of clean air and  clean water instead, and to do so with an appreciation for the  complexity of our modern world, with awareness of the broader economy,  with compassion toward those impacted, with respect for the rule of law  and the rights of State and local governments.   Pruitt has earned the support of countless groups across the country,  from State environmental protection officers to agricultural leaders.  He has the bipartisan backing of dozens of his fellow attorneys general  as well. They say he is someone who is ``committed to clean air and  clean water,'' one who is apt to ``come to Congress for a solution,  rather than inventing power'' for himself.   What a welcome change. What a welcome change from the previous  administration.   This is from a predecessor of Pruitt's in the attorney general's  office, Democrat Mike Turpen:         As a Democrat, I take seriously the threats to our       environment. . . . I may not agree with all the President-      elect's policies or nominees, but I do know that Oklahoma       Attorney General Scott Pruitt is a good choice to head up the       Environmental Protection Agency.        Scott Pruitt's background in constitutional law, combined       with a nuanced understanding of how environmental regulations       affect the economy, mean that he will be a thoughtful leader       of the EPA, and one capable of striking the balance between       protecting the environment and our economy.    Here is another Democratic attorney general:         I am a Member of the Democratic National Committee and was       a strong supporter of Secretary Clinton's campaign for       President. I believe in the core mission of the Environmental       Protection Agency.    And the nominee before us is known to him as ``a staunch defender of  sound science and good policy as appropriate tools to protect the  environment of his State.''   As one Democratic Senator put it, Scott Pruitt simply has ``the right  experience for the position.''   He is exceptionally qualified. He is dedicated to environmental  protection, and, as someone with State government experience, he  understands the real world consequences of EPA actions  [[Page S1224]]  and knows that balance is the key to making policies that are  sustainable over the long term. Pruitt is just the candidate we need at  the helm of the EPA.   We should confirm him. Doing so will represent another positive  change in Washington that can give hope to families in Kentucky and  across the Nation who are still recovering from the last 8 years.                            ____________________     Mr. President, here is something else that will give  cheer to Kentucky families. I am pleased to report that today the  President will sign a resolution identical to a proposal I introduced,  a resolution that will undo a harmful regulation that could threaten  nearly one-third of America's coal mining jobs. I am looking forward to  attending that signing ceremony later today.   This resolution is just one of several that we hope to send to the  President to begin providing the American people with relief,  protecting jobs, and growing our economy. It reflects promises made and  promises kept.                            ____________________     Mr. President, now on another matter, let me begin  with a statement of the obvious. ObamaCare is a disaster, an absolute  disaster. Just one in five Americans say their families are better off  since it went into effect. More actually say they are worse off. And,  really, is it any wonder?   Americans were promised that costs would go down, but in fact they  skyrocketed. Americans were promised choice, but it shriveled. We have  been warning that choices would continue their downward decline under  the ObamaCare status quo, and that is just what we saw this very week.  One large national insurer announced it was being forced from the  marketplace altogether--meaning thousands, including many in Kentucky,  will lose their current health plans, thanks to ObamaCare.   The CEO of another major insurer predicted more insurers would soon  follow--meaning thousands could find themselves without a single choice  of health coverage, thanks to ObamaCare. This partisan law has entered  a ``death spiral,'' the CEO warned, and ``it is not going to get any  better; it's getting worse.''   This should be a wake-up call to the do-nothing crowd on the left.  ObamaCare isn't working. It isn't sustainable, and it is going to  continue attacking the middle class until it is repealed and replaced.   We have already begun the process here in Congress. We are going to  continue working hand in hand with the administration to get it done.  In the meantime, there is much the administration can do to help bring  calm out of the chaos from ObamaCare's broken promises. That is  especially true of Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, who  was finally confirmed after weeks of unprecedented obstruction from  across the aisle.   We saw a great example yesterday of what he can do to help stabilize  the insurance market and protect consumers. The commonsense reforms he  issued can help put downward pressure on costs and help prevent the  fraud and abuse that ultimately hurt everyone. I commend him for taking  these important first steps. They will help provide relief for  Americans as broader efforts are made to address the underlying  concerns with ObamaCare.   The status quo on ObamaCare is simply unsustainable. Congress will  continue working to repeal and replace it with commonsense, step-by- step reforms. As we do, I hope the administration will continue using  its existing authority to protect Americans from the unnecessary harm  of this broken law.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, Neil Gorsuch is  one of the most impressive Supreme Court nominees we have ever seen.  His resume is a mile long, his reputation is second to none, and his  record is literally something to behold.   In nearly a decade on the circuit court, his work was so outstanding,  the Supreme Court didn't need to check it very often. In fact, as we  recently learned from his Judiciary Committee questionnaire, the High  Court felt the need to review on the merits an opinion he offered only  once in 10 years. In that one case, a broad cross section of the  Justices on the Court voted to affirm his work, with Justices Ginsburg,  Breyer, and Sotomayor joining Justices Thomas and Alito in affirming  his opinion.   Let me put that in context. Out of 240 opinions Judge Gorsuch wrote  for the Tenth Circuit or where he authored a concurrence or dissent-- not to mention the 500 additional unpublished dispositions he has  written--the Supreme Court reviewed only one--one of his cases on the  merits, and it affirmed the one case.   As for the cases where Judge Gorsuch did not write the opinion but  joined in the opinion of his colleagues, the Supreme Court reviewed  five of those cases, and the Court affirmed four out of five. So even  including opinions that Judge Gorsuch did not author but joined, his  overall record in the Supreme Court is being affirmed in five out of  six cases.   How does that record compare to some of his would-be colleagues on  the Supreme Court?   Well, President Obama's first nominee, Sonia Sotomayor also was a  circuit court judge before she was appointed to the Supreme Court, and  she was a circuit court judge for about the same amount of time as  Judge Gorsuch has been, approximately a decade.   The Supreme Court reviewed on the merits five opinions she authored  as a circuit court judge. But the Court reversed her most of the time-- reversing her three out of five times. And in one of those two cases  that it affirmed, the Supreme Court unanimously rejected her reasoning  in doing so, finding that it ``flies in the face of the statutory  language.''   So the Supreme Court actually rejected the approach of then Judge  Sotomayor in four out of five opinions she authored.   Our Democratic colleagues are insistent that we have someone  mainstream appointed to the Court, with the definition of mainstream,  of course, being determined by their particular worldview. Since all of  our Democratic colleagues who were here when her nomination to the  Supreme Court was pending supported Justice Sotomayor, I know that they  found her to be mainstream. Given that Judge Gorsuch's record before  the Court he seeks to join is quite a bit better than hers, I assume  they would concede, even if grudgingly, that as measured by one's  record before the Supreme Court as a lower court judge, Judge Gorsuch  is at least as ``mainstream'' as she is.    With Judge Gorsuch's impressive record before the Supreme Court and  other impressive qualities, it is no wonder, then, that both sides of  the political spectrum can't help but praise him. I have shared some of  that praise already from those who have worked alongside him, from  those who have studied underneath him, and now some thoughts from those  who appeared before him.   Let me read to my colleagues from an article that appeared just a few  days ago in the Albuquerque Journal:         Local attorneys from across the political spectrum who have       appeared before U.S. Supreme Court nominee Judge Neil Gorsuch       call him a ``gentleman,'' ``extraordinarily affable,'' and       ``an exceptional nomination.'' As a Federal Court of Appeals       judge posted in Denver for the last 10 years, Gorsuch has       ruled on numerous cases from New Mexico, giving many local       attorneys an up-close view of the man who could fill the seat       of the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.    Here is one local lawyer who praised his fairness:         He is an enormous intellect, a really, really bright guy. .       . . He'll be one of the brightest justices on that court--if       not the brightest. It was always a pleasure to be in front of       him because whether you won or lost, you knew you were going       to be treated fairly.    Here is another lawyer, a Democrat who appeared before him a dozen or  so times, mostly on civil rights cases:         Gorsuch is not an ``ideologue.'' Politics aside, Judge       Gorsuch would be someone good for the judiciary and the       country. People should rest assured that he would always try       to make the most learned and just decision and politics would       not be a consideration or factor in his decisions. . . . And       that's from me, and I'm a longtime Democrat.    Here is one more who noted the legacy he has already left behind:         Gorsuch has placed 11 of his (Appeals Court) clerks with       Supreme Court justices,  [[Page S1225]]       so he is in the very top. And not only has he placed them,       his law clerks go all over the place. They've clerked for       Kennedy, Scalia, Thomas, and they've also clerked for Kagan       and Sotomayor. . . . This is a really good indicator of what       the justices think of this guy before he was even a nominee       to the Supreme Court. It's like a Good Housekeeping seal of       approval. And it cuts across the political spectrum.    In other words, clerks of Judge Gorsuch have gone on to clerk for  Supreme Court Justices across the ideological spectrum.   Speaking of those who have clerked for Sonia Sotomayor, we recently  heard a testimonial from an Obama administration lawyer who clerked for  both Sotomayor and Gorsuch. ``I don't think folks on the Left should be  concerned about Judge Gorsuch becoming a Supreme Court Justice,'' she  said. ``He is extraordinarily fair-minded . . . [h]e will approach each  case the same, regardless of the issue or the parties before him, and  he will have a great deal of respect for folks on all sides of the  ideological spectrum.''   That is very high praise. It is coming from both sides of the aisle.  And I am sure we will hear even more of it as the days go by.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote on the  nomination, I move to table the motion to reconsider.

I object.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, a vote in relation to the  motion to extend debate on the Pruitt nomination occur at 12:30 p.m.  today, and that following disposition of that motion, there be 4  minutes of debate equally divided in the usual form prior to a vote on  the nomination.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  following disposition of the Pruitt nomination, the Senate resume  consideration of the following nominations en bloc: Wilbur Ross to be  Secretary of Commerce, Ryan Zinke to be Secretary of Interior, Ben  Carson to be Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and Rick Perry  to be Secretary of Energy.   I further ask unanimous consent that there be 30 minutes of debate on  the  [[Page S1367]]  nominations, equally divided in the usual form, and that following the  use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the nominations in the  order listed with no intervening action or debate.    Madam President, over the past several weeks, we have  seen a historic level of obstruction from our Democratic colleagues on  the President's Cabinet. Let me say that again--truly historic,  unprecedented, harmful, and pointless obstruction. It is one thing to  obstruct to get some outcome. Really, these are a collection of futile  gestures not changing the outcome on any of these nominations.   They have postponed committee meetings as long as they possibly  could. They forced unnecessary procedural hurdles, and they have even  boycotted markups altogether.   So as I indicated, to what end? It hasn't prevented the Senate from  moving forward with the confirmation of these nominees. And, by the  way, it hasn't--and it won't--change the outcome of the election,  either, which was back in November. I think it is pretty clear that  that is what this is all about.   Instead, this Democratic obstruction has just kept many of our  Nation's most critical agencies without a leader for too long-- needlessly delaying the President from fully standing up this new  administration. It has led to what is now the longest it has taken to  confirm most of the President's Cabinet since George Washington--what a  record for our Democratic colleagues to hold.   Enough is enough. We need to put the rest of the President's Cabinet  into place without further delay. Confirming these well-qualified  nominees is what is best for our country. My goodness, isn't that what  we should all want?   I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes  following the first vote in the series be 10 minutes in length.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote on the  nomination, and I move to table the motion to reconsider.
