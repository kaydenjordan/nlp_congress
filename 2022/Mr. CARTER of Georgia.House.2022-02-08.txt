 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor the 80th anniversary of the Mighty Eighth Air Force unit. The  Mighty Eighth Air Force was organized in Savannah, Georgia, on January  28 in 1942. It was comprised of 48 bomber groups, 21 fighter groups,  and three photo reconnaissance groups, making it the largest of its  kind at the time.   The Mighty Eighth was utilized heavily over the course of World War  II, participating in primarily heavy bombardment of strategic and  military targets in Nazi-occupied Europe and Germany. The Mighty Eighth  Air Force Museum opened its doors in 1996, in Pooler, Georgia, during  my tenure as mayor. It tells the heroic story of the Mighty Eighth,  along with the story of World War II.   Featuring a B-17 project from the National Air and Space Museum, a  fire truck used at Hunter Army Airfield in Savannah, along with  multiple other aircraft and state-of-the-art technology, the Mighty  Eighth Air Force Museum is a remarkable tribute to our brave soldiers.   The celebration kicked off on the 28th of January and events will be  held throughout the year to celebrate this momentous occasion. I am  proud to have been involved in the construction and dedication of this  tribute to American heroism and want to thank the staff and supporters  for making this celebration possible.                              Honoring Gus Bell     Madam Speaker, I rise today in gratitude for  the service of a friend and an instrumental member of the First  District of Georgia, Mr. Gus Bell.   Gus is a proud graduate of The Citadel, where he received a  bachelor's degree in civil engineering. From The Citadel, he continued  his education at the University of Kentucky. Gus Bell has worked in  every aspect of engineering, starting his career with U.S. Army Corps  of Engineers in Virginia and Albuquerque before joining his private  firm.   I am proud to call Gus Bell a friend and have had the pleasure and  opportunity to work with him throughout the years. He has had an  enormous impact on my career. The work that Gus has done to better the  First District is nothing short of remarkable and deserves recognition.   The red brick waterfront, Rousakis Plaza, in Savannah and the I-95  corridor in Pooler are just examples of how Gus' expertise has led to  growth and new development for the great State of Georgia. His  commitment to his community is an inspiration, and I cherish the time  we had to work together.   Gus is an example of a servant to others, and we are very grateful  for his years of work and commitment. Thank you, my friend.                 Recognizing Jekyll Island's 75th Anniversary     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor Jekyll Island's 75th anniversary as a State park. Under Governor  M.E. Thompson, Jekyll Island was purchased in 1947 and Jekyll  authorities will be having events throughout 2022 to celebrate 75  years.   This island has been a vacation spot for Georgians across the State  for decades, and it will continue to be for years to come. Recently,  Jekyll has experienced increasing growth with the construction of a  hotel in 2010, parks, camp sites, public beaches, and more.   The biggest addition to Jekyll Island was conducted in 2015 with a  revamped shopping center, Beach Village, hotels, and the Westin Jekyll  Island opening. I had the privilege of attending the kickoff  celebration, complete with fireworks and synchronized swimmers, and am  excited for what the rest of 2022 has in store for Jekyll.   COVID hit the hospitality industry especially hard and Jekyll Island  was no exception. Through resiliency, hard work, and a dedicated  community, Jekyll Island will be back in full force and better than  ever.   This great Georgia vacation spot will be back on the map as a must- see for residents and people across the country.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  honor Joe Willie Sousa for being inducted into the Georgia Association  of Broadcasters Hall of Fame.   Joe is no stranger to the Georgia broadcasting awards scene, as he  also earned the Best Pandemic Coverage Award. In the face of a public  health crisis, Joe's knowledge and expertise helped educate listeners  on issues of supreme importance to them. He developed this experience  as an on-air radio personality for several stations over his four  decades-long career.   His career began in the 1970s when he took a chance to get into  broadcasting while working at a Winn-Dixie in Brunswick. He had planned  to attend the University of Georgia after graduating high school but  got his big break when he was introduced to Ed Wright and began working  on a radio show from 7 to midnight.   After only a year of work, and showing off his natural talent, Joe  had shown he was more than capable, and Wright offered him a spot on  the morning show. The rest, as they say, is history.   Since that day, Joe has broadcast his personality across the  airwaves, and we hope to continue to hear from him for years to come.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding and I thank him for hosting this night.   Mr. Speaker, for years, Democrats have been pushing this ``defund the  police'' rhetoric that has demonized our law enforcement officers and  left them unequipped and abandoned by their government. Now, we are  paying the price.   In the year 2021, 73 of our bravest police officers lost their lives  in defense of their country and their communities. This is a 59 percent  increase from 2020 and the most that we have had since 1995. This is  utterly unacceptable. The language from top Democrats empowers those  that wish to do harm upon others and leaves our law enforcement  stranded with nowhere to look for aid.    After an entire year of this detrimental rhetoric, at least 16 U.S.  cities have set new homicide records in 2021, 346 officers were shot,  and we saw 115 percent increase in ambush-style attacks on law  enforcement from 2020. Democrats aren't just downplaying the impacts of  their soft-on-crime rhetoric, they are completely ignoring it.   Shoplifting in California and New York has gotten so bad that it is  now mocked on social media and offenders simply walk into a store, grab  what they want, and walk out. The First Congressional District of  Georgia is unfortunately no exception to this current trend.   In the first half of 2021, violent increased 7 percent, property  crimes rose 10 percent, and shoplifting has risen 9 percent, all in  Savannah alone.   Folks, this rhetoric is harmful. It hurts our communities, it hurts  our law enforcement, and it hurts our constituents. We must put a stop  to this and reinforce the fact that we have the backs of our police  officers. This issue is of the utmost importance, and I call upon  President Biden to say, unequivocally, that he supports our men and  women in blue.
