 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3299, the  Protecting Consumers' Access to Credit Act.   I thank my good friend from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry) for his  leadership on this bipartisan, commonsense bill.   This is a commonsense piece of legislation that is sponsored by two  Republicans, two Democrats. It passed out of our committee with a vote  of 42-17. It is the kind of bipartisan solution that the American  people expect from their elected officials.   Yet, opponents of this bill want people to believe that it will hurt  consumers. We heard similar rhetoric on the recent tax bill passed in  Congress. In fact, we still hear it, even though millions of Americans  are getting bonuses, taking new and better jobs, and seeing their  savings account grow.   Now, let's be clear. This bill will allow banks and credit unions to  sell certain loans to investors, thus diversifying their risk and  freeing up capital that can be used to issue more loans in local  communities. Imagine that.   Why is this commonsense legislation necessary?   A recent case out of the Second Circuit ruled that certain loans  would be valid when held on the books of a bank, but would be invalid  the minute they are sold to investors.   I fail to see how a loan becomes more dangerous, usurious, or  otherwise problematic because the owner of the loan has changed. This  is like saying a house's roof becomes leaky the minute you sell it to  your neighbor. This is the sort of logic that can only thrive in  Washington.   What happens when banks and credit unions can no longer sell loans on  the public market?   They issue fewer loans. Fewer young parents can get a mortgage for  their new home. Fewer single mothers can get a loan for a new car.  Fewer students can get a critical loan to pay for their first year of  college. Fewer businesses can get loans to bring innovative ideas to  the market to create jobs.   This bill is not rent-a-bank. It will not result in usurious interest  rates.   I recently was at a restaurant and I struck up a conversation with  the waitress. She can't get a mortgage. She can't buy a home, even  though she and her husband have good credit. That is the kind of  problem we are trying to address.   Mr. Speaker, I would ask the opponents of this bill to put aside  politics and to join me in supporting legislation that will help young  families, new businesses, and students. This bill will make credit  accessible, and I urge all Members to vote for it.                                time  1500
