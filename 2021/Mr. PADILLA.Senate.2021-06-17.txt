 Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Accountability  for Federal Law Enforcement Act.''   This legislation recognizes the need to hold bad actors accountable-- period.   In order to build trust in our system of justice, we must allow  individuals the right to sue Federal law enforcement agencies when the  actions of  [[Page S4626]]  their officers lead to a violation of rights.   This legislation would provide a right of action for an individual to  sue a Federal law enforcement officer and agency for harm resulting  from a violation of their civil and constitutional rights.   42 USC Sec. 1983 currently provides this right of action for state  and local law enforcement officers who violate a person's rights.  However, there is currently no statutory equivalent that extends this  right to incidents involving federal law enforcement officers and  agencies.   Because Americans lack this right, there is a gap in accountability  that urgently needs to be filled. This legislation fills that gap by  allowing individuals to sue federal officers, just as they can sue  state and local officers. It would also allow individuals to sue  federal law enforcement agencies. The United States Supreme Court has  recognized that the federal government will not be liable in suit  unless it waives its immunity and consents. This legislation recognizes  the need for such a waiver.   While extending this right will not automatically end all cases of  abuse by certain law enforcement officers, it will give the American  people an important tool to fight against injustice while also  demonstrating that the time is now to address police brutality.   While the United States Supreme Court has addressed the absence of a  right of action against Federal officers before, the scope of the  provided ``remedy'' has been kept extremely narrow. Without a statute  in place, this right will continue to be under-utilized and could  disappear whenever the Court sees fit.   Americans deserve better. We all deserve to have our constitutional  rights respected, and we deserve a system that will hold bad actors  accountable. This is too urgent a need to go unaddressed.   Public safety is a two-way street. We, as citizens, honor our  officers and trust law enforcement to keep our streets safe and  peaceful. In return, we expect officers to be held to account for bad  behavior. Anything less undermines public safety.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the  ``Accountability for Federal Law Enforcement Act'' as quickly as  possible.   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Cassidy, Mr. Brown, Ms. Klobuchar,          Mr. Sanders, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Merkley, and Mr. Casey):   S. 2108. A bill to amend title II of the Social Security Act to  eliminate work disincentives for childhood disability beneficiaries; to  the Committee on Finance.
