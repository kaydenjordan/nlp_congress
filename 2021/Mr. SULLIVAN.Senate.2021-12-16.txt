 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up  to 10 minutes prior to the vote.    Mr. President, the next vote is going to be a motion to  discharge from the Judiciary Committee Judge Holly Thomas for the U.S.  Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. I am going to vote no because I  have not had the opportunity to actually meet Judge Thomas.   In a remarkable undermining of senatorial tradition, the Biden  administration White House is now saying that no Senator is allowed to  meet a circuit court judge prior to the confirmation vote of that  judge.   The Presiding Officer might be tilting his head at me like that seems  crazy. Well, it is crazy. Every Ninth Circuit judge--a court of appeals  that has enormous power over my State--who has been nominated by any  President since I have been a U.S. Senator, I have met with to discuss  issues. This is part of our advice-and-consent role. Yet this White  House is now saying no Senator can meet with a circuit court judge,  even for an hour, prior to the vote despite the fact that they are  getting ready to have life tenure.   This is in line with this administration and with, unfortunately,  some of my Democratic colleagues who are just smashing institutional  norms in this body that have significant bipartisan support.   We saw the junior Senator from Massachusetts yesterday saying she  wants to pack the Supreme Court. I am sure that is going to lead to a  charge of other Democrat Senators. My colleagues are all very focused  on getting rid of the filibuster despite the fact that more than half  the Democratic conference, in April of 2017, wrote a letter to the  majority and minority leaders of the Senate, saying: Don't get rid of  the filibuster. Now only Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema seem to be the  ones defending it. I would love it if the press asked questions of the  other 26 of my Democratic colleagues who, just 4 years ago, said: Don't  do this. But this norm that is being undermined right now--of Senators  being able to meet with nominees to circuit courts--is a new low.   I raised this with senior Biden administration White House officials  just last week, and they said they would look into it. They seemed a  little confused. The White House Counsel for the President finally  called me back after I had been trying to get ahold of her because I  had heard it was her idea. Then I asked her ``Why are you doing this?''   By the way, the Trump administration didn't do this. To the contrary,  [[Page S9235]]  their White House Counsel actually tried to get Republican and Democrat  Senators to meet with circuit court nominees to help maybe get  bipartisan votes. So it wasn't the precedent of the previous  administration.   The White House Counsel actually told me--she used this language:  ``We are doing it to protect the judges''--``to protect the judges.''  From what--Senators doing their constitutional duty? What are they  hiding? Are they really that unimpressive that they have to have their  own nominees being protected from us here in the Senate?    So the bottom line is that all of this is patently absurd, and I  think many of my Democratic colleagues actually agree with me. I have  talked to a number of them, and I don't think this is a precedent that  anyone who is a U.S. Senator should want, whether you are a Democrat or  a Republican.   Remember, these judges are going to have enormous power over the  people we represent, and they are going to have life tenure. It is not  like voting for an Assistant Secretary who will be 2, 3, 4 years on the  job. This is life tenure, and they can't take an hour out of their time  prior to the vote to meet with Senators.   I asked these judges in a speech just last week: Hey, give me a call.  You don't have to get permission from the White House. This is actually  a first test of your judicial independence. Call me. I want to talk to  you.   We didn't hear back from any judges, and the White House is still  blocking it.   What is really surprising is that the current President is the former  chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee. I wonder if he actually knows  what is going on with his senior staff of his White House Counsel  where, right now, no Member of the U.S. Senate who is trying to do his  advice-and-consent constitutional role can even meet--can even meet-- with a circuit court judge. I am pretty sure most of my colleagues  don't agree with this.   What I am hoping for is to get the White House to change its outlook  on this, to follow the example of the Trump administration--I know that  might be a hard swallow--and have these judges meet with us.   When I meet with them, I talk about Alaska legal issues, and if you  are a judge who grew up in L.A. and you are an L.A. judge, you don't  know anything about Alaska, but you will have an enormous impact on the  people I represent.   So I think what you are going to see until we get some cooperation  with the White House is that I hope most of my colleagues, Republican  colleagues, whether they think these nominees are qualified or not, are  going to vote no. They are going to vote no, and the reason is a core  principle: We should be able to do advice and consent.   If there were a Republican President in the White House and if some  of my Democratic colleagues said ``Hey, can you help me get a meeting  with a circuit court nominee who is going to have big impacts on my  State?'' I would certainly do it. Like I said, we didn't have to do it  the last time because that was the Trump administration's standard  operating procedure.   I hope we can get to an agreement on this, and I hope all Senators  can agree with this. I am hopeful that you are going to see, at least  with my colleagues, that there are going to be no ``yes'' votes on any  of these nominees, and that is not good. These circuit court judges  want a bipartisan confirmation. Well, they are not going to get it  until we are able to do our constitutional duty of advice and consent  for judges, life-tenured judges, who have enormous power over the  people we represent.   I am hopeful that every Member of this body can work with us, work  with me, work with the White House, maybe even call the President and  say: Do you know what? This is probably a standard principle that you  guys want to get rid of. Making sure U.S. Senators cannot meet with  judges who are going to have lifetime tenure is smashing a bipartisan  institutional norm. That is not going to serve this body well at all.   I yield the floor, and I encourage my colleagues to all vote no in  the upcoming vote to discharge this nominee until we can actually talk  to her and see what kind of judge she would be. This is a very, very  reasonable position, so I strongly urge a ``no'' vote from all of my  colleagues.    Mr. President, I ask my friend and colleague from  Illinois, who is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, if he could  actually work with us--I have already reached out to him and some other  Democrat Senators--on this very reasonable request. He has been here a  lot longer than I have. But every time there is a Ninth Circuit judge  who has been nominated, I have met with him because it is so important  to my State. Alaska has 1 Ninth Circuit judge, and there are 29 judges  on the court.   So I would ask, respectfully, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee  to work with me because this is a precedent that I don't think any  Senator, Democrat or Republican, wants.   Literally, you are going to have the White House saying ``You know  what? You are not on the Judiciary Committee, so your advice-and- consent role under article II, section 2, is null and void'' because  the White House Counsel wants to ``protect the judges''? Protect them  from what?   So I want to work with my colleagues--all of them--particularly the  chairman of the Judiciary Committee, as he has a lot of influence, I am  sure, with the White House and the White House Counsel's Office, but,  again, I encourage my colleagues to vote no until we start getting  meetings and are able to do our duty. This is going to benefit my  colleagues on both sides of the aisle over the long term, and it will  strengthen this body, not weaken it, which is what is happening right  now.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  allowed to speak for up to 20 minutes and Senator Menendez for up to 5  minutes before the scheduled rollcall votes.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I introduced a resolution with  Senator Murkowski celebrating the 50th anniversary of the Alaska Native  Claims Settlement Act--ANCSA, as we call it back home in Alaska--which  was an enormously consequential piece of legislation that, after years  and years of debate right in this body, passed the House, then passed  the U.S. Senate, and then was signed into law by President Nixon on  December 18, 1971, almost exactly 50 years ago to this day. It was a  great day for Alaska.   I know Senator Murkowski was on the floor earlier talking about ANCSA  and why it is so important and why in Alaska, right now, we have been  celebrating 50 years of this important piece of legislation.   I want to go back in time a little bit to help explain, because part  of what Senator Murkowski and I do here is we are constantly talking  about and educating our colleagues about this very unique legislation,  which happened right here in the U.S. Senate.   If you go back in time to 1867, that is when the United States  purchased Alaska from Russia. Within the agreement, there was  acknowledgement of the Alaska Native people and their lands, but,  still, almost 100 years after the purchase from Russia, even following  statehood for Alaska, the claims settlement that the Native people had  to their own lands was still in limbo.   It got a kick and a turbo charge when oil was discovered on Alaska's  North Slope during a worldwide shortage, which created new urgency to  develop Alaska for our resources but to do so by settling these land  claims.   There were allies in the Federal Government who were helpful, but it  was truly the Alaska Native people and their determination to  themselves and to future generations and their resiliency and  brilliance which led to the passage of ANCSA 50 years ago, which became  the largest and, certainly, most innovative indigenous land settlement,  certainly, in U.S. history, and it is no exaggeration to say probably  in the world--44 million acres of land going to the Native people of my  State.   It brought tremendous educational, social, political, economic, and  cultural achievements for the Alaska Native people. It certainly wasn't  perfect, but this body played a very important role.   Now, there were obstacles, challenges. In fact, when you look back on  the history over 50 years ago, it was kind of a classic David-and- Goliath story.   Let me spend a few minutes going back in time to set the stage for  what was happening in Alaska.   In 1954, the U.S. Department of the Interior did a health survey on  the Native people of Alaska. Here is a quote from that survey: ``The  indigenous people of Native Alaska are the victims of sickness,  crippling conditions and premature death to a degree exceeded in very  few parts of the world. . . . health problems are nearly out of hand.  If . . . Americans could see for themselves the large numbers of the  tuberculosis, the cripple, the blind . . . the malnourished, the  desperately ill among [this] relatively small [Native] population,'' it  would have a profound impact on them. And it did.   Even in the face of these crippling conditions, the Alaska Native  people joined hands, joined hearts and said: This is our land. We need  rights to it.   They did this by coming together. In the mid-1960s, they formed the  Alaska Federation of Natives--AFN, as we call it back home--an entity  that is very important to our communities.   Of course, the Native people in our State looked for potential  allies. In the lower 48, they gave speeches. They wrote columns. They  formed their own newspaper, The Tundra Times, edited by legendary  Howard Rock, which was highly read throughout the State, celebrated  throughout the globe, and had an enormous impact on bringing people  together.   A few years ago, my team and I combed through some of the hearings  [[Page S9269]]  that led to ANCSA. It was many years in development. There were field  hearings that took place in Alaska in 1968, 1969--3 years before the  passage of ANCSA.   Incredibly proud and determined first peoples from all over the  State--Tlingit, Haida, Athabascan, Inupiat, Yupik, Aleut--travel to  Anchorage, to Fairbanks to give their testimony in field hearings to  U.S. Senators. Some of them had never even left their villages. Some of  them didn't even speak English.   Many were veterans--and I am going to talk briefly about that. Dozens  and dozens of young men and women, old men and women, all of them  testifying before U.S. Senators and Congressmen, telling their stories  of how they lived off the land and the rights that they needed for  thousands of years on the land.   They told stories of strong and resilient people who had been able to  thrive in some of the harshest conditions in the planet. But as I  mentioned earlier, they also told stories of health challenges.   The first AFN president, Emil Notti, who is still a great leader in  Alaska, then only 36 years old, spoke with passion at these hearings  and heartbreak about the conditions in rural Alaska.   He said to a group of Senators in a hearing:         The indigenous people of Native Alaska are the victims of       sickness, crippling conditions and premature death to a       degree exceeded in very few parts of the world.    He told the committee then that life expectancy for the average  Native Alaskan was 34 years old. This is in the late 1960s. The average  life expectancy in the United States at that time was 69--34 years old  to 69.   Many spoke of how much they had sacrificed for their country. And  this is an issue I never tire of talking about. Alaska Natives serve at  higher rates in the U.S. military than any other ethnic group in the  country. So they are fighting for their country in World War II and  Korea and Vietnam, and they are coming home and they are being denied  fundamental rights themselves.   Here is what Jerome Trigg, a leader and a marine from Nome, had to  tell U.S. Senators who were in Alaska. His testimony was said to have  brought tears to the eyes of many. He looked at the U.S. Senators and  said this: We have showed our patriotism as proudly as any Americans on  Earth. We have answered the call of duty with pride in serving in our  military. In World War II, we answered the call 100 percent. Every  man--old and young--in every village volunteered with the Alaska  National Guard.   On Vietnam, which was raging at the time, he said: I have never heard  of an Alaska Native burning their draft card or our Nation's flag. We  love our land, and we will sacrifice and fight to protect it.   He concluded with this thought, which I love: ``Sometimes I think the  wrong people are running this hearing and taking our testimony,'' he  said to the Senators. ``It seems that [maybe] we should be on the bench  and you people should be . . . giving [us] the testimony.''   I love that--strong words from Marine Jerome Trigg, who had a very  important point to make.   So many in our communities testified in front of Congress. One  happened to be a beautiful, young Alaska Native woman in her thirties  from the village of Rampart named Mary Jane Fate, who not only worked  on this but came to Washington, DC, to lobby U.S. Senators to pass  ANCSA. I had the very great privilege of being the son-in-law of that  great Native woman who, unfortunately, passed away recently. That was  my mother-in-law, Mary Jane Fate, who came to this body and made sure  Senators understood what was happening in Alaska and got them to vote  for ANCSA 50 years ago.   So here is what it did in a nutshell. As I mentioned, it was the  largest indigenous land settlement in the history of the country: 44  million acres of land, almost a billion dollars from the State and  Federal Government to transfer land in fee simple--not the reservation  system like you have in the lower 48, which was a huge innovation at  the time. They own this land. It is theirs. It is not held in trust by  the United States like it is in the lower 48 on Indian reservations.   Congress mandated the creation of for-profit Alaska Native  corporations solely owned by Alaska Native shareholders. Twelve of  these regional corporations and 200 village ANCs were created by the  Congress. Sometimes people talk about ANCs as if they were some foreign  entity. They were actually created right here 50 years ago.   What did all of this do? It provided economic opportunity. These were  not typical entities, but they were more than just corporations. They  were kind of a combination: social, cultural, economic. They passed on  the values to the different shareholders.   One of the great things about ANCSA was that it required, actually,  the sharing of revenues. Some of these regional corporations did very  well; others didn't. There were provisions early on that said, if these  corporations are doing great and these aren't, there is going to be  some sharing. It was called the 7(i) provision. These provisions have  been critical to the survival of ANCs, which regional ANCs at times, as  I mentioned, were receiving more revenue than others.   So that day 50 years ago--December 18, 1971--was really an important  day for our State. How has it worked out? It has worked out well, but,  of course, we always have more work to do.   Over the last 50 years, the Alaska Native people have managed their  lands to foster sustainable businesses, created employment  opportunities for all people--Native and non-Native--in Alaska, across  the country, and across the globe. They have become the heart and soul  of our economy in Alaska, employing thousands of both Alaska Native and  non-Native people.   And they have prospered with their own initiative and with innovative  approaches to fostering economic development through self- determination. And beyond the economic benefits, these ANCs, these  groupings, these shareholders in these Alaska Native entities created  right here on this floor, provided benefits in terms of culture,  language revitalization, scholarships, burials, funeral assistance, and  an enormous focus on education. Over 54,000 individual scholarships  were given to younger Alaska Native people.   And, importantly, this law, passed by this body, gave the Native  people the opportunity to thrive; to continue to live on their land,  practice their culture, create leaders throughout the State. In what  was once one of the most impoverished places in the country are now, in  many areas, strong, dynamic--health, education, housing, food security,  and sanitation have all improved immensely.   We have a long way to go. There is still a lot of misunderstanding.  In Alaska, you have Tribes, Tribal members, you have ANCs, and  shareholders. These are the Native people. You have crossover. And  sometimes there is a misunderstanding.   For example, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act specifically  excluded tens of thousands of Alaska Natives because they were members  of an organization that Congress created. My own view was that was  outrageous.   So that is why we need to keep educating our colleagues here. But  overall, this was a story of success, of resilience, of what can happen  when you allow people to take charge of their own destiny. It is a  story of self-determination and, in many ways, heroism, and it is a  story for the ages.   I am honored to represent these people, wonderful people--many of  whom the leaders are still alive who made this happen 50 years ago--and  their children and grandchildren. We have more work to do, but 50 years  ago, on December 18, 1971, it was the start of a new, positive,  innovative chapter in the history of Alaska. And that is why Senator  Murkowski and I wanted to celebrate this very important milestone this  afternoon.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it is Thursday. The Senate is still very  busy here. We have a lot of work to do, as we are all trying to get  home for the holidays. And I thought it was still the appropriate time  to come down and talk about somebody who is making our State such a  great State, somebody who is contributing to the community, somebody  who I refer to as our Alaskan of the Week.   Now, we have been doing this for, gosh, going on almost 6 years,  maybe 5 years. But it is always one of my favorite times of week, even  when the speech is late. So I appreciate the majority leader and the  Presiding Officer letting us stay open here for one more speech. And I  know the pages--I mean, they love the Alaskan of the Week. So this is a  little bit of a treat.   But I always start this speech with a little bit of an update on what  is going on in Alaska. So right now, Utqiagvik, formerly known as  Barrow--that is Point Barrow. That is the northern most community in  North America. They haven't seen the sun in nearly a month. The sun  went down, and it is not rising again until January 23. So they get a  lot of darkness. There are 66 days of darkness. Great people up there.  Wonderful people up there. I love it up there.   We have had some pretty significant cold spells already. That, for  now, doesn't seem to be lifting. It was 40 below 0 in Fairbanks  yesterday. In Anchorage, the high was 4 degrees above 0. Forty below is  chilly. Tough people throughout the State. Four degrees above is pretty  cold for Anchorage.   But everybody is excited because Christmas is right around the  corner, and it is, of course, a great time to be in Alaska. We do have  a place--I was just talking with the Presiding Officer and the majority  leader. We have a great community in Interior Alaska called North Pole,  AK. Santa actually lives there. We have a city council member in North  Pole named Santa Claus, and a reindeer there.   And, of course, I am like everybody else here, looking forward to  getting home, going to Midnight Mass, eating my special Alaska seafood  Newburg, having friends over, and family, of course. And I think we all  know we are very fortunate. I, certainly, believe I am a very blessed  man.   And we are blessed in Alaska because of people like Shari Daugherty,  who is our Alaskan of the Week. And so I want to talk a little bit  about Shari because what she has done is literally the definition of  the Christmas spirit.   For the last month, as she has done for the last 30 years, she has  been working pretty much around the clock, volunteering her time for  the nonprofit Share the Spirit. Share the Spirit--that is the nonprofit  that Shari helped found in 1992--30 years.   Share the Spirit's mission is to make sure that hundreds of less  fortunate families in Homer, AK, her hometown, get all of the  ingredients for a proper Christmas dinner and presents for the kids.   Share the Spirit--it sounds pretty simple, but, as you can imagine,  this is no easy task. And Shari would tell you that it involves so many  others in Homer to make sure that the children in the community, who  might not otherwise have anything under the tree, can experience the  magic of Christmas that every child deserves.   So who is Shari, this great volunteer who has been doing incredible  work in Homer? Originally from Chico, CA, Shari and her parents moved  to Homer when she was in the 10th grade. Her father was a fisherman.   And for those of you who have been to Homer or want to come to Homer,  I will tell you, it is one of the most stunningly beautiful places in  all of America--really, in all of the world. It is known as the  ``Halibut Fishing Capital of the World.'' But anyone who goes there  falls in love with Homer. It is surrounded by the glistening waters of  Kachemak Bay, jagged mountains, glaciers, snowcapped volcanoes, and a  great tight-knit community.   After college at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, Shari moved  around a little. But in 1991, she came back home with her daughter. She  did so because she had family there in Homer. And even if she didn't,  as she put it, she had a whole town full of family in Homer.   Now, volunteering was in her blood. She said her mom stressed the  importance of giving back to the community since she was a young girl.  So she almost immediately joined the Emblem Club. That is the  unofficial auxiliary of the Elks. And during one of their first  meetings, it was announced that a Christian minister's group that every  year provided food and presents for people in the community was  actually going to disband.   A meeting was called. The talking lasted for a very long time--at  such volunteer meetings, that can happen, of course--until Shari  finally cut in and said: Hey, guys, we are really burning daylight  here. Here is what needs to happen: We need to form a committee, form a  plan, form a nonprofit, and get busy--get busy.   And as such things go, she and another woman, Norma Foust, were put  in charge. And boy, did they make a difference. That year, with  Christmas only weeks away, a nonprofit was formed and a fundraiser to  organize with the help of a strong community. They put together 57  baskets of food: turkey, stuffing, potato, sugar, salt, eggs, celery,  pie crusts, cards with recipes on them--all the fixings for a nice  [[Page S9271]]  Christmas dinner. And then there were the presents for more than 100  children. There were 220 gifts that first year, 30 years ago.   And the program has grown ever since. Hundreds of families each year  are referred to Shari's program by social agencies, including food  banks and anywhere people go for help. The information is passed on to  Shari and the whole Share the Spirit team. Each family is identified by  their needs: a family of three, say, with a 4-year-old girl who needs  boots and would like a princess costume. They are then assigned a  number that goes onto a Christmas decoration and put on one of the  numerous trees posted by local businesses in Homer. Homer residents  pick up a decoration and buy the presents. It is pretty well organized.   And Shari and the volunteers then get busy organizing a huge  spaghetti feed to raise the funds, and then they go shopping for the  food.   A few days before Christmas, the group stages the location, normally  at the high school. The presents and the food baskets are then  disbursed.   As I mentioned, Shari has done this for 30 years--30 years--and  throughout the years, many stories and people stand out.   This is Alaska. So, of course, this was the year of the huge  blizzard. Nobody could drive. So they enlisted a club of snow machine  riders to deliver the presents and the food throughout the area.   There is the woman who now lives in Pennsylvania, who lived in Homer  for a while, with a young child. That child, because of the group, was  able to experience Christmas. And now, like clockwork, this woman sends  a quarterly donation to Share the Spirit.   You see how the spirit is literally being shared all over the  country: Alaska, Homer, Pennsylvania.   There are many people now adults, some with children of their own,  who got help, who got presents because of Share the Spirit and are now  regular volunteers. Shari knows of many people who got presents as  children because of her group's efforts and decided to stay in Homer,  have families of their own, and now help out at Share the Spirit. She  said: They decided that this is where they were going to live. This is  the town they are going to live in and to contribute to, because this  is the place that took care of them when they were young and needed it.   Shari is retiring this year from both the program and from her job as  a medical biller at South Peninsula Hospital. She will be leaving Share  the Spirit in good hands, though: Kelly Glidden, who began volunteering  as a sixth grader in 1993; John Adams, who started when he was 8 years  old volunteering; and Emmy Olsem Drye, who has been involved in Share  the Spirit since she was 3, and who is also Shari's daughter. They will  take on the mantle of this great volunteer effort, focused on the  Christmas spirit, that Shari started.   And there are those who have been there since the beginning: DeeDee  Shoultz and Fran Van Sandt.   And then there is the great community of Homer--a community that  takes care of its own.   So thank you, Shari, for all you have done throughout the years-- three decades to keep the Christmas spirit alive. Thank you for making  our State a much better place, a more generous place, a caring place  for all, and touching the lives of so many, and especially for making  sure that children in Homer and across Alaska--and really across  America--experience the joy and the magic of Christmas.  Congratulations, Shari, on being our Alaskan of the Week, and Merry  Christmas.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
