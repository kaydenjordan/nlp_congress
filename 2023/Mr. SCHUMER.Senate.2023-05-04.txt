 Mr. President, last week, House Republicans rammed  through a nakedly partisan bill to default on America, without taking  even a moment to explain how their bill would wreak havoc on our  country. That, of course, was by design.   Republicans have known for years that their agenda is horribly  unpopular with the American people. So the MAGA part of the GOP has  used this default crisis to sneak their radical proposals through the  back door.   Since MAGA Republicans--and House Republicans, in general--have  refused to level with the American people, Senate Democrats have been  doing their work for them: exposing how ``Default on America'' will  crash the economy, raise costs, and kill millions of good-paying jobs.   Yesterday, at an Appropriations subcommittee hearing with  Administrator Regan, Chair Murray and Subcommittee Chair Merkley showed  how ``Default on America'' would devastate clean water and cut programs  that protect kids from harmful PFAS chemicals.  [[Page S1522]]    Chair Murray and Senator Heinrich also met with Deputy Secretary Turk  and showed how ``Default on America'' would slash scientific research  and cripple American competitiveness, just as both parties passed CHIPS  and Science.   Here we have finally passed good, strong bipartisan legislation that  will help us compete against the Chinese Government. And what do the  House Republicans, led by the MAGA group, do? They cut so much of that  out. The American people don't want that. And they don't even want the  American people to know what they are doing.   Today, the Senate Budget Committee is hearing from experts like Mark  Zandi of Moody's Analytics--hardly a liberal stalwart--to show how  ``Default on America'' would lead to hundreds of thousands of job cuts  and diminish economic prosperity. And ``Default on America,'' as you  know, is the Republican plan. That is what we are calling it, and that  is what America knows.   And we won't stop there. Senate committees will continue, next week,  showing how the MAGA Republican ``Default on America'' plan utterly  wreaks of MAGA Republican extremism. And it is not a plan at all. It is  just a rightwing wish list thrown together in the House. The stench is  foul.   Just look at the way the Republican bill treats our seniors. One  million seniors will lose access to Meals on Wheels if Republicans'  ``Default on America'' becomes law. These are seniors who often can't  leave their homes by themselves to get groceries and need a hand from  others.   It is incredible--tell seniors who are homebound they can't get meals  so that some rightwing billionaires don't have to pay taxes?   That is the way these MAGA Republicans think, and that seems to be  where House Republicans are following.   Or look at the way ``Default on America'' turns its back on our  Nation's veterans. If Republicans get their way and ``Default on  America'' becomes law, up to 80,000 jobs at the Veterans Health  Administration would be cut.   Our Nation's veterans have dedicated their lives to keeping our  country safe. There is no greater shame than intentionally depriving  them of the resources to stay healthy, but that is precisely what the  House Republican bill does.   And if anyone wonders whether or not House Republicans truly care  about law enforcement and public safety, ``Default on America'' would  cut 30,000 law enforcement jobs--30,000.   Let me emphasize that again because it is a stunning revelation.   If ``Default on America'' becomes law, 30,000 law enforcement jobs  would be cut. Our Border Patrol would be left hanging to dry. Our  communities that are fighting the opioid crisis, drugs, and guns would  be less safe.   This party, which is railing against ``those outside of this room who  have said defund the police,'' are defunding the police.   Cuts to seniors, cuts to veterans' health, cuts to Federal law  enforcement--these are just some of the consequences of the ``Default  on America'' wish list that has been proposed by the MAGA Republicans  and the Republican leadership in the House.   But the horrors don't end there. ``Default on America'' is loaded  with poison pills that have nothing to do with averting default and  everything to do with the hard-right agenda. ``Default on America''  would deregulate fossil fuels and empower Big Oil, make life easier for  wealthy tax cheats, and impose unpopular work requirements on  vulnerable families.   There is no way the American people will accept legislation as  flawed, as cruel, as hard right as the Republican ``Default on America  Act.'' ``Default on America'' cannot credibly be called any sort of  plan from Speaker McCarthy to avoid default. It reads much more like a  House Freedom Caucus manifesto.   The solution here is staring Republicans in the face: Do what we have  already done under President Trump and President Biden, under both  Democratic and Republican majorities. We should pass a clean bill to  avoid default--no brinksmanship, no hostage-taking. If we do that,  there will be no default on the national debt.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  postcloture time on the Shogan and Gupta nominations be considered  expired and the confirmation votes be at a time to be determined by the  majority leader following consultation with the Republican leader.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session to  consider Calendar No. 71.
