 Mr. Speaker, recently, our friends in the Jewish  community celebrated their holiest days. During these times, I know  they have taken note of America's strong support for Israel.   Our two countries are tied by common values and joint interests as we  share commitments to freedom and democracy, societal pillars in short  supply in Israel's immediate neighborhood. The history of the Jewish  people is one of faith, one of honor, but, most importantly, survival.   This week, President Trump reiterated our Nation's strong support for  Israel in his address to the United Nations General Assembly. He told  the world that the United States will not stay silent against threats  to Israel and made it clear that moving the American Embassy was a sign  of peace.   I am calling on the rest of the world leaders to acknowledge  Jerusalem as the true capital of Israel and to protect God's chosen  people at their time of peril. It is time we all stand in solidarity  for the Israeli nation.                            ____________________
