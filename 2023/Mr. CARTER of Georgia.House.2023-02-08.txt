 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the  Imperial Sugar Refinery explosion in my hometown of Port Wentworth,  Georgia, in 2008.   Mr. Speaker, 15 years ago, 14 lives were tragically taken, and  several others were severely injured. I want to honor the victims of  this tragedy, as well as the first responders and doctors who worked  bravely to save lives.   After the explosion, emergency vehicles quickly lined the access road  leading out to the refinery. In total, there were around 60 first  responders on the scene after the accident, working around the clock.   After survivors were transferred to the Burn Center in Augusta,  doctors worked diligently to save lives. Some patients were covered  with burns on upwards of 90 percent of their bodies.   If it had not been for the heroic work of everyone involved, the  death toll could have been much higher. Our thoughts and prayers  continue to be with the families of those whom we lost and with those  who were injured.   Thank you to our first responders and medical experts for this  lifesaving care they gave to all of those involved.                            ____________________
