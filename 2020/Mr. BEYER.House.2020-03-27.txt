 Mr. Speaker, the last pandemic, I want to draw attention  to the research investments in the CARES Act.   The Department of Energy has funds for its high-end computing  capabilities. The National Science Foundation will do molecular and  cellular research. NIST will ensure the validity of and the reliability  of the testing, and the EPA will do research on the risk of  transmission.   Mr. Speaker, my grandfather lost his wife and first son in the flu  epidemic in 1919, yet this is not the last novel virus. But with the  bold, sustained commitment to science, we can make COVID-19 the last  pandemic.
