 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from North Carolina  for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Eliminate Barriers to  Innovation Act. As the ranking member of the Commodity Exchanges,  Energy, and Credit Subcommittee, I am looking forward to digging in on  the many issues surrounding digital assets, particularly digital  commodities.   Digitally native assets represent a new way for people to interact  with each other and potentially organize productive activities.  Whatever promise this innovative technology may hold, it will not be  realized if it is subjected to outdated and unworkable regulations.   One of the great strengths our financial system in the U.S. has is  that the rules are well-formed, longstanding, and fit for purpose.  While we may argue about the details, the basic principles of the U.S.  financial markets, and the rules which apply to legacy assets, are well  understood.   Digital assets, on the other hand, present new challenges. While the  principles won't change, the rules that bring those principles into  effect may have to change.   This working group will give the CFTC, the SEC, and the market  participants a critical venue to examine those principles and bring  needed clarity to the application of existing rules on digital asset  transactions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
