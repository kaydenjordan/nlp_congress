 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Edward M.  Bartholomew, Jr., for his life of service to the city of Glens Falls,  Warren County, and the entire north country region.   Ed served in many important roles over the course of his over-40-year  career. He was elected mayor of the city of Glens Falls at the age of  28. He set to work revitalizing the community, making the civic center  a success, building a modern baseball park, improving critical  infrastructure, and establishing the Greater Glens Falls Transit  System.   He cemented his reputation as someone who can grasp all aspects of a  challenge and accomplish his objectives despite daunting obstacles.   In 2010, after spending time in the State senate, Ed returned to lead  the Economic Development Corporation of Warren County, where he had  been working tirelessly throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.   Ed Bartholomew was an extraordinary leader for the Warren County  community and beyond. He was an absolute joy and privilege to work  with, and he will be sorely missed.   I am honored to recognize his leadership in the Congressional Record  on behalf of New York's 21st Congressional District. Our prayers go out  to his friends and family during this difficult time.                            ____________________
