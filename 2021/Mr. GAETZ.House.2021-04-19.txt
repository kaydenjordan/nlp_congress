 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the Financial  Services Committee for yielding.   I rise in support of the SAFE Banking Act, which I am honored to  introduce with my colleagues, Mr. Joyce, Mr. Perlmutter, Mr.  Blumenauer, and others.   It seems the war on drugs is a lot like so many of the other forever  wars that this Congress confronts, deeply unpopular in all parts of the  country except Washington, D.C.   I commend the majority party for bringing this bill to the floor and  allowing businesses that serve particularly medical marijuana patients  the opportunity to access the U.S. financial system.   There is an important part of this legislation that bears note. With  the SAFE Banking Act, we will have an unprecedented opportunity for  research and collaboration, which did not exist previously and which  doesn't exist now.   There are so many universities, medical centers, other research  institutions that would like to partner with and work alongside  marijuana businesses with the opportunity to improve health outcomes  for patients and to bring relief to people who badly need it.   I would implore my colleagues in the majority party to reach out to  President Biden as I did to President Trump. Ask him to take executive  action to remove marijuana from the list of schedule I drugs so that we  can accelerate marijuana reform for the benefit of our fellow Americans  and those who are in need and in pain and are counting on it.
