 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Protection  of Women and Girls in Sports Act. Last year, we celebrated the 50th  anniversary of Title IX, which has made incredible progress for women  in this country, opening doors for countless women and girls.   Thanks to Title IX, women have been afforded incredible opportunities  in sports. I have seen this firsthand in my daughter who is an aspiring  college volleyball player, as well as through the growth of women's  professional sports across this country, including women's hockey.   It is outrageous that we even have to consider legislation like this  today, but, unfortunately, Democrats are seeking to weaken Title IX.  President Biden and Democrats across this Nation are pushing for  radical policies that will jeopardize the progress that has been made  over 50 years.   These policies ignore the biological differences between men and  women. They will force female athletes to compete against biological  males in high school and collegiate sports. They will jeopardize years  of hard work put in by female athletes like my daughter and  disincentivize their future participation. In short, they will erase  women from athletics.   The Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act will protect and  strengthen Title IX and will ensure that women and girls have the level  playing field they deserve.                                time  1400
