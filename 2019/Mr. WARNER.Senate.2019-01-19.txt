 Yes, Madam President.                            ____________________     Madam President, let me thank the Senator from Alaska for  her comments and my dear friend from Virginia for his comments. I am  going to somewhat echo what has already been said, but what I don't  understand--and for those who are listening or viewing, the four of us  and many others on both sides of the aisle have been working in good  faith to try to say: How do we get out of this?   The question I have is--I wonder if all of our colleagues have  actually gone out and sat with Federal workers or folks who are  affected. How could anyone sit with anyone who is affected by this  self-imposed personal, financial, and economic disaster and not say:  Let's not talk about money; let's get the government reopened. We can  figure this out, but let's get this government reopened.   I will recount some similar stories, and I appreciated the Alaska  stories of the Coast Guard in Kodiak. In Virginia, we have a major  Coast Guard facility down at Hampton Roads. But, as the Senator from  Alaska has mentioned, it is not just Federal employees; it is  contractors and private businesses and a host of other folks.   The Presiding Officer is part of the group who has been trying to  say: How do we get to yes? How do we get to reopen?   Maybe we can renew our efforts and urge all of our colleagues. Many  of them have gone home, but I hope they will sit down and have these  kinds of sessions.   I don't know how anybody can look at people who are out of work and  without pay due to nothing they have done individually and not say that  no matter who is winning the inside-the-beltway battle of the day, we  owe it to them to get this government reopened.   Madam President, I rise today out of deep frustration with the  administration's treatment of Federal workers during this government  shutdown. I will come back to this again, but I wish--I wish there were  some indication that the President, the Vice President, or any of his  top advisers would actually go out and do a listening session with  Federal workers. That doesn't seem to be too much to ask. I want them  to look those Coast Guard spouses or those TSA employees or those air  traffic controllers in the eye and tell them why they are being held  hostage on an issue that, frankly, has nothing to do with their work as  public servants.   We are now on day 29 of what I call the President's shutdown--the  longest shutdown in U.S. history. In many ways, we are creating the  legacy of this administration, a legacy that--the President claimed in  mid-December that he was ``proud'' to have initiated the shutdown that  is plunging so many Americans' lives into chaos.   More than 800,000 Federal workers have missed a paycheck, and that  number, I think the Senator from Alaska has alluded to and the Senator  from Virginia has alluded to, is actually a fraction of the folks who  are actually being affected. That doesn't count the countless  contractors--I will come back to that in a moment--or the host of  businesses, like the brewery in Kodiak. They are not Federal workers.  They are absolutely being affected, and let's recognize that. Even when  we are reopened and those Coast Guard workers are paid back, that  brewery is never going to make back its lost revenue.   The President has found time for an Oval Office address, he has found  time for a trip to the border, and he has found time for a tit-for-tat  with Speaker Pelosi, but what he has not found time for--or, for that  matter, anybody else in the White House--is to sit down with the  Federal workers who are being affected, and I believe that is a  national disgrace.   Again, I appreciate the Presiding Officer and your colleagues  listening. I know you have made efforts, and you are continuing to work  with other colleagues on both sides of the aisle to try to hopefully  find some sense in this disaster, but the truth is, people's time is  running out.   Over the last couple weeks, Senator Kaine and I have heard from so  many Virginia families who are shouldering the burden from this  shutdown. I wanted to share some of the stories.   The Senator from Alaska told a story about a 13-year-old who couldn't  cash a Christmas check. At least for me--I can't speak for Senator  Kaine--the most compelling story, heartbreaking story--and I am going  to tell a number of them, but this is the one I have kept coming back  to. Senator Kaine and I, with the press, had a series of Federal  workers tell their stories. One of the Federal workers didn't want to  come and do it on camera, but he came up and talked to Senator Kaine  and me afterward. He was a relatively young guy, about 35. He was a  veteran. He was an air traffic controller. He has now gone 4-plus weeks  without a paycheck. His wife had served in the Air Force in an intel  capacity and was suffering from pretty significant PTSD. Because he  hadn't had a paycheck, he couldn't pay the $90 copayment for his wife  to continue to see her psychiatrist and continue to pay for her drug  treatment. Not unlike the story the Senator from Alaska told, he said  he has his wife to take care of and their two kids, a 4- and 5-year- old. The 4- and 5-year-old kids came to their parents and brought their  piggy banks and said: Mom and dad, can we give you what we have in our  piggy banks to help our family?    This is the United States of America. These are two veterans. We say  we honor their service. This is somebody who is still going to work and  working overtime without pay to keep our air safe. This shouldn't be.   A few days earlier, we met with other workers. A young father whom we  met works with the Department of Justice. He brought his 7-week-old  daughter to this session. He said when his daughter was born, he wanted  to make sure he could get his daughter on his Federal insurance plan.  That is his right. But the person who was supposed to submit the form  to the insurance company had been furloughed. He went to the doctor and  his infant daughter had an illness and had to get a prescription. He  didn't have the money to pay for the prescription, and his daughter  wasn't registered on his insurance company, not because of any fault he  had made. He wasn't able to pay for the insurance. In this case, thank  God, the insurance company actually worked with him, and they brought  extra proof and went through other hoops, and he was able to get the  medicine. How many other  [[Page S313]]  young families are going through that same stress right now?   Eric, a Federal law enforcement agent and father of three, wrote me  an email this week. He said missing a paycheck caused ``a tremendous  amount of strain'' on his family. This is a law enforcement officer.  Eric said he had some money saved up in a rainy day fund, but he  continued to tell me, in terms of his rainy day fund:         It's raining extremely hard right now. At some point, I am       going to have to make some tough decisions to ensure that my       family has a roof over its head and food on the table.    Unfortunately, a lot of the employees Senator Kaine and I have been  talking to don't have that rainy-day fund.   One of the things I think we all knew, maybe intellectually--and we  have all seen the statistics--is that half of Americans couldn't afford  an unexpected $400 bill without going into financial ruin. We are  seeing that play out right now--again, not because somebody has been  mismanaging their funds, but because they expected if they worked for  the United States of America and if they were willing to continue to do  that work, they would get paid.   We are now into this crisis 29 days, and if we think we have seen the  stuff hit the fan so far, wait until this coming Thursday when families  go through that second pay period where, adding insult to injury, they  get a paycheck that says zero, or in the case of one air traffic  controller, a penny, as you get into the new month when all their bills  come due.   Yesterday, I volunteered at a food bank in Arlington where Federal  contractors and furloughed workers were coming because their families  were running out of money. Some of these folks came up to me and said:  I viewed myself always as middle class. I have been working for the  Federal Government for double-digit years. They felt an enormous amount  of shame to come to the food bank. You shouldn't feel shame to come to  the food bank, but their appeal was to get the government reopened.   The President, who has never worked for a paycheck in his life, says  he can relate. He says he is sure that the Federal workers ``will make  adjustments.'' This is the very same President who has not had the  common decency to sit down with any Federal workers and listen to their  stories.   Here is what some of those adjustments look like.   Lisa in Arlington wrote me an email that says:         I am forced to look for multiple part-time jobs to make       ends meet and my savings will soon run out. Creditors and       landlords have only so much patience with us.    Another worker whom Senator Kaine and I met on Thursday broke down  crying when she said how hard it was for her to send her infant child  away up for a week to 10 days to stay with relatives because her mom,  who had been taking care of that child, had to go up and deal with her  own personal business, and she couldn't afford daycare. That is  dispiriting and disheartening.   The Presiding Officer has already pointed out the problem in terms of  recruitment and retention. Those people who are actually trying to  serve others now suddenly see their livelihoods in jeopardy through no  fault of their own.   The truth is that this shutdown is having a devastating effect--not  only on the short-term morale but on the long-term morale of all our  Federal workforce.   The fact is, since we have already agreed to pay them when we reopen,  why shouldn't we at least go ahead and, even if we are shut down, pay  these Federal workers come Thursday so they don't have to incur  additional pain and suffering? I commend so many of us, particularly my  friend the Senator from Virginia, along with Senator Cardin, who led  the effort so that we are giving Federal workers backpay when we  reopen.    Backpay alone doesn't make up for the hurt if you had to draw down  from your IRA and have a tax penalty. It doesn't make you whole if you  have taken an advance against your credit card and you have to pay  those fees in paying those dollars back. It doesn't make you whole, as  the Presiding Officer indicated, if you get dinged on your credit  rating or if you are in the process of trying to get a security  clearance and that security clearance is withheld because it appears  you have bad credit, not because you did anything wrong but because the  Congress and the President can't agree on how to pay you when you are  still asked to do your job.   The number of current Federal employees who are eligible for  retirement is supposed to be about 30 percent over the next few years.  How many of those Federal employees, whom we have trained and worked  with and who bring enormous expertise, are not going to wait until they  have to retire but actually say: I am going to get out of this job now.   The last thing we need to do is further undermine the competitiveness  of our Federal workforce.   The Presiding Officer made this point and Senator Kaine has made this  point that it is not just the Federal employees, but Federal  contractors. I heard from one Federal contractor from Ashburn who says  the shutdown has ``rocked the financial stability of my family.''   You see folks in the Gallery. We probably have a few more tourists  than we might normally have on a Saturday because the Smithsonian shut  down. I heard from someone who is in leadership in the Smithsonian,  begging me, saying those folks who work at the Smithsonian, on one  level, may get reimbursed, but all the folks who pick up the trash,  clean the bathrooms, and serve the cafeteria food are all contractors.  They are not direct employees of the Federal workforce. So even when we  reopen, even when the Federal workforce gets reimbursed, they are out.   This is one of the things Senator Kaine and I have been working on,  and I hope the Presiding Officer will look at this, and I hope some of  our other colleagues who want to work toward a solution will work on  this. It is complicated. In all the previous shutdowns, we never found  a way to reimburse contractors. We have a piece of legislation that may  not be perfect, but it says that for those workers who make less than  $50,000, we ought to find a way to make sure they get reimbursed and,  then, for those above, some small percentage. If not, these folks will  never be made whole.   Again, think about some of the tourists. Normally, there are a whole  lot of food trucks surrounding the Smithsonian and elsewhere around  downtown. We heard from a number of those folks as well. They can't  continue because if the Smithsonians aren't open, the tourists aren't  coming. If you have taken out a loan to buy a food truck to try to  employ a few folks, once that business is shut down, once your loan is  pulled, once you lose that truck--even when we come to a solution--they  can't reopen.   Again, I know it is unprecedented. We have not looked at Federal  contractors in the past, but at least for the folks in low or moderate  incomes who cannot make back the 29 days of pay--Lord knows that we  listen to the President who says he doesn't mind if it is weeks, months  or even years--I hope we find a way to somehow make them whole.   We have also seen small businesses. In Virginia, we have  disproportionately a lot of small contractor businesses. A small  business owner and contractor in Arlington wrote me and said:         My disabled-veteran-owned small business will have to shut       its door after serving the Federal Government for the last 2       decades. . . . I am going to have to put 72 families out of       work because our reserves aren't big enough to support the       payroll expenses of $35,000-$40,000 per day during this       political impasse.    It doesn't take a lot of math to figure out that if you are closed  roughly 30 days, you are talking about over a million dollars in  payroll that this veteran-owned small business can't meet. When they  reopen, there is no guarantee that this business comes back.   It is not just the small businesses that actually serve the  government. It is the brewery in Kodiak. It is the restaurants around  the battlefields in Richmond, near Senator Kaine's home. It is some of  the campgrounds that surround the Shenandoah National Park in our  Commonwealth. I think there may be a number of our colleagues who maybe  don't have the same concentration that Alaska or Virginia or Maine has.  If they think this problem hasn't gotten to them and isn't spreading  like the plague, it will come to their States as well.  [[Page S314]]    Why do we have to put all of these families and our economy through  this kind of turmoil?   Senator Kaine and I have worked really hard recently. Those of us who  live in the national capital area know the Metro is an important way we  commute. The Metro has had its share of problems the last couple of  years. Actually, in a good-news story, Virginia, DC, and Maryland came  together and ponied up more resources so Metro could make some of the  improvements--safety improvements and operating improvements--trying to  improve quality of service for our Federal workforce and for tourists  in our Nation's Capital. Every day--every weekday--that the Federal  Government is shut down, Metro loses $400,000 in lost fares per day.  Metro can't get a break. Where is that money going to rematerialize  from? I am not sure we are going to appropriate millions of additional  dollars.   We have had debates before, but if there has ever been one that the  American public has a right to be frustrated with in terms of the  shutdown--historically, the longest shutdown ever--it is this one. The  President says he wants money for a border wall--a border wall that he  promised the American people was going to be paid for by Mexico, a  border wall for which he says that before he will reopen government,  give him $5 billion. I think it is up to almost $5.9 billion. There are  some arguments that now it is up to $7 billion or $8 billion.   The truth is--and let me be clear--if the President and his White  House allies are listening, this Senator is willing to look at any  reasonable investment in additional border security, but it ought to be  done in a way in which we are not holding these hundreds of thousands  of families and--literally, indirectly--millions of Americans hostage.  Rule No. 101 of hostage taking is you don't not negotiate with the  hostage taker. You don't reward a bully. As I think some of my  colleagues on the other side have at least acknowledged privately, if  we allow this tactic to work today, it will be reused in April when we  have the debt ceiling, and it will be reused at the end of the fiscal  year when the next year's appropriations are due.   Again, I hope the people of good will will also try to see if we can  commit to putting enough of a poison pill in place so that this tactic  can never, ever be used again by any Congress or any President without  inflicting some damage, frankly, on the legislative branch and on the  office of the White House. That is part of the remarkable thing. Our  offices--and I say this to the good folks who work for us in Congress-- are not feeling any of the pain. The White House staff is not feeling  any of the pain.   I do wonder, as the President starts to selectively decide based on  one's ability to lobby and promote, who is going to come back and what  will get reopened. Frankly, I am more than a little disappointed, while  it is important that mortgages get processed, that he has decided to  bring back certain folks to process mortgages and certain folks in the  Department of Agriculture to process farmers' loans and that they have,  suddenly, mysteriously, found some money in the State Department to  reopen part of the State Department. I would love to see that same  priority for the folks who process food stamps. I wonder what kind of  Federal buildings we will go into where the toilets haven't been  cleaned and the trash hasn't been taken out and the food services  haven't been provided.   I say to the White House that we will negotiate, that we will work  through this process. Some of us have even said--and I know the Chair  has been part of this effort--that we will put it through regular  order. We will consider his proposal in a reasonable way, but let's do  it with the government open and with people getting paid.   I thank my friend Senator Kaine from Virginia. I know and  acknowledge, as somebody who actually lives only 20 minutes away in  Virginia, that it is a little bit easier for me than being a Senator  from Alaska or a Senator from a host of other places around the  country, but I think it is proper and right that we are here today, and  I will be back this coming week to continue to raise this point. When  we heard from some Federal workers that Congress was taking a break for  another 10 days when they were supposed to reach another pay period but  that they were going to make it goose eggs and when they have the  beginning of February looming when their rents and mortgages and  tuition bills will be due, I thought it was appropriate. I thank him  for forcing us to be back here to continue to raise these issues.   The last point I want to make is that I think we owe a huge debt to  our Federal workers--the TSA, the air traffic controllers, the Coast  Guard, and, for that matter, the folks who process food stamps and the  lady we saw who was supposed to investigate chemical spills who is  desperate to get to Houston where there was a spill 10 days ago, but  they still haven't been able to investigate. Without pay, whether you  are furloughed or, in many cases, are being asked to work overtime  without pay, they are still showing up. They are still being asked to  commute to work--some from a distance--as has been mentioned by the  Presiding Officer. If you put a bill on a credit card that has your  name on it, your credit rating is at risk. Whether you are a prison  guard and have to commute an hour and a half in your car and may not  have money for gas, you are still finding a way to show up for work.   As somebody who worked longer in the private sector than I have in  the public sector, I wonder how many folks who work in the private  sector--if you work for Facebook or Google or if you work for Ford or  Northrop Grumman--would continue to show up week after week after week  without pay or how many folks in the private sector would show up and  work overtime without pay and still perform.   In a moment in which I was looking straight at the press pool that  was with me yesterday at the Arlington food bank, I asked all of the  press folks--when the cameras were off--how many of them would show up  tomorrow if they had gone 4 or 5 weeks--with no end in sight--without  any payment. The press was supposed to cover this, but there was not a  single reporter or camera person who didn't at least acknowledge to  me--and I wish we had had it all on tape--that, no, they wouldn't be  showing up to their jobs.   For those of us who are policymakers or who are, candidly, visitors  in the gallery, sometimes it is easy--and there have been politicians  who have made careers out of this--to trash Federal employees. I think  it is wrong. I think it is disgraceful. I think now, more than ever, we  owe them a debt of gratitude. I know there are at least reports of  people at airports and others who have said thank you or who have tried  to slip somebody food or something else. The remarkable thing is,  because of our rules that in conventional times are appropriate, we  can't even, in many cases, give additional compensation to these  Federal workers, but we can give them a personal thanks.   My hope would be, in going forward, for a commitment from folks on  both sides of the aisle to think twice before we come to the floor of  this Senate and berate and degrade Federal workers. I would hope, on a  going-forward basis, when we get the government reopened, we could find  a bipartisan way to actually make sure that what this Senate passed in  terms of a relatively meager 1.9-percent Federal pay raise increase for  this year would override this administration's spiteful Executive order  that tries to take away that pay raise. If not--maybe not next week but  the next time this happens--I don't know if those TSA workers will show  up. I don't know if those air traffic controllers will keep working. I  don't know if those Coast Guard employees will still sign up for  service in places as remote as Kodiak, AK.   We have it within our power to end this. If the President of the  United States will not end this, we have a bill that is at the desk  that 96 of us agreed to in mid-December when there was not this crisis.  Now, when we hear these stories--when we hear of this pain--if the  President will not act, then the Senate must act and put that  legislation on the President's desk. Let him choose to not, simply,  postulate but to then make a decision as to whether he will sign or  veto it.   I thank the Presiding Officer. I know that she and others will be  back. Part of the burden on the majority is of showing up to that  presiding space. We, as the Virginia Senators, disproportionately had  that opportunity during  [[Page S315]]  these kinds of circumstances. Regarding her stories, the Senator from  Virginia's stories, the Senator from Maine's stories, and our other  colleagues' as well, I hope that the White House is listening and that  we can find that common agreement to get this government reopened and  demonstrate to the workers, the contractors, and the folks who depend  upon the Federal Government that we value their service and that never  ever again will they have to be put through this kind of tragedy.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
