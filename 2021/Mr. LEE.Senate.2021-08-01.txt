 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for the  duration of my remarks, not to be limited by 10 minutes.    Mr. President, it is an honor to serve in this body. It is  an honor to serve with the men and women from whom we have just heard.   The Senators from whom we have just heard are some of my favorite  people in the Senate. For that matter, they are some of my favorite  people. I like them, Democrats and Republicans alike. They are hard- working. They have been working really hard. They have gotten very  little sleep in the last few days.   Notwithstanding my great respect for them personally and  professionally, I rise today because I have got real concerns with this  bill, a lot of them. Those concerns, unfortunately, can't be overcome  by the respect I have for the individuals involved or my gratitude to  them for their willingness to work hard for months on end and through  the night on many, many nights in the recent past. These individuals  are hard-working, and they genuinely want to do good.   I have a different perspective on this bill. I recognize that I am  the only one with that perspective on the floor right now, but I assure  you, Mr. President, I am not alone. I am not alone among Senators, and  I am sure not alone among those I represent and those represented by  the 100 of us in this body. There are a number of Americans who see  that all is not well with the way we spend money, the people's money,  within the Federal Government, and it is to them that I would like to  direct my remarks tonight.   Let's talk for a minute, first of all, about infrastructure. One of  the things that I think makes this an appealing piece of legislation is  the fact that it deals with something that most Americans intuitively  understand we need. Infrastructure is something that is somewhat  uniquely positioned for government. It doesn't always have to be  through government, but it can be, and it often is because it is a  public good. It is a public good that is supposed to be accessible to  all, not excludable, and it is difficult to have that without some sort  of a master plan.   Infrastructure is also something that can make the difference between  someone having to spend hours of their life each day stuck in gridlock  traffic and being able to spend time at home with their family.   Infrastructure benefits us in countless ways. The fact that  infrastructure is a good thing and that we need it is a different  question from whether we can afford the infrastructure plan in this  particular case. It is also a separate question from whether Federal  infrastructure is what we need, at least to this degree.  [[Page S5241]]    Remember that we are a government of powers that James Madison  described as few and defined. That is in Federalist No. 45. By  comparison, he described the powers reserved to the States as numerous  and indefinite.   The powers of Congress and, by extension, the powers of the Federal  Government are those, for the most part, outlined in article I, section  8 of the Constitution. There have been a few other powers added since  then. Most of them, most of the power that we rely on in enacting  legislation--the overwhelming majority of the powers we rely on can be  found in article I, section 8.   Article I, section 8 really does come up with a pretty limited list  of powers. We are in charge of national defense, trademarks, copyrights  and patents, postal roads and post offices, and immigration code to  determine questions on immigration and naturalization, bankruptcy laws,  declaring war, granting letters of marque and reprisal. That is one of  my favorite powers because, you know, it is a power that we have to  issue essentially a hall pass in the name of the United States that  entitles the bearer to engage in state-sponsored acts of piracy on the  high seas in the name of the United States with utter impunity, and  that is really, really cool that we have that power. We don't exercise  it very often; at least we haven't in the last century or so.   We also have the power to regulate trade or commerce between the  States with foreign nations and with Indian Tribes. We have the power  to collect taxes and to spend that money. And I believe the best  reading of that clause, clause 1 of article I, section 8, is that we  have the power to spend money on those powers that are enumerated in  article I, Section 8 or elsewhere.   We don't have the power--in article I, section 8, you won't find a  generalized power that just says: Go out and spend things that you  think would be good for the American people.   Some people make the argument that that very power can, in fact, be  found in clause 1 of article I, section 8. They will refer to what they  sometimes characterize as the general welfare clause.   Now, the term ``general welfare'' is a term of art that appears  exactly twice in the Constitution. The first time it appears is in the  preamble. Remember that the preamble is a nice, lovely statement. It is  not an operative provision. It doesn't contain any authority.   The second time, as I mentioned, is in article I, section 8, clause  1. James Madison believed--and I believe--that most of the Founding  Fathers were with him in this belief. As I said a moment ago, it was  intended to grant Congress the power to spend money on those things  that they were put in charge of. It doesn't mean just go out and spend  money on anything that we deem appropriate. There is also no power in  there--in article I, section 8, or elsewhere in the Constitution--that  gives us the power to create jobs.   Now, I understand that that is an appealing thing. People like being  able to have jobs. They like an economy that provides jobs. So when a  politician can promise job creation, that sounds like an appealing  feature. That, in and of itself, can't be our objective; and that, in  and of itself, doesn't actually work. I will touch on this a little  more a little bit later.   But we have to remember that the Federal Government has no ability to  generate wealth. It lacks that capacity; that, regardless of what you  think of the Federal Government and the extent of Federal power, the  Federal Government can't create wealth. It can only transfer it. It can  collect taxes. It can do new things, and those things can be good. They  can even have positive impacts on the economy.   We lack the power to generate wealth. We, therefore, lack the power  to create jobs. Because, remember, when we are taking money, we are  taking it from someone else--taxpayers, typically. Or in the case of  borrowed money--and we will get more to that later--talking about  future generations of Americans who will pay for this.   So we are not creating jobs. We are just taking money from one group  of people to do a specific job. And, yes, some people might be employed  in those projects. That doesn't mean we are actually creating jobs.   Nor can we forget the fact that when we do something, we can always  take credit for the things that we do. Those things don't necessarily  take account of the things in the economy that would have happened but  for our intervention. We can't take into account what hospital wings  might have been built but for the fact that we took a whole bunch of  money and spent it on a Federal priority.   So let's get back to the distinction between State power and Federal  power; specifically as it relates to infrastructure. I can see a number  of instances in which some infrastructure projects might well be  appropriate for Federal spending.   It was President Dwight D. Eisenhower who proposed the creation of  the Interstate Highway System back in the 1950s. One of the arguments  that he came up with--in fact, as I recall, is the principal argument  that President Eisenhower relied on in creating the Interstate Highway  System--was that, for purposes of national defense, we needed to have a  way that we could move U.S. military personnel from one part of the  country to another.   He did some research on it and discovered that many parts of the  country would be inaccessible from other parts of the country; and if  they needed to get troops from one area to another, that could create a  real national security hazard.   I suppose he might also have relied on the power to regulate  interstate commerce. To my knowledge, he was relying principally on the  defense aspect of having an Interstate Highway System.   So, on that basis, he proposed that we create the Interstate Highway  System; and he proposed, and Congress passed with his signature,  legislation creating a gasoline tax to pay for the creation of the  Interstate Highway System. It was more or less the deal that he cut  with the American people   He said: Look, we, Congress, and the Federal Government, as a whole,  will fund this. We will then fund the building of the Interstate  Highway System. Once the Interstate Highway System is built, we will  hand it over to the respective States, understanding that each State  would have a portion of the Interstate Highway System running through  it. We will hand over to each State the portions of the Interstate  Highway System running through that State. Those States would then be  responsible for maintaining it and keeping it functioning and so forth.   In the seven or so decades since that plan was conceived and hatched,  we have now built the Interstate Highway System. It is complete. The  Federal gasoline tax has been adjusted on several occasions since then.  It has been a few decades since it has been adjusted, but it currently  stands at 18.4 cents per gallon. That is the portion of what every  American pays when they go to the gas pump. Regardless of what other  additional State tax they might pay on that gasoline, it is 18.4 cents  out of every gallon that goes into the Federal Highway Trust Fund, and  that is still there, notwithstanding the fact that the Interstate  Highway System is still in existence.   Now, one might ask why. Well, decisions have been made over time  suggesting it might be appropriate still for us to maintain the  Interstate Highway System using Federal gasoline tax dollars. It is a  decent argument; one that I can accept, notwithstanding the fact that  it wasn't part of the original plan.   Why then, with Federal infrastructure money, do we always dip into  the Federal Highway Trust Fund and have to supplement it with general  fund revenues?   Why is the 18.4 cents per gallon--a tax, remember, that is the  vestigial remains of the tax originally put in place to build it with  the understanding we would hand it over and the States would maintain  it.   The question becomes an even more interesting one when you realize  that it doesn't cost 18.4 cents per gallon to maintain the Interstate  Highway System. In fact, it doesn't take anything close to that.  Estimates vary some, but, according to some estimates, you can do that  for about 5 cents per gallon. And yet we collect 18.4 cents per gallon.  And yet that is never enough because, on transportation funding, we  routinely spend a lot more than that and we have to dip into other  sources of revenue, including what we collect in income tax and so  forth.   Why is that?   Well, it is because of the mission creep. Instead of just focusing on  Federal infrastructure, we have focused on  [[Page S5242]]  a lot of things that are not Federal infrastructure; things that, while  lovely, useful, perhaps necessary, aren't necessarily Federal in  nature; things like bike paths, hiking trails, beautification projects  that go alongside of a transportation corridor, and, in some cases,  mass transit systems; in some cases, surface streets that may or may  not even be connected to the Interstate Highway System; and that, in  many cases, start and end entirely within one State that are not part  of the interstate network at all.   So why, then, do we do that?   I mean, we do that to a really large degree. As the sponsors of this  bill, this bill that I received for the first time just moments ago--I  was sitting on the Senate floor waiting to begin my remarks, 2,702  pages long. I see it sitting near the desk clerk right now. It is a  rather impressive specimen. It is a large piece of legislation. It is  one that I look forward to reading. It is one that I realize will not  exactly read like a fast-paced novel.   Reading legislation like this and being able to digest it takes a  fair amount of expertise. It takes a lot of patience, and it takes  countless instances of cross-referencing to multiple existing  provisions in Federal law to understand. There is 2,702 pages. They  have worked hard on it. It has taken them 4 months to come up with it,  and even though I have got grave concerns with the legislation and  can't fathom a circumstance in which I will vote for it--although that  said, that remains to be seen, depending on what we are able to change  about it. You see, any piece of legislation can potentially turn into  something that any Member ought to be able to vote for it, depending on  how the amendment process goes.   In its current form, I couldn't possibly vote for it because it  simply spends too much money. It spends money that we do not have, and  it spends an enormous amount of money at a time when the American  people are feeling the pinch of inflation--inflation brought about  predictably and foreseeably by a government that spends way too much  money.   In effect, it is just printing more money. I mean, technically, I  know there is an additional step involved in that. Technically, it is  borrowed money. The Treasury issues instruments of debt, and in those  instruments of debt, we borrow money from our creditors. There are lots  of investors from all over America and throughout the world who buy  those instruments of debt from us   But because the U.S. dollar is the world's reserve currency, and  because many regard U.S. Treasuries as sort of the least bad investment  of its kind, people will buy them; and this stuff functions almost-- when we decide to issue additional debt--functions almost as if hitting  a button, just printing more money.   When you print more money and you have a relatively finite basket of  goods and services that an economy can produce in a particular year,  the same basket of goods--when that same basket of goods can be  targeted by more money, inflation is going to hit and people are going  to have to pay more for the same things that they always need to buy.   So, look, this doesn't necessarily hurt wealthy Americans. In fact,  some of the wealthiest and most well-connected Americans will get rich  off of legislation like this. Keep in mind, this legislation spends  $1.2 trillion. The $550 billion number is the number that just refers  to the new spending. So that means there was already roughly $700  billion that they were anticipating would be spent based on past  practice. That doesn't necessarily mean that we have to start all of  this from the assumption that we will continue spending at that pace,  but it certainly shouldn't obscure the fact that this is an enormous  amount of money--$1.2 trillion--that we will be spending here.   This is at a time when Americans are feeling the pinch of inflation  precisely because of the pace at which we have been spending money. I  mean, look, we were already spending way too much money even before  COVID hit. In the last few years, we have typically been shelling out  about $4 trillion a year through the Federal Government. And,  tragically, even at the top of the economic cycle, where we were right  when COVID hit, we were still borrowing $1 out of every $4 we were  spending. We were taking in about $3 trillion and spending about $4  trillion before COVID hit. This, at a time where we are at the top of  the economic cycle, fantastic economic growth, record low unemployment,  things were going great and we were still borrowing $1 out of every $4  we were spending. COVID hits. Last year, instead of spending $4  trillion, which is already too much, we spent $6.6 trillion, $6.7  trillion. So we spent $3.6 trillion more than we brought in.   One of my colleagues recently pointed out to me that about 37 percent  of all U.S. dollars that have ever come into existence have come into  existence in the last 18 months. That, by itself, should help people  understand why their dollars are going less far than they have ever  gone before. Because when you just add to the money supply, when  government spends that much money that it does not have, that does not  exist, it lessens the buying power of every dollar of every American.   There, again, are some people, wealthy, well-connected individuals  and corporations in this country who will get very rich off of a $1.2  trillion spending bill. They just will. We know it. They have got  sophisticated analysts, lawyers, lobbyists, and compliance specialists  who I can assure you right now, at this very moment, are combing  through that bill to figure out how they can get wealthy off of it.   Those who don't get wealthy off of it but who are already wealthy  themselves probably won't notice the pinch as much. Sure, they might  notice that they are paying more for everything from gasoline to  groceries, to air travel and everything in between, but it probably  won't impact their lifestyle, at least not for the top 1 percent.   But then you have got pretty much everyone else--pretty much everyone  else in America who is not wealthy, not well connected, who won't make  money off of this, and isn't wealthy enough; any person who is not  wealthy enough to be able to cushion the blow of inflation to where it  doesn't have to impact their lifestyle, pretty much everyone else, and  that means the overwhelming majority of Americans.   I mean, I am talking about probably 90, 95 percent of the men and  women in America really will get hurt by this. Most people in America,  in one way or another, are living paycheck to paycheck, and if their  paycheck remains the same during a time period in which each dollar  goes less far, that really hurts them. And if they are living close to  the edge on what they can afford with that paycheck and we further  diminish the buying power of the dollar through our reckless spending  in order to bring praise and adulation from the media and from each  other, shame on us. That is reverse Robin Hood. That is stealing from  the poor to give to the rich. Why then would we do that? Why would we  do it right now?    By the way, because of this same spending spree, this orgiastic  convulsion of Federal spending of money that we do not have, we have  labor shortages, and we have material shortages. The cost of labor and  the cost of materials that will go into these projects are costing more  than they ever have before. So why is this the time to aggressively  push something when we know full well that it will cost more right now  because of other things we have done and that will, in turn, make other  things that the American people need to buy more expensive?   Shame on us for making poor and middle-class Americans poorer so that  we can bring praise and adulation to ourselves and more money to a  small handful of wealthy, well-connected interests in America.   It begs the additional question: There has got to be an additional  reason why you would want to make all this spending Federal. I mean,  keep in mind, it is not just that most powers of government are and are  supposed to be lodged in States and localities. That is also true. But  it is also true that most infrastructure falls within the domain of  States and localities. Most roads that people use from one day to the  next are State roads or local roads. They are not Federal.   So why does all of this need to be Federal? Why couldn't some of  this, why couldn't most of it, why couldn't perhaps nearly all of  either the new spending or all of the spending incorporated within this  $1.2 trillion package, why shouldn't that be something  [[Page S5243]]  that States and localities could play a part in?   Now, one might reason, perhaps there is some additional efficiency  that could come from this centralization of this plan by making the  plan Federal--by making the money Federal. Maybe we can make it more  efficient. We can standardize it. That argument might be compelling if  it were true, but it isn't. It is quite to the contrary.   When you add Federal money to any infrastructure project, the minute  you add Federal money to it, you attach a whole host of Federal laws  and Federal regulations that the State or local government carrying out  the work then has to comply with, such that if the project were not  Federal, if there were not Federal dollars in place, they wouldn't have  to comply with the same Byzantine labyrinth. They wouldn't have to  negotiate this Byzantine labyrinth of Federal regulations and mandates.   This affects everything from the cost of labor to the cost of  materials, to the length of time needed to complete the project, the  paperwork involved. And at the end of the day, it results in less of  that money going into steel and concrete being placed in the ground and  a whole lot more of it going to lawyers, accountants, compliance  specialists, and delays, frankly.   In fact, this varies a little bit from State to State, but in many  States, including my own, you often add 30 percent, sometimes it is  closer to 40 percent, to the cost of a project the minute you add  Federal dollars. Even just a few Federal dollars will add these  requirements, and those requirements require a lot of additional money.   It is not the case that we make this more efficient, that we make  each dollar stretch farther by consolidating it and distributing it  back to the States, which is how these infrastructure projects often  work.   It is also intuitively something that doesn't add up. Why would we  take money, bring it to Washington, run it through our filter, knowing  some of that money can slosh around, some of it gets lost  administratively, and send it back? That wouldn't make things more  efficient. Separate and apart from the fact that we make infrastructure  more expensive when we do that, it doesn't make sense intuitively.   All of this also arises in the context in which, due to the recent  spending spree that we have been on in Washington, we are at a scary  place with regard to our debt-to-GDP ratio. It is about 2 years ago  when the Congressional Budget Office issued a report expressing some  concerns about the fact that we were, at the time, about 79 percent-- our debt-to-GDP ratio was about 79 percent.   It is concerning because it had been mounting for some time. It was  continuing to mount at the time. It was continuing, tragically, to  mount, even though we were at the top of the economic cycle with good  job growth, good economic growth, low unemployment, and so forth, and  yet we were still adding to the debt at a rate of about $1 trillion per  year. But they concluded, yes, 79 percent debt to GDP, this is bad.   They also forecasted at the time that we might cross the dreaded 100  percent debt-to-GDP ratio within about a decade. I believe the  prediction at the time was that we would cross that threshold sometime  in maybe 2029.   One of the reasons people worry about that is that there has been a  lot of research done on this. A couple of economists from Stanford  University wrote a book. The name of the book was, ``This Time Is  Different.'' It is one of many academic publications that explored the  relationship of the debt-to-GDP ratio and economic growth.   They conclude that once you cross that threshold, 100 percent debt to  GDP, economic growth tends to stall, and it becomes much more difficult  to manage the Federal debt at that point, the national debt that you  are dealing with. And they have done this using models from all over  the world, going back hundreds of years. And they have concluded that  this is a threshold at which economies tend to stall out.   The name of the book was inspired by the fact that they said,  basically, every country, when it approaches this sort of thing, tends  to--the government tends to tell the people of that country: Don't  worry. We are different. This time, it will be different, just as  Americans and the Federal Government tend to tell people this day:  Don't worry, this time it will be different.    They say it is not. This is real stuff.   So it was with some concern a couple of years ago, when the  Congressional Budget Office issued this report saying: Yes, we are at  79 percent now, and by the end of the 2020s, if we don't turn things  around, we should be hitting 100 percent debt-to-GDP ratio.   Just a couple of weeks ago, the CBO issued another report. That  report concluded that by the end of this year, by the end of 2021, our  debt-to-GDP ratio will be at a staggering 106 percent. So at that  moment when we really should be very concerned--because, look,  regardless how comfortable someone has been with deficit spending in  the past, there are people who brushed off concerns by making an  argument that, look, as long as the economy on the whole and the big  picture is growing faster than the debt, we should be able to keep a  lid on it; we should be able to prevent it from spinning out of  control.   Now, there is some real appeal to that argument, but that appeal  starts to dwindle. In fact, it disappears entirely once your debt is  growing much, much faster than your economy. And it gets even more  concerning once you past that 100 percent debt-to-GDP ratio because at  that point, many economists predict that you will experience not just a  cyclical, not just a periodic or episodic short-term downturn economic  growth, but you will experience a secular downturn, one that is likely  to last much longer than that.   So at a moment like that, I respectfully tend to think we should be  asking ourselves the question about money that we are already spending.  Should we even be spending money that we have already been planning to  spend? The $700 billion that we had planned to spend over the next few  years, perhaps that could be pared back. But, instead, we are saying:  No, we are going to do all of that, not cut back on any of it, and then  we are going to add $550 billion to it.   To me, that is kind of scary, especially when you take into account  how all of these things are interconnected. The fact that we have been  spending too much, way too much, the fact that we have inflated the  dollar as a result, that as a result of inflation, Americans are  finding it harder to fill up their gas tank, they are finding it harder  to pay their grocery bills, to pay for their rent, their mortgage, they  are finding it harder to do just about everything, so why would we want  to step on the accelerator at that moment, which also happens to be the  precise same moment when the cost of all the things that we will need  to undertake this ambitious infrastructure spending package, including  materials, steel, concrete, labor, everything else that we will need in  connection with that, when all of those things are more expensive and  made more expensive still by the fact that we are making them all  Federal because, when you use Federal dollars for an infrastructure  project, it typically cost a lot more.   In a State like mine, it is often 30 percent, sometimes more than  that. It costs that much more the minute you add Federal dollars. For  that reason, in my State and in many others, State transportation  officials--very bright--my friend Carlos Braceras, who has been the  long-time head of the Utah Department of Transportation, he and his  team in the State of Utah and with the help of Utah's Governor and its  legislature, they have figured ways to make sure that when Federal  funding comes their way, it doesn't bleed into everything.   There are a number of projects that they try to keep insulated from  Federal spending, from Federal dollars, specifically for the reason  that it is likely to cost more and sometimes take longer if you involve  Federal dollars in it. So why would we want to continue exactly as we  have been going and then add to it an additional $550 billion?   Now, on the inflation side of this argument, some of my colleagues  will argue--in fact, some of them argued tonight--that this is  noninflationary spending and that it is going to be lengthened over--it  will be spent over a lengthy period of time and we, therefore,  shouldn't worry about the impact it might have on inflation.   I have a couple of responses to that. First of all, the fact that we  will be  [[Page S5244]]  spending it over a period of several years doesn't mean it won't have  an impact on inflation. The fact is, when we spend more Federal money,  especially Federal money that we don't have, that is the definition of  inflationary. Maybe it is not as inflationary as it would have been had  this bill spent two or three times that amount and had it been mandated  that it all be spent immediately, but that doesn't make it  noninflationary.   Many of them also argued that it is OK because it is all paid for,  the new money is all paid for. Well, it is one of the things that we  will be exploring over the next few days, and I hope we will have even  longer than that to wade through it. On this point, I would add simply  that my colleagues--again, all Senators for whom I have tremendous  respect and affection.   Every one of these Senators who has worked on this has worked hard on  it. They are passionate about it. I like them. I respect them, even  though I disagree with them on this. But many of them pointed out that  it is paid for. Yet, when you look at the pay-fors, I wonder whether it  actually is.   Now, some of the arguments that they make in saying that it is all  paid for rely on things like recapturing COVID funds already  appropriated but not yet spent.   I suppose that is a good thing to do. If we have got COVID money that  we have appropriated but that hasn't been spent, I suppose we have got  to recapture that and direct it somewhere else. But I am not sure that  that necessarily means that there is no cost or consequence to choosing  to spend it here.   I mean, if we appropriated more money for COVID than we should have,  than we needed to, shouldn't we also consider--I don't know--giving it  back to the American people or paying down the debt so that we don't  add to the debt as quickly? I think that ought to be on the table as  well. So that is part of it, is the argument that we are taking a good  chunk of it from COVID money that has previously been appropriated but  not spent.   They also rely on a number of other arguments suggesting that it is  paid for and not through tax increases or additional borrowing. Some of  those arguments are, I suppose, technically defensible but not  necessarily within the spirit of what they are saying. For example,  there is a large sum of money, many billions of dollars--the last time  I checked, their proposal was at about $13 billion--to reinstate the  fees attached to the production and distribution of certain chemicals.  Like I said, the last time I checked, the proposal was at about $13  billion falling into that category. It might be more or less because,  again, we just now received the 2,702-page bill that now sits at the  clerk's desk in front of us.   So let's assume that it is $13 billion from the collection of that.  Well, it really is--at least, in my investigation of that, they are  imposing taxes on the production and distribution of certain chemicals,  many of which are used in the production of basically everything,  basically all consumer products.   So it is listed as a fee, not a tax. Sometimes, the distinction  between a fee and a tax can be relatively minor and relatively  insignificant, but, regardless, it is money that ends up being paid for  by poor and middle-class Americans in the form of higher prices passed  down to the consumer on everything that American consumers buy.   The biggest difference between this and a tax is that with a tax,  there is some record somewhere of what the taxpayer is paying. But with  a fee that is going into basically every consumer product in the case  of many of these chemicals, it is effectively an invisible or sort of  hidden tax, so it is actually less desirable than a tax increase, in  that respect.   Like I say, there are two purposes of our tax system. The more  obvious purpose is just to fund the government. But the other purpose  is to communicate the cost of government to the voter so that the voter  knows what they are getting and what they are paying for.   Things like these hidden fees that will increase the cost of all  manufactured items, maybe just a little but with no pricetag attached  to it, it seems kind of unfair to me.   Last I checked also, there were $56 billion counted among the pay- fors, $56 billion that they were counting on as something that would be  collected by the Federal Government as tax revenue as a result of  increased economic activity stemming specifically from the money that  we are spending in this legislation.   Now, I don't think we score infrastructure bills that way. To my  knowledge, we haven't done that in the past. To my knowledge, the  Congressional Budget Office, whose job it is to score these things and  which I hope will give us a score here--I don't think it typically  scores infrastructure bills that way.   So, yeah, we are going to spend $1.2 trillion on this bill, but that  $1.2 trillion being plied into the economy is going to do other things,  and that, in turn, will generate revenue and come back to us this way.  You sometimes hear of things like that being done from advocates of tax  reform, and sometimes dynamic scoring has been done in tax reform. I  don't think it is typically done with infrastructure projects.   I also think it is wildly speculative to assume that $56 billion will  come from this and that that $56 billion wouldn't come from the Federal  Government if we weren't doing this. It goes back to the common fallacy  with government. You can see the tangible things that government does,  but seeing those tangible things that government does often obscures  and makes impossible to know what would have been done in the absence  of government intervention, what hospital wing won't be built as a  result of people paying higher prices for everything they buy and  higher prices on their tax bill and through inflation, generally.   You don't always see all of the consequences built into that, but you  can see the tangible benefits, which is exactly why this is such a  tantalizing, tempting thing for politicians--because, look, when  politicians vote to spend more money, not theirs but everybody else's,  the way things work in our society today, in our mainstream media  today, you will get praised for that. You will pretty much always get  praised for voting to spend more of the American people's money as long  as you can identify good people who will benefit from it. And you can  almost always do that, and I am absolutely certain that there are a lot  of good, deserving, hard-working Americans who will be able to point to  things in this bill that they will benefit from. I won't take that away  from the bill's sponsors, not for a moment.    There are absolutely good things that will happen to good people-- good, deserving people--if we pass this legislation. It is very  tempting to do that because we will get praised if we do it. And once  we create the expectation that we are going to do it and then we don't  do it, we will get criticized. Predictably, those who vote for this  will get praised in the media. Those who vote against it will get  attacked as thoughtless and insensitive and not caring about those  people who will benefit from it.   But what about the Americans who will be harmed by it? It is one of  the tragic consequences of spending large volumes of money through a  system of government. We have the luxury in government of collecting  money by force. Usually, that force doesn't have to be brought to bear  directly; it is the implicit threat of the potential for use of force  that allows governments to collect money. In fact, it is what  differentiates governments from businesses or individuals or any other  enterprise that might want to collect money in some way. Governments  can use the implicit threat of force and carry out the threat of force  when necessary in order to carry out our mandate.   So we always have to remember that, even though we will get praised  for spending other people's money because there are good people who  will benefit from it, there are other people who are harmed. It is a  tragic consequence of concentrated benefits and dispersed burdens  attached to basically all spending legislation. I mean, it is really  difficult. I don't know quite how to unravel it other than to say it is  one of the many reasons why we should adhere to the constitutional  norms established in 1787, as modified with each of the 27 amendments  that we have adopted, in figuring out what is and what is not a Federal  priority.   There are a lot of things that are good ideas. We don't have to  utilize  [[Page S5245]]  force or the implicit use of force or the potential use of force for  all of them, but that is what we do when we push things through  government. And when we push them through the Federal Government, we  add other problems to them.   Back to the drafters of this legislation. It took them 4 months to  get to this. And, again, I commend them for doing that. I don't fault  them for the fact that it took them that long. I praise them for their  willingness to dedicate their time and that much of their lives to  something they care about. I happen to disagree with where they are  going with it, but I respect them, nonetheless, greatly for it.   But think about this. This group that has been working together has  been very, very intimately involved in the negotiation of the details  of it, but it took them 4 months to get there. There are, what, 10 or  so of them. But there are 100 of us, and we have got 435 counterparts  in the House of Representatives.   Article I, section 7 tells us that you can't create legislation at  the Federal level without going through Congress. You can't pass  Federal legislation without it passing the House and passing the Senate  and being presented to the President for signature or for veto. So it  does still have to get through this body.   What I would suggest is that if it took these 10 or so of our  colleagues 4 months to get here, it is not reasonable to expect that  the rest of us can be brought to where they are in a matter of days.  That is one of the reasons why we have committee processes. And I am  not of the view that there is no piece of legislation that ought to  ever be passed without it having gone through a full committee process  and regular order. There are lots of times when that might not be  necessary or appropriate or there might be other extenuating  circumstances.   I wonder, here, why that didn't happen, but, regardless, the bill is  here now. It is on the Senate floor now. We ought to consider it. But I  would suggest this. If it took them 4 months to get comfortable with  it, is it at all reasonable to expect that we should get through it and  over the threshold of passing it, placing burdens on the American  people that will last not just for years but for decades, in a matter  of days? Would it be unreasonable to suggest that we ought to have at  least a few weeks to debate it and discuss it; that we ought to have at  least half the time that they have had to prepare this? It took them 4  months. Shouldn't we at least have a month or 2?   We are approaching a time when Members of Congress typically spend  more time in their home States. Is it at all unreasonable to suggest  that maybe we ought to take that time to vet this with the people we  represent in our respective States? I would love nothing more than to  take that 2,702-page bill around the State of Utah with me in my visits  to the State in the month of August. I would love to get their input  on it. I would love for them to be able to have access to that document  so we can have this debate and this discussion.    And, yeah, sure, I have got grave concerns with it. In its present  form, I can't vote for it. That doesn't mean that we can't make it  better. That doesn't mean that we can't all benefit a lot from having  those who have elected us have the chance to review this.   Now, I don't expect that all 3\1/2\ million Utahans will read that  2,702-page bill. It does not read like a fast-paced novel. But they  still ought to have time to learn about what is in it, to at least read  analysis performed by others and presented to them in a digestible form  so that we can get their input on how it might affect their lives for  good or for ill.   Some of the other arguments that we have heard also need to be  addressed. We have been told tonight that many of our peer nations are  spending more money on infrastructure than we are. I am not sure that  is true in every case. In fact, there aren't a lot of countries on  Earth that can afford to spend anywhere near the amount of money that  we spend on anything, infrastructure or otherwise. So if that is what  they are suggesting, I am not sure the argument pans out in a dollar- for-dollar or dollar-for-dollar equivalent analysis. If they are  talking about as a percentage of GDP, maybe that is a good point.   If we are talking about China, I am not sure that we want to measure  what we do and evaluate the sufficiency of what we do on infrastructure  the same way China would. China, remember, has a very highly  centralized form of government and a very highly centralized economy,  which China, being a communist dictatorship, focuses around the  government, around their national government. That is a critical  difference. I don't think the Chinese model is one that we want to  emulate here.   The argument was also made that many in Europe are spending more.  Again, perhaps they mean as a percentage of GDP. I am not sure. I would  note here that many countries in Europe have the luxury of doing a lot  of things that we don't, in part, because of the burden that we carry  for them on issues of national defense. Even with that, I doubt very  highly that any country in Europe spends more dollars or more dollar  equivalence of whatever currency they use than the United States, so I  am not sure what is meant by that argument.   We have to remember that anytime a politician, anytime an elected  official, says ``you need me,'' the opposite is true. He or she, who  when saying ``you need me,'' is actually saying ``I need you.''   People aren't here to serve the government. The government exists for  the purpose of serving the people. We have to be very, very wary of  anything that sounds like we are telling the people ``you need us, you  need us to take money from you and to take money from your yet unborn  children or from your children who are alive today but not yet old  enough to vote and spend it in a manner that we see deem fit.''   For that additional reason, we should be extra cautious. As much as I  love and respect the colleagues who put together this 2,702-page bill,  I want to go through it to make sure that it spends money in the way  that my constituents would like, which is all the more reason why--if  it took them 4 months, shouldn't we really at least take a few weeks  with it and not just a few days?   Now, $1.2 trillion is what this bill wants to spend. It is easy to  get caught up in the words ``million,'' ``billion,'' ``trillion.'' In  fact, I have heard most of our colleagues--most of us at one point or  another have made the mistake, hopefully not in public as much, but at  least in our private conversations as we discuss large numbers--large  numbers necessarily involved in funding a government as large as ours  is. Sometimes we will find ourselves saying ``million'' when we mean  ``billion,'' or ``billion'' when we mean ``trillion,'' or some other  combination of syntactic errors. There is a big difference between  them, a thousandfold difference at every level.   Remember that a number of people have pointed out recently in order  to encapsulate the point, a million seconds lasts just 11\1/2\ days; a  billion seconds lasts 31.69 years; a trillion seconds lasts 31,688.74  years. There is an enormous difference here--an enormous difference  that we ought to take into account.   So I don't mean to suggest that any of this is easy. It is not easy  at all. But we ought to get concerned anytime someone proposes that we  spend this much money all at once, we have got to do our due diligence.   Now, people like to talk about roads, bridges, wastewater projects.  They like to talk about potholes. Those things are all really  important.    I would be happy to.    I am not sure I would use the word ``sui generis'' there,  but go ahead.    Mr. President, I appreciate my friend and colleague, the  majority leader, for allowing me to finish my remarks this evening.   When we look at legislation like this, I hope we can pay attention to  a few details--a few details--that focus on more than just our roads,  bridges, wastewater projects, and other infrastructure matters.   Are they important? I hope we will ask specifically: Are they  appropriately Federal? Could they be just as easily handled as some  other level of government?   I hope that we will also ask: If they are appropriate for the Federal  Government, are we spending appropriately there? And, are we doing it  at the right time? Are we placing the dollars that we are going to  spend on the right things?   I also hope that we will pay careful attention to something that my  friend and my distinguished colleague from Arizona, Senator Sinema,  said. She pointed out throughout this process it was difficult and time  consuming. I liked how she put it. She said: It is supposed to be that  way.   Our Founding Fathers set up a system in which it would necessarily be  difficult and time consuming to get there. She is absolutely right. It  is not supposed to be easy to pass legislation because legislation,  especially like this, impacts a lot of people--a lot of people who are  not here. There are only 100 of us who have the privilege of serving in  this body, and we have 330 million people in this country who will be  affected by it, and they will be affected by it for a long time to  come.   That is why it is supposed to be difficult and time consuming. There,  again, I point back to the fact that it took this committee--this  committee--or this group; they are not a committee--this group of 10 or  so Senators 4 painstaking months to come up with this. And it is to  their credit that they were able to get it done even in that amount of  time.   Again, I don't agree with the conclusion that they reached. I can't  vote for this bill as it is written. But that really is remarkable that  they were able to do it in that period of time.   The fact that they, as a small group, were able to do that in 4  months means that this body has no business passing this legislation in  a matter of just a few days. Quite arguably, we should need more time  than that, not less, to digest it. But for the sake of discussion, and  for the sake of respecting what appears to be a widely held view in  this body that we ought to act on this, we at least need a few weeks.  We shouldn't be doing this in just a few days.   I also hope that we will keep in mind that every one of us in this  body holds an election certificate, whether we participated in the  drafting of this bill or not, and every one of us should have the  opportunity to offer up amendments and to vote on those amendments to  make improvements to the bill, whether we support it in its current  form or not, whether we intend to vote for the finished package or not,  every one of us deserves an opportunity to offer as many amendments as  we may choose. And if we want them voted on, they should be voted on.  We shouldn't be afraid of it.   Often it is through the amendment process that we discover the nooks  and crannies, we discover the unintended consequences that we allow the  public to have visibility and to what has been a process that most  people don't have access to. So I hope that we will do that and that we  will be respectful to each other's views in doing that.   Bad things happen when legislation--especially legislation spending  as much money as this one does or anything close to it--is drafted in  secret.   Look, there is no problem--I don't have a problem at all with the  fact they have been meeting. Members have every prerogative to decide  what they want to propose behind closed doors. That is how the  deliberative process works that results in legislation. But once it is  here, as it is now, we need to take into account the fact that this  hasn't been through committee; this hasn't been aired in its current  form. We have got to give it the adequate airing that it needs and that  the American people deserve.   So I hope, I expect that in the coming days, what I hope will  actually be the coming weeks, we will have the opportunity to review  this in full, to share it with our constituents, to have it analyzed,  to have it scored by the Congressional Budget Office--we have no  business spending this kind of money without a CBO score--and then  Members need to be able to offer amendments on it.   We live in difficult times, and we live in times where there is a lot  of rancor and there is a lot of disagreement. I am glad that there has  been a good feeling here tonight with people who have been able to come  together.   Sometimes we can't pass legislation simply because it is bipartisan.  We can't be expected to pass it just because some Democrats and some  Republicans happen to agree with it. That is actually not all that  uncommon.   From watching the news, sometimes you get the impression we can't  stand each other and that there is such deep-rooted animus across party  lines, that we can't talk to each other, we don't like each other, and  that the problem with Congress is that we can't get anything done  because there is partisan gridlock that stops everything.   Well, I would offer a different perspective to that. The fact that  legislation like this occurs, bipartisanship; the fact that you don't  get to be almost $30 trillion in debt without a whole lot of  bipartisanship. Every single time we add an enormous sum to our  national debt, there is bipartisanship behind it. Just because  something is bipartisan doesn't mean that it is taking into account the  needs of poor and middle-class Americans, who increasingly, of late,  are being robbed blind by those who, for short-term political gain and  praising the media, will make things more expensive for the poor and  middle class, enabling a small handful of wealthy and well-connected  interests to benefit from it. The fact that it is bipartisan shouldn't  obscure the problems with it. I hope we will have an opportunity to  address those problems and that we will give this legislation the due  consideration it deserves.   Mr. President, I yield the floor                            ____________________
