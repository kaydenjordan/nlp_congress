 Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask for permission to complete my  remarks before the recess.    Mr. President, 50 years ago this last Sunday, the Supreme  Court ruled that reproductive healthcare in America is a  constitutionally protected right and that Americans have the freedom to  make the most personal decision imaginable: when--and whether--to start  a family. The case was called Roe v. Wade.   For those who were alive when it was decided, we remember what it  meant for millions of Americans: the freedom to make their own  reproductive health decisions. Remember, at the time Roe was decided in  1973, our Nation had a long, long way to go in living up to the promise  of equal justice under the law. As just one example, women were often  required, at that time in history, to ask their husbands for permission  to apply for credit cards. In many banks, widowers and divorced women  had to bring along a man who would cosign for a credit card. Can you  imagine that?   Fifty years later, we still have a long way to go, of course, but Roe  was a breakthrough. It was a vision of an America that could be looking  to the future of opportunity.   Well, today, sadly, marks a very different anniversary. You see, it  was 7 months ago today when six rightwing, judicial activists on the  Supreme Court sent us back in time. Of course, I am referring to the  Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health  Organization--the crowning achievement of the Republican-led, decades- long campaign to overturn Roe and abolish reproductive rights in  America.   The Dobbs ruling is one of the most irresponsible and dangerous  decisions ever handed down by the U.S. Supreme Court. It ripped away a  constitutional right from individuals, handing it over to politicians  in suits.   With the Dobbs decision, the ultraconservative majority not only  overturned a nearly 50-year-old precedent that had been reaffirmed  many, many times, they twisted the facts to reach the outcome they  wanted.   What do I mean by that? Well, in his majority opinion, Justice Alito  claimed that abortion cannot be constitutionally protected because it  is not ``deeply rooted in the Nation's history and tradition.'' He is  wrong because whatever you think about abortion, it has deep roots in  our country. As the dissenting Justices in Dobbs wrote,  ``embarrassingly for the majority--early law in fact does provide some  support for abortion rights.''   The dissent noted that common law authorities did not treat abortion  as a crime before the point of fetal movement in the womb--also known  as quickening. And as Justice Alito himself conceded, historians  dispute whether prequickening abortions were punished before the 19th  century.   So there is no credibility to Justice Alito's argument for  overturning Roe. It wasn't originalism by any stretch. It wasn't  textualism. It was an ideologically motivated outcome based on  historical cherry-picking.   Someone asked the question the other day: After this decision, should  the Justices be asked to wear red and blue robes instead of black  robes?   Over the past 7 months, Republican lawmakers picked up right where  the Thomas-Alito Court left off. In State after State, they have ripped  away reproductive rights from millions of Americans.   Overturning Roe v. Wade has unleashed a healthcare crisis in our  country. In just 7 months, 24 States have banned or severely restricted  access to abortion or are preparing to do so. Many of these bans  provide no exceptions, even for rape and incest victims, and many are  insufficient in protecting the health and lives of mothers. And all of  these bans have added layers and layers of government bureaucracy for  women seeking emergency care.    If these Republican lawmakers have actually listened to all of the  medical professionals who sounded the alarm on overturning Roe, if  these lawmakers had actually listened to all of the Americans who took  to the streets in protest or the millions of voters who rejected their  radical agenda, then maybe you would understand the simple,  indisputable truth: You cannot ban abortion out of existence.   The only thing these laws have changed, if anything, is pushing women  into dangerous and deadly situations. We have already seen the barbaric  consequences in these Republican abortion bans. And they haven't just  endangered the lives of women living in red States; they have put every  woman in danger.   Christina Zielke is one of those women. She recently shared her story  [[Page S67]]  on NPR. This past July, Christina and her husband were overjoyed when  they discovered she was pregnant. It was their first pregnancy. But  that joy turned to sorrow after the first ultrasound. The doctors  couldn't detect a heartbeat, and they concluded it was a miscarriage.   When Christina asked the doctor, ``What do I do next,'' the doctor  recommended giving her body time to pass the pregnancy tissue--a  process that can take days or even weeks. So Christina and her husband  decided to wait and move on with their lives.   Soon after that appointment, the two of them drove from their home in  Washington, DC, to Ohio to attend a family wedding. But during the  drive, Christina started bleeding. She assumed her body had finally  passed the pregnancy tissue. But later, in the middle of the night, she  started bleeding again. It was serious.   It was at that time that Christina and her husband, at the advice of  a nurse, went to an emergency room in Painesville, OH. Now, remember,  Christina's doctor had already told her that her pregnancy ended in a  miscarriage. But when she arrived at that Ohio hospital, the medical  staff refused to provide her any care because they were afraid of  violating Ohio's new abortion ban.   So while Christina was still in danger, still bleeding, and carrying  a fetus with no heartbeat, the hospital discharged her and refused to  treat her. She objected, even showing them her records confirming the  miscarriage. She was ignored and sent home.   Hours later, she returned to that same ER. By that point, she had  lost so much blood she had lost consciousness. The paramedics had to  use a sheet to pull her limp body out of a bathtub and onto a  stretcher. Christina's family thought she was going to die. And let's  be blunt: The only reason her life was in peril was because of Ohio's  State law banning abortion.   This is America's post-Roe reality: women denied urgent care because  doctors and nurses are afraid of breaking State laws. Ohio's abortion  ban subjects healthcare providers who violate it to felony charges, up  to a year in prison, loss of medical licenses, and fines up to $20,000.  The law is so unclear in Ohio that even medical professionals struggle  to navigate its narrow exceptions.   When you hear stories like that by Christina, imagine if it was a  member of your family--your wife, the mother of your children, people  who want to live desperately and simply need the healthcare to make it  happen--it is really no surprise that Americans are fleeing red States  to access essential healthcare in blue States.   My State of Illinois, for instance, has become a leader on  reproductive freedom--a so-called oasis. Every single State that we  border has either restricted abortion or abandoned it outright. For  women living in the Midwest, our reproductive health facilities are  indispensable. Look at the numbers. Before Roe was overturned, only 6  percent of women seeking abortions at Illinois Planned Parenthood  facilities traveled from out of State--6 percent. Since the Dobbs  decision, that number has jumped to 30 percent.   And I want to commend our State's leadership because they stepped in  to provide care for women who have been betrayed by their own States.  Earlier this month, Governor Pritzker signed a bill into law protecting  women traveling to Illinois for reproductive care. Sadly, these efforts  to protect reproductive freedom have also made Illinois providers a  target. Just 2 days ago, after Governor Pritzker signed a bill into  law, someone firebombed a Planned Parenthood clinic in Peoria--a clinic  that doesn't even perform surgical abortions.   In post-Roe America, the mere act of seeking reproductive advice and  care--even for a procedure as simple as a Pap smear--has taken on new  risks. Lawmakers on both sides need to condemn this and any form of  politically motivated violence against any person or entity.   If there is any doubt that the Dobbs decision has unleashed chaos,  consider the impact on maternal health outcomes. Even before Roe was  overturned, our Nation had the highest maternal mortality rate in the  developed world--America, the highest maternal mortality rate in the  developed world. And as of 2020, those death rates are more than 60  percent higher in States with abortion restrictions.   This is not a problem without a solution: Studies show that more than  four in five pregnancy-related deaths are preventable. These mothers  can be saved. And one way to prevent them is by expanding access to  postpartum health coverage. That is why I have worked with Illinois  Congresswoman Robin Kelly to pass a law that gives States the option to  expand health coverage under Medicaid from 60 days postpartum to a full  year. We led this effort because in our State, one-third of pregnancy- related deaths happen after 60 days postpartum.   So for States that have now outlawed abortion, you would imagine the  first thing they would do is to take advantage of this new benefit and  expand health coverage for its expecting mothers on Medicaid. That  sounds like a no-brainer, right? Apparently not. Today, there are 15  States that have not extended Medicaid postpartum coverage, and 12 of  these States have also passed laws restricting abortion. If they are  truly dedicated to the new mother and her baby, why wouldn't they give  them healthcare coverage for a full year after the baby is born to save  their lives and the babies' lives?   So if you are a woman living in a State like Idaho or South Dakota,  you can be forced to carry a pregnancy to term, but once you have had  your baby, those States--Idaho and South Dakota--refuse to cover your  healthcare during the most critical, dangerous postpartum period.   Let's get real. There is no world in which this position can be  described as ``pro-life.''   We in the Senate can make a difference for all the women in America  who have been abandoned by their States, and we can do it by restoring  and codifying the right to reproductive freedom by passing pro-family  policies, like the MOMMA's Act, which mandates Medicaid expansion and  postpartum coverage.   Unfortunately, it seems the new MAGA majority in the House has other  plans in mind. Just this past week, Majority Leader Steve Scalise  pledged to a group of anti-choice activists that the overturning of Roe  was ``only the first phase of this battle.'' Those are his words. His  Republican colleagues have already made good on it. Less than 1 month  into the new Congress, House Republicans have introduced a dozen anti- abortion bills.   Here is my promise: Every one of those bills is destined to fail if  it comes to the Senate. They are going nowhere because this majority  and President Biden understand that all Americans deserve reproductive  rights. And until we have a Congress and Supreme Court willing to  protect those rights, we need to do everything in our power to stand  against this extremist, anti-choice agenda.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
