 Mr. Speaker, school principals are more than just managers  of educators and school activities. These individuals become students'  friends, mentors, coaches, and advocates.   Today, I have the distinct honor of recognizing Dr. Mark Crummey,  principal of Highland Park Elementary  [[Page H5983]]  School in Roanoke, Virginia. Dr. Crummey was recently named Elementary  Principal of the Year by the Virginia Parent Teacher Association.   Dr. Crummey has over 25 years of experience in education. As both an  educator and administrator, his life has been dedicated to service. His  quarter century of experience continues to enrich the lives of the  students who pass through the doors of Highland Park.   During Dr. Crummey's tenure, students have shown improvements in both  grades and test scores, a testament to his and the staff of Highland  Park Elementary's efforts.   Mr. Rogers once said: ``Anyone who does anything to help a child in  his life is a hero to me.'' I agree with that statement and want to  recognize Dr. Crummey as a hero in our community. His continued  dedication to the students of Highland Park Elementary is commendable,  and I congratulate him on this incredible honor.                            ____________________
