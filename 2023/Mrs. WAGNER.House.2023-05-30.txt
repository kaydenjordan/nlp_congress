 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2792) to require the Securities and Exchange Commission to  carry out a study and rulemaking on the definition of the term ``small  entity'' for purposes of the securities laws, and for other purposes,  as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2792         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Small Entity Update Act''.       SEC. 2. STUDIES, REPORTS, AND RULES REGARDING SMALL ENTITIES.         (a) Definitions.--In this section--        (1) the term ``Commission'' means the Securities and       Exchange Commission; and        (2) the term ``small entity''--        (A) has the meaning given the term in section 601 of title       5, United States Code, with respect to the activities of the       Commission; and        (B) includes any definition established by the Commission       of the term ``small business'', ``small organization'', or       ``small governmental jurisdiction'' under paragraph (3), (4),       or (5), respectively, of section 601 of title 5, United       States Code, with respect to the activities of the       Commission.        (b) Studies and Reports.--Not later than 1 year after the       date of enactment of this Act, and again 5 years thereafter,       the Commission shall--        (1) conduct a study of the definition of the term ``small       entity'' with respect to the activities of the Commission for       the purposes of chapter 6 of title 5, United States Code,       which shall consider--        (A) the extent to which the definition of the term ``small       entity'', as in effect during the period in which the study       is conducted, aligns with the findings and declarations made       under section 2(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5       U.S.C. 601 note);        (B) the amount by which financial markets in the United       States have grown since the last time the Commission amended       the definition of the term ``small entity'', if applicable;       and        (C) how the Commission should define the term ``small       entity'' to ensure that a meaningful number of entities would       fall under that definition; and        (2) submit to Congress a report that includes--        (A) the results of the applicable study conducted under       paragraph (1); and        (B) specific and detailed recommendations on the ways in       which the Commission could amend the definition of the term       ``small entity'' to--        (i) be consistent with the results described in       subparagraph (A); and        (ii) expand the number of entities covered by such       definition.        (c) Rulemaking.--After the completion of each study       required under subsection (b), the Commission shall, subject       to public notice and comment, revise the rules of the       Commission consistent with the results of such study.        (d) Inflation Adjustments.--As soon as practicable       following the date of enactment of this Act, and every 5       years thereafter, the Commission shall adjust all dollar       figures under the definition of small entity established by       the Commission to reflect the change in the Consumer Price       Index for All Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of       Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 2792, the Small  Entity Update Act.   Mr. Speaker, the slated bills that we are considering today are the  culmination of four hearings that the Capital Markets Subcommittee,  which I have the honor and privilege of chairing, has held this year,  where we heard from over a dozen witnesses, including founders of  private and public companies, investors, former SEC Commissioners,  security law practitioners, and even one of the authors of the IPO- related provisions of the JOBS Act.   All of these bills play a vital role in expanding investment  opportunities for all Americans, improving access to capital for small  businesses, and strengthening our public markets.   Mr. Speaker, 11 years ago, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act,  or JOBS Act of 2012, was enacted into law by a divided Congress with  the intention of increasing access to capital for small businesses and  entrepreneurs in the United States. The purpose of the JOBS Act was to  provide greater opportunities for small business owners and  entrepreneurs to grow their companies and create jobs in their  communities.   Despite the successes of the JOBS Act, there are still significant  regulatory barriers that impede the growth of small businesses and  hinder the competitiveness of job growth in the United States.   Small businesses, Mr. Speaker, make up 99 percent of all enterprises,  employ almost half of the United States' workforce, and are  disproportionately affected by these barriers. These companies  represent the engine of our economy and are far too often subject to  one-size-fits-all regulation. The lack of access to capital makes it  challenging for small business owners to grow and expand their  companies, which can limit job creation and economic growth.   That is why I introduced the Small Entity Update Act. This bipartisan  bill would direct the SEC to conduct a study, followed by a rulemaking  that is consistent with the results of such study every 5 years. This  study would focus on defining the term ``small entity'' under the  Regulatory Flexibility Act.   Regulations often impose disproportionate burdens on startups, small  businesses, and other small entities. Small entities simply can't  afford the number of lawyers and regulatory experts that large  multinational firms can to comply with every regulation while still  being able to afford the cost of doing business.   The government cannot and should not treat a small startup in my  hometown of Ballwin, Missouri, with seven employees as it would a  Fortune 500 company. The reality is that the size of companies and the  underlying makeup of market forces behind them change over time, which  is why my bill requires the SEC to reevaluate their small business  definition every 5 years. What makes sense for companies today in terms  of regulatory compliance may not in 5 years.   My bill addresses longstanding concerns that numerous SEC rules do  not appropriately balance the SEC's mandates to protect investors and  facilitate capital formation. Studying and revising these definitions  will result in a better understanding of regulatory costs on small  entities and ensure that the SEC modernizes its criteria for defining  them.   In order for our economy to thrive, Mr. Speaker, Congress and  regulators must ensure that any policies enacted keep in mind any  impacts they would have on our millions of small businesses.   H.R. 2792 will lead to a more targeted regulatory framework for these  entities and help make the American Dream a reality for all  entrepreneurs.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Himes, Mr. Torres, Mr. Scott, and Mr. Casten  for their bipartisan support of this  [[Page H2653]]  impactful legislation, and I urge all my colleagues to vote for this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2792, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2795) to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to  require issuers with a multi-class stock structure to make certain  disclosures in any proxy or consent solicitation material, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2795         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Enhancing Multi-Class Share       Disclosures Act''.       SEC. 2. DISCLOSURE RELATING TO MULTI-CLASS SHARE STRUCTURES.         Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15       U.S.C. 78n) is amended by adding at the end the following:        ``(l) Disclosure Relating to Multi-class Share       Structures.--        ``(1) Disclosure.--The Commission shall, by rule, require       each issuer with a multi-class share structure to disclose       the information described in paragraph (2) in any proxy or       consent solicitation material for an annual meeting of the       shareholders of the issuer, or any other filing as the       Commission determines appropriate.        ``(2) Content.--A disclosure made under paragraph (1) shall       include, with respect to each person who is a director,       director nominee, or named executive officer of the issuer,       or who is the beneficial owner of securities with 5 percent       or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of       securities entitled to vote in the election of directors--        ``(A) the number of shares of all classes of securities       entitled to vote in the election of directors beneficially       owned by such person, expressed as a percentage of the total       number of the outstanding securities of the issuer entitled       to vote in the election of directors; and        ``(B) the amount of voting power held by such person,       expressed as a percentage of the total combined voting power       of all classes of the securities of the issuer entitled to       vote in the election of directors.        ``(3) Multi-class share structure.--In this subsection, the       term `multi-class share structure' means a capitalization       structure that contains 2 or more classes of securities that       have differing amounts of voting rights in the election of       directors.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2795, the Enhancing Multi- Class Share Disclosures Act.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the other side of the aisle,  Congressman Meeks, for his work on this thoughtful piece of bipartisan  legislation that improves the information shareholders receive about  voting powers in the companies in which they invest.   Since the late 1800s, U.S. companies have utilized multi-class share  structures. The original intent behind these structures was to allow  companies, particularly family-run enterprises, to maintain voting  control without having to own the majority of equity in their company.   There have been several efforts to limit the availability of multi- class share structures in the past. For example, starting in 1926 and  ending in 1985, some national securities exchanges restricted the  number of multi-class shares that were allowed to list on those  exchanges.   In response to the increasing competitiveness of national securities  exchanges in the 1980s, the exchanges eased those restrictions on  multi-class share structures. While the SEC Investor Advisory Committee  has called for more mandatory disclosures from companies with multi- class shares, the SEC does not currently require companies to disclose  the gap between the equity an individual holds in the company and the  number of voting shares they control, although many companies already  disclose those for their shareholders voluntarily.   By requiring disclosures regarding voting power, particularly  regarding officers and directors and those who have more than 5 percent  voting power, H.R. 2795 will ensure that shareholders receive more  uniform information in proxy materials.   Mr. Speaker, rather than prohibiting multi-class share structures  altogether, H.R. 2795 represents a thoughtful and balanced approach to  enhance  [[Page H2654]]  transparency without eliminating class structures that encourage  founders that may not otherwise go public to do so.   Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, I support H.R. 2795, and I urge my  colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, are there further requests for time on the  other side or does the gentlewoman from California yield back?   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I simply urge my colleagues to support H.R.  2795, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2796) to amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to  require the Advocate for Small Business Capital Formation to provide  educational resources and host events to promote capital raising  options for traditionally under-represented small businesses, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2796         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Promoting Opportunities for       Non-Traditional Capital Formation Act''.       SEC. 2. PROMOTING CAPITAL RAISING OPTIONS FOR TRADITIONALLY                     UNDERREPRESENTED SMALL BUSINESSES.         Section 4(j)(4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15       U.S.C. 78d(j)(4)) is amended--        (1) in subparagraph (G), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (2) in subparagraph (H), by striking the period at the end       and inserting a semicolon; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(I) provide educational resources and host events to       raise awareness of capital raising options for--  [[Page H2655]]         ``(i) underrepresented small businesses, including women-      owned and minority-owned small businesses;        ``(ii) businesses located in rural areas; and        ``(iii) small businesses affected by hurricanes or other       natural disasters; and        ``(J) at least annually, meet with representatives of State       securities commissions to discuss opportunities for       collaboration and coordination with respect to efforts to       assist small businesses and small business investors.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2796, the Promoting  Opportunities for Non-Traditional Capital Formation Act.   I thank my colleague and ranking member of the Financial Services  Committee, Ms. Waters, for her work on this commonsense, bipartisan  legislation to improve access to capital for underserved entrepreneurs  and businesses from overlooked parts of the country.   When trying to raise capital to start or grow their businesses,  entrepreneurs and founders need as little friction as possible.  Unfortunately, access to capital and funding is more challenging for  some than others. Likewise, funding is harder to obtain outside of a  few select regions.   For example, most venture capital funding goes to companies in just  three States: California, Massachusetts, and New York.   Likewise, less than 3 percent of venture dollars went to women,  Black, and Latino founders. As a result, Congress should take steps to  help companies and entrepreneurs from all geographic regions have  access to resources that they need to grow.   This bill would require the SEC's Office of the Advocate for Small  Business Capital Formation, or the Advocate, to provide educational  resources and host events to promote capital-raising options for  underrepresented small businesses and businesses in rural areas.   Last month, the Financial Services Committee passed numerous  bipartisan bills out of our committee to facilitate capital formation  and increase access to capital for entrepreneurs and small businesses.  H.R. 2796 is a commonsense piece of our committee's efforts and  complements the other bills that we passed.   Mr. Speaker, by requiring the Advocate to provide educational  resources and host events to promote capital-raising options for  underserved entrepreneurs, this bill will assist entrepreneurs  throughout the entire country in utilizing the capital-raising  provisions within our securities laws best suited for their needs and  circumstances. For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support H.R.  2796.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, are there further requests for time on the  other side, or does the gentlewoman from California, is she prepared to  close and yield back? I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I simply urge my colleagues to support H.R.  2796, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.  [[Page H2656]]    The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2797) to amend the Securities Act of 1933 to require  certification examinations for accredited investors, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2797         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Equal Opportunity for All       Investors Act of 2023''.       SEC. 2. CERTIFICATION EXAMINATIONS FOR ACCREDITED INVESTORS.         (a) In General.--The Securities and Exchange Commission       shall revise the definition of ``accredited investor'' under       Regulation D (section 230.501 of title 15, Code of Federal       Regulations) to include any natural person who is certified       through the examination required under subsection (b).        (b) Establishment of Examination.--Not later than 1 year       after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Securities       and Exchange Commission shall establish an examination       (including a test, certification, or examination program)--        (1) to certify an individual as an accredited investor; and        (2) that--        (A) is designed with an appropriate level of difficulty       such that an individual with financial sophistication would       be unlikely to fail; and        (B) includes methods to determine whether an individual       seeking to be certified as an accredited investor       demonstrates competency with respect to--        (i) the different types of securities;        (ii) the disclosure requirements under the securities laws       applicable to issuers and private companies as compared to       public companies;        (iii) corporate governance;        (iv) financial statements and the components of such       statements;        (v) aspects of unregistered securities, securities issued       by private companies, and investments into private funds,       including risks associated with--         (I) limited liquidity;        (II) limited disclosures;        (III) variance in valuation methods;        (IV) information asymmetry;        (V) leverage risks;        (VI) concentration risk; and        (VII) longer investment horizons;         (vi) potential conflicts of interest, when the interests of       the financial professionals and their clients are misaligned       or when their professional responsibilities are compromised       by financial motivations; and        (vii) other criteria the Commission determines necessary or       appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of       investors.        (c) Administration.--Beginning not later than 180 days       after the date the examination is established under       subsection (b), such examination shall be administered and       offered free of charge to the public by a registered national       securities association under section 15A of the Securities       Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-3).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and include extraneous material on this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2797, the Equal Opportunity  for All Investors Act. I thank my colleagues, Congressman Flood and  Congressman Nickel, for their work on this important piece of  bipartisan legislation that will safely increase investment  opportunities for everyday investors.   The ``accredited investor'' definition is intended to limit private  market investments to only those investors who are considered  ``sophisticated.''                                time  1700    To qualify as an accredited investor, an individual must have an  annual income of at least $200,000 or $300,000 together with a spouse  for each of the previous 2 years or a net worth of over $1 million.   However, using wealth as a proxy for determining sophistication  excludes a large pool of investors who may have other types of  expertise or experience.   According to estimates from the Securities and Exchange Commission,  the SEC, in 2016, about 13 percent of U.S. households qualified as  accredited investors.   Additionally, only about 1.3 percent and 2.8 percent of accredited  investors are Black and Latino, respectively. H.R. 2797 represents a  thoughtful approach to expanding the accredited investor definition to  include individuals who are certified through an examination  established by the SEC and administered by FINRA.   Under this bill, if you can demonstrate competency with these types  of investments through an exam, then you qualify as an accredited  investor.   Mr. Speaker, by expanding the pathways to qualify as an accredited  investor beyond wealth tests, this bill modernizes the outdated  definition that has inappropriately sidelined sophisticated-but-not- wealthy individuals from high-growth asset classes historically  reserved for the wealthiest individuals. By doing so, this legislation  will help more American families realize the American Dream by building  wealth through our capital markets.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2797, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr.  Flood), the author of this piece of legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to support  H.R. 2797, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
