 Madam President, I want to comment on an incident that  occurred late last week on the floor of the Senate regarding temporary  protected status, known as TPS, for people from the country of  Venezuela.   TPS can be provided by the President to nationals of a country when  that country is experiencing violence or a catastrophe that makes  returning to the country unsafe. This is a protection offered by  America under many different administrations to help those who might be  in the United States when a calamity occurs in their home countries. It  has often been granted for countries suffering outbreaks of war or  natural disaster, which leads me to the issue of Venezuela.   Currently, the United States is working with regional partners to  foster an end to a disastrous dictatorial regime still claiming power  in Venezuela.   I was there last year, and I saw what was heartbreaking, considering  that this was once a proud Latin American democracy.   People are literally starving in Venezuela. They faint in the  workplace from lack of nutrition. Hospitals don't have electric power  or the most basic medicines. I visited a children's hospital in  Caracas, and they told me they didn't have any antibiotics or the basic  cancer drugs necessary for the children who came to their hospital.   Millions are fleeing Venezuela as refugees into neighboring  countries. There is brutal political repression. Opposing the dictator,  Maduro, is a virtual guarantee of house arrest or worse. Staggering  government corruption and a systematic dismantling of that country's  democracy are taking place on a regular basis and resulted in election  results which were incredible and not believed by anyone in the region  when they were announced a few months back.   I have been supportive of this administration's efforts to work with  other nations to support the interim Presidency of Juan Guaido and  provide assistance to millions of fleeing Venezuelans.   While I fear this issue has escaped President Trump's attention, one  simple step he can take is to grant temporary protected status to  Venezuelans currently in the United States. Some are here as students  and others are here on work visas, but they are on temporary status.  What I am asking the President to do is to give them temporary  protected status so they will not have to return to Venezuela while the  danger still lurks.   Despite repeated requests by myself and many of my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle, President Trump has repeatedly refused. He goes to  audiences in Florida and talks about confronting the Venezuelan  dictatorship, then he turns around and refuses to give protection to  the Venezuelans in the United States who need this protection.   Ironically, while the President's Department of State has issued  travel warnings advising Americans not to visit Venezuela because of  the danger, this President still will not protect Venezuelans within  the United States who are afraid to return.   I have met many such Venezuelans in my home State of Illinois, and I  can tell you they are desperately worried about returning to the chaos,  violence, and hopelessness of the current Venezuela.   Since the White House refuses to act, the House of Representatives  passed a bipartisan bill granting temporary protected status to  Venezuelans this last July by a 272-to-158 margin. Senator Bob Menendez  of New Jersey, Marco Rubio of Florida, and I have introduced a similar  Senate bill, but the majority leader, Senator McConnell, refuses to  bring up any bill that might not meet the approval of President Donald  Trump, even a bill offered by leaders in his own political party.   Senator Menendez and I have tried to call up the House bill for  passage only to face objection repeatedly from Senate Republicans.   Last week, to deflect blame from President Trump and the Senate  Republicans who object to our bill, the junior Senator from Florida  came to the floor with his own approach. He blocked the bipartisan  House Venezuela TPS bill from passing and offered a dubious amendment,  undermining TPS for others as the price for helping the Venezuelans. In  other words, he said: Well, perhaps we can help Venezuelans as long as  it is at the expense of others who are in similar status from other  countries.   His proposal would in fact significantly weaken the entire temporary  protected status. For example, his proposal would require congressional  approval of any extension of TPS beyond the original period, and it  would limit such extension to an arbitrary 18-month period.   Ultimately, the proposal from the junior Senator from Florida is  using the plight of Venezuelans to basically gut the existing Temporary  Protected Status Program.   We have seen folks on the other side of the aisle resort to this when  it came to DACA--Republicans in the Senate trying to use a vulnerable  population, such as the young people who were raised in the United  States and want a chance to work their way to citizenship, as  bargaining chips for an anti-immigrant agenda. Once again, these  Members are simply refusing to stand up to the President when he fails  on these issues.   The solution, indeed, is simple. This administration should grant  temporary protected status on its own to the Venezuelans, but it  refuses. Senate Republicans could pass the bipartisan House bill to  grant Venezuelans temporary protected status, but the Senate  Republicans refuse.   Let everyone be clear where the real failure to help Venezuelans  actually rests.                              Order of Business    Madam President, at the request of the Republicans on the Senate  side, later today, I will be making a unanimous consent request  relative to the healthcare issue, which was raised by Senator McConnell  earlier. I am told they are not quite ready this morning, so I am going  to defer that offer until later in the day when they will be ready, and  we can have a colloquy on the floor of the U.S. Senate.   I yield the floor.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader     Mr. President, it is my honor to come to the floor to  speak on an issue that is important for so many Americans.   Let me start at the outset--before I move to unanimous consent on a  specific piece of legislation--by saying that I believe that the change  in the Affordable Care Act, which prohibited discrimination against  people because of preexisting conditions, is one of the most  fundamental changes in health insurance in America. Who among us  doesn't have a member of their family or a friend with a preexisting  condition?   There was a time, of course, when because of that, people were denied  any coverage or charged exorbitant amounts of money. Overwhelmingly, we  understand that if we are going to have a health insurance system that  really serves the entire Nation, we cannot allow health insurance  companies to pick and choose.   Prior to the Affordable Care Act's passage in 2010, health insurers  used to charge people with preexisting conditions higher monthly  premiums or simply deny them coverage all together. Health insurance  companies used to impose annual lifetime caps on what they could pay  for. These arbitrary limits disproportionately hurt people with  preexisting conditions who often needed ongoing intensive medical care,  and insurance companies before the Affordable Care Act used to refuse  coverage for certain healthcare services that people with preexisting  conditions needed--prescription drugs, hospital visits, mental health  and substance abuse treatment, maternity and newborn care.   The Affordable Care Act changed all of that. There are no more  denials or higher premiums for preexisting conditions, which is an  amazing breakthrough. There are no more annual or lifetime caps on  benefits and no more refusals to cover maternity benefits or doctors'  visits.   Ten years ago, every single Democrat--I was one of them--voted in  favor of the Affordable Care Act, and I would do it again today. It was  a law that ensured these protections for people with preexisting  conditions really meant something and were enforceable.   Ten years ago, every single Senate Republican voted against the  Affordable Care Act. Since it has been signed into law, House and  Senate Republicans have voted more than 100 times to repeal the  Affordable Care Act. Their efforts have failed. There was one most  dramatic effort, which many of us can recall happened just a couple of  years ago, right here in the well of the Senate when the late Senator  John McCain, Republican of Arizona, came to the floor in the middle of  the night and cast a ``no'' vote. He believed, and I think he was  right--I am sure he was right when he said: You can't be just against  something; you have to be for something. The Republican side of the  aisle has no alternative to the Affordable Care Act. They are just  against it. They don't like it. They don't like the name of it. They  don't like ObamaCare. They don't like Obama's administration. They just  vote no over and over again.   Right now, there is a pending lawsuit that even would try to  eliminate the entire Affordable Care Act, including the protection for  people with preexisting conditions. Eighteen Republican-led States,  including the State of Texas, brought the suit after congressional  Republicans eliminated the CRA's individual mandate. President Trump's  Department of Justice supports this bill to eliminate the Affordable  Care Act. If this lawsuit is successful, nearly 20 million Americans-- 600,000 of them living in Illinois--could lose their health insurance,  and nearly 133 million Americans with preexisting conditions--3 million  in Illinois--could once again be at risk of discrimination by health  insurance companies. As if that weren't bad enough, President Trump has  also proposed new rules that would allow States to discriminate against  Americans with preexisting conditions.   This week, the Senate will be voting on a Congressional Review Act  resolution to overturn the Trump administration's latest assault on  Americans with preexisting conditions. Senator Warner of Virginia has  offered a resolution of disapproval, cosponsored by every single Senate  Democrat. If any Senator on the Republican side really wants to help  people with preexisting conditions, join us. Make this a bipartisan  effort to tell President Trump and his administration it is wrong. We  should not discriminate against people with preexisting conditions.   I hope that Senate Republicans will consider supporting a piece of  legislation known as the MOMMA's Act. I am cosponsoring it; in fact, I  am the lead sponsor in the Senate. The House sponsor is Congresswoman  Robin Kelly of Illinois. It would ensure that all pregnant women get  the care they need. Why is this important to raise in a modern country  like America, with our great natural and medical resources? Because the  United States is 1 of only 13 countries in the world where maternal  mortality rates are worse now than they were 25 years ago. I want to  repeat that because it is an incredible statement, though true. The  United States is 1 of only 13 countries in the world where maternal  death rates are worse now than they were 25 years ago.   Fortuitously, the Presiding Officer is a medical doctor. I know he  has devoted a good part of his professional career to serving people of  low income, limited means.   You think when you hear that number about maternal mortality in the  United States, it cleverly must be associated with economic levels,  income levels, wealth levels, education levels. It turns out it is not.  Nationwide, more than 700 women die every year as a result of  pregnancy, and more than 70,000 suffer near-fatal complications. More  than 60 percent of maternal deaths are preventable.   Sadly, the tragedy of maternal mortality is even more pronounced when  it comes to mothers of color. In the United States, women of color are  three to four times more likely than White women to die as a result of  pregnancy. In Illinois, they are six times more likely than White women  to die.    When I researched this, I went to the University of Chicago and asked  the OB/GYNs there to look into the stats, look into the studies, and  tell me what is behind this. They said: Senator, there is no  correlation among income, education attainment, and this death rate  among women. It is only a question of color. We are losing new moms,  and, sadly, we are losing babies as well. Every year, more than 23,000  infants die in the United States, largely due to factors that could be  prevented. Black infants are twice as likely to die as White infants--a  disparity that is greater than it was in the year 1850 in this country.   That is why Representative Kelly, my colleague Senator Duckworth, and  I introduced the MOMMA's Act. First and foremost, our bill would expand  the length of time that a new mom can keep her Medicaid healthcare  coverage. Currently, Medicaid has to cover women only for 2 months  postpartum--after the baby is born. Our bill would expand that to a  full year.   Next, the MOMMA's Act would improve access to doulas, as well as  improve implicit bias and cultural competency training among healthcare  providers. Too often, Black women are just not listened to or taken  seriously by healthcare providers. Doulas can provide education,  advocacy, and support for women whose voices are being ignored.   Lastly, our bill would improve hospital coordination reporting on  maternal healthcare outcomes.   Leader McConnell has made it clear that he has no intention of  allowing the Senate to debate and pass legislation, instead, rendering  the Senate to what has been characterized as a ``legislative  graveyard.'' Senator McConnell says with pride that he will be the Grim  Reaper--his words--the Grim Reaper. Nothing will pass in the Senate.  [[Page S6235]]    But I hope he will make an exception for the MOMMA's Act, which is  currently moving through the House of Representatives. Whether you are  pro-choice or whether you are right to life, shouldn't we all stand  together--Democrats, Republicans, and Independents--and say: Let's do  something to eliminate this unacceptable level of maternal mortality in  the United States. Let's do something to save these babies. Let's agree  on that part if we can't agree on anything else.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Finance Committee be  discharged from further consideration of S. 960 and the Senate proceed  to the immediate consideration; that the bill be considered read a  third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Reserving the right to object, the Senator from Iowa is  my friend. We throw that word around here on the Senate floor, and it  usually doesn't mean much, but it is true. We are friends. I respect  him very much. I think he is a good father, good grandfather, and I  think the time will come--and I hope soon--when we can sit down and  take his proposal and my proposal and put them together and make a bill  we will both be proud of. We have done that before, even to the point  of getting the President to sign the bill into law.   For the time being and because his proposal cuts some Medicaid  benefits that are a great concern to me, I am going to object in the  hope that we can use this opportunity and this moment as a basis for  sitting down and finding a bill we can agree on.   I object.
