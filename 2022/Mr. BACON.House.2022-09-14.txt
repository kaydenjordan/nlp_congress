 Madam Speaker, I rise today during Hispanic Heritage Month  to recognize Carolina Padilla and the Intercultural Senior Center in my  district.   Historically, National Hispanic Heritage Month has been a way to  appreciate the contributions and influence Hispanic Americans have made  to our history, culture, and achievements of the United States. I can  think of no better way to recognize the achievements of Hispanic  Americans in our district than by recognizing Carolina and the  Intercultural Senior Center, which provides language interpretation,  cultural insight, community events, as well as social workers, to  better connect community members with outside resources.   Carolina, who was born in Guatemala City, immigrated to Omaha,  Nebraska, in 1993 with her husband and three children. She then started  her career in the United States by spending 12 years working for One  World Community Health Center, a nonprofit primary healthcare facility.  During her time at One World, she worked in a variety of health  departments in both administrative and leadership positions.   Additionally, she worked for Catholic Charities, where she was the  director of their Latina Resource Center. In this role, she worked to  develop social service programs for women in need of assistance with  English as their second language, as well as women facing issues of  domestic violence.   During this time, Carolina realized that one segment of the  population, the Latino elders, were largely overlooked and underserved.  Inspired by her aging family in Guatemala and her need to serve others  within her own community, Carolina founded the Intercultural Senior  Center in 2009 in the Latino neighborhood of South Omaha. The  Intercultural Senior Center, however, has extended much farther than  the Latino community as it now welcomes refugee communities, including  Sudan, Somalia, Bhutan, Nepal, Afghanistan, Ukraine, and Burma, as well  as native English speakers.   Today, the Intercultural Senior Center is a unique place where  seniors find enrichment and belonging, regardless of language,  ethnicity, race, sexual orientation, socioeconomic background, and any  other differences that too often create separation and isolation.   As Omaha's population ages and becomes more diverse, Ms. Padilla's  mission and the Intercultural Senior Center will continue to embrace  the elderly and bring awareness to the community about the aging  population.   Congratulations again to Carolina Padilla and the Intercultural  Senior Center on this amazing work you are doing within the Omaha  community.                        Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month     Madam Speaker, I rise today during Ovarian Cancer  Awareness Month to recognize women who have been diagnosed with ovarian  cancer who have either survived or, unfortunately, lost their hard- fought battle. A rare but deadly disease, only about 19,880 women will  receive a new diagnosis this year; but this past March, our  communications director, Danielle Jensen was one of them.   The deadliest of the reproductive cancers, only 20 percent are  diagnosed early in stages I or II, with a 5-year survival rate of over  93 percent. Unfortunately, the majority of cases are diagnosed in  stages III or IV, and the survival rate can be as low as 30 percent.   The risk of a woman getting ovarian cancer is about 1 in 78 in her  lifetime, and it is estimated that 12,810 women will lose their lives  to ovarian cancer this year. Fortunately, Danielle was diagnosed at  stage II and has recently completed chemotherapy.   There are several factors that can increase the risk of ovarian  cancer. Age is the biggest one. Half of all ovarian cancers are found  in women 63 years of age and older. Another is if a woman has never  carried a pregnancy to full term or had a child after the age of 35.  Hormone replacement therapy, a family history of ovarian, breast, or  colorectal cancer, or a personal history of breast cancer are also risk  factors.   There is no reliable screening or diagnostic test for ovarian cancer,  so it is important to know the signs and symptoms, which includes back  pain, bloating, frequent urination, feeling full quickly after eating,  fatigue, upset stomach, heartburn, or constipation, pelvic or abdominal  pain, or changes in the menstrual cycle. While these symptoms are most  likely not signs of cancer, they should be of concern if they don't go  away after two weeks following normal interventions such as changing  diet and exercise. It is because of this that ovarian cancer is often  referred to as the silent killer.   There are different treatments for ovarian cancer. Danielle had  surgery and she went through six cycles of chemotherapy to kill any  cancer cells that may have been left. Some women will also undergo  radiation to treat it.   Finally, we are just thankful that Danielle was diagnosed early when  she was and is on the path of being a survivor.                            ____________________
