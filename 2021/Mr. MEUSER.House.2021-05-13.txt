 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, during this National Police  Week, to honor and thank all men and women in blue who dutifully  protect and serve our communities.   Public safety is the most important factor in quality of life. In  recent years, antipolice rhetoric and violence have increased  dramatically. In 2020 alone, 128 police officers were fallen and died  in the line of duty, one of the deadliest in history for law  enforcement.   Fully aware of these dangers, more than 800,000 brave police officers  across America still faithfully put their lives on the line to protect  each of us every day. That is 0.25 percent who protects all the rest.   On Tuesday, I was honored to join police officers from Lebanon  County, in my district, at a ceremony honoring officers who made the  ultimate sacrifice. I thank Pier Hess Graf, the Lebanon County district  attorney, for handling, running, and emceeing the event.   I joined many Republican colleagues this morning on a bike rally led  by Leader McCarthy to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial,  where we honored our Nation's fallen police officers.   As the son of a police officer, Detective Stanley Meuser, I know well  the tremendous sacrifices our police officers and their loved ones  make. This week, and always, we all owe our police officers and their  families all of our support.                            ____________________
