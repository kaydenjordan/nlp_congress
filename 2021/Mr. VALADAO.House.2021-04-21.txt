 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 106th  anniversary of the Armenian genocide.   From 1915 to 1923, the Ottoman Empire engaged in the systematic and  organized murder and deportation of an estimated 1.5 million Armenians.   Around the world, leaders have rightly identified these horrific  events as genocide. However, despite both the House of Representatives  and the Senate passing resolutions in 2019 recognizing this tragedy, no  United States President has ever joined in this acknowledgement.   This week, I and my colleagues in the Congressional Caucus on  Armenian Issues sent a letter to President Biden urging him to formally  recognize the Armenian genocide.   Many of the men, women, and children forced to flee Armenia  immigrated to the United States and have raised their families and  embraced their new communities in our country. They deserve our  recognition.   I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring and remembering those  whose lives were lost and forever changed by the Armenian genocide.                            ____________________
