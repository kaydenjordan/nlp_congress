 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to       strengthen the U.S.-Indian strategic relationship and to       improve the security of a major defensive partner which       continues to be an important force for political stability,       peace, and economic progress in the Indo-Pacific and South       Asia region.        The proposed sale will improve India's capability to deter       regional threats. The SPS will facilitate a more robust       capability into areas of increased missile threats. India       will have no problem absorbing and using the SPS system.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The prime contractor will be Boeing Company, Oklahoma City,       OK. The purchaser typically requests offsets. Any offset       agreement will be defined in negotiations between the       purchaser and the contractor.        Implementation of this proposed sale will require the       assignment of one additional U.S. contractor representative       to New Delhi, India.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 19-02       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The AN/AAQ-24(V)N LAIRCM is a self-contained, directed       energy countermeasures system designed to protect aircraft       from infrared-guided surface-to-air missiles. The system       features digital technology and micro-miniature solid-state       electronics. The system operates in all conditions, detecting       incoming missiles and jamming infrared-seeker equipped       missiles with aimed bursts of laser energy. The LAIRCM system       consists of multiple Missile Warning Sensors, Guardian Laser       Turret Assembly (GLTA), LAIRCM System Processor Replacement       (LSPR), Control Indicator (CI), and a classified User Data       Memory (UDM) card containing the laser jam codes. The UDM       card is loaded into Computer Processor (CP) prior to flight;       when not in use, the UDM card is removed from the CP and put       in secure storage. The Missile Warning Sensors (MWS) for AN/      AAQ-24 (V)N are mounted on the aircraft exterior to provide       omni-directional protection. The MWS detects the rocket plume       of missiles and sends appropriate data signals to the CP for       processing. The CP analyzes the data from each sensor and       automatically deploys the appropriate countermeasure via the       GLTA. The CI displays the incoming threat for the pilot to       take appropriate action. The CP also contains Built-in-Test       (BIT) circuitry. LAIRCM hardware is CLASSIFIED. LAIRCM system       software, including Operational Flight Program and jam codes,       are classified SECRET. Technical data and documentation to be       provided is UNCLASSIFIED.        2. The AN/ALE-47 Countermeasure Dispenser Set (CMDS)       provides an integrated threat-adaptive, computer controlled       capability for dispensing chaff, flares, and active radio       frequency expendables. The AN/ALE-47 system enhances aircraft       survivability in sophisticated threat environments. The       threats countered by the CMDS include radar-directed anti-      aircraft artillery (AAA), radar command-guided missiles,       radar homing guided missiles, and infrared (IR) guided       missiles. The system is internally mounted and may be       operated as a stand-alone system or may be integrated with       other on-board Electronic Warfare (EW) and avionics systems.       The AN/ALE-47 uses threat data received over the aircraft       interfaces to assess the threat situation and determine a       response. Expendable routines tailored to the immediate       aircraft and threat environment may be dispensed. Hardware is       UNCLASSIFIED. Software is SECRET. Technical data and       documentation to be provided is UNCLASSIFIED.        3. AN/ALQ-211 Airborne Integrated Defensive Electronic       Warfare Suite (AIDEWS) provides passive radar warning, wide       spectrum RF jamming, and control and management of the entire       EW system. It is an internally or externally mounted       Electronic Warfare (EW) suite. The commercially developed       system software and hardware is UNCLASSIFIED. The system is       classified SECRET when loaded with a U.S.-derived EW       database.        4. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems which might reduce system effectiveness or       be used in the development of a system with similar or       advanced capabilities.        5. A determination has been made that the Government of       India can provide substantially the same degree of protection       for the sensitive technology being released as the U.S.       Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S.       foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in       the Policy Justification.        6. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       India.                            ____________________
