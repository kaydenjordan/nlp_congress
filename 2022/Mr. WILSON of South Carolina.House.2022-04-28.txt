 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, Washington  welcomed President Salome Zourabichvili, of the Republic of Georgia,  who had come to attend the funeral of former Secretary of State  Madeleine Albright.   During an interview with The Washington Post, President Zourabichvili  explained that, along with Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova were the two  countries closest to Russia wanting to join NATO and the European  Union, but not protected by either. ``Georgia should not be forgotten''  and if so, they might be a temptation for the Russian leadership.   President Zourabichvili reviewed that Georgia also had a history of  war with Russia, most recently in 2008, as well as 1991, shortly after  declaring independence.   It is reassuring, the President said, the Georgian population is 100  percent united in solidarity with the people of Ukraine. Americans are  also united for the independence of Georgia, Moldova, led by President  Maia Sandu, and Ukraine.  [[Page H4584]]    America supports the sovereignty of Georgia and will stand with  President Zourabichvili for the freedom of Georgia.   God bless Ukraine. God save Ukraine. Long live President Volodymyr  Zelenskyy.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3522, the Ukraine Democracy  Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022.   Madam Speaker, it is absolutely amazing the unintended consequence of  Vladimir Putin, war criminal Putin, that he has brought Democrats and  Republicans together. He has united the people of the United States.  With the leadership of Chairman  Greg Meeks and Ranking Member  Mike  McCaul, Americans are united in their support of the people of Ukraine.   For 63 days, the courageous people of Ukraine have resisted full- scale invasion by war criminal Putin with his murderous occupying  forces, in large part due to the courageous leadership of President  Volodymyr Zelenskyy.   Ukrainians have witnessed their prosperous homeland being attacked  and the lives of their loved ones senselessly murdered. The world has  been a witness to the countless atrocities inflicted upon the Ukrainian  people, and we continue to see the depravity of the Putin forces in  real time, targeting civilians and humanitarian infrastructure with  mass murder, just as they conducted gruesomely in Aleppo, Syria.   Ukraine's request is simple: Provide the weapons needed to defend the  Ukrainian homeland and Ukrainian families. This bill does just that by  removing bureaucratic red tape to support a loan or lease of defense  articles to Ukraine immediately.  [[Page H4596]]    I am grateful to have introduced the House bipartisan version of the  Ukraine Democracy Defense Lend-Lease Act of 2022 and to work with our  colleagues to bring this legislation to the floor today.   Time is of the essence. Every day that goes by means more innocent  lives lost. Congress has been united in its support of Ukraine, and we  have given the administration the capacity to use funds under  a Presidential Drawdown Authority specifically for Ukraine.    Today, with the passage of this bill, we remain unified in our  solidarity with the people of Ukraine.   There is a successful historical precedent for lend-lease. During  World War II, lend-lease was enacted to provide weapons to Great  Britain, the Soviet Union, and 28 other Allies to defeat Nazi Germany.  Lend-lease proved integral in the outcome of the siege of Leningrad.   On May 5, 2005, I led a codel to Saint Petersburg. We, sadly, were  there at the world's largest open cemetery to provide a wreath to  recognize the appreciation of the people of the United States to the  people of Russia. This is the final resting place of 420,000 civilians  and 50,000 soldiers who died when Hitler's murderous forces invaded.   America saved what is now Saint Petersburg, which is the birthplace  of Putin. It is ironic in history that America now is considering this  critical legislation to help Ukrainians avoid further loss of life at  the hands of Putin's murderous forces.   Ukraine's battle for its sovereignty is in the forefront of the fight  between autocracy, which is the rule of gun, versus democracy, which is  the rule of law. Their success is the success of democracy.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support passage of the bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Spartz).  [[Page H4597]]         Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  1515     Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time, and I am very grateful that next we will have  the Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, in closing, this bill calls on the administration to  supply the defense articles needed to defeat war criminal Putin's  forces, and for the land of Ukraine to be returned to its rightful and  lawful inhabitants, the courageous people of Ukraine.   The Ukrainian fight is a fight of freedom-loving people around the  world. This is part of authoritarianism, which is rule of gun opposing  democracy, rule of law.   America stands with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, with  President Salome Zourabichvili of the Republic of Georgia, President  Maia Sandu of Moldova, and with the rightful President, Sviatlana  Tsikhanouskaya, of Belarus.   Additionally, as we are discussing Lend-Lease, I had the  extraordinary opportunity with Congresswoman Madeleine Bordallo in  2005, to visit, sadly, the world's largest open cemetery in Saint  Petersburg, the victims, half a million people of the siege of  Leningrad. And we were there to show the love and affection of the  United States to the people of Russia.   We were there to also find out that it was American Lend-Lease  equipment that provided for the defeat of Hitler and for the saving,  actually, of the Putin family. And so, Lend-Lease has a long proud  history of providing for freedom successfully.   In December, I visited the courageous Ukrainian patriots in Kyiv. I  am confident Ukraine will win for freedom and independence. We are all  inspired by the Ukrainian-American Congresswoman Victoria Spartz of  Indiana, and over a million dynamic Ukrainian Americans who are  successful across America.   I urge all Members to support this legislation, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
