 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the rule  and the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, let me just tell you about a family at our local shelter  in San Diego. The mother and the father owned a successful fruit stand  in Guatemala, and they were threatened by a gang for money.                                time  1830    If they didn't pay, the safety of their children was in jeopardy.   Eventually, one of their kids was injured on his way home from  school, and the mother shared that it was common--common--for the gangs  to shoot into the air and for shrapnel to hit unintended objects and,  sometimes, people.   The gangs also targeted young, female children, attempting to use  them as prostitutes.   The question that we have had before us is: What do we do? What do we  do with families? What do we do with children separated from their  families that come 1,000 miles to escape violence?   What are our choices? Do we shut the door? Do we keep them detained  under inhumane conditions or hear their case?   So, we must consider who we are as a country and what are our values.  The least we can do--the least we can do--is to provide basic care  while their case is heard.   Today's proposed funding is crucial to helping improve humanitarian  efforts at the border. This crisis, we know, will only get worse if we  don't act now, so let's act now. Let's act now. Let's pass this rule,  and let's pass the underlying bill.
