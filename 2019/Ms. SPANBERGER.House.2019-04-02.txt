 Mr. Speaker, last week the administration asserted  that the Affordable Care Act should be invalidated in Federal court. If  this effort succeeds, protections for those with preexisting conditions  would vanish.   Approximately 51 percent of central Virginians under the age of 65  have a preexisting condition. If this effort succeeds, we would see the  return of caps on lifetime coverage, and those over 65 could be forced  to pay higher Medicare premiums.   If this effort succeeds, we would lose the ability to keep our  children on our insurance plan until age 26. In Virginia, where we just  saw Medicaid expansion become law, this would be upended as well.   If efforts to scrap our healthcare system succeed, Medicaid expansion  would be completely gutted, and with it, our efforts and ability to  deal with the opioid epidemic across our State.   Right now, we need a bipartisan effort to stabilize and fix our  healthcare system, not a hyperpartisan lawsuit focused on settling old  scores.   Central Virginians deserve better. We are here to solve problems, and  if there is a problem with our healthcare system, we should fix it, not  upend our system, not hurt those with preexisting conditions, not get  rid of the prohibition on lifetime caps, not eliminate a provision that  allows young people to stay on their parents' insurance.   This is why, among the other efforts we are making in this body, I am  proud to cosponsor the Protecting Pre-Existing Conditions and Making  Healthcare More Affordable Act of 2019.                            ____________________
