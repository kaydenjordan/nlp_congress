 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2521, DOULA  for VA Act of 2021--to require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to  establish a pilot program to furnish doula services to veterans.   Doulas provide emotional and physical support to pregnant people  during pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum. A doula will assist  during birth by providing a positive and safe birthing experience.   Studies show that when doulas are present in the birthing process  labors are shorter, it is less likely that a C-section will be needed,  there are less requests for pain medication, and there is a more  positive childbirth experience.   In 2013, the Journal of Perinatal Education conducted a study which  found that expectant mothers matched with a doula had better birth  outcomes than did mothers who gave birth without involvement of a  doula.   Doulas work to develop birthing plans, help the parent understand  labor and delivery procedures, communicate preferences to the medical  staff, and teach relaxation and breathing skills, along with many other  non-clinical tasks that improve the birthing experience.   Currently, Veterans Affairs benefits do not cover doulas.   Improving the childbirth experience should be a priority for us all.  Veterans and their family members deserve to have positive birthing  experiences, just as all Amencans do.  [[Page H8602]]    Maternal mortality is an issue that continues to plague the United  States health care system. In 2020, 861 women died of maternal causes  in the United States. In the U.S., two-thirds of those pregnancy- related deaths are preventable and for every pregnancy-related death,  there are 70 pregnancy-related near-death experiences. It's extremely  important that we remove barriers in health care that may be  contributing to these deaths.   Maternal mortality is caused by several issues such as cardiovascular  problems, high blood pressure, blood clots, and complications of labor  and delivery.   One step to removing health care barriers is to provide more services  such as doulas who can advocate for the parent and provide positive  birthing experiences.   From 2010 through 2015, the use of maternity services from the  Veterans Health Administration increased by 44 percent.   If doula services are improving care for the general public, then  veterans should be provided with the opportunity to utilize doula  services as well.   A study in 2010 found that veterans returning from Operation Enduring  Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom who experienced pregnancy were  twice as likely to have a diagnosis of depression, anxiety,  posttraumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia as  compared to those who had not experienced a pregnancy.   H.R. 2521, Doula for VA Act of 2021 is important because we should be  working to improve the lives of women and children in the United  States. This bill directly impacts the health of veterans and their  families.   I know that this bill is important to my constituents in Houston.  Over 282,000 Veterans live in the Houston area, and almost 25,000  Veterans in Houston are women. Improving the birthing experience for  these women is a top priority to me.   I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this critical bill  that will direct the Department of Veterans Affairs to establish a  pilot program to furnish doula services to veterans.    Mr. Speaker, I proudly stand in strong support of  H.R. 4601, the Commitment to Veteran Support and Outreach Act, which  will authorize the VA to provide grants to states to implement programs  that improve outreach and assistance to veterans and their families to  ensure that such individuals are fully informed about veterans'  benefits and programs.   As our veterans have put their lives on the line for defense of our  nation, we must do everything in our power to support them when they  return home after their service.   This bill achieves this goal by increasing outreach to veterans and  their families to ensure that they are fully informed about their  benefits and can get the assistance they need to apply for and get the  benefits to which they are entitled.   According to a report by the Department of Veterans Affairs, America  has over 19 million veterans, of whom over 1,567,000 live in Texas, the  second most of any state. Over 179,000 live in Harris County and about  29,000 live in my district.   Of the total veteran population, the VA reports that only 49% (9.8  million out of 20.0 million) used at least one VA benefit or service in  FY 2017.   That percentage is far too low. Too few veterans are taking advantage  of the programs and services available to them to cope with the ravages  of war.   Their ailments include everything from respiratory problems caused by  burn-pit toxic exposure to combat conditions such as Traumatic Brain  Injury (TBI) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).  [[Page H8604]]    Prompt and easy access to services to address these problems  determines a veteran's ability to recover from them.   For example, according to research conducted by the VA, veterans who  received care soon after the end of their service had lower levels of  PTSD upon a follow-up evaluation a year after they initiated care.  According to the study, for each year that a veteran waited to initiate  treatment, there was about a 5 percent increase in the odds of their  PTSD either not improving or worsening.   In 2018, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine  found that post-9/11 veterans who had not sought VA mental health care  didn't know how to apply for benefits--or were unsure whether they were  even eligible. Some didn't know what services the VA offered or felt  that they didn't deserve care even if they could get it.   This bill addresses that problem by making grants available to states  to help the thousands of veterans who need services for their  conditions acquired or exacerbated by military service but who don't  know how to access them.   This legislation will not only be key to assisting veterans to get  over barriers to access their benefits but will also improve veteran  mental health and help reduce the veteran suicide crisis.   This bill focuses on equity by prioritizing grants to areas with high  suicide rates among veterans and high referrals to the Veterans Crisis  Line. This approach will help save veterans' lives and ensure this  funding is directed to areas most in need.   Smoother access to VA mental health care and suicide prevention has  never been more important than it is today. A disproportionate number  of veterans die by suicide following separation from military service.   Veterans ages 18 to 34 have the highest rate of suicide.   As reported by the Houston Chronicle, in 2020, the suicide rate for  Texas veterans was 36.6 suicides per 100,000 veterans while the  nationwide rate was 34.4, according to data from the U.S. Department of  Veteran Affairs. This rate is in stark contrast to the suicide rate  among Texans overall, which is 13.3 per 100,000 people.   I am proud to support this legislation because it will reduce veteran  suicide among Texans and nationwide, and it will enable states to  better serve veterans who are in need of many types of assistance.   This is especially important because of the Texas governor's recent  actions impacting troops and veterans in Texas with regard to the  southern border.   Texas's governor has thrust our National Guard into a disastrous  border operation, Operation Lone Star, by declaring a fictional  ``migrant invasion'', and falsely claiming that activation of the  National Guard is needed for what he describes as ``secure our  communities against record-breaking illegal border crossings and  transnational criminal activity.''   The result is that our National Guard troops are being forced to  commit major human rights violations. The governor's use of the  National Guard to police misdemeanor trespassing by migrants has  sparked a civil rights probe by the Justice Department. According to  Human Rights Watch, the operation results in arrests that target people  based on race and national origin and disregard due process, including  abuses in detention.   Black and Brown migrants, and even US citizens, are subjected to  racially discriminatory arrests, prosecutions on flimsy pretexts, and  detention with substandard food and inadequate or nonexistent health  care, according to detainees cited in a complaint filed with the US  Justice Department. Defendants have been forced to wait weeks or months  in pretrial detention before they have an opportunity to see a judge.   Troops commanded to carry out this operation are so affected that at  least four confirmed suicides have occurred since the operation began,  while ten soldiers linked to the operation have died since September  2021, all via accident or suicide.   In addition to human rights abuses, Texas Guard troops have  complained about pay problems, poor living conditions and inconsistent  guidance from leaders since the operation expanded massively last Fall.   I strongly denounce the program, its abuses, and the trauma that it  is inflicting on our troops who are charged to carry out the program's  edicts.   This legislation, H.R. 4601, will help these veterans who struggle  with the aftermath of the psychological and physical toil of serving on  this operation, just as veterans of combat in Afghanistan and Iraq and  elsewhere continue to wrestle with the aftereffects of their service.   We must help veterans access the benefits and services that they  earned and so definitely deserve.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4772, the  Mark O'Brien VA Clothing Allowance Improvement Act.   This legislation would amend the VA's existing clothing allowance  program by enabling automatic payments to continue being made to  eligible veterans on a recurring basis until the veteran opts out of  the program or is no longer eligible.   The bill will make it easier for veterans--especially veterans living  with lifelong disabilities--to receive their earned clothing benefits  which enables them to live with the dignity and comfort that they  earned and so rightfully deserve.   Millions of veterans will live the rest of their lives with  disabilities due to service-incurred injuries and physical impairments  that resulted after they made the decision to protect our nation and  safeguard our freedom.   Our courageous servicemembers have pledged that, on the battlefield,  they will leave no soldier behind. In carrying out this sacred  obligation, many have suffered life-altering injuries, including loss  of limbs.   These injuries often result in loss of mobility or the need for a  prosthetic which require specialized clothing and cause accelerated  deterioration of standard garments.   In full appreciation of their devotion and the consequences they  suffered from it, as a nation, let it be our pledge that when they  return home, we leave no veteran behind.   H.R. 4772, the Mark O'Brien VA Clothing Allowance Improvement Act  will alleviate these veterans' burden of needing to reapply for  clothing benefits every year for our 1.9 million veterans with a  service-connected disability.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 4772, the Mark  O'Brien VA Clothing Allowance Improvement Act.   Veterans have kept their promise to serve our nation; they have  willingly risked their lives to protect the country we all love. We  must now ensure that we keep our promises to our veterans.   Let us resolve together that we will provide returning veterans with  the welcome, services, care, and compassion that they deserve.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Michigan  for managing and her leadership and the gentleman from Oklahoma for his  leadership.    As a member of the Homeland Security Committee that has dealt with  PFAS over the years, I am extremely grateful for this legislation that  has come from the Senate and particularly grateful because I use as a  backdrop having been on the Homeland Security Committee since its  origins, on 9/11, when firefighters rushed in to save lives. Some, of  course, tragically lost their lives along with other law enforcement as  they were attempting to save people from the burning buildings.   But we do know that their long journey that was taken in order to get  coverage and compensation for the terrible exposures that they had in  the chemicals in the aftermath of 9/11.   This brings to mind the importance of this legislation having dealt  with PFAS in many different forms, particularly in the agriculture  arena, the Homeland Security Committee has looked at these chemicals  and how they can be made safe, if you will, in the midst of the  utilization that they have.   This legislation is extremely important because it works to develop  guidance to firefighters and other emergency response personnel on  training, education, and best practices to protect them from exposure  from PFAS, these chemicals that they are bound to engage when they rush  in to save lives and to save property from the terrors of fire.   I am excited about this legislation and hope that it gets to the  President's desk because I have seen what chemicals can do in the midst  of a 9/11 but also in the midst of an ordinary house fire or business  fire.   I applaud the proponents of this bill. I am excited about it reducing  and eliminating exposure to PFAS from firefighter foam, personal  protective equipment, PPE, prevent the release of the PFAS from  firefighting foam into the environment so that it provides for an  environmentally safe pathway, and educating firefighters and other  emergency response personnel on the foams and non-foam alternative.                                time  1515     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman and continue to  say that I think what we have here is an important directive for the  Department of Homeland Security. Under their jurisdiction are the first  responders, and we clearly know the wide range of needs that  firefighters face. Look at the West and the series of wildfires that  have spread from California to the far Northwest. Fires are never- ending; chemical exposures are never-ending; and firefighters never  stop going into places where people are desperate or there is a need.   Mr. Speaker, I am excited about this legislation because it is long  overdue. I hope it gets to the President's desk as quickly as possible.  I believe that once we pass this, we will give a new lifeline to the  Nation's firefighters. As a member of the Fire Caucus, I know that this  is a bill long overdue.   Mr. Speaker, as I conclude my remarks celebrating the firefighters  and supporting this legislation, let me say: Go USA against Iran.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland  Security, I rise in strong support of S. 231, the Protecting  Firefighters from Adverse Substances Act.   Known as PFAS, for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, the chemicals  in this class of approximately 5,000 substances have become notorious  for their danger to human health.   Because the chemical bonds that hold the compounds together don't  break down easily, they last a very long time. This has led to a  commonly used name for the group: ``Forever chemicals.''   According to monitoring by the Environmental Protection Agency,  millions of Americans are easily exposed to unsafe levels of PFAS  through outlets as simple as drinking water.   PFAS chemicals have been associated with several health problems,  including testicular and kidney cancers, reduced immunity, thyroid  problems, and reproductive harms.   Our first responders are at the front lines of PFAS exposure.  Firefighters have been shown to have a 14% higher risk of dying from  cancer than the general U.S. population does.   This is a result of direct exposure to PFAS chemicals in firefighting  foam and personal protective equipment.   It is time we do something to protect the brave men and women who,  even in the face of danger, continue to put themselves at risk for our  safety and protection.   Mr. Speaker, it is urgent that this Congress enact this legislation  because agencies such as the Environmental Protection Administration  have failed to address known threats presented by PFAS chemicals.   The EPA has known about the risks from PFAS chemicals for decades but  failed to act to prevent the spread of this contamination.   Because of such negligence, the persistent and toxic effects of PFAS  linger and firefighters are now forced to work around these ``forever  chemicals.''  [[Page H8612]]    With S. 231, the Department of Homeland Security will be required to  develop guidance for firefighters and other emergency response  personnel on training and education programs to protect them from  exposure to PFAS.   This curriculum would not only educate firefighters on how to protect  themselves, but also educate them on how to prevent the release of PFAS  into the environment.   Clear and swift action from Congress is needed to address the PFAS  crisis, and we need an all-hands-on-deck effort to protect both the  health of our first responders and our environment.   Backing our first responders should be a non-partisan issue, so I  urge my colleagues to join me in voting for S. 231, the Protecting  Firefighters from Adverse Substances Act.    Mr. Speaker, I rise to counter my good friend and  indicate that this is important legislation. It is documented to be  important legislation, and the documentation is clear because of the  widespread support of such a wide range of Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today on the floor to support S. 4003. I thank my  colleagues, Senator Cornyn from Texas and Congresswoman Bass.    As this legislation came out of the Judiciary Committee as well, this  is legislation that fits very well under the Crime, Terrorism and  Homeland Security Subcommittee, which I chair. Our responsibilities are  to address the question of crime but also to address the question of  social justice and reform.   We have heard over the last couple of months--many of us have been in  the mode of campaigning--challenges against Democrats, as to whether or  not we are tough on crime or whether or not we can work to protect our  communities. One thing that protects our communities is strong law  enforcement that knows how to engage with the community and is given  the tools that will help them do so, and to help the community engage  with law enforcement so that they can collectively solve crime.   This legislation is a bipartisan bill that would improve public  safety and strengthen public trust in law enforcement, one of the first  steps toward bringing down crime.   S. 4003 would require the Department of Justice to develop a de- escalation training curriculum in collaboration with mental health  providers, law enforcement agencies, civil rights organizations, and  associations representing individuals with mental health diagnoses.                                time  1530    How many times have mothers and fathers had to deal with the loss of  a child because they were having a mental health episode?   This legislation continues to be a need to improve the practices that  law enforcement officers can use to reduce use-of-force incidents and  also protect themselves.   When individuals are in crisis, police are often the first to  respond. We understand that is not their total responsibility, but  because of our lack of access to mental health resources, they have  been on the front lines; and so, without training necessary to  recognize a mental health crisis, someone winds up injured or dead.  Interactions between law enforcement and civilians can escalate to  potentially deadly consequences.   As the country faces an epidemic of violence committed by officers  and the disproportionate impact that this violence has on people of  color, we remember the lives lost to police violence, including Nicolas  Chavez, who was killed by law enforcement, among others in cities  across the land.   Just this week, we learned that two Colorado deputies that killed  Christian Glass in June have been indicted. That was a sad  circumstance. We wish it had not happened, and it did not need to  happen.   This legislation will give us the opportunity, again, to do what we  want to do; to keep America safe; to bring down crime; and to protect  our officers and to give them the training that helps them to be able  to engage in de-escalation tactics.   Somewhat similar to the overall bill that I introduced, and John  Conyers before me, I introduced the Law Enforcement Trust and Integrity  Act, which I hope to reintroduce again, and seeking bipartisan support;  this would authorize $70 million in annual grant funding for training  that includes improving community officer relations and engage in  training on use of force or de-escalation scenario-based exercises.   In addition, this bill would provide support to law enforcement  agencies to train and equip officers. This legislation, of course, is  widely supported.    This legislation is widely supported. It is  bipartisan; and I thank Mayor-Elect, Congresswoman Karen Bass for her  leadership on the companion bill.   I also thank my colleague, Senator Cornyn from Texas for his  commitment and concern.   Mr. Speaker, I quickly want to acknowledge that the faith community  is squarely in support of this, and they certainly care about law  enforcement and bringing down crime.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter signed by Catholic  Charities USA, Catholic Prison Ministry Coalition, Committee on  Domestic Justice and Human Development, United Sates Conference of  Catholic Bishops, Center for Public Justice, Jesuit Conference, Office  of Justice and Ecology, National Association of Evangelicals, National  Latino Evangelical Coalition, National Hispanic Christian Leadershp  Coalition, and Prison Fellowship; a letter from CPAC; a letter from  National Fraternal Order of Police; and a letter from Major Cities  Chiefs Associations.                                                 November 29, 2022.      Senator John Cornyn,      Hart Senate Office Building,      Washington, DC.      Senator Sheldon Whitehouse,      Hart Senate Office Building,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Cornyn and Whitehouse: Our faith-based       organizations write to urge for broad co-sponsorship among       your colleagues and the swift passage of the Law Enforcement       De-escalation Training Act of 2022 (S. 4003) as it would help       police officers better serve vulnerable populations and keep       our communities safe. Furthermore, this bill would promote a       more restorative justice system that respects the God-given       dignity of each person and promote safe communities for both       law enforcement officers and residents. The bill would also       provide law enforcement officers with the skills and tools       needed to respond appropriately to the needs of the       communities they protect and serve.        Police officers respond every day to calls for service for       men and women grappling with grave mental and behavioral       health challenges. However, they are not consistently trained       to address these situations effectively. Inadequate training       can undermine law enforcement officers' wellbeing and job       satisfaction, and increase incidents of excessive use of       force that erodes public trust. Policymakers must better       equip law enforcement officers with evidence-based training       for interactions with people in crisis that  [[Page H8617]]       fosters community partnership, promotes understanding of       mental illness, and prioritizes the lowest level of force       necessary to keep communities safe.        Several key provisions position the Law Enforcement De-      escalation Training Act (S. 4003) to be a catalyst for       modernizing American policing. The legislation would create a       new federal funding stream to provide training for law       enforcement agencies on de-escalation techniques, on       participation in crisis intervention teams, on making       referrals to community-based service providers, on safely       responding to individuals in a behavioral or mental health       crisis, and on alternatives to use of force. Furthermore, the       bill would advance transparency and accountability to best       practices through strong reporting and evaluation       requirements from the Department of Justice, National       Institute of Justice, and Government Accountability Office.       To foster public trust, the Department of Justice will       develop training curriculum in collaboration with mental       health providers, law enforcement agencies, civil rights       organizations, and other stakeholders. The legislation would       provide funding for continuing education for law enforcement       officers to further refine their knowledge and tactical       skills beyond initial training requirements.        We support the passage of the Law Enforcement De-escalation       Training Act of 2022 as it would provide law enforcement       officers the training needed to carefully respond to the       needs of the community in a way that would promote human       dignity and strengthen public trust.

Re S. 4003--Law Enforcement De-Escalation Training Act of           2022.       Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, House Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jim Jordan,      Ranking Member, House Judiciary Committee,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler and Ranking Member Jordan: The       American Conservative Union (``ACU'') is the nation's oldest       grassroots advocacy organization. Founded in 1964 by William       F. Buckley, we have a 50-plus-year track record of advancing       policies that reduce the size and scope of government,       advance liberty, and reduce burdens on families. Criminal       justice reform, if done properly, fits squarely within this       rubric.        ACU also strongly supports law enforcement. We have asked       our police officers to do more and more in recent years.       Today, our men and women in blue are not only cops putting       their lives on the line every day; they also serve as family,       marriage and addiction counselors, mental health responders,       and social workers, too. As a result, officers have day-to-      day interactions with people in crisis, and this often       escalates to the point that a use of force is necessary. De-      escalation is an important skillset for officer safety as       well as for those in crisis when they encounter law       enforcement.        Accordingly, we support the efforts of Senators John Cornyn       (R-TX) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) to ensure that funding       for de-escalation training is expanded. S. 4003 establishes       funding through the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant (``JAG'')       program totaling $90 million for two years to help state and       local law enforcement obtain de-escalation crisis       intervention training. This funding will be targeted to       smaller law enforcement departments that would otherwise lack       resources for this type of training.        It is notable that the curriculum will leverage the ``train       the trainer'' model to allow a significant increase in       training opportunities by having officers train their       colleagues. Not only is this an efficient use of resources,       it helps inculcate the lessons and values of de-escalation in       the culture of the departments funded by this program.        Finally, S. 4003 includes strong reporting and evaluation       requirements on grants for the Department of Justice, the       National Institute of Justice, and the Government       Accountability Agency. ACU believes the justice system must       be accountable for a wise use of tax dollars, and these       requirements will ensure that state and local law enforcement       are effectively using their grants to serve their communities       well.        We believe S. 4003 would be a prudent use of taxpayer       resources and as such, urge you to take this important       legislation up as soon as possible. Should S. 4003 come to       the floor, we will recommend to our colleagues at our sister       organization, the ACU Foundation's Center for Legislative       Accountability, to score this bill positively.        Thank you for your assistance with this matter. Should you       have any questions regarding this matter, please feel free to       contact me.            Respectfully,                                                 David H. Safavian,      General Counsel.                                   ____                                            National Fraternal Order                                                       of Police,                                                      April 8, 2022.      Hon. John Cornyn III,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators Cornyn and Whitehouse: I am writing on behalf       of the members of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you       of our support for S. 4003, the ``Law Enforcement De-      escalation Training Act.''        Law enforcement officers face numerous challenges when       responding to threats against public safety, and not all of       these threats are necessarily criminal in nature. Police are       on the front lines and are often called to deal with       individuals experiencing mental illness, substance abuse       issues, or similar psychological impairments who may become       dangerous to themselves or to the public. Recent studies       found that as many as ten percent of all law enforcement       encounters involve individuals experiencing these issues. The       Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration       (SAMHSA) has estimated that over 2 million individuals       arrested each year are struggling with a serious mental       illness.        Your legislation would address this issue by providing $70       million in annual grant funding from the Edward Byrne       Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (Byrne-JAG) to State and       local law enforcement agencies to train officers in de-      escalation tactics and alternatives to the use of force. The       U.S. Department of Justice's Office on Community Oriented       Policing Services (COPS), through consultation with State and       local law enforcement agencies, would be required to develop       a curriculum of relevant training topics, including de-      escalation tactics, use of force alternatives, establishing       and maintaining crisis intervention teams, as well as how to       safely respond to mental and behavioral health crises using       public benefits programs, housing assistance programs, and       other relevant services. The funding from this bill will be       used to cover the cost of training, attendance, overtime       fees, and the procurement of certifications. Additionally,       the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and the Government       Accountability Office (GAO) would study and evaluate the       impacts of the training. This would ensure that the training       has a meaningful, tangible impact on law enforcement       encounters with individuals in crisis.        The implementation of de-escalation techniques would have a       tremendous positive impact on public safety and the       relationship between the public and law enforcement officers.       Numerous studies have shown that civilians base their       perceptions of law enforcement on their last encounter.       Providing officers with the skills and training to avoid       needless escalation of calls for service enable officers to       protect the public more effectively. This improved       communication will create a better police force and safer       communities.        On behalf of the more than 364,000 members of the Fraternal       Order of Police, we thank you both for your leadership on       this important issue. If I can provide any additional       information about this bill, please do not hesitate to       contact me or Executive Director Jim Pasco in our Washington,       DC office.            Sincerely,                                                      Patrick Yoes,      National President.                                   ____                                  Major Cities Chiefs Association,                                                      April 5. 2022.      Hon. John Cornyn,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Cornyn and Senator Whitehouse: I'm writing on       behalf of the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA) to       register our support for S. 4003, the Law Enforcement De-      Escalation Training Act of 2022. The MCCA is a professional       organization of law enforcement executives representing the       largest cities in the United States and Canada.        The MCCA is a leader in national policy debates on policing       reform and, in January 2021, released a comprehensive report       that addressed a number of topics, including training. This       report recommended that all law enforcement officers undergo       training on de-escalation tactics.        De-escalation training is already a part of many MCCA       members' standard training curriculums. Law enforcement       training is quite expensive, however, and the Law Enforcement       De-Escalation Training Act will provide critical grant       funding to help offset the costs associated with de-      escalation training. Furthermore, MCCA members will also be       able to use these resources for continuing education, which       will help further enhance existing de-escalation training       programs.        Thank you for your leadership on this issue and your       continued support of law enforcement. Please do not hesitate       to contact me if the MCCA can be of additional assistance.            Sincerely,                                                  Jeri Williams,                                   Chief, Phoenix Police Department,                        President, Major Cities Chiefs Association.  [[Page H8618]]                                          ____                                                  October 14, 2022.      Hon. Karen Bass,      Washington, DC.      Hon. David Trone,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Darrell Issa,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Steve Chabot,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representatives Bass, Issa, Trone, and Chabot: Thank       you for championing America's mental health. The undersigned       national organizations representing consumers, family       members, mental health and substance use treatment providers,       advocates, and payers committed to strengthening access to       mental health care and substance use treatment write to voice       our strong support for H.R. 8637, the Law Enforcement De-      Escalation Training Act. We are grateful for your ongoing       commitment to our country's public safety officers and to       improving behavioral health crisis response.        This legislation comes at a moment of crisis in American       life. According to CDC data from August 2020 to February of       2021, over 4 in 10 adults reported experiencing anxiety or       depression. From 2009 to 2019, the number of high school       students reporting feelings of sadness or hopelessness       increased by 40%, the number of those seriously considering       suicide increased by 36%, and the share of high school       students creating a suicide plan increased by 44%. Nearly one       in twenty American adults (4.9%) report having had serious       thoughts of suicide in the last year. Providing law       enforcement with tools and resources to handle these mental       health crises is a common-sense solution to supporting our       officers and first responders while they carry out their duty       of protecting the public, as 6 to 10% of encounters with law       enforcement involve individuals dealing with a mental       illness.        As you know, the Law Enforcement De-Escalation Training Act       will direct the U.S. Attorney General to develop training       curricula to help educate law enforcement officers and       covered mental health professionals about how best to respond       to behavioral health crises. Such curricula will be developed       with the goal of promoting awareness of de-escalation       tactics, alternatives to use of force, and best practices to       safely respond to an individual experiencing a mental health       or suicidal crisis.        Through the existing Edward Byrne Memorial Justice       Assistance Grant (JAG) program, this legislation will help       state and local law enforcement agencies train public safety       officers to respond to mental health or suicidal crises. This       training will place an emphasis on scenario-based exercises,       testing, and follow-up evaluative assessments to ensure that       officers have the simulated experiences needed to respond in       real-life situations appropriately and effectively. It also       encourages collaboration between law enforcement units, local       mental health organizations, and healthcare services to       better integrate and plan training programs, and establishes       pathways for evaluating what works.        Law enforcement are a key partner in ensuring that every       person experiencing a mental health or suicidal crisis is       connected to the care they need. Training officers to       identify and de-escalate crises while avoiding use of force       will help improve outcomes for crisis situations. It is for       these reasons that we give H.R. 8637 our strong support.        We respectfully urge the swift passage of H.R. 8637, and we       look forward to continuing to work with you and your       colleagues to improve public safety responses to behavioral       health crises.            Sincerely,        2020 Mom, American Academy of Social Work and Social       Welfare, American Association for Psychoanalysis in Clinical       Social Work, American Association of Psychiatric Pharmacists,       American Association on Health and Disability, American       Foundation for Suicide Prevention, American Group       Psychotherapy Association, American Psychiatric Association,       American Psychological Association, Anxiety and Depression       Association of America, Association for Ambulatory Behavioral       Healthcare (AABH), Children and Adults with Attention-      Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 4003, the ``Law Enforcement De- escalation Training Act of 2022,'' a bipartisan bill that would improve  public safety and strengthen public trust in law enforcement.   S. 4003 would require the Department of Justice to develop de- escalation training curriculum in consultation and collaboration with  mental health providers, law enforcement agencies, civil rights  organizations, and associations representing individuals with mental  health diagnoses and with disabilities.   There continues to be a need to improve the practices of law  enforcement officers and reduce use of force incidents. When  individuals are in crisis, police are often the first to respond.  Without the training necessary to recognize a mental health crisis,  interactions between law enforcement and civilians can escalate to  potentially deadly consequences.   As the country faces an epidemic of violence committed by officers  and the disproportionate impact that this violence has on people of  color, we remember the lives lost to police violence, including in my  community of Houston, Nicholas Chavez, who was killed by law  enforcement in 2020 while experiencing a mental health crisis.   Just this week we learned that two Colorado deputies who killed  Christian Glass in June have been indicted. Christian was experiencing  a mental health crisis when officers received a ``motorist assist''  call and is said to have posed no danger to the officers.   We must remember these lives and countless others as we stand ready  to pass this legislation, which would reduce use of force incidents,  keep our communities safe, and save the lives of civilians and law  enforcement officers.   Law enforcement officers must be equipped with the skills necessary  to interact with people with mental or behavioral health issues safely  and with compassion.   The numerous officer-involved encounters that ended badly, which we  know all too well, might have led to better outcomes if the officers  involved had known: 1) how to recognize that the individuals were in  crisis and suffering from the effects of mental health issues or  disabilities; 2) how to communicate with such individuals; and 3) how  to maximize officer and subject safety.   The Law Enforcement De-escalation Training Act would authorize $70  million in annual grant funding for training that includes improving  community-officer relations, deescalation and use of force, scenario- based exercises, and follow-up evaluative assessments.   In addition, this bill would provide support to law enforcement  agencies to train and equip officers to respond to individuals in  crisis and connect them with the necessary mental and behavioral health  services.   It would also promote transparency by requiring grantees to evaluate  and provide reports on the application of deescalation tactics acquired  through the training by officers in the field.   S. 4003 is bipartisan legislation that would take meaningful steps  toward improving policing practices in America, increasing public  safety, and restoring trust between law enforcement and the communities  they serve.   I thank Representative (Mayor-elect) Karen Bass for her leadership on  the House companion--which I am proud to cosponsor along with a  bipartisan coalition of members--and encourage my colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to support it.    Mr. Speaker, I rise, first of all, to thank the  chairman and to thank the sponsor, my friend from Virginia, Congressman   Bobby Scott.   As I think of my dear friend from Virginia, let me also acknowledge  my deep sadness for the loss of our dear friend, Congressman McEachin,  and acknowledge the beauty of his service and, of course, his  compassion and his true spirit, a true American hero.   Mr. Speaker, I will quickly say that any of us who have been engaged  in the criminal justice arena, who have engaged with police officers,  whether they are local, State, or Federal, those of us who have served  as judges, understand the value of this important legislation. It is  bipartisan and will build on  [[Page H8620]]  the success of the JMHCP grant program and make necessary improvements  to enable State and local governments to better serve their  communities.    This reauthorization will make critical improvements to the JMHCP  program which supports services for individuals with mental health  issues who are involved in the criminal justice system, including  expansions in suicide prevention in jails and prisons, co-responder  programs that pair law enforcement with mental health professionals  and, of course, recognizing that though we give them this  responsibility, law enforcement needs to have wraparound services and  those that have the expertise to work with those suffering from mental  health crises.   With the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, communities  across the country have suffered increased challenges in addressing  mental health. We, as Democrats, have consistently said that we need a  holistic approach.   Again, I said that we take no back seat to fighting crime and being  successful, but we understand public safety and civil rights.   I thank Chairman Scott for this work and for acknowledging where we  are at a loss; that is, with people who are suffering mental health  issues.   Now, we have had a series of mass murders, mass killings, of course  using the weapon of choice for young men who espouse hatred, but many  have been determined or assessed to have had mental health crisis  issues, at least that has been the defense. We now need to really  invest in this program and ensure that this is a national program.   In 2018, Harris County Jail, mental health division expanded as an  alternative to jail, diverting individuals with mental health illnesses  away from incarceration. I want to see this program grow. The updated  diversion program allows law enforcement to direct individuals with  mental illness over to these programs; those picked up for low-level,  nonviolent offenses. Many of us know that these are sometimes homeless  persons, and many of these persons are veterans. By the way, we have a  veterans' court in Harris County.   So I am excited about this bipartisan legislation that would also  support State implementation of the newly established 988 suicide  crisis hotline. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of support from the  National Fraternal Order of Police, the Conference of Chief Justices  Conference of State Court Administrators, among others.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.                                           National Fraternal Order                                                       of Police,                                                     April 29, 2022.      Hon. John Cornyn III,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Cornyn: I am writing on behalf of the members       of the Fraternal Order of Police to advise you of our support       for S. 3846, the ``Justice and Mental Health Collaboration       Reauthorization Act.''        According to recent studies, one in ten calls for service       to law enforcement involve a person suffering from a mental       illness. One in three people taken to a hospital emergency       room for psychiatric reasons are transported there by law       enforcement. Our officers respond to these calls for service       with care, compassion, and professionalism. While we have       come a long way in our ability to handle these incidents       safely and effectively, law enforcement officers need the       training and resources this legislation provides.        The legislation would reauthorize the Justice and Mental       Health Collaboration Program (JMHCP) through 2026. First       authorized in 2004, JMHCP grants have funded mental health       courts, other court-based initiatives, diversion and       deflection programs, crisis intervention teams, training for       local police departments, and other programs to improve       outcomes for people with mental illness and co-occurring       substance use conditions who come into contact with the       justice system. In addition to adding $10 million to program       funding, this legislation would also expand the allowable       uses of grants to include the funding of crisis response       teams, suicide prevention in jails, and the hiring of       community health workers.        Law enforcement officers have one of the toughest and most       dangerous jobs in the United States. They are tasked with       keeping our streets and neighborhoods safe from crime,       ensuring that every citizen can live free and without fear.       By putting funding and resources into improving mental health       outcomes across the criminal justice system, this bill       ensures that law enforcement officers will have a reduced       risk of encountering dangerous situations on a day-to-day       basis.        On behalf of the more than 364,000 members of the Fraternal       Order of Police, I am pleased to offer our support for this       legislation. If I can be of any further assistance, please do       not hesitate to contact me or Executive Director Jim Pasco in       our Washington, D.C. office.            Sincerely,                                                      Patrick Yoes,      National President.                                   ____           Conference of Chief Justices, Conference of State Court             Administrators,                                                 November 23, 2022.      Hon. John Cornyn,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Robert C. Scott,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Amy Klobuchar,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Steve Chabot,      Washington, DC.        Dear Leaders of the Senate and the House of       Representatives: The Conference of Chief Justices (CCJ) and       Conference of State Court Administrators (COSCA) represents       the highest judicial officer and court executive of each       state, the U.S. Territories, and the District of Columbia.       Together with the National Center for State Courts (NCSC),       the Conferences work to improve the administration of justice       throughout the United States. State courts are our nation's       primary court system handling over 95 percent of the nation's       litigation. It is in this capacity that we write as the       presidents of the Conference to express our support for your       legislation, S. 3846/H.R. 8166. If enacted, this legislation       would reauthorize and further expand the Justice and Mental       Health Collaboration Program (JMHCP) to provide resources for       mental health courts, veterans treatment courts, crisis       intervention services, and other key interventions to improve       the justice system's response to individuals with mental       illness.        The prevalence of mental illness in the United States has       an enormous impact on communities and a disproportionate       impact on our state and local courts. According to the       National Institute of Mental Health, nearly one in five U.S.       adults live with a mental illness--over 50 million in 2020--      and over 13 million adults live with serious mental illness.       Individuals with mental illnesses in the U.S. are 10 times       more likely to be incarcerated than they are to be       hospitalized. On any given day, approximately 380,000 people       with mental illnesses are in jail or prison across the U.S.,       and another 574,000 are under some form of correctional       supervision. For too many individuals with serious mental       illness, substance use disorder, or both, the justice system       is the de facto provider of treatment services. Except for       self-referral, state courts are the number one referrer in       the nation for treatment services.        In March 2020, the CCJ, COSCA, and NCSC established the       National Judicial Task Force to Examine State Courts'       Response to Mental Illness to assist state courts in their       efforts to respond to the needs of court-involved individuals       with severe mental illness more effectively. The task force       recently released its national report, which provides       examples of successful programs from across the nation and       shares recommendations for change that call for action by all       state and local court leaders, behavioral health and other       community partners, and other state and federal agencies to       more effectively to meet the needs of justice-involved       individuals with serious mental illness. The report can be       found at: MHTF State Courts Leading Change.pdf (ncsc.org).        Recommendations from the Task Force include:        Examine the continuum of behavioral health deflection and       diversion options available in each community to promote       deflection and diversion to treatment options at the earliest       point possible.        Convene justice and behavioral health system partners to       identify opportunities to collaboratively improve our       responses to individuals with behavioral health disorders.        Proactively promote processes to identify and divert       individuals with behavioral health disorders at every stage       of system involvement towards treatment and away from further       penetration into the criminal justice system.        Examine current case management and calendaring practices       for all types of cases and implement strategies to more       quickly and effectively address issues presented in cases       involving individuals with behavioral health needs.        Thank you for your continued leadership and commitment to       helping each intercept point in the criminal justice system       improve our response to individuals experiencing a mental       health crisis. Please feel free to direct your staff to Chris       Wu if there is any way we can be of assistance.            Sincerely,      Chief Justice Loretta Rush, President,        Conference of Chief Justices.      Karl Hade, President,        Conference of State Court Administrators.  [[Page H8621]]                                          ____                                                 November 10, 2022.        Dear Leaders of the House of Representatives: We are       writing today to strongly urge you to bring up and swiftly       pass H.R. 8166/S. 3846, the Justice and Mental Health       Collaboration Reauthorization Act of 2022 on suspension when       the House of Representatives returns for the lame-duck       session. This bipartisan legislation makes critical       improvements to the Justice and Mental Health Collaboration       Program (JMHCP), which supports jurisdictions creating       collaborative responses to people with mental illnesses or       co-occurring mental health and substance abuse disorders in       the criminal justice system. We applaud the work of the       Senate Judiciary Committee, which unanimously approved the       bill in May. The Senate has already shown their strong       support for the bill by passing it by unanimous consent in       June. Now it is time for the House to show their support for       state and local governments that are working on this complex       issue by bringing the bill to the floor.        Since its inception, JMHCP has supported initiatives across       the country to reduce contact with the criminal justice       system and increase access to treatment and supports for       people with behavioral health needs. JMHCP was created by the       Bureau of Justice Assistance in 2006 as a critical way to       support the Mentally Ill Offender Treatment and Crime       Reduction Act (MIOTCRA), which was signed into law in 2004 by       then-President George W. Bush. JMHCP's mission, then and now,       has been to unify justice and health partners around a common       goal: reducing criminal justice involvement for people with       mental illness.        Collectively, state and local governments use JMHCP grants       for a broad range of activities, including establishing       diversion programs, creating or expanding community-based       treatment programs, supporting the development of curricula       for police academies and orientations, and providing in-jail       treatment and transitional services, and training programs to       teach criminal justice, law enforcement, corrections, mental       health, and substance use personnel how to identify and       appropriately respond to incidents involving veterans.       Additionally, grant funds may be used to train law       enforcement on identifying and improving their responses to       people experiencing a mental health crisis. The program was       reauthorized in 2008 and again in 2016 with bipartisan       support.        The Justice and Mental Health Collaboration Reauthorization       Act of 2022 will:        Strengthen support for mental health courts and crisis       intervention teams (CITs); Support diversion programming and       training for state and local prosecutors; Strengthen support       for co-responder teams; Support the integration of 988 into       the existing public safety system;        Amend allowable uses for grant funds to include suicide       prevention in jails and information-sharing between mental       health systems and jails/prisons;        Amend allowable uses to include case management services       and supports; and        Clarify that crisis intervention teams can be placed in 911       call centers.        The law enforcement, training and treatment components of       JMHCP will help law enforcement better handle calls involving       people with mental health and substance use challenges.       Jurisdictions across the country are implementing strategies       to improve the outcomes of these encounters, which includes       providing specialized training and tools that can yield a       response that prioritizes treatment over incarceration, when       appropriate. CITs, along with other practices authorized       under the legislation, have been proven to be effective in       reducing recidivism, enhancing public safety, and freeing up       criminal justice resources for traditional crime fighting       purposes.        With the responsibility of treating people with mental       illness often falling on an already strained criminal justice       system, it is imperative that we provide resources to help       law enforcement officers, judges, corrections officers, and       mental health professionals develop more thoughtful and cost-      effective programs. We strongly urge the House to support law       enforcement and our communities better serve individuals with       mental health disorders and to increase public safety by       passing the Justice and Mental Health Collaboration       Reauthorization Act in the lame-duck session.            Sincerely,        National Fraternal Order of Police; National Sheriffs       Association (NSA); Major County Sheriffs of America;       Conference of Chief Justices; Conference of State Court       Administrators; Wounded Warrior Project; Addiction Policy       Forum; National Association of Counties; National League of       Cities; American Foundation for Suicide Prevention; National       District Attorneys Association; National Alliance on Mental       Illness; National Association of Police Organizations;       American Jail Association.        National Association of State Mental Health Program       Directors; National Association of State Alcohol and Drug       Abuse Directors; The Council of State Governments Justice       Center; Major Cities Chiefs Association; American Probation       and Parole Association; Faith & Freedom Coalition; Meadows       Mental Health Policy Institute; Leslie County Sheriffs       Office; Elliot County Sheriffs Office; Union County Sheriffs       Office; Grayson County Sheriffs Office; Knox County Sheriffs       Office.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3846, the ``Justice and Mental  Health Collaboration Reauthorization Act of 2022,'' a bipartisan bill  that would build on the success of the JMHCP grant program and make  necessary improvements to enable state and local governments to better  serve their communities.   This reauthorization would make critical improvements to the JMHCP  program--which supports services for individuals with mental health  issues who are involved in the criminal justice system--including  expansions in suicide prevention in jails and prisons; co-responder  programs that pair law enforcement with mental health professionals;  and crisis intervention teams within 911 call centers.   With the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, communities  across the country have suffered increased challenges in addressing  mental health. We know that individuals suffering from mental illness  belong in our health care system and not our criminal justice system.   Democrats have worked consistently throughout this Congress to  address issues of public safety from a holistic approach, one that does  not require us to choose between our rights and our safety. We know  that public safety and respect for civil rights can coexist and that  supporting interventions to respond to individuals in crisis with  compassion rather than force builds stronger and safer communities.   This bill would improve existing programs within the Department of  Justice that divert individuals with mental illness away from the  criminal justice system towards treatment and health care.   Since 2006, JMHCP grants have funded 620 awardees across 49 states  and territories. With these funds law enforcement agencies have  established co-responder teams, mobile crisis teams, and crisis  intervention teams to improve encounters with individuals in crisis and  connect them with the services they need.   JMHCP supports 14 law enforcement mental health learning sites,  including both the Harris County Sheriffs Department and the Houston  Police Department, that serve as peer resources to grantees and  communities throughout the country.   In 2018, the Harris County Mental Health Jail Diversion Program  expanded as an alternative to jail--diverting individuals with mental  illness away from incarceration and into the health care and treatment  that they need. The updated diversion program allows law enforcement to  direct individuals with mental illness, who have been picked up for  low-level, non-violent offenses, to more appropriate mental health  interventions.   These initiatives at the state and local level have been successful  and S. 3846 would provide an opportunity for the federal government to  increase support to these programs and build on what we know works.   This bipartisan legislation would also support state implementation  of the newly established 988 Suicide and Crisis hotline, which is a  lifeline for individuals in suicidal crisis or emotional distress  seeking help.   This bill would also provide additional resources for law enforcement  as they work to keep communities safe and respond effectively and  appropriately to individuals in mental health crisis.   S. 3846 is a common-sense bipartisan bill that would improve public  safety and strengthen our communities. I thank Representative Bobby  Scott for taking the lead on the House companion, of which I  cosponsored along with Representatives Steve Chabot and Tom Emmer. I  urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, this is an enormously important  initiative, and I rise today to support the Pro bono Work to Empower  and Represent Act of 2021, or the POWER 2.0 Act. This has to be one of  the more important bills on the floor, among many.   This is a bill that saves lives, and I certainly want to, at the very  beginning, acknowledge certainly the Senator, but as well, I want to  acknowledge our friend and colleague in the House and thank her so very  much, Congresswoman Peltola, for her great work that has generated  something that is very close to my heart.   The POWER Act will give a lifeline to domestic violence sufferers,  those who have been abused by domestic violence.    As the author of the Violence Against Women Act in the House over a  number of Congresses, I know how important any legislation is dealing  with domestic violence and domestic abuse.   I speak to law enforcement and often say to them that domestic  violence calls are the most dangerous that law enforcement engage in.   Remember, as I started on this floor, I indicated that as Democrats,  we know how to bring down crime and also engage in social justice. We  understand that it is extremely important that those in the criminal  justice system deserve due process. But the victims of domestic  violence, more often than not women, suffer greatly.   In Texas, 40.1 percent of women and 34 percent of men experience  intimate partner physical violence, intimate partner rape, and/or  intimate partner stalking in their lifetimes. Thousands of incidents  are reported every day. On a single day in 2020, domestic violence  hotlines across the country receive 21,321 calls.   The provision of legal services through the southern district or  through the various Federal districts that train over 600,000 lawyers  and then send them out to be able to give assistance to State and local  governments is a lifeline. It is a lifesaver.   Less than one-third of domestic violence victims successfully obtain  protective orders. Protective orders can be the cause of saving life,  keeping a mother to protect her children, keeping an aunt or a  grandmother. The POWER Act has an indelible impact on the lives of the  most vulnerable Americans, and I stand here in grand support of this  important effort.   As a former board member of the Houston Area Women's Center, I know  what it means to get calls late into the night and calling the  executive director and asking for relief for a woman who is running for  her life.   Over this past Thanksgiving weekend, unfortunately, in my own  community, there were a series of domestic violence killings of women  who suffered at the hands of an ex.   It is important to eliminate the sunset of this provision and to be  able to say that no one should be left alone without the idea or the  help of ensuring that there is legal protection and that you have  access to legal protection.   Again, I want to commend Congresswoman Mary Sattler Peltola, a friend  and someone who I appreciate her leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following articles, The  Justice in Government Project and HAWC.                  [From the Justice in Government Project]      Key Studies and Data About About How Legal Aid Assists Domestic                             Violence Survivors         The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that       in the U.S., 36.4 percent of women and 33.6 percent of men       experience sexual or physical violence or stalking       perpetrated by an intimate partner in their tifetimes.       Individuals who have experienced domestic violence display a       multitude of legal needs. They may require assistance with       filing protection orders, custody issues, housing, identity       theft, and employment (Lee & Backes, 2018; Allen et al.,       2004).                             RESEARCH HIGHLIGHTS         Providing civil counsel in divorce, custody, and protective       order proceedings can significantly improve outcomes for DV       [domestic violence] and IPV [intimate partner violence]       victims and their children as well as serve as a cost-      effective strategy for reducing violence and generating       positive social norms'' (Lee & Backes, 2018).        In a study of survivors of IPV, researchers concluded that       ``[c]ivil legal services can most directly address economic       self-sufficiency in two ways: by increasing income and       decreasing economic liability'' (Hartley & Renner, 2016).        ``83 percent of victims represented by an attorney       successfully obtained a protective order, as compared to just       32 percent of victims without an attorney'' (Institute for       Policy Integrity, 2015).        In custody matters, ``attorney representation, particularly       representation by legal aid attorneys with expertise in IPV       cases, resulted in greater protections being awarded to IPV       victims and their children. Improved access of IPV victims to       legal representation, particularly by attorneys with       expertise in IPV, is indicated'' (Kernic, 2015).        ``DV/SA [sexual assault] victims reported an aggregate       total of 3,446 separate legal problems in areas identified in       the survey instrument with an average of 19.69 legal problems       per household/respondent. This is 2 times higher than an       average of 9.3 problems per household/year documented for the       general low-income population of Washington'' (Social &       Economic Sciences Research Center, 2014).        ``In 2003, for example, requests for restraining orders in       Dane County were granted approximately 55 percent of the       time. With the aid of a legal advocate provided by DAIS,       however, that number increased to 69 percent'' (Elwart et       al., 2006).        Women living in counties with shelters, hot-lines, safe       homes, emergency transportation, programs for batterers,       children's programs, and counseling are not significantly       less likely to be victims of intimate partner abuse than       women who live in counties without these services. However,       women who live in counties with legal assistance programs to       help battered women are significantly less likely to report       abuse'' (Allen et al., 2004).        . . . [T]he overwhelming fraction of our study participants       did not achieve the goal of terminating their marriages       unless they had lawyers'' (Degnan et al.. 2019).        Most services provided to help battered women do not impact       the likelihood of abuse, but the provision of legal services       significantly lowers the incidence of domestic violence''       (Farmer & Tiefenthaler, 2003).         NARRATIVE OVERVIEW RE: ASSISTING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SURVIVORS         Domestic violence (DV) is defined as violent, often       aggressive, behavior used by one partner in a relationship       that incites fear and intimidates the other partner or among       family members. The U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of       Justice Statistics differentiates between DV (violence from       family members and former or current partners) and IPV       (violence only from current or former partners). Experiencing       violence can leave a profound impact. Those who have been       directly victimized report higher rates of depression, are at       higher risk for repeat victimization, are at higher risk for       perpetrating DV in their lifetime than those who have not       experienced violence.        Experiencing IPV/DV is common: The Centers for Disease       Control and Prevention reports that in the U.S., 36.4 percent       of women and 33.6 percent of men experience sexual or       physical violence or stalking perpetrated by an intimate       partner in their lifetimes. In 2017, data from the National       Crime Victimization Survey found that 1,237,960 Americans had       experienced DV in the six months prior to the survey.        IPV/DV has disproportionate effects on elderly, disabled,       LGBTQ, minority and low-income people due to increased social       risks associated with violence and decreased access to       services. One study found that, while 6 to 12 percent of       older adults self-identify as being abused, the actual number       of participants reporting indicators of abuse was about five       times greater. A published review reported that, in       comparison to non-Hispanic White women, Black, Latina, and       Native American/Alaska Native women experienced higher       lifetime rates of IPV associated with various mental health       disorders, reproductive health outcomes, and barriers to       services. These barriers are often the result of trauma,       housing; instability, employment needs, and compounding       mental and physical health needs experienced in historically       marginalized communities. Additional evidence shows that even       when survivors in vulnerable populations have access to legal       interventions intended to reduce future risk of harm, they       may be less protected from revictimization. For example,       Benitez, McNiel & Binder (2010) found that Black women were       at elevated risk of renewed abuse after legal intervention       (i.e., obtaining a protection order or the arrest of their       abusive partner following a DV incident) compared to white       women.                    DATA AND STUDIES SHOW LEGAL AID HELPS         Individuals who have experienced domestic violence often       display a multitude of legal needs: from assistance with       filing protection orders, custody issues. housing, identity  [[Page H8624]]       theft, and employment (Lee & Backes, 2018; Allen et al.,       2004). Domestic violence survivors and sexual assault       survivors are likely to report more legal needs than the       average low-income household (Social & Economic Sciences       Research Center, 2014). Studies show how access to legal aid       can both reduce domestic violence and mitigate some of its       collateral consequences. Kernic (2015) found that when DV       survivors have access to legal representation in child       custody cases, they are granted greater protections and       visitation decisions when compared to those who are not       represented. Another study agrees. The National Network to       End Domestic Violence (2017) found in their survey of 1,762       shelters that DV survivors without legal representation are       more likely to be later victimized than those without access       to legal representation.        Having access to legal representation reduces the       likelihood of future violence. In their seminal study, Farmer       and Tiefenthaler (2003) found that increased access to legal       representation and services is partly responsible for the       decrease in domestic violence observed in the 1990s. More       recently, Hartley and Renner found that with legal       representation to obtain a protective order or on a family       law issue, survivors of domestic violence in Iowa saw       increases in monthly income and personal growth and support       (2018). They also found that, while receiving free civil       legal services for intimate partner violence, depression and       PTSD decreased significantly over one year (Renner & Hartley,       2018),        The Institute for Policy Integrity (2015) also found that       providing legal services to DV survivors reduced domestic       violence, as well as the societal costs of domestic violence.       Elwart and colleagues (2006) found that when state funding of       domestic violence service providers was at $9.1 million, the       maximum benefits were $27.3 million.                                   ____          Seven Reasons Why Abuse Victims Need Legal Services--HAWC         On average, survivors have multiple legal problems       associated with their abusive situation, and many cannot       afford the assistance of an attorney. Agencies like HAWC       (Healing Abuse Working for Change) seek to ensure all abuse       survivors can have access to the appropriate legal services       they need to secure and maintain their utmost safety. Why       legal assistance helps:        It dramatically increases the likelihood of obtaining a       protective order Research from the Institute for Policy       Integrity shows that 86 percent of abuse, or domestic       violence, victims who were represented by an attorney were       successful at obtaining a protective order. The rate for       abuse survivors without legal representation was only 32       percent         Hundreds of thousands who need help are turned away every       year Each year, hundreds-of-thousands of domestic violence       victims and abuse survivors are turned away from help,       including legal services. This often leads to victims feeling       helpless and, in some cases, going back to their abuser. each       day from various domestic violence services, including       shelters. Lack of funding and donations are the primary cause       for the decreasing lack of services for victims.        3. Fifty-eight percent of victims need additional and       transitional services Legal representation doesn't end in the       court room. Attorneys and legal advocates assist in       everything from divorce proceedings to property protection,       when related to the abuse.        4. Legal problems are complex A domestic violence survivor       will, on average, have at least three legal problems to       resolve after obtaining safety and during any criminal       proceedings. In many instances, survivors don't realize how       many separate legal issues will arise when initially trying       to escape their abuser.        5. Without legal representation, a victim's voice often       goes ignored Domestic violence victims without legal       representation often report that police, hospital staff, and       judges do not take their claims ``seriously,'' going as far       as to ignore them completely.        6. Immigrants and adolescents are the most underserved       Obtaining legal services is an uphill battle for all victims       of abuse. However, immigrants, adolescents, and their family       are at the highest risk of not obtaining the appropriate       legal representation because of various barriers to service.        7. The likelihood of losing of custody of children       increases without an attorney present Thousands of abuse       victims lose custody of their children each year because they       could not afford an attorney. The same research shows that,       without an attorney, children may not receive the therapy and       other psychological support they need during such a traumatic       period.                                How HAWC Helps         Our trained legal advocates provide advice, assistance,       and, depending on availability, representation for abuse       survivors who seek a life free from fear and violence. Part       of our mission is to make these services immediately       available for everyone who needs them.        By supporting our legal service efforts you're giving       thousands of domestic violence victims the chance to be safe       from physical, emotional, and economic harm. Specifically,       each donation goes towards:        Abuse and harassment prevention for survivors,        Access to clinics with our team of pro-bono attorneys,        Referrals for other services like individualized safety       plans, and        Legal representation for high risk clients .        HAWC offers immediate, comprehensive support to those       experiencing domestic violence. By expanding our legal       service offerings, we can ensure that all victims of domestic       violence get access to the legal support they need.    Mr. Speaker, this bill must be passed.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3115, the ``Pro Bono Work to  Empower and Represent Act of 2021,'' also known as the ``POWER 2.0  Act,'' which extends the authorization of vital programs that help  victims and survivors of domestic abuse and sexual violence receive  free legal assistance--without which they would be unlikely to receive  any semblance of justice, let alone safety and security.   No community is safe from domestic violence. It touches people of  every socioeconomic status, race, and ethnicity--in red states and blue  states   Nearly a quarter of women in this country experience domestic  violence or sexual assault at some point in their lives. Many victims  of domestic violence are poor, helpless, and living in underserved  communities. Many are mere children.   In Texas, 40.1 percent of women and 34.9 percent of men experience  intimate partner physical violence, intimate partner rape and/or  intimate partner stalking in their lifetimes.   Thousands of incidents are reported daily. On a single day in 2020,  domestic violence hotlines across the country received 21,321 calls--an  average of almost 15 calls every minute.   The provision of legal services following the first occurrence of  domestic violence can be a proactive solution that minimizes the  likelihood of victims experiencing farther incidents of abuse. But  without access to legal representation, those most in need of  protection--which our courts can provide--are often unable to receive  the help they need to escape the cycle of violence.   Unfortunately, less than one third of domestic violence victims  successfully obtain protective orders if they seek one on their own,  without the assistance of counsel.   That is why in 2018, Congress enacted the Power Act, which requires  every judicial district within the United States and its territories to  hold annual public pro-bono summits to recruit and encourage attorneys  to provide free legal services to survivors of domestic violence,  dating violence, stalking, and sexual assault. It also requires  targeted programs in areas with large populations of Native Americans  and Alaska Natives.   The Power Act has had an indelible impact on the lives of the most  vulnerable Americans. From 2019 to 2021, our courts have held nearly  250 pro bono summits, reaching more than 60,000 attorneys--educating  them about the need for their services and letting them know how they  can help,   While that is a promising start, it is only the beginning. An  innumerable number of domestic and sexual violence victims still need  legal assistance to survive. Yet the programs authorized under the Act  are set to expire in just a few short weeks.   That is why it is imperative we pass the POWER 2.0 Act, which would  remove the 4-year sunset provision from the original legislation and  allow us to continue growing an army of capable, volunteer attorneys  available to represent, protect, and provide a lifeline to victims and  survivors, who so desperately need their help.   I commend Representative Mary Sattler Peltola for her work on the  POWER 2.0 Act, and I urge my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the full  committee, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 5455, the Terry  Technical Correction Act, which has widespread support from really the  people who count that deal with these issues day after day, our law  enforcement officers and attorneys general across America.   Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record a letter from several attorneys  general, as well as the Major Cities Chiefs Association.                                                 September 2, 2021.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Senate Majority Leader,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Senate Minority Leader,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Washington, DC.        Dear Leader Schumer, Leader McConnell, Speaker Pelosi, and       Leader McCarthy: As our jurisdictions' Attorneys General, we       are responsible for protecting the health, safety, and well-      being of our residents. Although our jurisdictions vary in       size, geography, and political composition, we are united in       our commitment to an effective criminal justice system that       safeguards the communities of our states. To that end, a       bipartisan coalition of Attorneys General supported the       passage of the First Step Act of 2018--landmark legislation       that brought common sense improvements to myriad aspects of       the criminal justice system. Central to these reforms was       retroactive relief for individuals sentenced under the       discredited 100-to-1 crack-to-powder cocaine ratio that       Congress abolished in 2010. Following the Supreme Court's       recent opinion in Terry v. United States, however, the lowest       level crack cocaine offenders remain categorically ineligible       for resentencing. We write today to urge Congress to amend       the First Step Act, and to clarify that its retroactive       relief applies to all individuals sentenced under the prior       regime.        Congress enacted the historic First Step Act of 2018 to       modernize the criminal justice system, implementing       comprehensive reform in areas such as corrections, criminal       charging, community re-entry, and beyond. The product of a       unique bipartisan consensus, the Act passed with overwhelming       support from organizations across the ideological spectrum,       including the Heritage Foundation, the American Civil       Liberties Union, Freedomworks, the National Urban League, the       American Conservative Union, the Public Defender Association,       Americans for Prosperity, and the Center for American       Progress, among many others. Over three dozen Attorneys       General supported the Act as a critical tool for       strengthening our criminal justice system and better serving       the people of our states.        One of the First Step Act's key pillars was sentencing       reform. This reform included Section 404, which provides       retroactive relief for individuals sentenced under the       discarded 100-to-1 crack cocaine-to-powder-cocaine ratio that       Congress repudiated through the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010.       That earlier legislation abolished the 100-to-1 ratio going       forward, reflecting the overwhelming consensus that treating       crack cocaine and powder cocaine radically differently       exacerbated racial inequality in the criminal justice system       and resulted in unjustly severe sentences for low-level crack       cocaine users.        But the Fair Sentencing Act applied only to sentences       imposed after the Act's passage. As Senator Cory Booker       explained, it left thousands of ``people sitting in jail . .       . for selling an amount of drugs equal to the size of a candy       bar'' based solely on their sentencing date, underscoring the       need, in Senator Mike Lee's words, to apply the law ``equally       to all those convicted of cocaine and crack offenses       regardless of when they were convicted.'' Congress therefore       included Section 404 in the First Step Act, which allowed       individuals sentenced under the discarded 100-to-1 ratio to       seek discretionary resentencing.        Unfortunately, that critical work remains incomplete. In       Terry v. United States, the Supreme Court concluded that       while Section 404 clearly authorized certain mid- or high-      level crack cocaine offenders to seek resentencing, it did       not extend relief to the lowest-level offenders sentenced       under the prior regime. Specifically, the Court relied on       Section 404's definition of a covered offense as any       ``violation of a Federal criminal statute, the statutory       penalties for which were modified by'' the Fair Sentencing       Act. The Court reasoned that because the Fair Sentencing Act       did not formally change the elements or penalties for the       lowest level era offensesg--it merely changed the quantities       needed to trigger mid- and high-level charges--the Act failed       to modify the ``statutory penalties'' for the lowest category       of offenders. As a result, these individuals are now the only       ones sentenced under the earlier crack cocaine quantities       that remain categorically ineligible for the First Step Act's       historic relief.        We urge Congress to close this gap. There is no reason why       these individual--and these individuals alone--should       continue to serve sentences informed by the now-discredited       crack-to-powder ratio. Discretionary relief is unambiguously       available to serious dealers and kingpins sentenced under the       prior regime; extending Section 404's scope would simply       allow individual users and other low-level crack cocaine       offenders to have the same opportunity for a second chance.       We therefore urge Congress to clarify that Section 404 of the       First Step Act extends to all individuals convicted of crack       cocaine offenses and sentenced under the 100-to-1 ratio--      including the lowest level offenders.

Chuck Grassley,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.      Hon. Mike Lee,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Durbin, Ranking Member Grassley, Senator       Booker, and Senator Lee: I write on behalf of the Major       Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA) to register our support for       S. 2914, the Terry Technical Corrections Act. The MCCA is a       professional organization of police executives representing       the largest cities in the United States and Canada.        In 2010, Congress reduced the federal sentencing disparity       for crack versus powder cocaine offenses. However, due to an       unclear definition in statute, the Supreme Court recently       held in Terry v. United States that individuals convicted of       some of the least serious crack cocaine offenses are       ineligible to be resentenced under the reduced disparity. The       Terry Technical Corrections Ad will address this issue by       clarifying that all offenders sentenced for a crack cocaine       offense before the disparity was reduced are eligible to be       resentenced. While the MCCA believes Congress should       eliminate the federal sentencing disparity, until that       happens, this legislation will help address inequities in our       criminal justice system related to sentencing for crack       cocaine offenses.        Thank you for your leadership on this important issue.       Please do not hesitate to contact me if the MCCA can be of       any additional assistance.            Sincerely,      Chief Jeri Williams,        Chief, Phoenix Police Department, President, Major Cities       Chiefs Association.    As Justice Thomas noted in his opinion in Terry v.  United States, citing my introduction of H.R. 4545, the Drug Sentencing  Reform and Cocaine Kingpin Trafficking Act of 2007, I have long worked  to address the sentencing disparity between crack cocaine and powder  cocaine offenses, introducing legislation to eliminate the disparity  completely.   Mr. Speaker, I include this opinion that cites this legislation,  among others, for the Record.                               141 S.Ct. 1858                     Supreme Court of the United States                        Tarahrick TERRY, Petitioner                                     v.                               UNITED STATES                                No. 20-5904                             Argued May 4, 2021                           Decided June 14, 2021         THOMAS, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which       ROBERTS, C.J., and BREYER, ALITO, KAGAN, GORSUCH, KAVANAUGH,       and BARRETT, JJ., joined. SOTOMAYOR, J., filed an opinion       concurring in part and concurring in the judgment.    ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE                              ELEVENTH CIRCUIT       Attorneys and Law Firms        Elizabeth B. Prelogar, Acting Solicitor General, Counsel of       Record, Department of Justice, Washington, DC, for       Respondent.      Opinion        Justice THOMAS delivered the opinion of the Court.        In 1986, Congress established mandatory-minimum penalties       for cocaine offenses. If the quantity of cocaine involved in       an offense exceeded a minimum threshold, then courts were       required to impose a heightened sentence. Congress set the       quantity thresholds far lower for crack offenses than for       powder offenses. But it has since narrowed the gap by       increasing the thresholds for crack offenses more than       fivefold. The First Step Act of 2018, Pub. L. 115-391, 132       Stat. 5194, makes those changes retroactive and gives certain       crack offenders an opportunity to receive a reduced sentence.       The question here is whether crack offenders who did not       trigger a mandatory minimum qualify. They do not.                                      I         In the mid-1980s, the United States witnessed a steep surge       in the use of crack cocaine, and news of high-profile,       cocaine-related deaths permeated the media. Witnesses before       Congress, and Members of Congress themselves, believed that a       ``crack epidemic'' was also fueling a crime wave. Crack, they       said, was far more addictive and dangerous than powder       cocaine; it was cheaper and thus easier to obtain; and these       and other factors spurred violent crime.        In response to these concerns, Congress quickly passed a       bill with near unanimity. The new law created mandatory-      minimum penalties for various drug offenses, and it set much       lower trigger thresholds for crack offenses. The Act included       two base penalties that depended on drug quantity: a 5-year       mandatory minimum (triggered by 5 grams of crack or 500 grams       of powder) and a 10-year mandatory minimum (triggered by 50       grams of crack or 5 kilograms of powder). 100 Stat. 3207-2,       3207-3. The Act also created a third penalty--possession with       intent to distribute an unspecified amount of a schedule I or       II drug--that did not treat crack and powder offenses       differently, did not depend on drug quantity, and did not       include a mandatory minimum.        Petitioner was convicted under this Act and subjected to       the third penalty. In exchange for the Government dropping       two firearm charges, petitioner pleaded guilty in 2008 to       possession with intent to distribute an unspecified amount of       crack. At sentencing, the District Court determined that his       offense involved about 4 grams of crack, a schedule II drug.        It also determined that petitioner was a career offender       under the Sentencing Guidelines. The career-offender       Guidelines controlled because they recommended a higher       sentence than the drug-quantity Guidelines. The District       Court sentenced petitioner to 188 months, the bottom of the       career-offender Guidelines range.        All this occurred while Congress was considering whether to       change the quantity thresholds for crack penalties. In 1995,       the Sentencing Commission issued a report to Congress stating       that it thought the 100-to-1 ratio was too high. In       particular, it stressed that the then-mandatory Guidelines       helped make the ratio excessive because the Guidelines, which       were not yet in effect when Congress created the ratio,       addressed some of Congress' concerns about crack. Addressing       those concerns through both the ratio and the Guidelines, the       Commission said, ``doubly punished'' offenders. United States       Sentencing Commission, Special Report to the Congress:       Cocaine and Federal Sentencing Policy 195-197 (Feb. 1995).       Separately, although the Commission thought that it was       reasonable to conclude that ``crack cocaine poses greater       harms to society than does powder cocaine,'' it determined       that the ratio overstated the difference in harm. Finally,       the Commission noted that persons convicted of crack offenses       were disproportionately black, so a ratio that was too high       created a ``perception of unfairness'' even though there was       no reason to believe ``that racial bias or animus undergirded       the initiation of this federal sentencing law.'' Members of       Congress responded to this and similar reports. For example,       Senators Sessions and Hatch introduced legislation in 2001 to       lower the ratio to 20 to 1. S. 1874, 107th Cong., 1st Sess.       Representative Jackson-Lee led a similar effort in the House,       but would have created a 1-to-1 ratio. H. R. 4545, 110th       Cong., 1st Sess. (2007).        Two years after petitioner was sentenced, these attempts to       change the ratio came to fruition. In the Fair Sentencing Act       of 2010, 124 Stat. 2372, Congress reaffirmed its view that       the triggering thresholds should be lower for crack offenses,       but it reduced the 100-to-1 ratio to about 18 to 1. It did so       by increasing the crack quantity thresholds from 5 grams to       28 for the 5-year mandatory minimum and from 50 grams to 280       for the 10-year mandatory minimum. Sec. 2(a), 124 Stat. 2372.       These changes did not apply to those who had been sentenced       before 2010.        The Sentencing Commission then altered the drug quantity       table used to calculate Guidelines ranges. The Commission       decreased the recommended sentence for crack offenders to       track the statutory change Congress made. It then made the       change retroactive, giving previous offenders an opportunity       for resentencing. Courts were still constrained, however, by       the statutory minimums in place before 2010. Many offenders       thus remained sentenced to terms above what the Guidelines       recommended. Congress addressed this issue in 2018 by       enacting the First Step Act. This law made the 2010 statutory       changes retroactive and gave courts authority to reduce the       sentences of certain crack offenders.        Petitioner initially sought resentencing under the new,       retroactive Guidelines. But because his sentence was based on       his recidivism, not his drug quantity, his attempt was       unsuccessful. After Congress enacted the First Step Act,       petitioner again sought resentencing, this time contending       that he falls within the category of crack offenders covered       by that Act. The District Court denied his motion, and the       Eleventh Circuit affirmed, holding that offenders are       eligible for a sentence reduction only if they were convicted       of a crack offense that triggered a mandatory minimum. 828       Fed.Appx. 563 (2020) (per curiam). We granted certiorari. 592       U.S.----, 141 S.Ct. 975. 208 L.Ed.2d 511 (2021).        On the day the Government's brief was due, the United       States informed the Court that, after the change in       administration, it would no longer defend the judgment.       Because of the timeline, the Court rescheduled argument,       compressed the briefing schedule, and appointed Adam K.       Mortara as amicus curiae to argue in support of the judgment.       He has ably discharged his responsibilities.                                      II         An offender is eligible for a sentence reduction under the       First Step Act only if he previously received ``a sentence       for a covered offense.'' Sec. 404(b), 132 Stat. 5222. The Act       defines `` `covered offense' '' as ``a violation of a Federal       criminal statute, the statutory penalties for which were       modified by'' certain provisions in the Fair Sentencing Act.  [[Page H8628]]       Sec. 404(a), ibid. Here, ``statutory penalties'' references       the entire, integrated phrase ``a violation of a Federal       criminal statute.'' And that phrase means ``offense.''       Black's Law Dictionary 1300 (11th ed. 2019) (``A violation of       the law''). We thus ask whether the Fair Sentencing Act       modified the statutory penalties for petitioner's offense. It       did not.        The elements of petitioner's offense are presented by two       subsections of 21 U.S.C. Sec. 841. Subsection (a) makes it       unlawful to knowingly or intentionally possess with intent to       distribute any controlled substance. Subsection (b) lists       additional facts that, if proved, trigger penalties.        Before 2010, Sec. Sec. 841(a) and (b) together defined       three crack offenses relevant here. The elements of the first       offense were (1) knowing or intentional possession with       intent to distribute, (2) crack, of (3) at least 50 grams.       Sec. Sec. 1841(a), (b)(1)(A)(iii). This subparagraph (A)       offense was punishable by 10 years to life, in addition to       financial penalties and supervised release. The elements of       the second offense were (1) knowing or intentional possession       with intent to distribute. (2) crack, of (3) at least 5       grams. Sec. Sec. 841(a), (b)(1)(B)(iii). This subparagraph       (B) offense was punishable by 5-to-40 years, in addition to       financial penalties and supervised release. And the elements       of the third offense were (1) knowing or intentional       possession with intent to distribute, (2) some unspecified       amount of a schedule I or II drug. Sec. Sec. 841(a),       (b)(1)(C).        Petitioner was convicted of the third offense--subparagraph       (C). Before 2010, the statutory penalties for that offense       were 0-to-20 years, up to a $1 million fine, or both, and a       period of supervised release. After 2010, these statutory       penalties remain exactly the same. The Fair Sentencing Act       thus did not modify the statutory penalties for petitioner's       offense.        Petitioner's offense is starkly different from the offenses       that triggered mandatory minimums. The Fair Sentencing Act       plainly ``modified'' the ``statutory penalties'' for those.       It did so by increasing the triggering quantities from 50       grams to 280 in subparagraph (A) and from 5 grams to 28 in       subparagraph (8). Before 2010, a person charged with the       original elements of subparagraph (A)--knowing or intentional       possession with intent to distribute at least 50 grams of       crack--faced a prison range of between 10 years and life. But       because the Act increased the trigger quantity under       subparagraph (A) to 280 grams, a person charged with those       original elements after 2010 is now subject to the more       lenient prison range for subparagraph (B): 5-to-40 years.       Similarly, the elements of an offense under subparagraph (B)       before 2010 were knowing or intentional possession with       intent to distribute at least 5 grams of crack. Originally       punishable by 5-to-40 years, the offense defined by those       elements is now punishable by 0-to-20 years--that is, the       penalties under subparagraph (C). The statutory penalties       thus changed for all subparagraph (A) and (B) offenders. But       no statutory penalty changed for subparagraph (C) offenders.       That is hardly surprising because the Fair Sentencing Act       addressed ``cocaine sentencing disparity,'' Sec. 2, 124 Stat.       2372, and subparagraph (C) had never differentiated between       crack and powder offenses.        To avoid this straightforward result, petitioner and the       United States offer a sleight of hand. Petitioner says that       the phrase ``statutory penalties'' in fact means ``penalty       statute.'' The United States similarly asserts that       petitioner is eligible for a sentence reduction if the Fair       Sentencing Act changed the ``penalty scheme.''        But we will not convert nouns to adjectives and vice versa.       As stated above, ``statutory penalties'' references the       entire phrase ``a violation of a Federal criminal statute.''       It thus directs our focus to the statutory penalties for       petitioner's offense, not the statute or statutory scheme.        Even if the ``penalty statute'' or ``penalty scheme'' were       the proper focus, neither was modified for subparagraph (C)       offenders. To ``modify'' means ``to change moderately.'' MCI       Telecommunications Corp. v. American Telephone & Telegraph       Co, 512 U.S. 218, 225, 114 S.Ct. 2223, 129 L.Ed.2d 182       (1994). The Fair Sentencing Act changed nothing in       subparagraph (C). The United States notes that prosecutors       before 2010 could charge offenders under subparagraph (B) if       the offense involved between 5 and 28 grams of crack; now,       prosecutors can charge those offenders only under       subparagraph (C). But even before 2010, prosecutors could       charge those offenders under subparagraph (C) because       quantity has never been an element under that subparagraph.       See, e.g., United States v. Birt, 966 ; F.3d 257, 259 (CA3       2020) (noting that an offender charged under subparagraph (C)       had possessed 186 grams of crack). It also defies common       parlance to say that altering a different provision modified       subparagraph (C). If Congress abolished the crime of       possession with intent to distribute, prosecutors then would       have to bring charges under the lesser included offense of       simple possession. But nobody would say that abolishing the       first offense changed the second.        In light of the clear text, we hold that Sec. 2(a) of the       Fair Sentencing Act modified the statutory penalties only for       subparagraph (A) and (B) crack offenses--that is, the       offenses that triggered mandatory-minimum penalties. The       judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.        It is so ordered.    That is why I introduced H.R. 5455, the Terry  Technical Correction Act, which reaffirms Congress' intent to provide  retroactive sentencing relief to all individuals convicted of crack  cocaine offenses before the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 took effect;  and now I support Mr. Jeffries' EQUAL Act, which we hope will be on the  President's desk.   With the declaration of the war on drugs in the early 1970s began a  dramatic rise in the U.S. prison population. In fact, Mr. Speaker, it  was teeming over, fueled largely by excessive, unwarranted drug  sentences, some for minimal drug sentences and actions, putting  particularly young African-American men in incarceration for decades.   The Federal Government played a pivotal role in America's era of mass  incarceration. During the 1980s and 1990s, Congress passed several  pieces of legislation that moved away from rehabilitation toward  excessive punishment.   One such example is the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, which created  mandatory minimum penalties for most drug offenses and established the  100-1 cocaine to crack disparity. We have found that that does not  bring down drug use. It does not bring down crime. What brings down  crime is an effective rehabilitation system so that law enforcement  officers do not have to confront recidivists ever again because we have  given them a pathway to enter into society.   As Justice Sotomayor acknowledges in her concurring opinion in Terry,  African Americans ``bore the brunt of the disparity.''   Between 1992 and 2006, roughly 80 to 90 percent of those convicted of  crack offenses were African American. There were many who sounded the  alarm during this time, including the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which  repeatedly called upon Congress to revisit the mandatory minimum  sentencing structure because of the racial disparities in cocaine  versus crack sentencing. Sadly, Congress refused to listen for many  years, and they did not see any strong impact on that approach.   Thankfully, Members of Congress, on an increasingly bipartisan  manner, have worked hard to reduce the harmful impact of the failed  policies of the war on drugs, including putting an end to the crack to  powder sentencing disparities.   Those who are supporting us--law enforcement officers, attorneys  general--are Republicans and Democrats alike. Through our efforts, we  have learned that there is no greater danger to public safety from  crack offenders than powder cocaine offenders, and that the 100-1 ratio  overstated the relative harmfulness of the two forms of cocaine and  diverted Federal resources away from prosecuting the highest level of  traffickers.   In 2010, Congress began the process to eradicate the devastating  consequences of the poorly conceived war on drugs and the punitive  response to the crack epidemic.   We have had circumstances where false warrants were used to enter  people's homes under the false premise that they were using drugs. That  didn't bring down crime. That didn't help eliminate those who were  doing ill to people. That was not the right approach.   The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 reduced the sentencing disparity to  18-1, and the First Step Act of 2018 made the Fair Sentencing Act  retroactive.    Mr. Speaker, although the Terry decision bars crack  offenders convicted of offenses involving small amounts of crack--like  the 3.9 grams of crack that the petitioner possessed--that do not  trigger the mandatory minimum penalties, Congress can address this  injustice.   H.R. 5455, aptly named the Terry Technical Correction Act, would  guarantee the ability to seek a sentence reduction to all individuals  who have unfairly lost years of freedom under the unfounded 100-1  disparity, including those whose requests for sentence reduction was  previously denied based on the narrow interpretation of the First Step  Act.   While I continue to look forward to the day that we will fully  eliminate the powder-to-crack disparity, I thank Representatives  Cicilline, Jeffries,  [[Page H8629]]  Owens, Massie, and Delegate Holmes Norton for working with me on this  crucial bipartisan piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this. It is long overdue.  I also include for the Record a press release from the Maryland  Attorney General.  [Press Release from Brian E. Frosh, Maryland Attorney General, Sept. 2,                                   2021]  Attorney General Frosh Calls on Congress to Clarify First Step Act and          Apply Fair Sentencing Reforms to Low-Level Drug Offenses         Baltimore, MD.--Attorney General Brian E. Frosh today       joined a bipartisan coalition of 25 attorneys general urging       Congress to amend the First Step Act and extend critical       resentencing reforms to individuals convicted of the lowest-      level crack cocaine offenses.        The coalition is calling on legislators to take this needed       step in the wake of the Supreme Court's recent decision in       Terry v. United States, which held that certain mid-level and       high-level crack cocaine offenders could seek resentencing       under the law, but low-level offenders were not eligible.        ``The intent of the First Step Act was to correct       disproportionately harsh sentencing. Ironically, the does not       apply to low-level offenders,'' said Attorney General Frosh.       ``Congress needs to fix this oversight and ensure that the       law provides relief to those who committed lower-level crimes       and were subject to inequitable sentencing.''        The First Step Act, a landmark criminal justice reform law,       passed Congress with strong bipartisan support in 2018. One       key reform aimed to correct injustices caused by the earlier       crack cocaine vs. powder cocaine sentencing regime. That now-      discredited regime punished users and dealers of crack       cocaine much more harshly than users and dealers of powder       cocaine, which disproportionately harmed communities of       color.        In 2010, Congress passed the Fair Sentencing Act to reduce       the disparity between sentences for crack cocaine and powder       cocaine. However, the law did not help the many people       sentenced for crack cocaine offenses before 2010 who remained       in prison. The First Step Act then included a provision that       made previous drug sentencing reforms retroactive, allowing       those serving harsh sentences imposed under the former       federal law to seek relief.        U.S. Senators Richard J. Durbin, Charles E. Grassley, Cory       A. Booker, and Mike Lee--the drafters of the First Step Act--      confirmed in an amicus brief that the sentencing relief was       intended to apply to all crack cocaine offenders sentenced       before 2010. Nevertheless, in Terry v. United States, the       Supreme Court concluded that while the First Step Act clearly       authorized certain mid- or high-level crack cocaine offenders       to seek resentencing, it failed to extend relief to the       lowest-level offenders.        In today's letter, the attorneys general urge Congress to       close that gap and clarify that the sentencing relief       provided by the First Step Act extends to all individuals       convicted of crack cocaine offenses under the earlier regime,       including the lowest-level offenders. They argue that there       is no reason that only these low-level offenders should       continue to serve sentences informed by now-discredited       standards, and that they should have an opportunity to seek a       second chance.        Attorney General Frosh is joined in the letter by the       attorneys general of California, Colorado, Connecticut,       Delaware, the District of Columbia, Guam, Illinois, Iowa,       Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New       Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode       Island, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5455, the ``Terry Technical  Correction Act.''   As Justice Thomas noted in his opinion in Terry v. United States,  citing my introduction of H.R. 4545, the ``Drug Sentencing Reform and  Cocaine Kingpin Trafficking Act of 2007,'' I have long worked to  address the sentencing disparity between crack cocaine and powder  cocaine offenses--introducing legislation to eliminate the disparity  completely.   That is why I introduced H.R. 5455, the ``Terry Technical Correction  Act''--which reaffirms Congress's intent to provide retroactive  sentencing relief to all individuals convicted of crack cocaine  offenses before the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 took effect.   With the declaration of the ``War on Drugs'' in the early 1970's  began a dramatic rise in the U.S. prison population--fueled largely by  excessive, unwarranted drug sentences.   The federal government played a pivotal role in America's era of mass  incarceration. During the 1980s and 1990s, Congress passed several  pieces of legislation that moved away from rehabilitation toward  excessive punishment.   One such example is the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, which created  mandatory minimum penalties for most drug offenses, and established the  100-to-1, cocaine to crack disparity.   And, as Justice Sotomayor acknowledges in her concurring opinion in  Terry, African Americans ``bore the brunt of the disparity.''   Between 1992 and 2006, roughly 80 to 90 percent of those convicted of  crack offenses were African American.   There were many who sounded the alarm during this time, including the  U.S. Sentencing Commission, which repeatedly called upon Congress to  revisit the mandatory minimum sentencing structure because of the  racial disparities in cocaine versus crack sentencing. Sadly, Congress  refused to listen for many years.   Thankfully, members of Congress, on an increasingly bipartisan basis  have worked hard to reduce the harmful impact of the failed policies of  the War on Drugs, including putting an end to the crack to powder  sentencing disparity.   Through our efforts, we have learned that there is no greater danger  to public safety from crack offenders than powder cocaine offenders,  and that the 100-to-1 ratio overstated the relative harmfulness of the  two forms of cocaine and diverted federal resources away from  prosecuting the highest-level traffickers.   In 2010, Congress began the process to eradicate the devastating  consequences of the poorly conceived War on Drugs--and the punitive  response to the crack epidemic.   The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 reduced the sentencing disparity to  18-to-1, and the First Step Act of 2018 made the Fair Sentencing Act  retroactive.   Although the Terry decision bars crack offenders convicted of  offenses involving small amounts of crack--like the 3.9 grams of crack  that the petitioner possessed that do not trigger the mandatory minimum  penalties--Congress can correct this injustice.   H.R. 5455, aptly named the ``Terry Technical Correction Act,'' would  guarantee the ability to seek a sentence reduction to all individuals  who have unfairly lost years of freedom under the unfounded 100 to 1  disparity, including those whose requests for sentence reductions were  previously denied based on the narrow interpretation of the First Step  Act.   While I continue to look forward to the day that we will fully  eliminate the powder to crack disparity, I thank Representatives  Cicilline, Jeffries, Owens, and Massie, and Delegate Holmes Norton for  working with me on this crucial, bipartisan piece of legislation and  ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 922,  ``Condemning the use of hunger as a weapon of war and recognizing the  effect of conflict on global food security and famine Act''.   This resolution condemns the use of starvation of civilians as a  weapon of warfare. It also calls on the U.S. government to prioritize  diplomatic efforts to call out and address instances where hunger and  intentional deprivation of food is being utilized as a weapon of war,  including efforts to ensure that security operations do not undermine  livelihoods of local populations to minimize civilian harm.   The United States has always been a nation that espouses human  rights. That's a central tenet on which we were founded.   So when we see starvation being used as a weapon of warfare, it is  reprehensible to us.   Global food insecurity is of great importance to me because, not only  am I a longtime Member of the House Hunger Caucus, I represent the same  Congressional District that had been represented by iconic leaders who  fought to end hunger in the U.S. and globally.   I am proud to continue the historic legacy of Congresswoman Barbara  Jordan, who was a champion for human dignity and fought for the rights  of all people regardless of race, gender, heritage, or economic status,  and Congressman Mickey Leland, who worked tirelessly to raise awareness  of, and fight for, policies to end food insecurity around the globe and  who, tragically, died in a plane crash while working to end world  hunger on a relief mission in Ethiopia.   Starvation is a brutal and inhumane way to force someone to  surrender. It's a slow and agonizing death, used by the immoral to gain  leverage in a war of attrition and aggression.   Starvation tactics typically target innocent, vulnerable civilians  who are not directly a party to the conflict; instead they are merely  caught in the crossfire of conflict.   That is why we must adopt this legislation.   The United States government must prioritize diplomatic efforts to  call out and address instances where hunger and intentional deprivation  of food is being utilized as a weapon.   We must show the world that we do not condone this type of behavior  and that we will not stand for it.   The United States should prioritize diplomatic efforts to call out  and address instances where hunger and intentional deprivation of food  is being utilized as a weapon.   We must do everything in our power to protect innocent civilians from  this barbaric practice.   Starvation is a terrible thing. It's something that nobody should  have to go through. And yet, there are people in this world who are  starving right now as a consequence of war, or, perhaps worse, as a  tool of warfare.   The people of Ethiopia's Tigre Province are being subjected to a  truly vile and malicious use of food deprivation in this way. The  region was already suffering from drought, and when compounded by  forced starvation from denial of access to food as a weapon of war, the  effect is heinous and the consequences are unforgiveable.   In Pakistan, food deprivation is compounded by the human toll from  recent floods and other natural disasters. Using drought to  strategically exacerbate starvation is unacceptable.   Russia's aggression against Ukraine is a global food insecurity  tragedy on multiple levels. As Putin wages his war against the people  of Ukraine, he uses food as a weapon by destroying the food production  and transportation capacity of the country he invaded. At the same  time, since Ukraine grows grains and crops that feed much of the world,  Putin's devastation of Ukraine's food production infrastructure and  takeovers of Ukrainian food exports cause food insecure populations of  countless countries to suffer, especially in Africa.   Finally, I condemn the use of government blockades as a weapon of war  to deliberately increase starvation.   Government blockades are nothing more than collective punishment, and  they're a violation of the human rights of the people who are suffering  under them.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H. Res. 744-- Condemning the Government of Iran's state-sponsored persecution of its  Baha'i minority and its continued violation of the Universal  Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and  Political Rights.   This resolution condemns Iran's state-sponsored persecution of its  Baha'i minority and its continued violation of the international  covenants on human rights.   Further, the resolution calls on Iran to immediately release all  imprisoned or detained Baha'is, and it urges the President and the  Department of State to impose sanctions on Iranian officials and others  who are responsible for serious human rights abuses, including abuses  against Iran's Baha'i community.   Persecution of religious minorities in Iran is rampant. For over 40  years, the Government of Iran has persecuted members of the Baha'i  faith, killing over 200 Baha'i leaders, dismissing more than 10,000  from their government and university jobs, and using intimidation and  violence to target them as enemies of the state.   The Iranian regime routinely arrests Baha'is and imposes lengthy  prison sentences. Between 50 and 100 Baha'is were reported to be in  prisons in Iran during 2020, despite the widespread prevalence of  COVID-19.   Since 31 July 2022, Ministry of Intelligence agents have raided and  confiscated dozens of Baha'i properties and arrested at least 30  members of the Baha'i community on account of their faith in various  cities throughout Iran.   Iranian state-sponsored propaganda encourages citizens to avoid all  dealings with Baha'is citing that they ``create anxiety in the minds of  the public and those of the Iranian officials.''   The onslaught against the Baha'i community is yet another example of  the Iranian government's brutal and degrading treatment of minorities  and women and is a vivid reminder of the regime's extremist and  intolerant foundation.   Iranians from all socioeconomic backgrounds are desperate for a  democratic government that respects the universal rights of all humans,  basic respect for human rights, and the rule of law.   The arrest and murder of Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman arrested by  ``morality police'' in Tehran on September 13, 2022, for allegedly  violating Iran's strict rules requiring women to cover their hair with  a hijab, or headscarf, sparked massive protests around Iran and the  world.   For the past two months, since the day of Mahsa Amini's funeral,  women and men have taken to the streets, risking their lives for a free  and democratic Iran.   Since the protests started in September, more than 350 protesters  have been killed, and thousands have been arrested.   Two weeks ago, an Iranian court issued the first death sentence  linked to the protests, convicting an unnamed person of ``enmity  against God'' and ``spreading corruption on Earth.'' Three more people  have since been sentenced to death on the same charges, according to  the Iranian government.   We are presented with evidence everyday of Iranians putting their  lives at risk in pursuit of a better tomorrow.   To all the Iranian women, men, children, and protestors who are  leading the fight for democracy, I say loud and clear that I stand with  you.   The United States Congress will always support a democratic movement  in Iran. We support the organized and peaceful resistance by women,  students, and youth against this extremist regime.   Let us remain dedicated to advocating for a democratic secular  government in Iran founded on universal respect for human rights,  religious tolerance, and equality among all citizens.   I urge all my colleagues to support H. Res. 744--Condemning the  Government of Iran's state-sponsored persecution of its Baha'i minority  and its continued violation of the Universal Declaration of Human  Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.   We must consistently demonstrate to the Iranian people and the entire  world that we stand with them in solidarity for the atrocious  injustices being committed by the Iranian Government, to give voice to  the oppressed support human rights, and freedom in Iran, because  freedom is a universal right.   I will always champion global democracy stand against human rights  violations, and never shy away from speaking truth to power in the  presence of oppression.   May the Iranian people soon enjoy all the rights and benefits of  freedom and democracy.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4785, the  Uyghur Policy Act of 2021, a bill that addresses the human rights  issues concerning the Uyghurs and other minority groups in the Xinjiang  Uyghur Autonomous Region in China.   The Uyghur Policy Act would authorize the establishment of a Special  Coordinator for Uyghur Issues position within the Department of State.   The bill would also allow the State Department's Bureau of  Educational and Cultural Affairs make certain funds available to human  rights advocates working on behalf of Uyghurs and members of other  minority groups.   The funds, if made available, shall be used to facilitate the  presence of such human rights advocates at public diplomacy forums to  speak on issues related to the human rights and religious freedoms of  minority groups in Xinjiang.   Mr. Speaker, in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China, the  Government of the People's Republic of China has, since 2017,  arbitrarily detained as many as 1.8 million Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz,  and members of other Muslim minority groups in a system of  extrajudicial mass internment camps.   Additionally, the Chinese government has arbitrarily detained many in  formal prisons and detention centers, and has subjected detainees to  forced labor, torture, political indoctrination, and other severe human  rights abuses.   Forced labor exists within the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region's  system of mass internment camps, and throughout the region.   These assertions have been confirmed by the testimony of former camp  detainees, satellite imagery, official media reports, publicly  available documents, official statements, and official leaked documents  from the Government of the People's Republic of China as part of a  targeted campaign of repression of Muslim ethnic minorities.   These atrocious acts are indicative of a state sponsored systematic  effort to eradicate the ethnic and cultural identity and religious  beliefs of religious minorities in China.   Recent reports have also indicated that the Chinese Government is  aiming to prevent the births of, Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs and Kyrgyz,  and members of religious minority groups.   Recent data has shown a significant drop in birth rates among Uyghurs  due to enforced sterilization and enforced abortion.   Indeed, the birth rate in the Xinjiang region fell by 24 percent in  2019 compared to a 4.2 percent decline nationwide.   In addition, there are credible reports of the Peoples Republic of  China's Government campaigns to promote marriages between Uyghurs and  Han and to reduce birth rates among Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims.   It has also been reported that many Uyghurs have been assigned to  factory employment under conditions that indicate forced labor, and  some former detainees have reported food deprivation, beatings,  suppression of religious practices, family separation, and sexual  abuse.   Reporting from international news organizations has found that over  the past decade, family members of Uyghurs living outside of China have  gone missing or been detained to force their return to China or silence  dissent.   Mr. Speaker, on January 19, 2021, the Department of State determined  the Peoples Republic of China's Government, under the direction and  control of the Chinese Communist Party, has committed crimes against  humanity and genocide against Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious  minority groups in Xinjiang.   The Chinese government must answer for the barbaric acts of terror  they have afflicted on their own people.   H.R. 4785 the Uyghur Policy Act of 2021 call for the Government of  the People's Republic of China to open the XUAR to regular visits by  United States Members of Congress, Congressional staff delegations, the  United States Special Coordinator for Uyghur Issues under section 4,  and members and staff of the Congressional-Executive Commission on the  People's Republic of China to monitor the human rights violations and  abuses occurring in Xuar.   As members of the United States Congress, we must use our voice to  condemn, monitor and oppose the atrocities occurring in China.   I and this chamber stand with the Uyghurs, ethnic Kazakhs and Kyrgyz,  and members of  [[Page H8637]]  other religious minority groups in China being terrorized by their own  governments.   I encourage all my colleagues to support H.R. 4785--Uyghur Policy Act  of 2021 to promote justice globally.
