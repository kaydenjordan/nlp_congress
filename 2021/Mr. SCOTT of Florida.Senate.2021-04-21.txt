 Madam President, I do want to compliment my  colleague. He comes from a beautiful State. While I would like all of  the tourists to come to Florida, Alaska is a great State to take a  vacation. I have had the opportunity to do that a few times, and it is  a beautiful State.   I thank my colleagues Senator Sullivan and Senator Rubio for working  on this bill that is so important to all of our States but, for sure,  Florida and Alaska.   Many States rely on the success of our ports, our cruise lines, and  our maritime industries. Throughout my time as the Governor of Florida,  we proudly welcomed more than 100 million visitors every year and  shattered annual tourism records each year. Every visitor to our State  supports small businesses, fuels job growth, and boosts tax revenue,  helping to create State and local investments in the environment,  transportation, public safety, and education.   And it is not just Florida and Alaska. Tourism, including our all- important cruise industry, has huge impacts for States across our  Nation and the thousands of jobs that rely on its success.   On the chart you can look at this.   So, first off, the cruise industry shutdown is just killing a lot of  jobs--jobs all across this country. Before the COVID-19, we had 450,000  jobs--450,000 American jobs--and $55 billion in GDP every year in our  economy.   Unfortunately, due to the suspension of cruises caused by the CDC  inaction, more than 300,000 American jobs have been lost. So this is  all across our country.   As we continue to work to recover from the coronavirus and get our  economy back on track, I remain committed to doing everything I can to  support our tourism industry in Florida, Alaska, and all across the  country in a safe manner.   Unfortunately, while many sectors of the economy have been safely  operating for months under CDC guidelines, Floridians and those across  the Nation who rely on the cruise industry for work, continue to wait,  wait, wait, wait for updated guidance from the CDC.   For months, I have heard from small business owners who have shared  just all their stories about how important tourism is to them and,  specifically, that the cruise industry is to their livelihood and how  much the CDC's decision here has hurt them.   Let me give you an example. Omar Otero, founder and owner of VOK  Protective Services, says:         As a business owner, I've been dependent on the cruise       industry for my livelihood for 20 years, and this pause has       been devastating. What many people don't see behind the       scenes is that cruising has a significant impact on many       small businesses, and employs hundreds of thousands of people       in America. Resuming cruising is critical to my business and       would allow me to work again and support my family.    Jeannette Pineiro, president of Cruiseport Destinations, says:         The uncertainty we've been living with the last year is       probably the most devastating mentally for a business owner.       I have former employees that are still unemployed. They want       to get back to work, and there has been nothing I could do.       The cruise industry needs to be treated on par with other       sectors of the travel industry, and this legislation would       provide a plan to safely resume cruise operations.    The CDC's refusal to properly address this shutdown is wrong. It is  time to get the cruise lines open, and it is going to create jobs all  across the country.   That is why I am proud to join my colleagues Senator Sullivan and  Senator Rubio in introducing the CRUISE Act, which says we are not  waiting on the CDC any longer.   In March, President Biden announced the effort to vaccinate all  Americans--his plan to vaccinate all Americans by July 4.   As of this week, all adults will be eligible for COVID-19 vaccines.  Our Nation has made enormous progress in fighting COVID-19. Yet the CDC  has continued to act like we are still in March 2020. Meanwhile, as my  colleague from Alaska said, there is cruising all over the rest of the  world.   My colleagues and I are simply asking the CDC to provide a timeline  of when the cruise industry can begin to reopen, like so many other  sectors, and the CRUISE Act ensures they can do that in a safe manner.   The CDC is treating the cruise sector unfairly, while other  industries are open for business. There is no reason why America's  cruise industry and the thousands of jobs that rely on its success  should continue to suffer.   Cruises can and should resume, and we are going to do everything we  can to bring back cruising safely.   I yield to my colleague from Alaska.    Madam President, well, I am clearly  disappointed that my colleague from Washington would object to this  commonsense proposal.   The cruise industry impacts thousands of jobs, not just in Florida  and not just in Alaska but in the State of Washington. Everybody here I  know wants to make sure that we can start cruising again in a safe  manner.   Let's remember what my colleague was talking about. She was talking  about what was going on in March and April in 2020. But today, hotels  are open, airlines are flying, beaches are open, restaurants are open,  tourism sites are open, and amusement parks are open. They are all  open, but for whatever reason, the CDC has made the decision to not  allow cruising to happen, and they have singled out this industry and  cannot tell any of us why they singled this out.   All we are asking is for the CDC to provide a timeline of when the  cruise industry can begin to reopen. The cruise industry wants to do it  safely. It is a lot of American jobs, including--I think it is--23,000  jobs and a billion dollars in economic impact in the State of  Washington.   So I know everybody says they want to get this done, but the only way  this is going to happen is if we make sure that we force the CDC to  finally make a decision and allow the cruise industry to get open again  in a safe manner.
