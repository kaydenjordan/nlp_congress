 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor 8-year-old  Sunny Bryant from Houston, Texas.   Some hometown heroes, like Sunny Bryant, might be too young to work  and are certainly too young to even have a driver's license, but they  inspire millions of people across our Nation.   Sunny Bryant is a transgender girl who, like her transgender  community, is currently experiencing fear and anxiety due to  politically motivated attacks sparked by Texas Governor Greg Abbott and  his anti-trans actions.   Governor Abbott recently directed State officials to investigate  parents who support their trans children with gender-affirming  healthcare, describing it as child abuse. This measure not only goes  against the opinions of medical experts, but it intentionally strikes  fear in the transgender community for political gain. This is  appalling.   But like hometown heroes across the country, Sunny is strong and  resilient--and she has got some missing teeth as you can see in the  photo, Mr. Speaker.   Sunny Bryant, from my home district in Texas, will be my virtual  State of the Union guest. I am truly honored that she will be joining  me today.                            ____________________
