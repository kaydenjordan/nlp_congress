 Mr. Speaker, because of our diversity of interests and  constituents, Congress is an inherently volatile body. For stability,  the Nation typically looks to the President, the one official elected  nationwide.   This President has abdicated his role as a unifying figure. Instead,  he daily takes radically disconcerting actions, alarming residents who  do not know what to expect from 1 day to the next.   The Republican majority does not even try to help, so, instead,  Trump's own appointees now seek to reassure the public and our allies  that someone on the inside is trying to prevent all-out chaos.   Those who want the author of the uncontradicted New York Times op-ed  to resign need to explain how that would quell the undeniable chaos in  the administration or reassure the American public that responsible  officials are looking out for them.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my very good friend, Representative  Barbara Lee from California, who has the great honor of serving in the  seat that Ron held. And she has that honor because of her work with Ron  and because those who lived in his district understood that Ron did not  serve them alone.   I think that for Barbara Lee to have risen from intern to chief of  staff to Ron Dellums says everything about her service in the Congress.  She is just the right person to be leading this special honor for our  good friend, the dapper, the brilliant, Ron Dellums.   Ms. Lee shows us that Ron had an eye for talent, and I thank her for  sharing that talent now with the Nation.   It is true that my district and I had a special relationship with Ron  Dellums; and, therefore, a special love. Because for 14 years, he  chaired the old District of Columbia Committee, which he helped me get  rid of, understanding  [[Page H7904]]  that the District deserved equality with other districts.   Yet, I have to say how fortunate we were that Ron chose to use one of  his committee seats for the District of Columbia. Why would Ron Dellums  do that? There is not a vote in the District of Columbia for Ron  Dellums--much as people would have loved to vote for him--but there  wasn't a single vote because he didn't live in the District of  Columbia.   This was such an unselfish human being. He went where he thought he  was needed. And I do need to tell you how unusual that is, because most  Members choose their committees, and this applies to his choice of the  Armed Services Committee, as well as the District Committee. You choose  your committee because it allows you to bring home something to your  constituents, and I am the perfect example.   I have chosen committees which have helped me rebuild entire sections  of the District of Columbia, the Wharf, or the Southwest Waterfront,  the Southeast Waterfront, and other sections of the city. That is how  most of us operate.   Well, let me tell you something: It is hard to bring home peace. Yet,  that is why Ron Dellums chose to serve on the Armed Services Committee,  as he unselfishly served on the District Committee. I will have a word  to say about that--it was because he could not bear to see any  Americans treated as less than full American citizens.   I must note, though, because I don't want to leave you with a sense,  a parochial sense of Ron Dellums, or think I am just here because of  what he did for my district. That would be reason enough for me to be  here, but I am here to note the uniqueness of Ron Dellums as a Member  of Congress, because not before, and not since, has there been a Member  like Ron Dellums.   As a lawyer, I am going to prove this point. I hope you will agree  before I sit down.   First of all, here was a Marine Corps vet--a pretty tough branch of  the armed services--and, of course, this gave Ron special credibility  when he became the leader of antiwar efforts in the Congress of the  United States. Whether House or Senate, this was the leader of antiwar  efforts when we were in Vietnam and when we were in wars since.   Never before or since has a Member who opposed most of the mandate of  a committee been elected to chair that committee, as Ron was elected to  chair the Armed Services Committee. Now, remember, you don't get  appointed to chair these committees. You have to earn the respect of  your colleagues on the committee so that they want to elect you to  chair them.   I defy my colleagues to find any other Member of Congress who has  gotten elected or could get elected chairman of a committee with a  mission they oppose.   Ron Dellums was the leading advocate for peace in the Congress,  winning the votes of his colleagues to chair the Armed Services  Committee, which has, if you will forgive me, little to do with peace.  They have to do with preparing for war.   I begin there to make you understand what manner of man I am talking  about. Now, he didn't just decide when he came to Congress: Wouldn't  this be a cute thing to do given where I stand on these issues to  chair, to grow up as it were in Congress to chair the Armed Services  Committee. He started right where he ended. As a freshman, Ron  introduced a resolution calling for an investigation of war crimes, or  what he regarded as war crimes in Indochina. Particularly as a  freshman, that was refused.   So instead of walking away as virtually any Member would, especially  a freshman, he said: I am going to call some unofficial hearings on  this very subject and he was able to lure some of his colleagues with  him, despite many colleagues regarding the introduction of the  resolution as an outrage to begin with.   Here is a Member of Congress whose reputation for fairness, whose  congeniality was such that when time came to elect a chairman, many  Republicans as well supported him to become chairman of the Armed  Services Committee. The defense establishment that was certainly  rattled. What to expect from this man? Well, this is what you got. You  got leadership from a man who managed every bill to increase defense  funding with great equanimity and fairness, while opposing his own  bills. That is what you got. Find yourself that kind of a Member, much  less a chairman, today in the Congress of the United States.   You got a man who was, in fact, very much for equal rights for gays  in the military, but ushered through his committee a ban on gays  serving openly in the military regardless. He understood the difference  between Ron Dellums the man and Mr. Chairman. That is an important  difference. And because Members tend not to understand that difference,  they tend not to get elected chair of a committee whose mandate they  oppose.   I must say, because I was not a Member of Congress at the time of the  Free South Africa movement, but, was a leader of that movement, how  much Ron was appreciated throughout the country for his leadership as  the chief sponsor of the bill that produced sanctions against South  Africa for its apartheid policies, and, ultimately, the release of  Mandella from prison.   Finally, if I may say to my friend from California, a word of special  thanks regarding Ron Dellums' service on the District of Columbia  Committee. He served on it from the moment he was in Congress, and he  chaired the committee for, as I indicated, 14 years. It is interesting,  that this was a committee he wanted to eliminate as one of the first  supporters for statehood for the District of Columbia when the District  of Columbia was just trying to get the local vote, or what we call home  rule.   Some of his words deserve repeating. For example, he said: ``I am an  advocate, not an overseer of District affairs.'' Now, Ron was the  committee chairman. He clearly was the overseer. We didn't want that  power. He had it. This is how he approached his work as chair of a  committee that had nothing to do with his district. This is how he  approached giving the District the respect that it deserved.   I was not a Member of Congress at the time, but I know that my  friend, Walter Fauntleroy, who represented the District at the time,  deeply appreciated Ron Dellums, in particular.   When I indicate that Ron was for D.C. statehood, you might think,  well, you are for D.C. statehood. What do you expect? Remember, we  didn't have good home rule then. We didn't get that until 1994, and we  were just getting to the point where people understood the inequality  of the residents who live in the District of Columbia. But Ron Dellums  understood, you have got to advocate for what people deserve, not where  they are now in getting what the Congress wants to give them.   His service as chair of the District Committee was long ago, it meant  everything to the District to have a chairman who loved the District of  Columbia as he loved his own city who understood what the District  needed and wanted, and who always consulted with the District.   Yes, California is far away from the District of Columbia, but  notwithstanding the distance, I stand here this evening with the  greatest gratitude for the 700,000 people I represent now and for all  those who at the time had the great privilege of having Ron as the  chair of the District Committee.   I stand here to thank Representative Ron Dellums, to let him know he  will be forever remembered in our city, and to let him know that he has  not been and never will be forgotten by the people of the District of  Columbia.   My thanks to my good friend for leading this Special Order.
