 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize veterans of  the Korean war as this month marks the 72nd anniversary of the war's  beginning.   Sadly, the Korean war is too often referred to as the forgotten war.  I am here today to recognize the 5.7 million American men and women who  served in that war, along with seven Korean war veterans our community  lost in the past year: Albert A. Fowler, Ralph M. Lanza, Thomas H.  O'Rourke, Nicholas J. Matranga, Walter H. Zipf, Robert Klose, and  Hermando J. Folla.   These veterans put their lives on the line to defend our Nation and  to fight  [[Page H5342]]  communism, and we are forever grateful for their service.   This past weekend, I joined the Corporal Allan Kivlehan Chapter of  the Korean War Veterans Association and local members of the Korean- American community to honor them.                                time  1045    Last year, I also honored the life and legacy of Private First Class  Raymond Andrew Smith as his remains returned to Brooklyn 71 years after  he was reported missing in action.   While the return of Raymond's remains is something to be celebrated,  our Nation must not forget that more than 81,600 Americans remain  missing from World War II, the Korean war, the Vietnam war, the Cold  War, the Gulf war, and other conflicts.   On Monday, the anniversary of D-day, I was honored to receive a POW/ MIA Chair of Honor from our local Rolling Thunder chapter to display in  my office as a permanent tribute to the brave men and women who  honorably served our Nation overseas, but sadly never made it home.   I urge my colleagues to consider doing the same because we all must  do more as a grateful Nation to raise attention to this issue and  diligently work to return all prisoners of war and soldiers missing in  action back to our homeland.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today to oppose the previous  question so that we can immediately consider my bill, H.R. 7967, the  Prosecutors Need to Prosecute Act.   My legislation will hold prosecutors accountable and create  transparency by letting the public know how many cases prosecutors are  declining to prosecute, the number of offenses committed by career  criminals, and the number of criminals released.   Over the past 2 years, we have seen a disturbing trend in progressive  district attorneys in cities across the country who are refusing to  prosecute violent criminal offenders.   Look no further than my city of New York, where Manhattan DA Alvin  Bragg released a ``Day One'' memo initially directing his staff not to  prosecute certain crimes, including: drug possession, trespassing,  driving with a suspended license, sex trading, resisting arrest, and  public obscenity.   He even directed his staff to downgrade felony charges filed by our  police, including armed robbery, weapons charges, and drug dealing.  Worst of all, his office will no longer seek life sentences without  parole, which means the most heinous murderers, including terrorists,  serial killers, cop killers, and perps who kill young children in  connection with sex crimes will be released back on to our streets in  20 years or less.   These policies have sent a clear message to criminals, and that  message is: Go ahead, commit crime, break the law, because we will not  enforce it. What is the point of creating laws if the ones currently on  the books are not enforced?   With prosecutors that refuse to prosecute, it is no surprise that  crime is surging in cities across America. In Boston and Los Angeles,  if you want a designer purse, toiletries, or food, you can break into  any store and take it. No questions asked.   This week, LA's District Attorney George Gascon doubled down on the  light sentence given to a teen driver who mowed down a mother and her  newborn baby last summer. The teen only received juvenile probation,  which authorities say is less than military school and a little bit  tougher than summer camp.   In 2020, defund the police rioters and looters created chaos in my  city of New York, destroying storefronts; they assaulted police  officers, and they even put police cars on fire. While police made  hundreds of arrests, New York City district attorneys dismissed the  majority of those charges filed.   In the Bronx, more than 60 percent of arrestees had their charges  dropped, and of the 485 rioters arrested in Manhattan, 222 individuals  had their charges dropped entirely, while 73 received lesser counts.   The same goes for Federal prosecutors in Portland, Oregon, who  dismissed roughly half the cases charged in connection with violence  and anti-police protests.   In Philadelphia, 23-year-old Police Corporal James O'Connor was  gunned down and killed in 2020 by a career felon and wanted gangbanger  because the DA's office allowed him to freely roam the streets. Perhaps  if the DA's office had done its job, Corporal O'Connor would be alive  today. We had a similar story in my city of New York as well.   In Nancy Pelosi's San Francisco, on New Year's Eve 2020, a man  slammed a stolen car into two women crossing the street, killing them  both. The man, who had a lengthy criminal rap sheet, was out on parole,  thanks to San Francisco's soft-on-crime DA Chesa Boudin, the son of a  domestic terrorist cop-killer associated with the far-left militant  group, Weather Underground.   Well, you know what? Voters have had enough of the violence and crime  plaguing our communities and endangering their families. In fact, just  last night, when San Francisco voters recalled Boudin, they sent a  clear message that prosecutors who fail to do their job will be removed  from office.    Madam Speaker, our Nation is under attack by  criminals with no regard for property and life, and rogue district  attorneys who allow them to wreak havoc on our streets.   Madam Speaker, I close with the words of the late Democrat Senator  Robert Kennedy: ``Every society gets the kind of criminal it deserves.  What is equally true is that every community gets the kind of law  enforcement it insists on.''   Let's stop siding with the criminals preying on our cities. Let's  stop emboldening the district attorneys to lay idly by as crime plagues  our streets.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support my legislation today. It is time to support our citizens, not  criminals.
