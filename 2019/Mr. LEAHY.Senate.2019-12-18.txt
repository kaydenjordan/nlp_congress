 Mr. President, this year marks the 100th anniversary of  one of Vermont's most nationally recognized businesses, Agri-Mark Cabot  Creamery Co-operative. Founded as a small butter plant in Cabot, VT,  with principles of producing high-quality dairy products and supporting  farmers and communities, Cabot has grown to be a leader in the dairy  industry, raising the bar for excellence across the country. The  founders of Cabot prided themselves on quality products and doing  things the right way. Cabot began with just 94 members that  collectively owned 800 cows. Today, Cabot has expanded to include over  800 farm families, never losing sight of their core values of  exceptional quality, safety, and community cooperation. These tenants  have been upheld by their members repeatedly throughout the last  century.   The farm families of Cabot Creamery Co-operative continue to be  innovators, pioneers of sustainability, and dedicated stewards to their  land and animals. Their products consistently prove to be the cream of  the crop, winning many awards, and rightfully earning the title of  ``World's Best Cheddar.'' For decades, they have been earning top marks  around the country and world, from respected competitions like the U.S.  Championship Cheese Contest, the American Cheese Society, and even the  World Championship Cheese Contest. The recognition is well deserved  after a century of hard work, dedication, and commitment shown by  generations of farmers across New England and New York.  [[Page S7151]]    Not only do they produce excellent products, Cabot's farm families  are leaders of sustainability. They have worked to strengthen green  farming practices, some of which provide Vermont families with  electricity, and even their own electricity processing plant. They have  made continuous efforts to create more sustainable practices, from  conserving water to installing solar panels. Cabot and their members  have been awarded prestigious honors, such as U.S. Dairy Sustainability  Awards and New England Green Pastures Award for Outstanding Dairy Farm  of the Year. Cabot has recently been classified as a B Corporation, the  first dairy cooperative to achieve that certification, which shows the  strong commitment they have to being a socially and environmentally  responsible business.   I have had the pleasure to work with Cabot, creating lasting memories  and an incredible working relationship that has supported the dairy  industry in Vermont and the entire country. I am privileged to host  Cabot at my annual Taste of Vermont event, and guests of the reception  are often greeted by the distinct Cabot plaid upon entering the Kennedy  Caucus Room on Capitol Hill.   As a Vermonter, I am proud of the incredible service Cabot, its  leaders, and their farmers provide for our State, our economy, and the  larger dairy industry. Cabot truly represents the essence, values, and  traditions of what makes Vermont special. I congratulate Cabot and  their dairy farmers on 100 years of hard work and success.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to celebrate the success of a  Vermont entrepreneur and small business owner, Steve Gagner, of 14th  Star Brewery. Started in 2012, 14th Star Brewery began in a hand-built  brew house in St. Albans, VT, with beer brewed in repurposed maple sap  collection tanks. Under the leadership of the team he has assembled,  the company has grown immensely since then, increasing their staff to  24 and moving to a new location where they are expected to produce over  8,000 barrels of craft beer by year-end. 14th Star has become widely  popular throughout Vermont and distributes to six nearby States.   The creation of this Vermont brewery, however, began on the  battlefields of Afghanistan. The founders of 14th Star, Steve Gagner  and Matt Kehaya, served in Afghanistan with the Vermont Army National  Guard. During their deployment, they drafted the business plan for  their dream company on the back of a notebook. Even as the business has  grown dramatically, Steve continues to serve in the Vermont Army  National Guard and has been named commanding officer of the Army  Mountain Warfare School in Jericho, VT. Steve was deployed for two  combat tours and is a two-time Bronze Star recipient. He also teaches  the next generation of leaders as an assistant professor at Norwich  University.   Named after Vermont's status as the 14th State to join the Union,  Steve has ensured that 14th Star Brewery maintains a close tie to  service of our fellow Vermonters. Taking its values from Steve and his  close-knit leadership team, the brewery directs a portion of its  proceeds towards supporting Purple Hearts Reunited, an organization  founded by fellow Vermont Guardsman Zach Fike to return lost or stolen  military medals to veterans and their families. Each June, which is  PTSD awareness month, 14th Star releases a special brew, 11Bravo, and  hosts an annual event to support the Josh Pallotta fund for addressing  veteran suicides, in memory of his fellow Vermont Guardsman.   Steve and 14th Star are proud and devoted members of the St. Albans  and Franklin County community, serving every way possible, such as  raising enough funds to ensure eggs and milk were supplied to a local  kitchen for an entire year. 14th Star's tireless efforts to give back  to their community and the State shows how far a small business's  impact can go.   Marcelle and I have enjoyed getting to know Steve and his wife Nicole  over the years. During the Vermont Brewers Festival in 2015, Steve  kindly gave me a tour of the festival and introduced me to many amazing  brewers within our State. Marcelle and I have also had the pleasure of  visiting 14th Star Brewery, where we were impressed not only by the  creativity and quality of the beer but also the sense of community they  have fostered by creating a welcoming gathering space in St. Albans.  His sister and business partner, Andrea Gagner, who is the CEO of 14th  Star, has also joined us in DC to participate in the annual Taste of  Vermont on Capitol Hill for 2 years, and Marcelle and I have enjoyed  spending time with her at the event.   I was proud to hear that Steve was chosen as the Vermont Small  Business Person of the Year earlier this year. I have seen firsthand  the dedication Steve has not only to his community in St. Albans but  also to the veteran's community. He has an outstanding work ethic and I  applaud him for all the selfless work to give back to his community. I  believe Steve truly exemplifies what it means to be a small business  owner in Vermont and he is very deserving of this high recognition.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to recognize  the success of another Vermont business, Hazelett Continuous Casting,  which is celebrating its 100th anniversary of producing quality casting  equipment and research. Hazelett is a true pioneer of continuous metal  casting development and research, growing from one man's dream into one  of Vermont's most successful companies. As a fourth-generation, family- run company, it is fitting to look back on Hazelett's 100 years of  public service and learn more about their history.   Hazelett's founder, Clarence W. Hazelett, worked tirelessly to design  and develop continuous metal casting technology in 1919. Clarence's  commitment was undying, his persistence to be a leader in this field  led to his groundbreaking work being recognized through worldwide  patents and technical publications. In 1924, Clarence established the  first commercial continuous metals casting and processing company in  the world, Hazelett Storage Battery Company. Upon his death, his two  sons, William ``Bill'' and Richard, followed in his footsteps and took  Hazelett a step further.   Bill took the reins from his father, becoming president of the  company in 1956. Building on his father's foundation, Bill relocated  the company to Colchester, VT, and renamed it Hazelett Strip-Casting  Corporation. It was here that the family business grew into one of the  world's leading continuous casting machine manufacturers. Bill went on  to win the United States Small Business Administration National  Exporter of the Year award in 2001 for his exemplary innovation and  vision in building a very successful business in Vermont, boasting an  employment of 145 people while accounting 70 percent of its $23 million  in sales to foreign business. Bill passed away in 2010, but his legacy  lives on and continues in his son, David.   Today, with David at the helm, Hazelett has maintained their status  as one of the world's leaders in continuous metal casting, expanding  well beyond the Green Mountains. Hazelett's prominent presence around  the globe is marked by the operation of their machines in 27 countries  and the establishment of the only full-service Hazelett branch outside  of the United States, Hazelett Trading in Shanghai, China. David's  mission is clear: He hopes to offer the most cost-effective,  environmentally friendly metals casting technology in the world. It  pleases me to hear important Vermont values incorporated into  Hazelett's work.   Hazelett has been an important contributor to not only the Vermont  economy but the global economy. The Hazelett family and their employees  have also helped build and support their home town of Colchester over  this entire 100 years. A business of this magnitude in Vermont is a  true gem and the years of dedication and hard work are exemplified  through Hazelett's generations of leaders. I am incredibly proud of the  continued dedication of each generation that has taken over the  business. Congratulations to Hazelett Continuous Casting on 100 years  of business, may your success continue for another 100 years.  [[Page S7152]]                                ____________________
