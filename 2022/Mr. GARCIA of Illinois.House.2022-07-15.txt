 Madam Speaker, I rise today in celebration of  the life of a friend and an outstanding Chicagoan, Vincent ``Vince''  Rangel.   Vince was an immigrant from Mexico who proudly chose to serve his  country during the Vietnam war as a member of the U.S. Army,  accumulating a long list of decorations, including a Purple Heart, a  Bronze Star Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, and many more.   Vince later served in numerous veterans' organizations in Illinois,  becoming a leading advocate for enhanced behavioral health services for  veterans.   His service to our community included his work in support of small  business as president of the Mexican-American Chamber of Commerce of  Illinois and as board member of the U.S.-Hispanic Chamber.   Vince never forgot his roots, serving as president of the Mexican  Civic Society of Illinois, helping to promote Mexican history and  culture.   My wife, Evelyn, and I send his daughters, Veronica and Jennifer, and  his beloved grandchildren, Juan Diego and Victoria, our most sincere  condolences.                            ____________________
