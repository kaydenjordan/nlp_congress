 Mr. Speaker, within minutes of the tragic  shooting in Las Vegas, Democrats and the liberal media called for more  gun control measures.   A recent Washington Post op-ed describes how one gun control advocate  researched restrictive gun laws in Great Britain and in Australia, only  to discover that gun buybacks and gun bans do not reduce mass shootings  or gun-related crimes.   She said: ``The case for the''--gun control--``policies I had lobbied  for crumbled when I examined the evidence. . . . But I can't endorse  policies whose only selling point is that gun owners hate them.  Policies that often seem as if they were drafted by people who have  encountered guns only as a figure in a briefing book or an image on the  news.''   This researcher concluded that more lives would be saved by focusing  on individuals instead of guns.   We should ensure that background checks work as intended and prevent  those with mental health issues from acquiring guns. This actually will  do some good, as opposed to meaningless gun regulations.                            ____________________
