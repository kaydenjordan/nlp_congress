 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor the life of Dr. Leslie Lamar Wilkes, Jr., who went to be with the  Lord on April 4.   Les and I attended church together at Wesley Monumental United  Methodist Church in Savannah, Georgia, and he was always a devoted  member who took every opportunity he could to serve for over 40 years.   He was born and raised in Georgia and eventually received his MD  degree from the Medical College of Georgia in 1965, before becoming a  surgeon for the U.S. Navy.   Dr. Wilkes was an amazing person with a true passion for the medical  field, being one of the first surgeons in Georgia to perform  arthroscopic knee surgery and, all in all, performed about 15,000  operations.   He received numerous accolades throughout his life, including the  Savannah's Best Doctor Award numerous times, and the Georgia Medical  Society awarded him the Health Care Hero Award in 2010 as well as the  Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012. He was active in various medical  organizations as well as community service organizations, like the  Savannah Rotary Club.   Dr. Wilkes embodied what it means to be a steadfast and humble  servant. He used every area of his life to help others, including his  patients, community, fellow church members, friends, family, and his  country.   His family, friends, and all those impacted by him will be in my  thoughts and prayers during this most difficult time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding me the time.   Mr. Speaker, I come here for two purposes: One is to express my  opposition to this bill.   My second purpose is to express my hope, my hope that we can come  together and that we can negotiate a long-lasting and a significant  compromise, an American compromise to an American problem.   Just yesterday, the Democrats in the Senate blocked Senator Tim  Scott's bill, the JUSTICE Act. They blocked it from moving forward with  debate. They blocked it from moving forward for compromise and for  negotiation. That is not an American solution.   We all agree this is an American problem. We all agree we need an  American solution, and we all agree that that means we have to have  negotiation. That means we have to have compromise.   Mr. Speaker, the minority leader in the Senate wouldn't even allow  our counterparts in the Senate to discuss solutions and allow them to  decide if it is the right path forward. Now, here we find ourselves in  the House facing a situation where we have a partisan bill, drafted  without Republican involvement, that is being brought to the House  floor to be voted on in a rush process. That is not an American  solution to an American problem.   We have seen calls to defund the police and dismantle police  departments across the United States. We all know that can only lead to  bad outcomes. We all know that the police are there to protect and to  serve.   Yes, we all know that there are bad policemen out there. We all know  there are bad actors in every profession, and we know that they need to  be weeded out. We need to do that. And we also know that those bad  policemen are as offensive to the good policemen as they are to anyone.  No one wants to see them weeded out more than the good policemen want  to see them weeded out. This bill does nothing to address those calls  and reassure Americans that things will happen.   No, this is a partisan bill with no Republican involvement  whatsoever. This bill also doesn't take appropriate steps to ensure  that law enforcement officers are working to improve their relations  with the community--the community that they serve and protect. We have  all said we need community policing. You ask any policeman, any good  policeman out there, ``What is the best police practice?'' And they  will tell you ``Community policing.'' That is what we need.   Mr. Speaker, instead, this bill limits their ability to do their  jobs, and it keeps them in their cars rather than interacting with the  people in their communities. That is what they want to do. They are not  there for the money. We know that. There is not a single police person  out there that is there for the money. They are there to protect and to  serve. And they want community policing. That is what they want.   Mr. Speaker, in my district, we had a tragic death of a young man  whose life ended way too early--Ahmaud Arbery. This was something that  none of us should accept in our society, and none of us will accept in  our society. It should have never happened.   We have had protests. We should have protests. I am very proud of the  First Congressional District because our protests have been productive.  Yes, we should protest and, yes, we are protesting. And we are getting  results because we are protesting in the right way. We are protesting  to change the system. That is what we want to do. We are protesting to  have an American solution to an American problem.   Mr. Speaker, the right path forward is discussion and negotiation  with our eyes, with our goal, with our mission set on real reforms.  This bill doesn't have that. This bill doesn't represent that. This  bill is not an American solution to an American problem. That is why I  am urging my colleagues to oppose this bill. That is why I am urging my  colleagues to negotiate, to compromise. That is why I am encouraging my  colleagues to come up with an American solution to an American problem.  [[Page H2468]]
