 Mr. Speaker, 6 months ago, the American  people elected a Republican House majority to deliver the Commitment to  America. On behalf of American families, we will fight to tackle  inflation, lowering the cost of living. We are promoting peace through  strength, making America energy independent again, securing the  southern border, preserving our constitutional freedoms, and creating  jobs, with the leadership of Speaker Kevin McCarthy.   Accomplishments thus far include: defunding Biden's Army of 87,000  IRS agents, eliminating the military vaccine mandate, establishing the  bipartisan committee to strengthen America against threats from the  Chinese Communist Party, establishing a subcommittee on the  weaponization of the Federal Government, and protecting America's  Strategic Petroleum Reserve.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with open Biden borders.   Congratulations for the wreath laying today in honor of the 79th  anniversary of the liberation of Guam, hosted by Congressman James  Moylan and the Guam Society.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, as a 31-year Army veteran  myself, and a grateful father of four sons who have served overseas in  Iraq, Afghanistan, and Egypt, I believe very much in the principles of  Ronald Reagan, peace through strength.   I am very grateful that, in fact, President Donald Trump was the  first person to recognize and try to stop the war in Ukraine. He sent  javelin missiles to stop Putin, war criminal Putin.   He put American troops in Poland, which had the effect of stopping  war criminal Putin. He also warned the Chancellor of Germany Angela  Merkel and others that Nord Stream 2 should be closed and stopped to  avoid the funding of any war by war criminal Putin.   So in that tradition, I would oppose any cutting of the defense  because we know this is a worldwide war that we are in of  authoritarians versus democracies. This is not a war we chose. War  criminal Putin is the person who started the war February 24.    Mr. Chair, Congresswoman Victoria  Spartz is correct. We can learn from the lessons of World War II. There  was weakness, and with that weakness, Imperial Japan attacked China.  Then, ultimately, on December 7, 1941, Japan attacked Pearl Harbor.   We must be resolved to resist by having peace through strength. I  personally can identify. My father served in China and India during  World War II with the Flying Tigers to stop the tide of imperialism at  that time.   Today, we can learn from history. Today is the 79th anniversary of  the liberation of Guam. We don't need to repeat the weakness that has  occurred. We need to stop our enemies today. These authoritarians have  plans to dissolve the United States, and we need to stop it now.    Mr. Chair, indeed, there should be a  strategy of U.S. support to defeat war criminal Putin, and it should be  clarified.   Sadly, we are in a worldwide conflict that we did not start. It was  Putin, on February the 24, 2021, that invaded Ukraine. This began an  active conflict and a worldwide competition that we are having, and  that is with authoritarians, with Putin in control of the Russian  Federation and abusing the people of Russia.   We have the authoritarians of Beijing, the Chinese Communist Party  threatening the people of Taiwan. Clearly, we also have the regime in  Tehran that pledges death to America, death to Israel, the vaporization  of the people of Israel.   This is a worldwide conflict that needs to be addressed. We should  have a strategy, and that is why I have introduced legislation,  bipartisan, H. Res. 332, to define victory as restoration of Ukraine's  1991 internationally recognized borders. This is territory integrity  for the people of Ukraine, NATO membership, as agreed to with the 2008       Bucharest Declaration, and justice and accountability for       war crimes committed by Putin's murderous invaders.   The Biden administration, sadly, has not been clear with Congress. We  can be clear because we have got to stand together. War criminal Putin  needs to know that his violations of nine different agreements is  simply not going to be allowed or recognized, that we should have, in  the tradition of Ronald Reagan, peace through strength.   Mr. Chair, I urge that we have bipartisan support to encourage the  President to clarify the American strategy for Ukrainian victory, which  is peace through strength.    Mr. Chairman, it is so important with  lend-lease that we make every effort to provide the people of Ukraine,  who are fighting so valiantly with equipment. Many of us thought that  they simply couldn't resist, but they are. They are resisting because  they are getting the equipment. The quickest way to get the equipment  is through lend-lease.   I am very grateful that last year, as has already been identified, we  voted here in Congress 417-10 to provide for the Ukraine Democracy  Defense Lend-Lease Act. It provides for great accountability.   Ironically, I have actually seen success of lend-lease. I was in St.  Petersburg, Russia, to place a wreath at the world's largest open  cemetery for the victims of the siege of Leningrad. The only reason  that the Russians were successful in stopping Hitler was because the  equipment was provided by the United States through lend-lease. It is  now ironic that we need to be providing lend-lease equipment to Ukraine  to stop war criminal Putin.    Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment. As  a 31-year Army veteran myself and a very grateful dad of four sons who  served in Iraq, Egypt, and Afghanistan, I want to reestablish peace  through strength as developed by President Ronald Reagan.   We must support Ukraine to end criminal Putin's war of aggression as  quickly as possible and stop the carnage with Putin's mass murder of  innocent civilians.   Putin's forces are bombing civilians, kidnapping children to Russia,  raping and torturing, and have mined a nuclear plant and blown up a  dam. In light of Ukraine's ongoing counteroffensive, which is pitting  Ukrainian defenders against dug-in Russian soldiers, cluster munitions  are an effective new weapon for Ukraine's arsenal.   These weapons will be effective against fortified Russian trenches  and concentrated troops of Putin's soldiers who are being sacrificed to  death by Putin for his own personal gain of oil, money, and power.    The Wall Street Journal has editorialized that Biden is right on  cluster bombs for Ukraine. Cluster bombs are an antipersonnel weapon  that ejects multiple bomblets over a large area. They can be very  effective to promote the Ukrainian cause.   Ukraine is not seeking to use these bombs against civilians. There is  a moral distinction between Russia's aggression and Ukraine's use of  cluster bombs for defense. Those best suited to make the tradeoff  between risks are the Ukrainians whose lives are on the line every day.   Mr. Chair, I urge opposition to the amendment.
