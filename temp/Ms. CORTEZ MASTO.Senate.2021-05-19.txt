 Mr. President, I rise to recognize one of my  State's incredible educators, Jennifer Jaeger, who announced her  retirement after almost three decades of work in the Clark County  School District.   A native Nevadan, Mrs. Jaeger was born and raised in Las Vegas and  began her work in education at UNLV, where she earned a bachelor's  degree in secondary education and a master's degree in middle level  education and educational leadership. Since obtaining her educator  license, Mrs. Jaeger has worked in four different Las Vegas schools in  capacities ranging from dean of students to assistant principal to,  presently, principal of the Robert O. Gibson Leadership Academy.   Mrs. Jaeger has an accomplished history in serving Tier I, Title I  schools and was recognized for her excellence in fostering a positive  school culture and climate. During her time as principal, Robert O.  Gibson Leadership Academy received several accolades, including being  named a Magnet School of Excellence for the year 2020 and one of the  first Purple Star Schools of Nevada for showing ``a commitment to  understanding and addressing the unique needs of military-connected  students.''   Through her career, Mrs. Jaeger put immense focus on the well-being  of her students, including through her work with low-income families to  identify kids in need of new shoes. Her work has yielded annual  benefits for students and families in need through the Warm the Soles  program.   I ask my colleagues to join in me celebrating the amazing work of  Jennifer Jaeger. Her service to Nevada schools and the community at- large has been exemplary and worthy of recognition.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to recognize Juliana  Urtubey, an outstanding Nevada educator and the 2021 National Teacher  of the Year.   Each year, the Council of Chief State School Officers honors one  incredible educator as the National Teacher of the Year. This honor is  the most prestigious recognition for teachers in the country, and I am  proud to honor Ms. Urtubey's achievement today. Juliana Urtubey is the  first Latina Teacher of the Year candidate from the State of Nevada,  the first Latina national finalist since 1992, and the first Nevada  Teacher of the Year awardee in the history of the program. In addition,  Ms. Urtubey is only the third special educator to receive this amazing  honor.   Ms. Urtubey has been an educator for 11 years and teaches at Kermit  R. Booker, Sr. Innovative Elementary School in Las Vegas, NV. There,  she serves as a special education co-teacher for the prekindergarten  through fifth grade levels and as an instructional strategist in  developing supports to meet students' differing academic, social- emotional, and behavioral needs.   Ms. Urtubey is also a national board certified teacher and holds a  bachelor's degree in bilingual elementary education and a master's  degree in special bilingual education. Through her impressive teaching  career, Juliana Urtubey has also held the role of board of directors  member and teaching fellow with the National Board for Professional  Teaching Standards, senior policy fellow with Nevada Teach Plus, and  teacher fellow with the organization Understood.   In the classroom, Ms. Urtubey is also known as Ms. Earth for her work  in unifying the community through murals and gardens in local schools.  In this pursuit, Ms. Urtubey played a significant role in fundraising  for garden programs at two Las Vegas schools.   I ask my colleagues to join in me celebrating this achievement. Ms.  Urtubey's work in the classroom and  [[Page S2777]]  for our students is an example to all of us who wish to improve the  lives of others and better our communities.                            ____________________
