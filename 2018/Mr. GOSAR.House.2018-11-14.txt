 Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge support of H.R. 6784. Our  Federal wolf policy has gone rabid. From a policy standpoint, we are  foaming at the mouth. As chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus,  I have been trying for years now to return some sanity to the way the  Fish and Wildlife Service classifies and manages our wolf populations  on Federal lands and otherwise.   Make no mistake, everyone who votes for Mr. Duffy's bill are big  supporters of making sure wolf populations are robust, sustainable, and  healthy for the next century and more. This bill is about fixing a  Federal failure. Wolf populations across the country have made  impressive gains and recovered quite nicely despite Federal involvement  rather than because of it.   I have seen this firsthand, whether it comes to specific habitat  listing decisions, or the rate at which the government adapts and  responds to new situations on the ground. The Federal Government has  been sluggish and out of touch when it comes to managing and recovering  wolf populations. But the wolf has, nevertheless, persevered. It is now  considered recovered by all relevant measures and metrics evaluating  its status.   As a consequence, this bill makes necessary adjustments. It removes  the species from the endangered list, as required by the statute for  any recovered species, but empowers States to manage their unique  habitats and populations in accordance with their storehouse of  expertise and local knowledge.   State management plans developed for wolf populations are the  antidote to repeat Federal blunders, both for this species and quite a  few others. But for now, we are talking about the wolf and the fact  that this bill will put States at ease.   We need to stop jerking their chain and hand them the reins. If we  do, the wolf will have the best chance of continuing to make steady  gains range-wide.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of H.R. 6784.
