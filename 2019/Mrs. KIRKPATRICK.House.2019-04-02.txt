 Madam Speaker, Kerry from Tucson, Arizona, has a  daughter in middle school who has type 1 diabetes.   The countless doctor visits, the fights with insurers and providers  and doctors and back again, and the ache of watching her child struggle  to be a normal kid on the playground is hard, but, as Kerry said, the  fear of not being able to afford her daughter's treatment is a lot  harder.   The Affordable Care Act saved Kerry's family. Before the ACA, there  were no legal protections for those with preexisting conditions, and  the cost of coverage was simply unaffordable.   President Trump continues his war on healthcare.   I ask my colleagues: When can our working families and mothers like  Kerry feel safe from the fear of losing their healthcare? When can  these families come up for air from the medical bills that drown them?   Arizonans and all Americans deserve a country that is there for them  without question or condition. I will continue to defend the Affordable  Care Act, its protections, and lowering healthcare costs for all  families.                            ____________________
