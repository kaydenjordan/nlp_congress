 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentleman from New Jersey.   The Good Friday Agreement was just the start of the creation of peace  and reconciliation on the island of Ireland, not the end. Brokered by  the United States, this agreement was one of our Nation's great foreign  policy achievements of the 20th century.   This ongoing peace process requires our continued engagement,  especially now as Brexit becomes a reality. We cannot and, let's be  clear, will not stand by idly and watch the Good Friday Agreement  weakened or destroyed.   I was proud to introduce a similar resolution back in January, and I  am equally proud to cosponsor Mr. Suozzi's bill, which reaffirms our  bipartisan support in this Chamber for the Good Friday Agreement, and I  urge my colleagues to support it.                                time  1715
