 Mr. Speaker, the Senate has failed to repeal  and replace the Affordable Care Act, or the ACA.   As the President said: Healthcare is hard.   As Democrats, we didn't receive Republican votes to pass the ACA, but  it is the law of the land.   Our job as Members of Congress is to fix laws that are not effective.  Let's work as Members of Congress not to do a Republican fix or a  Democratic fix. Let's work together as Americans to find the American  solution to our healthcare problems. That is what our Founding Fathers  and our constituents expect from us.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from  Tennessee for yielding.   We are proud to accept the Speaker's trophy for winning the golf  tournament. The most important thing--and you said it--is that we  raised $144,000 to go to wounded warrior and warfighter programs. Over  the last 10 years, Members of Congress, on a bipartisan basis, raised  over $1 million.   Jimmy, I am just glad we were able to take this trophy home. We will  see you next year.                            Parliamentary Inquiry     Mr. Chair, I want to thank my colleague on  the Energy and Commerce Committee for yielding me the time.   I rise today in support of H.R. 2883, the Promoting Cross-Border  Energy Infrastructure Act.   The Presidential permitting process dates back through many  administrations, beginning with the administration of Ulysses S. Grant.  The executive branch has taken the necessary steps to ensure our cross- border infrastructure with Canada and Mexico was constructed.   These past administrations, and even the current administration, were  [[Page H6012]]  forced to issue executive orders because Congress failed to act.  Congress has the duty to regulate the commerce of the United States,  and cross-border energy infrastructure projects fall well within that  space.   Opponents of this bill argue the executive permitting process has  worked well in the past. It is true that in the past the process has  been proven effective. Unfortunately, cross-border decisions have now  fallen victim to election year-cycle politics.   We cannot build infrastructure in this country or on the continent  based on who sits in the White House, whether they be Democrat or  Republican. It is Congress' responsibility to create regulatory rules  by which infrastructure is constructed.                                time  1545    This bill will create a regulatory process at the Federal Energy  Regulatory Commission, the Department of State, and the Department of  Energy to permit cross-border infrastructure. It is not different than  building roads, bridges, or railways. The Department of Transportation  coordinates with the Federal, State, and local agencies to ensure  projects are completed and the environment is protected. We will do the  same thing for pipes and wires. We need to build electric transmission  lines and pipelines to move resources from where they are to where they  are needed.   The bill complies with the National Environmental Policy Act and  requires a full environmental review of any cross-border facility  including analysis of climate change impacts. More so, the entire  length of the pipeline or electric transmission line will be reviewed  for environmental impacts not just for the cross-border pipeline.   While there is some confusion on this issue, opponents of the bill  talk about how we will gut the NEPA process--the National Environmental  Policy Act. This is simply not the case. My colleague from Texas (Mr.  Veasey) will offer a bipartisan amendment to the bill clarifying that  the scope of the National Environmental Policy Act review shall not be  limited in any way by this act.   The bill is about the future and how to meet energy demands for the  21st century. We should embrace the changes taking place in North  America and harmonize our policies with those of our neighbors both to  the north with Canada and to the south with Mexico, and this bill, if  it becomes law, will do that.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Congressman  Mullin for partnering together.   Like he said, Texas and Oklahoma have a lot of things in common. We  both are energy States. But believe me, the Red River does divide us on  football.    Mr. Chair, there seems to be some confusion  here that this bill takes away National Environmental Policy Act  enforcement. That is just not true. In fact, during a committee hearing  in the Energy and Commerce Committee, we produced a Congressional  Research Service report that said that nothing in this bill will take  away the responsibility for the NEPA process, the National  Environmental Policy Act.   To make sure that every inch of those pipelines will be studied for  environmental issues is not our intention. Our intention is just to  move product. We will go through all the efforts.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a report from the Congressional  Research Service that we got in committee.           [From the Congressional Research Service, May 2, 2017]                                 Memorandum       To: The Honorable Gene Green; Attention: Justin Ackley      From: Linda Luther, Analyst in Environmental Policy, ext. 7-          6852      Subject: Scope of NEPA Review Required for Federal Agency           Approvals         This memorandum responds to your request asking CRS to       clarify the scope of an environmental review prepared by       federal agencies under the National Environmental Policy Act       (NEPA). More specifically, you asked CRS to identify the       scope of environmental impacts that a federal agency would be       likely to evaluate before making a final decision on a       request to approve certain energy infrastructure projects       that would cross a United States border, such as the issuance       of a ``certificate of crossing'' that would be required in       the Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act       (discussion draft released April 25, 2017). This memorandum       identifies the range of environmental impacts that federal       agencies currently evaluate when demonstrating compliance       with NEPA. It also discusses current agency practices, for       similar projects, that generally involve the evaluation of       the environmental impacts of any new facilities constructed       in the United States (i.e., impacts that may occur as a       result of approving a cross-border energy infrastructure       project). Information in this memorandum may be used or may       have been used in other CRS products.        Before a federal agency can make a final decision on a       proposed federal action, NEPA requires that agency to       identify the proposal's effects on the ``quality of the human       environment.'' The scope and level of review required under       NEPA depends on whether those effects will be       ``significant.'' To make that determination, each agency must       identify and evaluate the proposal's--        Direct effects--impacts caused by the project and occurring       at the same time and place, including impacts directly       associated with the construction and operation of the       facilities;.        Indirect effects--impacts that are later in time or farther       removed in distance, but still reasonably foreseeable; and        Cumulative effects--impacts on the environment that result       from the incremental impacts of the action when added to       other past, present, or reasonably foreseeable future       actions, regardless of what agency (federal or non-federal)       or person undertakes that other action.        If an agency is authorized to approve a cross-border       facility (e.g., issue a certificate of crossing for certain       energy infrastructure projects as in the proposed bill), that       agency's decision must be informed by appropriate       environmental review required under NEPA. As federal agencies       currently implement NEPA, the requirement to identify and       consider direct, indirect, and cumulative impacts has meant       that the agency evaluates the effects of siting, building and       operating the entire structure in the United States (not just       the cross-border segment they are authorized to approve).       That is, if a federal agency is authorized to approve a       cross-border project, that agency's existing NEPA practices       would likely continue to involve analysis of impacts       associated with the approval of the facility that physically       crosses the border, as well as any new facilities constructed       in the United States.        I hope this information is useful to you. Please feel free       to contact me if you have additional questions.     Mr. Chair, the other issue, though, is we  are going to do belts and suspenders. That is an old saying I heard. We  already had a belt, but now we are going to deal with an amendment from  Congressman Veasey. We will make sure it is belts and suspenders and  that the National Environmental Policy Act is applied to these  pipelines, because that is not our intent.   So we not only have the Congressional Research Service saying it is,  we are going to put language into this bill, and I understand it will  be accepted by our side, to make sure that is there.   What we need to do is make sure that our closest neighbors, Canada  and Mexico--right now, Mexico needs the natural gas that we are  producing in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, and New Mexico; but 20 years  from now, our wells may be dry for natural gas, and  [[Page H6017]]  we will need that natural gas that Mexico will be producing when they  work in northern Mexico.   So that is why we need to structuralize this, if we are really going  to have a North American energy market for electric transmission like  they do up in the New England States or electric transmissions even  along the border in Texas. I know they do the same thing in southern  California. We need to have some certainty with our closest neighbors.   We have a free trade agreement with these two countries. It is  already decided it is in our national interest. Why would we set aside  energy as something different? That is why this bill is so important.   Mr. Chair, I urge a ``yes'' vote for this legislation.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment. In the United States today, there is 150 million acres of  protected land set aside in the National Wildlife Refuge System for  protected designation for America's fish, wildlife, and plants.   Conservation efforts like the National Wildlife Refuge System build  up America's great conservation legacy that began with Teddy Roosevelt.  Ensuring that future generations of Americans have access to these  great traditions must be our priority as a body going forward.   In this 150 million acres of National Wildlife Refuge System land,  though, there currently stretches 1,339 miles of pipeline already.  Protecting our natural resources and building much-needed  infrastructure are not mutually exclusive goals.   These pipelines are already there. They are not destroying the lands  or their ecosystem or prohibiting the American people from enjoying  access to this public land. Companies must pay the government for use  of the land for pipelines. That money, in turn, goes into acquiring  more land for conservation efforts and recreational use.   The Department of Transportation's review of safety accidents  conducted under President Obama's administration showed that in  addition to providing a substantial cost advantage, pipelines result in  fewer spillage incidents and personal injuries than either road or  rail.   As coal-fired power plants continue to shut down, the demand for  natural gas, a lower emission alternative, is going to keep going up.  Whether the gas is produced in Canada, Alaska, North Dakota,  Pennsylvania, or the Gulf of Mexico, it will be used all over the  country, and we need to ensure that a regulatory framework is in place  that allows us to get this supply to where it is needed.   The amendment is a backhanded way to prevent any pipelines or  electrical transmission infrastructure from being built.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.    Mr. Chair, as the designee of Mr. Veasey, I  offer an amendment.    Mr. Chair, again, this is Congressman  Veasey's idea, and I am doing it for him because he couldn't be here.   Our intent when crafting the bill was never to reduce or limit the  National Environmental Policy Act applicability when considering  whether to approve a cross-border project.   Before a Federal agency can make a final determination on a proposed  Federal action, the National Environmental Policy Act requires that the  agency identify the proposal's effects on the quality of human  environment and whether these effects will be significant.   To make this determination, Federal agencies identify and evaluate  the direct and indirect cumulation of effects of the proposal. Direct  effects are the impacts caused by the project occurring at the same  time and place. Indirect effects are the impacts that are later in time  or further removed but still reasonably foreseeable. And cumulative  effects are impacts on the environment that result with incremental  [[Page H6020]]  impacts on the action, regardless of what person or agency undertakes  that action.   The Federal agencies currently implement NEPA. The requirement to  identify all three of these impacts has required the analysis of  impacts to include not just the cross-border section of the project,  but any new facility or structure constructed within the United States.   Our office had the bill analyzed by the experts at the Congressional  Research Office, who confirmed that the underlying bill did not in any  way limit the scope of future National Environmental Policy Act reviews  under it. Under our language, they will continue to involve reviews of  the entire project, not just that part that crosses the border section.   With that said, I have heard concerns from Members who are worried  that the bill will limit the NEPA in some way. I am happy to support  this bipartisan amendment with my colleague, Mr. Veasey, which  unequivocally states that nothing in this act or the amendments made by  this act shall affect the scope of any review required to be conducted  by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969.   I support this good faith amendment--and like I said earlier, it is  belts and suspenders, but sometimes we need them to pass legislation-- and I urge my colleagues to do so as well.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
