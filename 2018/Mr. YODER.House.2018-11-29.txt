 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a young woman in  my district for creating a remarkable application to help detect  Parkinson's disease.   Erin Smith, a Shawnee Mission West High School graduate, created  FacePrint, a facial expression recognition system that uses a web  camera or smartphone to detect facial masking, a common Parkinson's  symptom caused by stiff facial muscles. FacePrint will analyze facial  movements and compare them to a database of people with and without  Parkinson's.   Erin's app will help lead to early detection of Parkinson's. Early  diagnosis means early treatment, and appropriately targeted therapies  can be initiated before further tissue damage is done.   This creation earned Erin a spot on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list,  making her the youngest person to make this list in a decade.   We are extremely proud to have Erin in the Third District of Kansas.  She is a testament to our local schools and a shining example of the  hardworking and innovative Kansas spirit. I wish the best for Erin as  she continues this important work to combat Parkinson's disease.                            ____________________
