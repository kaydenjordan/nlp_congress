 Madam Speaker, this phrase keeps coming up  that no person is above the law. That is true. But, also, no person is  denied protection under the law.   Why would we wait 4 years?   Why would this come up at this time that we have to check the former  President of the United States' tax returns?   The answer is because we want to make them public.   Why do we want to make them public?   Because we need to have every single citizen understand just who this  person is and what is in their tax returns with no regard to the  protections that are already in place that these kinds of things don't  happen, that they do not become a political weapon.   Yet, now in the very last days of this session, we have decided that  this is the most important thing this Congress can do. No other  President has ever gone through this type of scrutiny.                                time  1000    We keep saying he is not above the law. He is not above the law. The  truth of it all is, he is not protected by the law because we are going  to change the law. We are going to make it a weapon that we can go  after.   I will just tell you this: The American people continue to lose  faith, trust, and confidence in a system that cherry-picks what it  decides to go after and go after in a way that is detrimental to the  very form of government that we have.   To be here today, talking about this, in the last hours of this  session, has nothing to do with what is good for the American people.  It is a political hit job. It is sad and, especially in this age, for  the Ways and Means to be doing this at the end of the year? Horrible.
