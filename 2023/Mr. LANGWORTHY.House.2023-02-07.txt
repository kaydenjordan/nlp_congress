 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules,  I call up House Resolution 97 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                 H. Res. 97         Resolved, That at any time after adoption of this       resolution the Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule       XVIII, declare the House resolved into the Committee of the       Whole House on the state of the Union for consideration of       the bill (H.R. 185) to terminate the requirement imposed by       the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and       Prevention for proof of COVID-19 vaccination for foreign       travelers, and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce or their       respective designees. After general debate the bill shall be       considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. The bill       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill are waived. No amendment to the bill       shall be in order except those printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution. Each such       amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the       report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the       report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for       the time specified in the report equally divided and       controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be       subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand       for division of the question in the House or in the Committee       of the Whole. All points of order against such amendments are       waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for       amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the       House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The       previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill       and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except one motion to recommit.        Sec. 2.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 24) disapproving the action of the District of Columbia       Council in approving the Local Resident Voting Rights       Amendment Act of 2022. All points of order against       consideration of the joint resolution are waived. The joint       resolution shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the joint resolution are waived. The       joint resolution shall be debatable for one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Oversight and Accountability or       their respective designees. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the joint resolution to final       passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit (if otherwise in order).        Sec. 3.  Upon adoption of this resolution it shall be in       order to consider in the House the joint resolution (H.J.       Res. 26) disapproving the action of the District of Columbia       Council in approving the Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022.       All points of order against consideration of the joint       resolution are waived. The joint resolution shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the joint resolution are waived. The joint resolution shall       be debatable for one hour equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Oversight and Accountability or their respective designees.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       joint resolution to final passage without intervening motion       except one motion to recommit (if otherwise in order).     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Scanlon), pending which I yield myself such time as I  may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded  is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 97 provides for  consideration of three measures: H.R. 185, H.J. Res. 24, and H.J. Res.  26.   The rule provides for H.R. 185 to be considered under a structured  rule with 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce or  their designees and provides for one motion to recommit.   Mr. Speaker, I should point out that in only our second week after  organizing, this Republican majority has already tied House Democrats  in the number of times a structured rule makes in order more minority  amendments than majority amendments. In the 117th Congress, House  Democrats only reported one structured rule making in order more  Republican amendments than Democratic amendments. Clearly, House  Republicans are delivering a more open and transparent legislative  process for the American people.   The rule further provides for consideration of two measures, H.J.  Res. 24 and H.J. Res. 26, under closed rules with 1 hour of debate each  equally divided and controlled by the chair and the ranking minority  member of the  [[Page H721]]  Committee on Oversight and Accountability or their designees.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this rule and in support of the  underlying legislation.   H.R. 185 would finally end the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention's proof of COVID-19 vaccination requirement for foreign  travelers entering the United States.   This legislation should receive broad, bipartisan support. After all,  it was President Biden in September 2022 who acknowledged that ``the  pandemic is over.''   Life has returned to normal across the country. Yet, despite the  world moving on from the pandemic, this administration persists in  retaining an unnecessary vaccination requirement for those visiting the  United States.   Maintaining this mandate has led to great hardship for many  Americans, including those in my own district in western New York.  People have been separated from their family, their friends, and loved  ones for years. It is time that we acknowledge that these vaccine  mandates do not definitively stop the spread of COVID. It is time for  Congress to act where this administration refuses and finally end this  mandate.   Additionally, the rule before us provides consideration of H.J. Res.  24, a resolution disapproving of the District of Columbia's Local  Resident Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2022, a law which would allow  noncitizens of the U.S. to vote in D.C.'s local elections.   Citizenship is at the core of our society. It represents an  acceptance of duties and privileges, including the right to vote. The  oath of allegiance for newly naturalized individuals includes the  following: ``I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all  allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or  sovereignty.''   These aren't just words. This is a pledge of loyalty to this country  and an assumption of responsibilities as a citizen.   With the enacting of the Local Resident Voting Rights Amendment Act,  the District of Columbia has violated the core idea of what it means to  be a citizen of this great country.   America is not a geographic expression where the concept of  citizenship and sovereignty is meaningless or relative. We are a  sovereign nation and a sovereign people. It is Congress' right and  responsibility to step in and right a wrong that threatens one of the  pillars of our democracy--the right of citizens to vote.   Finally, this rule provides before us the consideration of H.J. Res.  26, disapproving of the District of Columbia's Revised Criminal Code  Act of 2022.   In the past few years, murders, rapes, carjackings, robberies, and  theft have skyrocketed here in our Nation's Capital. The District of  Columbia's law enforcement remains understaffed and overwhelmed by the  soaring rates of violent crime. Residents have routinely registered  this concern, as a recent poll showed 75 percent of D.C. residents  sought more police officers and safer streets.   Yet, the D.C. Council, in their infinite wisdom, chose not to heed  the concerns of D.C. residents or its many visitors and, instead,  approved the Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022, a bill patterned after  the disastrous policies already implemented in Democratic-led cities  across this country.   The Revised Criminal Code Act of 2022 will drastically reduce  sentences for violent offenders and make it easier than ever before for  those offenders to obtain early release. To be clear, when I say  ``violent offenders,'' I am referring to those convicted of murder,  rape, and other seriously horrific crimes.   Additionally, D.C.'s revised criminal code provides a right to a jury  trial for a slew of misdemeanors, forcing the court system, already  strained, to take on a new workload. Not only does this deprive  Americans of their right to a speedy trial, but it will also deny  victims resolution and closure against perpetrators of serious offenses  as they face an overwhelmed and understaffed justice system.   Democratic leadership in most major cities across this country are  trading the safety of Americans for the lawlessness of their pie-in- the-sky policies that, in reality, let violent offenders go, reduce  sentences, avoid prosecution, and deny victims justice.    Just downstate from my own district, New York City has seen its crime  rate skyrocket by 22 percent since this time last year alone. Arrests  linked to shootings and homicides jumped 12 percent in just 1 year.   In Chicago, Illinois, the homicide rate is up a whopping 34 percent  from 2019.   In San Francisco, businesses from mom-and-pop shops to national  retail chains have closed their doors. They have laid off workers  because they can't afford to stay open in a city whose leadership  refuses to prosecute basic offenses like theft and shoplifting.   Now, not to be outdone, the District of Columbia has chosen to import  these dangerous and disastrous policies.   Just last week, only a mile or so away from this Capitol, a gunman  went on a rampage at the Potomac Avenue Metro Station. A Metro  employee, 64-year-old Robert Cunningham, was killed, and three people  were injured.   This tragic event is just one more in a wave of violent crime that  has swept across the District of Columbia in recent years. Yet, the  D.C. Council seems unperturbed as it steamrolls ahead with a policy  that will only make the District, its residents, and the many visitors  to this city, our Nation's Capital, less safe.   Residents of D.C. have the same rights as other Americans to be  secure in their homes and to be protected against crimes committed  against their lives, their families, and their property. Putting  violent offenders back on the streets and reducing sentences for  violent crimes will only endanger the lives of D.C. residents.   It is our duty as Members of Congress, as laid out in the D.C. Home  Rule Act, to disapprove of a policy like this that threatens the safety  of this city's residents.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   As we talk about following the science, I have to ask the question:  France, Germany, Italy, Great Britain, they don't have a vaccine  mandate for their visitors.   Are they following the science?   Are they in great peril?   Back to the matter of public safety. I think it is very important to  point out that in letters to the leadership of this great body, the  National Fraternal Order of Police, a union representing the men and  women of the D.C. Metropolitan Police Department, they are proudly  standing against the wrongheaded policies in the District of Columbia  that overrode their Democratic Mayor's veto on this very legislation,  as well as the D.C. Police Union itself in a letter to Speaker McCarthy  doing the same.   Are they wrong? I don't think so.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota  (Mrs. Fischbach), my fellow Rules Committee member.    Mr. Speaker, as a reminder, the resolutions before us  today, they are not about the question of D.C. statehood. These are  based on current law and not what we would like the law to look like as  it relates to the District of Columbia.   Under the Home Rule Act, Congress has the ability, the  responsibility, to provide oversight and review of policies enacted by  the D.C. Government.   Let's also remember that the District of Columbia isn't just another  town or locality. It is a Federal district. It is our Nation's capital.  We have an obligation to protect the residents of this country in our  Nation's capital.   The criminal justice revisions, as well as weakening the protections  for the elections in the District of Columbia by opening it up to  foreign nationals, go and fly directly in the face of that.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr.  Massie), my fellow Rules Committee member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy) my fellow Rules Committee member.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Missouri (Mr. Alford).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  for closing.   Mr. Speaker, if individuals would like the power to vote in our  elections, they must go through the legal process to become U.S.  citizens, like the millions before them did.   Ask yourself: Should we be extending the right to vote, no matter at  any level, to the CCP members who work at the Chinese Embassy?   Should we extend the right to vote in elections in this country to  members of the Russian Federation staff at their embassy?   That would happen under the D.C. voting rights legislation.   If individuals attack, kill, steal, and destroy property, they should  be punished for those offenses, not let off the hook. These are basic  tenets of our society, of our democracy, and of this great Nation.   The District of Columbia is the seat of the Federal Government, and  as  [[Page H727]]  such has a special place in American society. Congress has a clear  responsibility under the Home Rule Act to block policies that  jeopardize the democratic rights and the lives of American citizens.   We have an opportunity today not just to provide much-needed  oversight to D.C.'s disastrous policies but to also finally end a  draconian vaccine mandate that has kept families and friends apart.   Let's remember that around the world, other countries have ended  their own COVID-19 vaccine mandates for air travelers. Europe, Canada,  and elsewhere no longer require Americans to arrive with a proof of  vaccination.   Why has the administration persisted in upholding this mandate?   With the proof about the vaccine's true efficacy and limitation in  preventing the spread of COVID, why have they so obsessively upheld  this mandate or any of the others, for that matter?   The time has come for Congress to step in and to remind the  administration that the pandemic is over and allow families and friends  and loved ones to reunite after years of forced separation.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Scanlon is as follows:                      Amendment to House Resolution 97         Strike the first section after the resolving clause and       insert the following:        That at any time after adoption of this resolution the       Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       185) to terminate the requirement imposed by the Director of       the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for proof of       COVID-19 vaccination for foreign travelers, and for other       purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed       with. All points of order against consideration of the bill       are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and       the amendments specified in this section and shall not exceed       one hour equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and       Commerce or their respective designees. After general debate       the bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-      minute rule. The amendment printed in section 4 of this       resolution shall be considered as adopted in the House and in       the Committee of the Whole. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as the original bill for the purpose of further       amendment and shall be considered as read. All points of       order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived.       No further amendment to the bill, as amended, shall be in       order except those printed in the report of the Committee on       Rules accompanying this resolution. Each such further       amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the       report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the       report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for       the time specified in the report equally divided and       controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be       subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand       for division of the question in the House or in the Committee       of the Whole. All points of order against such further       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill, as amended, to the House with such further       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and       on any further amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit.        Insert at the end the following:        Sec. 4. The amendment referred to in the first section of       this resolution is as follows:        ``At the end, add the following:        ``This Act shall not be effective unless and until the date       on which the Director of the Congressional Budget Office       certifies that this Act will not result in a decrease to       Social Security benefits.''.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
