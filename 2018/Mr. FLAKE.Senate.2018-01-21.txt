 Mr. President, on Friday, I voted with many of my  colleagues not to accept the deal that was offered at that time, the CR  to go for 4 weeks. I felt that was unnecessarily long.  [[Page S428]]    Also, I voted against it because I felt, like a lot of my Democratic  colleagues and some of my Republican colleagues, that we need to deal  with this situation on immigration and that we shouldn't wait for the  White House to indicate its preference.   I felt that we could have an agreement to move forward, so I voted  against the proposal at that time. In the intervening time, we have  worked with the majority leader to, No. 1, have a shorter timeframe,  which now has been offered, that of February 8. That is longer than I  would like, but it is shorter than a 4-week CR.   Also, we had an agreement, which the majority leader has just  announced, that if an agreement on immigration has not been reached by  that time, the majority leader, using his discretion and his authority  as majority leader, will move to immigration, and at that time, we can  deal with the DACA issue and broader immigration issues generally; that  moving to immigration, my understanding--and I believe the commitment-- is not to prejudice one bill over another, but anyone can bring forward  their bill.   There are several of us who have been working on a bipartisan bill. I  believe we have seven Republicans and seven Democrats on that effort  right now. That legislation certainly will be considered, as will other  legislation, as it should be. I think the Senate should act like the  Senate.   I just want to say that there has been a lot of rhetoric over the  last couple of days about whose shutdown this is--who should have the  blame. There is enough blame to go around. I hope we can move away from  that and find a way to open the government back up, move about our  business, and let the Senate legislate as it should.   I will add my vote for this agreement, as the majority leader has  simply outlined, that we have a CR that runs through February 8, and we  seek to have an agreement on immigration before that time, as well as  the other outstanding issues. If an agreement has not been reached by  February 8, then we move to immigration, and the Senate deals with it  as the Senate should, without relying on the White House or other  bodies, other Chambers, to dictate what we do here, and we deal with  this issue as we have dealt with it in the past, by debating it, by  amending legislation, and by moving forward.   With that, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
