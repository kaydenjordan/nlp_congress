 Mr. Speaker, I thank the Speaker, I thank the ranking  member of the Appropriations Committee, and the chair for bringing this  measure to the floor. But to paraphrase President Reagan, Well, there  you go again.   Why are we here? This should have been in the CR, approved, or we  should have had support for the ranking member's motion to recommit,  but we are here for a supplemental appropriation for the Iron Dome.   I support it, but it is disgraceful that we have had to come back to  the House floor to carry on this mission.   The Iron Dome is one of the most successful military and technology  partnerships in world history. Earlier this year, the missile defense  system, Iron Dome, saved countless lives, Mr. Speaker, of Israeli and  Palestinian citizens from relentless attack.   In July I traveled to Israel with Foreign Affairs Committee Chair  Meeks on the first U.S. congressional codel since the pandemic. Where  was it? Our first visit, Jerusalem, to meet the new Israeli coalition  government.   Despite a change in power and a new governing coalition between left  and right, there is no space, Mr. Speaker, between the parties in  Israel that the number one national security threat continues to be  Iran.   And who funds that roaring rocket reign of terror flying into Israel  from Hamas? Iran.   Mr. Speaker, we have historically in this body had strong bipartisan  support for our friend, Israel. On our trip, our delegation, led by  Chair Meeks, assured the Israeli Government that we have their back and  that we would continue to fund Iron Dome. I thank him for his critical  voice.    While this makeup vote restores the funding stripped by Democratic  colleagues earlier this week, the concern I have is like the  gentlewoman from Florida, those strong Democratic friends of Israel are  continuing to be thrown under the bus on this House floor by the far  left.   Mr. Speaker, I urge approval. I thank the Appropriations Committee.
