 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the remarks of the  gentlewoman from New York and the comments of the gentleman from Texas.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4975.   Midlothian resident Dorothy Braden Bruce--or Dot, as she was widely  known--embodied the true spirit of central Virginia and our  Commonwealth.   In World War II, Dorothy's work to break Japanese codes was one of  the most pivotal Allied code-breaking efforts in the war.   Having been recruited by the military to serve in a top-secret group  of code-breaking women, she intercepted enemy movements, supply  shipments, and potential threats to American servicemembers.   For 70 years, Dorothy Bruce kept her story a secret. She had sworn an  oath of secrecy. It wasn't until an author reached out to her a few  years ago that  [[Page H4362]]  she learned that she could finally talk about her by-then declassified  work in the service of our country. It was at this time that even her  grown children first learned of their mother's pivotal work.   Dorothy Bruce didn't ask for credit, and she didn't seek the  limelight. She knew that she had protected the lives of American  servicemembers in the field of combat, and she knew their families were  prospering and growing in the following decades, thanks to the  diligence of her top-secret code-breaking unit. For her, that was an  achievement worth celebrating, though quietly and secretly.   Meanwhile, Dorothy Bruce became a dedicated member of our central  Virginia community. She worked as an educator, and she raised a loving  family. Last year, she passed away at the age of 99.   This legislation honors Dorothy Braden Bruce's life serving our  country and her service to others across Virginia.   Her story continues to inspire, and that is why I am working to make  sure our community will always remember Dorothy Bruce's story and the  stories of her fellow women code breakers.   My legislation would name the Sycamore Square post office in  Midlothian, Virginia, near where she once lived at the Spring Arbor  Assisted Living, after her.   With this bipartisan bill passing today, we are one step closer to  future generations of trailblazers walking through the doors of the  Dorothy Braden Bruce Post Office Building.   I would like to thank every member of the Virginia delegation of the  House for signing onto this bill at introduction in order to recognize  Dorothy Bruce's work.   She was a trailblazer. Her ingenuity and her determination as a code  breaker did not just blaze a path for a generation of future code  breakers and women in public service, but it saved thousands of  American lives.                                time  1615    For women pursuing careers in science and math and intelligence,  Dorothy is a reminder of the pioneering contributions of women in these  fields throughout our Nation's history.   Today, I would also like to thank Dot's loving family for their work  to amplify her story and reaffirm the importance of the female code  breakers of World War II. Their story is worth knowing and worth  celebrating.   This bill is just a small act to remember and recognize Dorothy  Braden Bruce's remarkable life of courage, dedication, selflessness,  and service to country.
