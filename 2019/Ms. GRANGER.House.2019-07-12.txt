 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a Texas legend, an American  original, and a historic icon, H. Ross Perot. There is not enough time  in the day and not enough words in the world to describe the remarkable  life of this remarkable man.   Born and raised in Texarkana, Texas, Perot, as a boy, delivered  newspapers on horseback before dawn. And that same entrepreneurial  spirit led him in the 1960s to start Electronic Data Systems, a company  that would revolutionize the business world and make him a household  name.   It would be enough if Perot's life had been devoted to his business.  But as a believer, he knew from scripture that to whom much is given,  much is expected. So, his life became about much more than making  money, it became about making a difference, and what a difference he  made.   He spent his life, and much of his fortune, on other people. He gave  to philanthropic causes, supported countless people in need, and even  purchased the Magna Carta, which, in true Perot fashion, he gave to the  National Archives so all Americans could see it.   He also worked tirelessly to help, support, and honor American  prisoners of war in Vietnam. And when some of his own EDS employees got  caught in the Iranian hostage crisis in 1979, he organized and  supervised a rescue mission to get them out.   What made Perot so unique, so successful, so enduring? Having known  him, I can answer that question. It was his relentless devotion to  transforming a dream into reality.                                time  1445    Whether it is freeing prisoners in Iran or building one of the  greatest companies in history, Ross Perot would not be denied. This  relentlessness was the lighthouse that guided him through the stiff  winds and stormy seas of 89 years.  [[Page H5772]]    When his long-time friend and lawyer, Tom Luce, was working for him,  Perot once asked him to call a competitor about a business deal. The  next day, Perot asked Luce if he had talked to the man. ``I left him a  message,'' was Luce's unfortunate response.   ``You are going to go broke leaving messages,'' Perot responded in  rebuke. It was a message Luce never forgot and it is an example of the  relentless drive that made Perot so successful for so long.   For me, I am grateful to have known Mr. Perot. As a friend, he could  be loyal and loving. He gave advice when he was asked for it, and  sometimes when he wasn't asked for it, but it always came from his  experience and his heart. If you were his friend, he was on your side  and wanted you to succeed.   Of course, Perot's greatest accomplishment was his family. He was  married for more than 60 years to his wife, Margo, and he was the proud  father of 5 and proud grandfather of 16. Each of them will continue in  their own ways to carry on the great legacy of a great man. America has  lost an amazing hero, and those who knew him lost an amazing friend.   Ross Perot will be missed, but he will never be forgotten.   I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Carter).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Gohmert).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
