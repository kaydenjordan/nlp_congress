 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Month of the Military Child. I married the daughter of an Army retired  combat veteran. She was born just after her father got to Vietnam. My  children are, of course, military children.   Several years ago, I was on a friend's Facebook page. He had died  fighting for our country in Afghanistan. The last post on his Facebook  page read: ``I love you and miss you . . . Daddy.''   Her dad had signed up to go to war, but she never did.   Who will teach her to dance?   Who will drop her off at college?   Who will walk that young girl down the aisle?   Our military children's sacrifices can never be properly measured and  never compensated, but we must do all we can to honor them.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of  rule IX, I rise to give notice of my intention to raise a question of  the privileges of the House.   The form of the resolution is as follows:   House Resolution 304. Raising a question of the privileges of the  House.   Whereas Michael Cohen testified under oath as a witness before the  House Committee on Oversight and Reform on February 27, 2019;   Whereas Michael Cohen falsely testified under oath, ``I have never  asked for, nor would I accept, a pardon from President Trump'';   Whereas in truth and fact, attorney for Michael Cohen, Lanny Davis,  admitted on March 6, 2019, that Cohen ``directed his attorney to  explore possibilities of a pardon at one point with Donald J. Trump  lawyer Rudy Giuliani as well as other lawyers advising President  Trump'';  [[Page H3319]]    Whereas in truth and fact, attorney for Michael Cohen, Michael  Monico, admitted in a March 12, 2019, letter that Cohen's testimony was  inaccurate;   Whereas in truth and fact, the ex post representation by Cohen's  attorney does not annul Cohen's intentionally false and misleading  testimony;   Whereas in truth and fact, Cohen's testimony under oath was delivered  in the context of apologizing for all his criminal activities;   Whereas in truth and fact, Cohen's denial of ever seeking a pardon  contained no qualifiers about the context of his statement;   Whereas in truth and fact, Cohen's denial of ever seeking a pardon,  as uttered under oath in his testimony, was absolute and unequivocal;   Whereas in truth and fact, Cohen testified under oath that he and his  lawyers spent hours editing his written statement submitted to the  Committee on Oversight and Reform preceding his testimony, which  included the written assertion, ``I have never asked for, nor would I  accept, a pardon from President Trump'';   Whereas in truth and fact, Cohen's denial in his written statement of  never asking for a Presidential pardon was an unqualified assertion;   Whereas Michael Cohen falsely testified under oath that he ``did not  want to go to the White House'' and he ``did not want a role or title  in the administration'';   Whereas in truth and fact the United States Attorney's Office for the  Southern District of New York submitted to Federal court a sentencing  memorandum expressing Michael Cohen's desire to work in the White  House, explaining: ``during and after the campaign, Cohen privately  told friends and colleagues, including in seized text messages, that he  expected to be given a prominent role and title in the new  administration. When that did not materialize, Cohen found a way to  monetize his relationship with and access to the President'';   Whereas Michael Cohen falsely testified under oath on other factual  matters of material significance;   Whereas Michael Cohen's intentionally false testimony was aimed at  obscuring the truth and ameliorating the extent of his own personal  embarrassment;   Whereas intentionally false testimony to a committee of the House of  Representatives harms the integrity of the proceedings of the House;   Whereas it is a Federal crime to provide false information to  Congress and the failure to enforce this crime further undermines the  integrity of the House; and   Whereas it is the judgment of the House of Representatives that  providing a copy of the official transcript of the hearing of the  Committee on Oversight and Reform on February 27, 2019, to the  Department of Justice would aid the Attorney General's consideration of  investigation and potential prosecution of Michael Cohen's criminal  conduct: Now, therefore, be it   Resolved, that the House of Representatives directs the chair of the  Oversight and Reform Committee to submit to the Attorney General an  official copy of the transcript of the hearing during which Michael  Cohen testified under oath on February 27, 2019.                                time  1315
