 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, it is hard to believe, but the entire  island of Puerto Rico yesterday descended into darkness. An excavation  happened to hit a main line that cut out the electricity of the entire  island--3\1/2\ million people--an island that is not a small island; it  is a large island. It was a total blackout. Now, 24 hours later, a  large number of the people on the island are still in the dark.   Tomorrow marks 7 months since Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto  Rico, and yet Puerto Ricans are still dealing with constant setbacks  and unreliable power. This is simply unacceptable.   Senator Rubio and I have asked the Senate Committee on Energy and  Natural Resources Committee to conduct an additional oversight hearing  on the overall hurricane recovery and get to the bottom of this. I  understand this  [[Page S2292]]  hearing will likely take place next month.   In the meantime, this is a widespread power outage. It is the latest  example of why so many people who were forced to leave the island after  the storm haven't been able to return home, even though they want to.  Yet, despite all the island's ongoing troubles, the Federal Emergency  Management Agency, FEMA, said this week it is going to terminate the  transitional shelter assistance for more than 1,600 families across the  United States, and 600 of them are in my State of Florida. It doesn't  make sense. For too many of these displaced families, the only thing  keeping a roof over their head right now is the FEMA program, and it is  transitional housing assistance. What that means is, they are either in  hotels or motels and, in some cases, apartments, where FEMA is  providing them temporary shelter because they have been displaced from  their homes; in this case, the island of Puerto Rico.   Storms like Hurricane Maria did this to the island of Puerto Rico. We  have a responsibility to provide them with all the assistance we can.  Senator Rubio and I sent a letter to the FEMA Administrator and to  Governor Rossello, the Governor of Puerto Rico, urging them to work  together to extend this vital program. At the very least, because there  are so many of these families who have children in school, to extend it  to the end of the school year so the family doesn't have to be uprooted  while their child is still in school.   I am happy to report that Governor Rossello has made that formal  request to FEMA. The deadline is tomorrow. Hopefully, FEMA is listening  to the Governor and to the pleas of Senator Rubio and me as well  because students and families have had endless disruptions and need  some semblance of stability so they can finish out the year.   The hard fact is this. The situation in Puerto Rico is far from over.  These are our fellow U.S. American citizens, and they desperately need  our help. We should be providing them with all the help we can.   Mr. President, I want to speak on another topic.   (The remarks of Senator Nelson pertaining to the introduction of S.  2720 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced  Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, tomorrow marks another somber occasion.  Eight years ago, the news ticker came across our televisions saying  that an oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico, off of Louisiana, was on fire,  the Coast Guard was on the scene, and workers were missing.   It was a Tuesday night. It was nearly midnight on April 20, 2010. By  morning light, we knew 11 men would not be going home again. For 87  days, the oil gushed into one of the most productive marine  environments in the world. The studies show the oil impacted the  deepwater corals and fish at the bottom of the food chain, all the way  from the bottom up to the dolphins and sea turtles at the top.   Here is one example. This is one in the bayous. You can see the marsh  grasses in the distance. You can see the oil as it is coming up, and it  is literally covering everything. They did studies on fish that would  be in a bayou like this. A little fish, about as big is this, is called  a killifish. LSU professors did this study, and they compared them to  the bayous where there was not this kind of oil, compared it to similar  killifish. What they found over time was the little fish in bayous like  this were stunted. They didn't reproduce. They mutated because of this.   Nearly 5 million barrels of oil gushed for 3 months. A lot of it is  still there. Some of it is at the bottom where that well was, and that  wellhead on the sea floor below the rig was a mile deep. We worked as  one gulf community in a bipartisan way. We passed legislation--it was  called the RESTORE Act--to send a message that there were going to be  fines and penalties under the Clean Water Act. So many barrels of oil,  a figure, and then the culpability of the oil company that allowed it  to happen. A Federal judge did an extended trial over several years and  came up with that fine and that penalty. The RESTORE Act said that  money that was going to be assessed against the oil company was going  back to the Gulf of Mexico region, and it was going to aid in the  economy and in the environment.   There was another impact. The winds caught that oil slick and started  sending it east from Louisiana, and it got over to the white sugary  sands of Pensacola Beach in Destin and tar balls as far east as Panama  City Beach. Those white sands were completely covered in tar and oil.  Those photographs of Pensacola Beach went around the world. What was  the result? Our guests, our visitors, our tourists, for an entire  season, thought all of the Gulf of Mexico beaches along Florida were  covered like Pensacola Beach was, and they didn't come for the entire  year. Not only did you have an environmental effect like this, you had  an economic effect like the loss of tourist revenue in the hotels,  motels, the restaurants, the dry cleaners, the little newspapers, and  all the ancillary businesses that depend upon a $60 billion-a-year  tourist industry in Florida. Still, I am afraid the oil industry hopes  we have forgotten all of this.   This month, the media released documents from 2016 in which BP claims  that an oilspill can be a welcomed boost to local economies. Can you  believe that? This oilspill was in 2010. In 2016, we have just  uncovered documents that BP claimed that an oilspill can be ``a welcome  boost to local economies.'' How outrageous and how arrogant. I can  assure you, the coastal communities of Florida vigorously disagree, and  I bet you the coastal communities that had to put up with that in their  bayous would disagree vigorously as well.   All that progress, and yet the industry is relentless in wanting to  take us backward. They still want to open up Florida's beaches and  offshore to drilling, and we have to fight it every day.   The one thing we also have going for us is, the Gulf of Mexico, off  of Florida, is the largest testing and training area for the U.S.  military in the world. This Senator just climbed into an Air Force jet  to fly part of the training profile for young pilots, knowing they have  restricted airspace. That was out of Eglin Air Force Base--the testing  and training designee for all of the Department of Defense. We have a  range that goes from the Panhandle of Florida all the way south in the  Gulf of Mexico, off of Key West. In a one-angle shot, they can shoot  sophisticated, long-range weapons 600 miles to do the testing.    Big Oil is now trying to roll back some of the basic safety rules  that were put in place after the disaster in order to prevent another  tragedy. It is happening in front of our eyes. Two years ago, they said  that an oilspill could be a welcome boost to the local economies. Yet  they are rolling back safety rules today that were put in place in the  aftermath of there being 11 people killed on the Deepwater Horizon oil  rig. They are rolling that back today in this administration's  agencies.   That is why I am joining Senator Cantwell and other colleagues in  introducing legislation to codify these sensible safety measures, like  those designed to update the standards for blowout preventers and a  requirement for a third party to certify the safety mechanisms.   Let me explain what a blowout preventer is. It didn't work in the  Deepwater Horizon oilspill. A mile below the surface, where the well  comes out of the Earth, there is a thing called a blowout preventer.  If, as happened, there is a blowout in BP's oil well, there is a  mechanism that is supposed to safely cut the oil line--pinch it and  stop it from flowing. It was faulty. It did not work. So there have  been new standards for blowout preventers since 2010. In 2018, 8 years  later, the oil industry is trying to roll back those safety  requirements that were put in place in the aftermath of their spilling  5 million barrels of oil into the gulf.   Do you see the fight that we have? It is almost every week. We can't  allow the Department of the Interior to take us backward in time and  expose our beautiful beaches and our tourism-based local economies, as  well as our military, to another Deepwater Horizon-type catastrophe if  they keep pushing back these safety rules.   That is the purpose of introducing this legislation today with  Senator Cantwell. If we don't watch it, we are going to be right back  in the same place we were 8 years ago. It will be 8 years ago to the  day tomorrow that we had that awful experience.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Coons, Mr. Booker, Mr. Leahy, and          Ms. Warren):   S. 2724. A bill to reform the use of solitary confinement and other  forms of restrictive housing in the Bureau of Prisons, and for other  purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.
