 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 5332,  and it is not because I don't believe that there isn't a motive behind  this that isn't intended to help consumers. I just don't think it is  going to hit the target.   This bill requires the three largest nationwide credit reporting  agencies to create a single shared online portal to allow consumers  one-stop access to consumer reports, credit scores, and credit freezes,  as well as to initiate disputes. This portal would contain information  on consumer rights and directions on how to dispute a credit report.   The bill requires credit reporting agencies to match all nine digits  of a consumer's Social Security number with the information included in  a consumer file.   In addition, the bill codifies the CFPB's supervision of credit  reporting agencies and expands their authority to establish  ``administrative, technical, and physical safeguards,'' currently under  the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, to all credit reporting agencies.   The bill provides injunctive relief to allow a court to compel a  credit reporting agency to fix an error or remove inaccurate  information from a consumer report.   Furthermore, the bill creates an additional ombudsman at the CFPB  tasked with resolving persistent errors on reports that are not  addressed in a timely fashion and allows the ombudsman to make  referrals to the Office of Supervision and Enforcement for corrective  action.   We are all supportive of increased access and availability on credit  reports, scores, and file freezes, but this legislation is just overly  broad and proscriptive.   I, too, like one of my other colleagues who just talked about having  mysterious things show up in the mail, have been a victim of that. I  have also had my credit card numbers stolen in the past. We have had to  be online and try to deal with these things.   The goal to make sure that we are all protected as much as possible  is a lofty goal. The problem here, though, is that this is going to  potentially decrease competition, which then actually disincentivizes  that access; increasing fraud risk, which I am very concerned about;  propping up the trial bar, which I know is a common theme here in  Washington, D.C., at least out of one party; and expanding the  authority of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.   So, let's talk a little bit about the PII, that personally  identifiable information. When you are matching all nine digits of  consumers' Social Security numbers, it doesn't provide any alternate  methods for verification. We have had problems with this in the past,  and I, for one, and many Republicans have consistently--in fact, a  number of my Democrat friends--have consistently expressed concerns  regarding the private sector and government's overreliance on the use  of these Social Security numbers for identity verification, which  threatens consumers' personal information.   I oppose the Securities and Exchange Commission and other Federal  agencies' use of PII in their databases because there have been  breaches. I am reminded of the old adage: Why would you rob a bank?  Because that is where the money is. Why would you go after a database?  Because that is where the digital gold is.   What we are doing is, we are putting more digital gold into a new  database. So we are increasing that vulnerability. We need to be  working to promote more competition in the credit reporting and scoring  industry, not less. I think that is what this bill, unfortunately, is  doing.    Instead, we should be debating more targeted solutions, such as H.R.  3821, which would bolster cybersecurity capacity at credit reporting  agencies, encourage an alternative to use of Social Security numbers,  protect minors against fraud, and help consumers who may be facing  medical debt as a result of the global pandemic.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to reject this bill.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.J. Res.  90, which is an effort to overturn a long-overdue regulatory update of  the Community Reinvestment Act.   Frankly, it is ludicrous to compare this modernization effort to  bringing us back to 1930s banking policy. I don't understand how my  colleagues on the other side can possibly equate that.   So we all agree the fundamental purpose of the Community Reinvestment  Act is to combat unacceptable, discriminatory redlining, and demand  that banks meet the credit needs of  [[Page H2574]]  their communities. There is no disagreement on that. My friend from New  York laid out that history very, very well. It is the reason why we  support the CRA and modernizing it.   However, the regulations promulgated to implement the CRA haven't  been meaningfully updated since 1995. Now, earlier we were talking  about credit reporting, and the chair cited the fact that we had not  addressed this in 17 years, as to why we needed to pass the bill that  was on the floor. Well, we haven't addressed the CRA in any meaningful  way for 25 years. We have 8 years on that on this particular issue.   So in May of this year, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency  issued a final rule that modernizes the Community Reinvestment Act  regulations for the 21st century.   The final rule provides clarity to banks on what activities count for  a Community Reinvestment Credit, updated the geographic definitions of  a bank's community, as well as accounts for the technological  transformation of banking services that we have seen. This will ensure  that banks' reinvestment will be in those communities that need it  most.   The final rule establishes new performance standards and metrics that  will allow OCC bank examiners to measure performance objectively and  produce more consistent, useful, and timely Community Reinvestment Act  evaluations to provide more clarity to banks.   Now, I understand that some of my colleagues want to have this  ``let's move the target to my pet project'' kind of a way of evaluating  where a bank is going, but that is not what it is intended to do.   Lastly, this modernization introduces objective reporting measures  that will allow comparison over time and between banks, which has never  been possible in the history of the CRA. What is a good project in one  neighborhood should be viewed as a good project in an adjacent  neighborhood, and that isn't the case today.                                time  1645    As we work to ensure a strong economic recovery for all Americans-- all Americans--it is critical that we encourage financial institutions  to continue to provide services to those most in need.   I have the poorest county in the State of Michigan. I have urban and  suburban areas. These are issues that affect all of America.   The OCC's rule will play an important role in this recovery effort by  encouraging more capital, investment, and lending services in the  communities hardest hit by COVID-19.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the ranking member doing  that. Let me just wrap up.   By using the Congressional Review Act to overturn this critical final  rule, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will only delay  progress and harm the very communities that I know they want to  protect. Those are the same communities that I serve as well.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote against this partisan attempt to  overturn much-needed reform and modernization of the Community  Reinvestment Act, and I am hopeful that we are going to be able to come  together and work on true, meaningful, actual reform in the long run.
