 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for  his leadership in shepherding this legislation forward.   I rise today in strong support of the rule, as well as the underlying  spending agreement. This spending agreement was the product of  bipartisan negotiation with Democrats and Republicans in the Senate.   I thank Speaker Pelosi, Chairwoman DeLauro, and all of the members of  the House Democratic Caucus for their leadership in helping to make  sure that this bill includes strong democratic priorities.   This legislation invests in children and families; invests in  education and job training; invests in the creation and preservation of  affordable housing; invests in hardworking Americans and organized  labor; invests in research and development; invests in transportation  and infrastructure; invests in technology and innovation; and invests  in the health, safety, and well-being of the American people.   This legislation reflects Democratic values.   Democrats in the new year will continue to fight for lower costs,  better paying jobs, and safer communities, and Democrats will always  put people over politics.   Happy holidays and happy new year.
