 Mr. Speaker, Democrats are building a better America for  the people.  [[Page H1346]]    This week is the anniversary of the American Rescue Plan that  Democrats passed in the House and the Senate, and that President Biden  signed into law. That law was transformative. It helped schools reopen  and remain open. It also increased vaccine distribution across America.  It got people into jobs, and it funded police departments.   We then followed the American Rescue Plan with an infrastructure law  that is going to rebuild roads, bridges, and highways; it is going to  take lead out of our water pipes; it is going to have EV charging  stations across America; and it is going to make sure that we have  broadband everywhere.   What are Republicans doing? I am not really sure. But I know that two  of them recently attended a white nationalist conference, and last week  174 of them voted ``no'' to providing benefits to veterans who inhaled  toxic fumes.                            ____________________
