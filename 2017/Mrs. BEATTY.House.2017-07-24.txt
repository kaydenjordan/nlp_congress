 Mr. Speaker, I come to the House floor today in support  of National Housing Week of Action and to stand up for a better deal  for hardworking Americans.   Access to affordable housing directly impacts the ability of  Americans to have a better job, better wages, and a better future.  However, far too many families are struggling to keep a roof over their  heads as the cost of rent is rising, mortgages are harder to get, and  wages remain stagnant.   Due to cuts in Federal rental assistance, only one in four people  eligible for it actually are receiving it. Our constituents deserve a  better deal. I join Democrats in standing up to create millions of  good-paying jobs, full-time jobs by investing in our crumbling  infrastructure, and offering apprenticeship programs to new workers.   Mr. Speaker, I will continue to fight for affordable housing programs  so all Americans can have the ability to achieve the American Dream.                            ____________________
