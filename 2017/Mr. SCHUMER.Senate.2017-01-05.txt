 Mr. President, first, I appreciate the remarks of my  colleague the Republican leader. I understand the Republican leader's  discomfort. There is a cry from his side to repeal, but it has been 6  years and they have no plan to replace. Repeal without replace leaves  20 million Americans who have had health care in the lurch; leaves  college students who are 21 to 26 and have been on their parents' plan  in the lurch; leaves women who are now getting equal health care  treatment to men in the lurch; and leaves those who have families who  have preexisting conditions, and now can get insurance but without  ObamaCare couldn't, in the lurch.   I understand the Republican leader's discomfort. Replace is not  available because they can't come up with a plan. I appreciate his  request to work with us. He has two choices. Our Republican colleagues  have two choices: Either, once they repeal, come up with a replacement  plan, and we will give it a look--they haven't been able to do it for 6  years; they are squirming right now because they don't have one; they  are leaving so many Americans who need health care in the lurch--or  don't repeal and come talk to us about how to make some improvements.  We are willing to do that.   I will note that yesterday the vote to repeal without replace was  totally partisan. My colleagues decried that the vote originally for  ACA was partisan. This is equally partisan, and it is going to create  huge trouble for our colleagues. Again, I will say to my Republican  colleagues, your job is not to name call but to come up with a  replacement plan that helps the people who need help--people who are  now helped by the ACA but who will be left in the lurch once it is  repealed.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have another subject I wish to talk  about, and maybe this one will be a little more constructive right now  in terms of my Republican leader's response because he and I yesterday  had a constructive meeting on the matter of processing the President- elect's nominations to the Cabinet. We are still working out several  details, but on this issue I want to express my appreciation for the  majority leader's willingness to have a dialogue and work in good faith  toward a process both sides of the aisle can live with.   Our caucus thinks it is absolutely essential that the Senate has a  chance to appropriately vet the nominees, and the American people  deserve to hear their views and qualifications in public hearings,  especially for the most powerful Cabinet positions. We all know Cabinet  officials have enormous power and influence over the lives of everyday  Americans. They run massive government agencies that do the actual work  of implementing our laws, keeping our Nation safe from terrorism,  protecting the environment and civil rights, promoting clean energy and  affordable housing--on and on. Every facet of public life is governed  by a very powerful Cabinet official.   It is only right that we in the Senate--and by extension the American  people--get to thoroughly vet their baseline acceptability for these  jobs. That means getting their financial records to make sure they  don't come into public office with standing conflicts of interest, and  if potential conflicts of interest are found, making sure they have a  plan to divest the assets in question, making sure the FBI has had the  time to complete a full background check. It means making sure the  independent ethics officers of each agency can sign off on them.   All of these benchmarks are standard protocol. All were done by about  this time 8 years ago by the Obama administration. They are not onerous  requirements. They are necessary requirements to prevent conflicts of  interest.   I remind my colleagues again, every Obama Cabinet nominee had an  ethics agreement in before their hearing. Every Obama Cabinet nominee  underwent a full FBI background check before the Senate considered  their nomination. For such positions of influence in our government, it  is the responsibility of the Senate to guarantee that we have all the  information we need on each nominee and in a timely fashion.   Truth be told, the slate of nominations selected by President-Elect  Trump has made this process--standard for nominees of Presidents of  both parties--immensely difficult. There are several nominees who have  enormous wealth and own stock of enormous value. We have a CEO of one  of the largest oil companies in the world, a billionaire financial  services executive financier--oh, and another billionaire financial  services executive.   Leaving aside for a moment what that says about the President-elect's  priorities for his incoming administration, these nominees have  potential conflict of interest challenges of epic proportions. At the  very least--at the very least--they owe the American people the  standard paperwork, and in fact we believe many of these nominees,  given their financial holdings, should go one step further and provide  their tax returns.   The minority only has ethics agreements in for four of the nominees  so far. We only have financial disclosure forms from four of the  nominees so far. We only have tax returns for four of the nominees so  far. None of our committees has been notified that any nominees' FBI  background check has been fully completed. Briefings have started, but  they are far from complete.   As I said earlier, I hope the majority leader and I can work out an  arrangement that works for both of our caucuses to process these  nominees in a fair but thorough fashion. It certainly shouldn't be the  case, as seems to be planned now, that six hearings--several on very  important nominees--all occur on the same day and on the same day as a  potential vote-arama. That is mostly unprecedented in the modern era of  Cabinet considerations, happening only once in history. That is not the  standard, but right now that is the case on January 11.   There are Members who sit on multiple committees. One of our Members  chairs one of the committees, Judiciary, but has been very active on  the Intelligence Committee--both nominees in a single day. That is  unfair, not only to her, with her great knowledge, but to the American  people. Each member deserves plenty of time to question each nominee,  and if questions remain, they should be brought back for a second day  of hearings.   After all, they are going to hold incredibly powerful positions for  potentially the next 4 years. To spend an extra day or two on each  nominee, if it takes a few weeks, several weeks, to get through them  all in order to carefully consider their nominations, that is certainly  worth it to the American people and, I would argue, to the new  administration.   I have made these points to the majority leader, and I must say he  has respectfully listened. I am hopeful we can find an agreement that  alleviates the crunch and gives Senators and committees the opportunity  to process these nominations with the proper care and oversight, with  all of the proper paperwork in place, thoughtfully and thoroughly.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I just want to add my commendation. It  was such a well done, brilliant, articulate, carefully thought out  speech. But it is not a surprise because our new Senator, the junior  Senator from Maryland, is like that. We are so excited to have him and  our freshman class--some of his colleagues came here today. We wish it  had been larger in quantity, but they sure make up for it in quality,  as Senator Van Hollen's speech showed. And parenthetically, maybe he  will be able to increase that quantity in one of his other new jobs.   With that, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 8, submitted earlier  today.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made  and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Thank you, Mr. President.   We have just agreed to the committee resolution numbers on each  committee. I would make just a couple of points, if I might.   Our caucus has some serious concerns about letting the Intelligence  Committee and Armed Services Committee exclusively handle the issue of  Russia's interference in the election.   While much of the information relating to Russia's interference in  our election can be pulled together by the Intelligence and Armed  Services Committees, the legislative actions that  [[Page S107]]  will be required to respond fully to Russia's interference need to be a  wide-ranging endeavor that can only be done by a select committee.   I have spoken with Leader McConnell. I have told him that we will let  the committee organizing resolution go forward, but I did put the  majority leader on notice that if the work of the Intelligence and  Armed Services Committees is deemed insufficient or incomplete or  taking too long, this matter may well need to be revisited before the  committee funding resolution comes up in February.   Also, I understand additional information with respect to Russia's  interference in our election will be released in the coming days, and  that could also change our view as to the way we ought to proceed.   I have spoken to the majority leader about these concerns. He  carefully listened, and we will keep a careful eye on how things are  going in the Intelligence and Armed Services Committees with regard to  Russia's interference in the election.    Mr. President, this approach met our needs for the last  three Congresses, and I too would like to see it continue. In addition,  special reserves have been restored to its historic purpose. We should  continue to fund special reserves to the extent possible in order to be  able to assist committees that face urgent, unanticipated, nonrecurring  needs. Recognizing the tight budgets we will face for the foreseeable  future, it is necessary to continue to bring funding authorizations  more in line with our actual resources while ensuring that committees  are able to fulfill their responsibilities. I look forward to  continuing to work with the majority leader to accomplish this.
