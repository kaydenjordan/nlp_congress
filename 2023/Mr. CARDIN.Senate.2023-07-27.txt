 Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 705 and ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, first let me thank Senator Young, my  coauthor of this amendment that deals with our foreign policy being  grounded in our democratic values to fight corruption. I also want to  thank Senator Wicker for his help, particularly in the Helsinki  Commission where this issue was debated.   I also want to thank Senator Menendez and Senator Risch, the chair  and ranking members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. This  bill has been reported out by that committee at least twice by near- unanimous or unanimous votes.   I think we all recognize that corruption provides the fuel for Mr.  Putin and other corrupt leaders to do their nefarious actions,  including the war in Ukraine. It is in our core national security  interests to fight corruption, as has been declared by President Biden.   So this bill patterns the efforts we have made in the trafficking of  persons to have the State Department evaluate the capacity of what  countries are doing to combat corruption using standard evaluations  such as criminalizing corruption, investigating and prosecuting,  adopting measures to prevent corruption, adequate resources, and  protecting victims of corruption.   This amendment will continue the U.S. leadership in fighting  corruption globally. I ask my colleagues to support the amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 705    Mr. President, it is my understanding that we can do this by voice  vote. If that is the case, I ask unanimous consent that the 60-vote  threshold with respect to this amendment be vitiated.    Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to join  me in recognizing July as National Minority Mental Health Month. Since  2008, Congress has declared this month as National Minority Mental  Health Awareness Month in honor of author, journalist and teacher Bebe  Moore Campbell, a national agent of change who passed away in 2006.   Thanks to President Biden, through the 988 Suicide and Crisis  Lifeline, millions of Americans have been able to seek out help with  nearly 5 million calls, texts, and chats that have been answered over  the past year.   Unfortunately, mental health is a subject that often still has stigma  attached to it, even though mental illness touches the lives of  millions of Americans each year.   This month provides an opportunity to bring awareness and recommit us  to tackling longstanding health disparities and improve the public's  awareness of the health challenges that disproportionately affect  racial and ethnic minorities in the United States. Mental illness can  have a devastating impact on an individual's overall health and quality  of life. Racial and ethnic minorities often suffer from poor mental  health outcomes due to multiple factors, including lack of access to  quality mental health care services, cultural stigma surrounding mental  health care, discrimination, and overall lack of awareness about mental  health.   Today, because of historical injustices across our society, including  those in the healthcare system, communities of color continue to face  health disparities that result in poorer quality of life and lower life  expectancies when compared to their White counterparts. For people of  color who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender--LGBT-- these disparities are often exacerbated. In 2021, according to  estimates, only 39 percent of Black or African-American adults, 25  percent of Asian adults, and 36 percent of Hispanic/Latino adults with  any mental illness were treated, compared to 52 percent of non-Hispanic  White adults.   According to the Department of Veterans Affairs' Veterans Health  Administration, American Indian and Alaska Native Veterans report  experiencing posttraumatic stress disorder--PTSD--at double the rate of  non-Hispanic White Veterans--20.5 percent compared to 11.6 percent.   In 2020, suicide was the leading cause of death among Asian Americans  and Pacific Islanders aged 10 to 19; it was the second leading cause of  death among those aged 20 to 34.   Mental illness also has a significant impact on our country's  economy. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-- CDC--the economic cost of mental illness in the United States was more  than $300 billion in 2021. Fewer than half of those in need, however,  receive any mental health care in the United States. This is simply  unacceptable. Stigma, cost, and other barriers, such as limited  capacity in some areas to serve all those in need, prevent many  individuals from receiving necessary mental health care. It is  imperative that we act to improve access to high-quality, evidence- based mental health care services in our country.   Maternal mental health has been an enduring issue that has stricken  women across the Nation. The types of disorders are vast, though the  most common include depression, anxiety, and psychosis. The  consequences of leaving such disorders untreated are dire, as they  impact not only the mother, but her child, and the community, as well.  While all women are potentially susceptible to maternal mental health  disorders, there is an evident disparity in the rates at which certain  racial and ethnic groups are affected. Around one in seven women  suffers specifically from postpartum depression, though mothers of  color possess rates at around 38 percent, nearly double that of White  mothers. Despite this alarming statistic, these mothers of color are  still less likely to receive  [[Page S3744]]  both a diagnosis and treatment for their disorder.   Too many children and their families do not have adequate access to  high-quality specialty child and adolescent behavioral health care.  Child and adolescent psychiatrists practice in a wide range of settings  and further facilitate access to treatment through telehealth and  collaborative care arrangements with primary care providers, schools,  and other systems. And yet, there is still a shortage of inpatient  child and adolescent psychiatric beds. According to the American  Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, there are 1,341,682  children under the age of 18 in Maryland, but only 365 practicing child  and adolescent psychiatrists, or 1 for every 3,676 children. There are  six counties in Maryland that have no child and adolescent  psychiatrists available at all. This is simply unacceptable. Children  should have access to a full array of prevention, early intervention,  and treatment options within all child-facing systems. We need to act  now and improve services with integrated care models, including  collaborative care arrangements.   Several weeks ago, I had the opportunity to tour Brooke's House, a  community-based sober living environment for women in Hagerstown, MD. I  had the pleasure of attending the graduation of a resident who has  completed treatment and is transitioning out of the residential  treatment environment. Brooke's House was the dream of a young Maryland  girl who struggled opioid addiction. It provides a community-based,  safe, stable, and emotionally supportive living environment for adult  women in the early stages of substance abuse recovery. This model of  care ensures a tranquil, home-like facility to provide state-of-the-art  treatment and recovery services with resources to help residents  achieve their dreams of living drug-free and productive lives. This  year, Brooke's House will use an ARC INSPIRE grant to expand support  and engagement services, specifically by hiring a coordinator for a  commercial driver's license--CDL--program to help more women access job  training and placement while in recovery. The addition of this  coordinator will help expand the CDL program to serve 12 participants.   Behavioral health equity is the right of all individuals--regardless  of race, age, ethnicity, gender, disability, socioeconomic status,  sexual orientation, or ZIP Code--to access high-quality and affordable  healthcare support.   I am excited to see reforms such as the SUPPORT Act, enacted in 2018  with overwhelming bipartisan support, which addresses the opioid  epidemic and tackles many aspects of the epidemic, including treatment,  prevention, recovery, and enforcement. This year, we begin work to  reauthorize key programs within the SUPPORT Act. This bipartisan  legislation takes an important step forward in providing additional  tools to battle the opioid crisis. It is imperative we work toward  advancing access to high-quality behavioral health care.   The United States is an ever-changing cultural landscape that shapes  the way we experience diversity. Cultural values and beliefs not only  affect our daily activities, but also influence the way we perceive  physical and emotional distress and the need for interventions to deal  with them. Mental illness is perceived differently by various cultures,  as is the ability to express certain symptoms. Emotional distress and  mental health problems occur in all socio-cultural backgrounds as well  as ages.   Mental illness affects the lives of so many Americans. We have made  great strides as a nation to better support individuals and  communities, which is why we recently celebrated the anniversary of the  988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline. This July, in honor of National  Minority Mental Health Awareness Month, let us commit to continue  working together on both sides of the aisle to improve mental health  care in our country by building on the success of integrated care  models and innovative systems.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Wendy  Sherman, a fellow native Marylander and a distinguished daughter of  Baltimore--and a true friend of mine--as she retires tomorrow from her  position as Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Department of State.   As Deputy Secretary of State since the start of the Biden  administration, Ms. Sherman has been entrusted with handling some of  the most intractable diplomatic engagements our country has to manage.  It is no wonder that one of her senior colleagues in the administration  told the New York Times recently that she is the one most often  deployed to have ``hard conversations in hard places.'' This included a  vital meeting with her Russian counterpart in Geneva in January of 2022  where she delivered the U.S. Government's final warnings to the Kremlin  about the high costs they would incur should they invade Ukraine.   Wendy's early career was built around assisting women who had been  abused and people in poverty, helping them to succeed despite  underprivileged circumstances. The circle of people benefiting from her  sharp intelligence and good heart widened quickly over the years.  Advancing from her early career as a social worker, she became the  executive director of EMILY's List, an important organization for the  advancement of women in American politics, to the director of  Maryland's office of child welfare, and later to become the founding  president of the Fannie Mae Foundation.   Along the way, Ms. Sherman also worked closely with our former  colleague Senator Barbara Mikulski as her chief of staff during her  time in the House of Representatives, and so she worked on many  legislative issues and constituent services that were important for the  people of Maryland.   Ms. Sherman later served during the Clinton administration as an  Assistant Secretary and then counselor at the U.S. Department of State  and then as special adviser to President Bill Clinton and Secretary of  State Madeleine Albright as North Korea policy coordinator. She was  instrumental in negotiations related to North Korea's nuclear weapon  and ballistic missile programs. Wendy directly contributed to our  country's national security, as she secured a deal in which North Korea  agreed not to produce, test, or deploy missiles with a range of more  than 300 miles, preventing North Korea from fielding missiles that  could strike the United States.   Working closely with Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and John  Kerry, Wendy returned to the Department during the Obama administration  and continued her work to further our international goals as Under  Secretary of State for Political Affairs, the fourth-ranking official  in the U.S. Department of State, and the first women to rise to that  rank.   As the lead negotiator for the Iran nuclear deal, Wendy led six  arduous negotiating rounds between Iran and six world powers to reach  consensus on Tehran's nuclear program. As leader of a special task  force following 2012 Benghazi attack, Wendy leveraged her experience to  help implement recommendations to improve protections for Foreign  Service personnel, bolstering the safety and security of our diplomats  serving our countries overseas. For these and many other diplomatic  accomplishments requiring toughness, fortitude, and diplomatic savvy,  she was awarded the National Security Medal by President Barack Obama.   Out of government, Wendy continued to work closely with Madeline  Albright as vice president and senior counselor at Albright Stonebridge  Group, before returning to the national security sector again in her  present capacity.   Wendy has further leveraged her diplomatic experience to the benefit  of academia and the nonprofit world, serving as professor of the  practice of public leadership and director of the Center for Public  Leadership at the Harvard's Kennedy School. She was also a senior  fellow at the School's Belfer Center for Science and International  Affairs. She has served on the President's Intelligence Advisory Board,  as chair of the Board of Directors of Oxfam America, and on the DOD's  Defense Policy Board and the Congressional Commission on the Prevention  of Weapons of Mass Destruction, Proliferation, and Terrorism. Through  these diverse roles, Wendy has helped to not only shape the next  generation of diplomats and foreign affairs professionals, but the  future of diplomacy.   This month, Wendy Sherman retires as one of the most accomplished  diplomats in American history. Wendy will be missed by me and by her  wide circle of professional colleagues and admirers. I have no doubt  that she will continue to impart her wisdom and experience even as she  returns to the private sector.   Wendy Sherman is the embodiment of a fine public servant and a true  stateswoman, by turns persuasive and toughminded as the situation calls  for, inspiring future generations to follow in her footsteps. I wish  her all the best for her future endeavors.                            ____________________
