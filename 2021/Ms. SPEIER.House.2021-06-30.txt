 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   My heart is racing right now, and I am trembling, in part because I  am recalling what happened to me on January 6, when I was in that  gallery and had to climb around the other side and then lie there on  the floor. Then, I heard a shot ring out, and it took me back over 40  years ago, lying on an airstrip in Guyana about to lose my life. I  thought, at that moment: My God, I survived Guyana, but I am not going  to survive this, in the house of democracy in the country in which I  was born.   For the Members on the other side of the aisle to call this  political, let me remind you, it was political because the President of  the United States at the time thought it was fun and an act of great  patriotism to come up here and try to overturn the election.   So, you may call it political; it was political. But we are going to  find out why it happened, and we are going to make sure it never  happens again.
