 Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Steube) having assumed the chair, Mr. Gimenez, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4820)  making appropriations for the Departments of Transportation, and  Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 2024, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend for the amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the fact that the safety of  individuals who sleep in single-gender shelters is of the utmost  importance. It doesn't mean provisions cannot be provided elsewhere for  other individuals, but in this case, we need to ensure that people are  both comfortable in their surroundings and are protected as they are  coming out of difficult situations.   The proposal also puts burdens on religious organizations who might  feel differently about gender identity than the current administration.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Self) having assumed the chair, Mr. Smucker, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4820)  making appropriations for the Departments of Transportation, and  Housing and Urban Development, and related agencies for the fiscal year  ending September 30, 2024, and for other purposes, had come to no  resolution thereon.                            ____________________
