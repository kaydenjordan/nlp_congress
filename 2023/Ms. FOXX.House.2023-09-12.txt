 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize America's 3.5  million truckers during National Truck Driver Appreciation Week.   Truckers are the unsung heroes of our supply chain. Each year they  drive over 320 billion miles--the equivalent of nearly 13 million trips  around the globe--to deliver 11.5 billion tons of freight.   Every one of those miles represents a stocked store shelf, a package  placed on a household doorstep, materials delivered to a manufacturer,  and equipment conveyed to a construction site.   I am proud of America's dedicated truckers, including the 66,830  professional drivers in North Carolina. Today, 23 North Carolinians  from the trucking industry are on Capitol Hill sharing their stories.   Additionally, a North Carolina driver with over 2 million accident- free miles is demonstrating a simulator to staffers and my colleagues  to share the perspectives of truckers.   I look forward to thanking these individuals in person for the work  they do.                             Bowman Middle School     Madam Speaker, I recently had the pleasure of visiting  Bowman Middle School in Mitchell County to view the school's  International Space Station, ISS, contact project.   Thanks to the diligent work of Dan Hopson, a STEM teacher at the  school who has a penchant for securing these kinds of opportunities,  this project was able to come to fruition. Students were able to ask a  variety of questions in real time via ham radio to Warren Hoburg, a  NASA astronaut who successfully traveled to the ISS on March 3 of this  year.   This impressive event was one that these students will surely  remember as they continue their educational journeys. Hopefully, some  will be inspired to engage in careers in STEM areas.   Congratulations to Dan Hopson, Principal extraordinaire Amber Young,  and the dedicated staff at Bowman Middle School who made this event and  this learning opportunity such a success.                            ____________________
