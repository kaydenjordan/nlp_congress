 Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me  time.   Mr. Chairman, once again we are on the House floor debating ocean  planning. The reality is that comprehensive ocean planning works. We  have done it in Rhode Island, and we have done it throughout the  Northeast region. Ocean planning is a success because it brings  everyone to the table. Everyone is part of the dialogue and the  conversation.   The process forces cooperation and compromise by, again, opening  dialogue among fishermen, scientists, boaters, and others.   There is an impression, by the way, from some of my colleagues that  ocean planning is a Federal land grab of the oceans. Well, it is  anything but. It is about local control done at the regional level-- something many of my colleagues across the aisle often like to support.   Mr. Chairman, we can't turn back the clock on our oceans by allowing  this rider to remain in the bill. We have come too far. I want to  commend the work of the sponsors of this amendment. I also want to  commend my colleague, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, across the aisle, who  has done so much work to preserve the oceans, including creating the  National Endowment for the Oceans Act.    Mr. Chairman, in the past we have driven species to the point of  extension, destroyed natural habitat, and driven our oceans to the  brink. I implore my colleagues not to take us back to that era. Please  support this amendment and support ocean planning.
