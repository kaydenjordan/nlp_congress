 Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the MVP. They  call it the Mountain Valley Pipeline; I call it the most valuable  pipeline we have to offer energy to the people of America.   It has been under tow for a long time. I brought some illustrations  of what we are going through because my good friend from Virginia, the  Senator from Virginia who just spoke--and we respectfully disagree on  this--this is something we have worked on for an awful long time.   First, I want to make sure everybody understands that you cannot get  permission to move forward on a pipeline, transmission line, anything  you want in this country, unless there is a market for it. You have to  show that there is a person or a group or a market that this product-- whether it is electricity on transmission lines or gas in the pipelines  or oil or whatever, there has to be a market. You can't go from here to  there and try to build a market. So there has to be a need. There has  to be a need. If there is going to be a need in the market, then it  starts proceeding, and then it goes through the process.   This was started over 8 years ago, going through that process. I  don't think there is another permit that has ever been more  scrutinized--or a request for a permit--than this Mountain Valley  Pipeline.   It is the Mountain Valley Pipeline. We will call it the MVP. FERC has  approved the MVP three times--not one time, three times--basically,  over 8 years of review. It started with the Obama administration, went  through the Trump administration, and now into the Biden  administration. And we are as desperate for the fuel today as we are.   Let's look at the people and basically where the need is. This  pipeline is 42 inches. It takes the most oil shale. First of all, it  goes into an area that basically is deprived of natural resources  themselves. Let me tell you some of the areas we are going to be able  to serve in a direct and indirect way. Our military bases in North  Carolina and South Carolina are in desperate need.   There was another pipeline coming out of the same shale of gas called  the Atlantic Coast Pipeline that went on for years. It went on for  years and was finally scrubbed because the price got so exorbitant that  there was no way to continue, and they could not get through the  litigation that went on for years. After about $6 or $7 billion,  Dominion Energy basically pulled the plug on it. They couldn't do it.   So when they tell you that everything is fine and they did all this,  wherever there were problems, they are sent back. If someone doesn't  like this or that, they send it back. They went through it three times.  Now, when FERC goes through it, it is a pretty arduous process. They  look into everything. And if the courts basically say look at this,  then they do that, and they correct that and send it back, and they  find something else.   Wouldn't you think that they would see it all the first time if they  saw any problems whatsoever that needed corrected?   So, as I said, it has been thoroughly vetted for 8 years by the Obama  and Trump and Biden administrations, and eight NEPA reviews. Anyone who  has gone through any NEPA review knows how difficult that can be. Eight  times NEPA has reviewed this. There are six environmental impact  studies. The environmental impact studies can go from 1 to 3 years. Six  times, it went back to them.   So when anyone thinks this has not been scrutinized and has not  basically gone through every Agency that it was required to go through  and had every review done that possibly could be done, they would be  mistaken, if you see just the outline of things.   Three rounds of permitting were approved by FERC. They approved all  of them. It still wasn't good enough. It still wasn't good enough. It  went through the courts and back it came. It went through the courts  and back it came. The Forest Service, the Bureau of Land Management,  and Fish and Wildlife, they all went through it. Everybody had a good  look at this thing.   Now we have a situation where if you looked at Winter Storm Elliott  in December of 2022, the Carolinas have the highest natural gas prices  in the country--$50 to $60 per million Btu--$50 to $60 dollars.  Normally, in the Appalachian Basin, that is anywhere from $2.50 to $6  dollars to where it stays. But because they did not have the product  and the demand was so high, the people are getting gouged.   You tell me of an average family or a hard-working family who can  afford $50 or $60 per million Btu. It is 10 times the normal rate.   So is there a need? Absolutely, there is a need. Is there basically a  need for pricing that is stabilized and helps people get through tough  times and helps them take care of their family and home and also the  job they work in? Absolutely. So you have that.   Duke Energy says the MVP will save 4.5 million customers $3 billion  over 25 years. Duke Energy is a very large power company within North  Carolina, and they are saying that we don't have that product. We need  this product. They were counting on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline to get  that product. That didn't happen. Now we are counting on MVP.   But guess who gets gouged? Everybody talks about big business and  companies and this and that. But 4.5 million customers--that is who is  going to pay the price.   When you talk about price, let's talk about this. This line, when  they started on this pipeline, there was an approximate cost of $3.5  billion to build it. We are over $6.6 billion now. Who do you think is  going to pay that price? It is going to be paid by the customers who  need the product. They are paying $50 to $60 per million Btu, and they  should be paying $4 to $6, in that range there, and I guarantee you the  savings would be tremendously supportive to their families.   So as we have talked, we had a lot going on here, a lot of different  conversations. There is a new Summit View Business Park in Franklin  County in southwest Virginia. It is struggling to attract businesses to  that park that would create opportunities and jobs for the hard-working  people in southwest Virginia, just like all of West Virginia. They  cannot attract or furnish the energy at the plant that the park needs  to attract the different industries that would like to come. So for  economic development, just having a job, taking care of your family,  and living in beautiful southwest Virginia, they don't have that  opportunity now.   In North Carolina, Cumberland County and Fayette have lost out on $1  billion of investment because the businesses cannot afford the high  price of gas. And we have an abundance of it in  [[Page S1881]]  West Virginia and Pennsylvania and coming out of the eastern part of  Ohio. We are willing to share it and put it in the market and keep the  prices where they should be--affordable.   So the review process which has been incredibly thorough and rigorous  with eight NEPA reviews, six environmental impact statements, two  environmental assessments, three rounds of review by the same Federal  Agencies--FERC, Fish and Wildlife, Forest Service, and BLM--and that is  a mighty lift in itself. It has been before the court numerous times-- nine times, to be exact--nine times before the courts. When does it  stop? When does it stop? The cost has ballooned, as I said, and doubled  in price, and here we are.   Now, you would think that we are just trying to get this line  started. It is going to be 303 miles. But guess what: 283 miles are  already built. It is already laid in the ground.   Now, they said there have been violations because there is  sedimentation going on, and they didn't go back and reseed. They  weren't allowed to because of the court actions that prohibited them  from getting back on the property. It is a catch-22. They could not  reclaim what they wanted to reclaim because they were taken to court  and stopped, and then they were brought to task again for not  reclaiming it.   If we pass this piece of legislation, within 6 months this line will  be in production. We only have 20 miles to go. That would put 2,500  people to work--2,500 people to work.   About $40 to $50 million annually will be coming to the States of  West Virginia and some to Virginia, as it passes through. There is  about $200 to $250 million that will go to individuals who own their  gas rights that are being sold and put into the line. That is every  year. That is tremendous support for the poorest parts of our country.  In the poorest parts of our country, the people are finally able to  sell what they own, their resources, and to help stabilize the prices  or help all people in the States that are affected.    There is $1.2 billion in additional investment to complete the  project. We have tried everything humanly possible. We really have. I  just couldn't believe that we couldn't get this to work after what  happened to the previous lines they were trying to build to bring  product to the marketplace.   So there is all different people who are upset. I understand that. My  good friend from Virginia, my Senate friend--we were co-Governors  together and our families are very close. This doesn't affect our  relationship, our friendship, and it doesn't affect, basically, us  fighting for many of the same causes. But it brings a healthy  discussion: Are we going to move forward in this country? Are we going  to have permit reform? Are we going to be able to build the necessary  transmission that it takes?   I am talking about powerlines. They are the same. If anything, it  takes longer for a powerline, for pipelines. Everything is being  stopped now. It is not that they are protesting the pipe itself. They  are protesting basically the product in the pipe, the gas.   Now, there is a transition going on in energy throughout the  country--a transition throughout the world, to a certain extent--but we  still cannot run our country without the gas, without the oil, without  the coal that we need for dispatch. That means 24/7. Just gas and coal  itself is over 60 percent of the energy we use.   In this system here, right where we are in this beautiful Capitol,  this is a PJM system, which they call it, and it is basically what this  is all about. It is basically ``all of the above.'' It is wind, solar.  It is coal. It is gas. It is everything that gives the reliability  that, when you turn that switch on, you are going to have lights. When  you turn the heat on, you are going to be warm. When you turn this air  conditioner on, you are going to have comfort. When you cook your food,  you are going to be able to do it. That is what we are able to do in  America.   And as that transitions, there will be a transition into new  technology that will replace an awful lot of what we are talking about.  But we are a long way away from that, and to deprive people who need  this for their livelihood, to deprive them and make them pay 10 times  more for a product that is abundant--it would be different if the Good  Lord didn't give us the resources. But it is a shame and a sin that we  don't use the resources we have to help all humankind. That is what we  are talking about.   And if you look at the process we have just gone through and where we  are right now and what we embark on this evening, we will probably be  here most of the night, I would say, going through the amendments.  Everybody has to have their say. I agree. But we have come to the  reality and we have been here long enough understanding that this piece  of legislation that we have before us has to pass. The Mountain Valley  Pipeline is in that piece of legislation. It still has some review  processes. We are not asking for that. We are asking, basically, that  the things that have been done multiple times proceed on--that it  proceeds on. That is all we are asking for.   But with that, when you think about 3 or 4 months ago, we started  talking seriously about the debt ceiling. We have got to address the  debt ceiling. That is our responsibility to address it and make sure  the full faith and credit of this country and the value of us having  the reserve currency of the world is stable--that it is stable.   If we pass an amendment or any amendment--this amendment my dear  friend is going to introduce or any amendment--we will default. It is  as simple as that. We will default.   Now, it would be different if this had not gone through 8 years of  scrutiny, in court nine times, been looked at any way and every way,  shape, and form. That would be a different thing--if no one has ever  seen anything, if we are trying to slide something through. That is not  the case here. No one can accuse that of happening.   So we are in the process right now of trying to move forward in this  country to get the energy that we need, that we have. It is  unbelievable to me when the people were thinking sometime: Well, maybe  we will have Iran produce more oil. Maybe we will have Venezuela  produce more.   We have it in our backyard, and we can't produce it ourselves? We  want someone else to do the work that we won't do for ourselves? That  is ridiculous.   You can't lead that way. You can't have the rest of the world looking  at you as the superpower of the world that won't do for yourself  because you don't like something. We found ways through innovation, not  elimination, to do it better. And we can help the rest of the world,  and we can help the global climate because of this if we work together.   But I can assure you that what we have today before us is a product  that is going to help an awful lot of people--4.5 million just in one  State that depends on this product to give them some relief and are  paying the highest prices. They are already at the highest prices in  the country except for the Northeast.   So I would say there is so much at risk right now. If we move forward  and we pass this amendment that would go on this bill, that would have  to go back to the House with us not defaulting. We cannot take that  risk.   I would ask my colleagues--all of my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle--instead of what we are doing, consider basically the value that  this product brings. Consider also the reviews this product has gone  through, and I think you will find it more than adequate and more than  comforting that, basically, we have a product that is going to do an  awful lot of good for America, an awful lot of good for humankind in  the States. And, also, this will backfill and also help us toward where  we are sending LNG to our allies around the world. There are so many  benefits from 2 billion cubic feet a day--2 billion. Two billion cubic  feet a day will go through this line, helping America to be energy  independent.   So I encourage all of my colleagues to vote respectfully against the  amendment that will be offered to strip this out of the bill.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I also rise in opposition. For eight  years--eight years--and three administrations this project has been  under review. Eight times NEPA--eight times of NEPA reviews. Three  times through every Agency. This has been reviewed more than anything  in the United States of America. The people in this eastern,  southeastern part of the country, especially in the Carolinas, are  paying sometimes 10 times more for gas because of the shortages during  severe weather.   This is critical for the people of this country. If you believe in  energy security, if you believe in energy independence, and you believe  that we should be the superpower of the world, this helps us do that.  It puts more product in the market than anything that we have  available. This will be up and running in 6 months--6 months. Already,  293 miles are already built. We only have 20 more miles to go to finish  it. It is time to finish this project.   Please vote no on this, an amendment by my friend, who I respectfully  disagree with.                          Vote on Amendment No. 101    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question now occurs on agreeing to  amendment No. 101.
