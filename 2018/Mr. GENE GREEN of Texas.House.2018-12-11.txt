 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6140. This bill is an effort  to accelerate the availability of high-assay low-enriched uranium, the  fuel needed for most advanced nuclear designs.   There is no existing commercial market for this fuel, so in order to  ensure that the fuel is available for advanced reactors once they are  licensed and ready to begin producing electricity, the Federal  Government will need to coordinate efforts among agencies, and with the  commercial nuclear sector, to ensure that high-assay low-enriched  uranium can be licensed and safely transported.   You wouldn't buy a lawnmower if you couldn't buy gas to run it.  Similarly, we need to develop a domestic market for fuel needed to  power these advanced nuclear reactor projects that are coming onto the  market in the next decade.   I thank my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee, both  Representative Flores and Representative McNerney, for developing this  thoughtful proposal.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney), one of the  cosponsors of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7217, the IMPROVE Act.  This legislation contains several important policies related to  Medicaid and Medicare.   First, I am a proud original cosponsor of the ACE Kids Act, and I am  happy to see it included in H.R. 7217. The ACE Kids Act aims to improve  care coordination for children with complex medical conditions served  by Medicaid.   The legislation creates a Medicaid health home, State optional,  specifically targeted for this population of children. It also requires  the Secretary to issue best practices on coordinating out-of-State care  for children with complex medical conditions.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsors of the ACE Kids Act, Representative  Castor and Congressman Barton, both members of the Energy and Commerce  Committee, for championing this issue for so many years.   The IMPROVE Act also provides new funding for the Money Follows the  Person, the MFP, program. The MFP program helps individuals transition  from institutional care to care in their community, where they can live  more independent lives.   MFP also helps support States' home and community-based services  infrastructure. Without this extension funding, we would start to see  many of these MFP programs end in short order.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the program, which provides thousands  of Americans with the choice to receive services in their home or  community rather than in an institution.                                time  1245    The committee will continue to work on providing long-term funding to  the MFP program in the next Congress.   I also voice my support for the extension of spousal impoverishment  protections until April 2019. These protections will help ensure that a  person can maintain enough income and assets to meet their basic living  expenses while still allowing for their spouse to receive long-term  care in their home or community under Medicaid.   The expiration of this policy would lead to people losing their long- term care services and the unnecessary institutionalization of people  currently  [[Page H10048]]  receiving services in their homes or communities. The committee will  continue to work on a long-term solution in the next Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support passage of H.R. 7217,  the IMPROVE Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor), a cosponsor of the ACE Kids Act  and a great member of our Energy and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell), another member of the Energy  and Commerce Committee.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch), another good member of our Energy  and Commerce Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Schrader), a colleague from our committee.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have left?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think this is how we need to work together, and this  is a good example of not only inter-State but also inter-party, to be  able to solve these three problems that this bill corrects. I hope the  next Congress will continue that effort of Republicans and Democrats  talking to each other, Texans talking to Oklahomans, which is sometimes  tough, to work together for the people we represent.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2465, the Sickle Cell Disease  and Other Heritable Blood Disorders Research, Surveillance, Prevention,  and Treatment Act.   This legislation will reauthorize the Sickle Cell Disease Treatment  Demonstration Program at HRSA. This program enhances the prevention and  treatment of sickle cell through coordination of service delivery,  genetic counseling, testing, training of health professionals, and  other related efforts.   The program is particularly important since individuals with sickle  cell disease need comprehensive treatment throughout their lives in  order to manage their symptoms and prevent their disease from  worsening.   Over 100,000 Americans are living with sickle cell disease today.  Each will need access to robust network providers with the knowledge  and skills to treat this condition.  [[Page H10054]]    This is especially important now, for far too many individuals with  sickle cell are unable to get the care they need, particularly those  who present at emergency departments with intense pain associated with  a sickle cell crisis.   In addition to reauthorizing that program, this bill would expand the  activities related to sickle cell and other heritable blood disorders  by strengthening surveillance and other public health efforts as well  as encouraging more research into these health conditions.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Representative  Danny Davis,  Representative G.K. Butterfield, and Representative Burgess for their  leadership on this issue.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support S. 2465, which will  allow HHS to invest critical resources into research, surveillance, and  public health initiatives of sickle cell disease as well as other  heritable blood disorders. These investments will help bolster the  sickle cell workforce and improve treatments for sickle cell patients  of all ages.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1330     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 3029, the Prematurity Research  Expansion and Education for Mothers Who Deliver Infants Early, or  PREEMIE, Reauthorization Act of 2018.   Over the past 3 years, the preterm birth rate in the United States  worsened, placing more mothers and babies at risk. Such preterm births  are the largest contributors to infant death in the United States and,  for those infants who survive, a major cause of long-term health  problems throughout their lives.   While this preterm rate in the U.S. is 9.93 percent, mothers and  infants in Texas are at even greater risk. In fact, in 2017, the most  recent year for which data is available, 10.6 percent of live births  were born preterm. The percentage is even greater for African American  mothers and infants at 13.6 percent, a rate that is 39 percent higher  than the rate among all women in Texas.   This legislation would help combat those negative trends by  continuing support for federally supported activities that prevent  premature births, such as research and programs at the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention, as well as activities that promote  healthy pregnancies and preventing preterm birth at the Health  Resources and Services Administration.   This reauthorization legislation also requires such efforts to  address the determinants that contribute to the health disparities in  preterm birth.   I thank Representative Eshoo and Representative Lance for their  leadership on this issue.   I encourage my colleagues to support S. 6085 to extend and expand  Federal efforts to prevent and address preterm birth.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo), the cosponsor  of this bill and a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee and the  Health Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis).    Mr. Speaker, we have no further speakers on  this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6615, the Traumatic Brain  Injury Program Reauthorization Act of 2018, introduced by  Representative Pascrell and Representative  Thomas Rooney. This  legislation would reauthorize funding for Administration for Community  Living's Traumatic Brain Injury Program, TBI, to fiscal year 2024.   The TBI program provides grants to States to support activities, such  as improving screening to identify individuals with TBI, building a  trained TBI workforce, providing resources to families, and funding  protection and advocacy systems for people with TBI.   H.R. 6615 will also reauthorize programs at the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention to increase the incidence of traumatic brain  injury and reduce the prevalence of TBI. These programs are important  in improving our understanding of traumatic brain injury, and our  ability to prevent and treat such injuries.   Recently, the CDC released new diagnostic guidelines focused on  treating children with mild TBI and concussions, largely based on  research and surveillance efforts funded by CDC's traumatic brain  injury program.   Finally, this legislation also will reauthorize a new National  Concussion Surveillance System to determine the prevalence and the  incidence of concussions in the U.S. This is particularly important for  improving our understanding of long-term consequences of concussions,  as well as efforts to prevent, diagnose, and treat concussions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6615, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), the cosponsor  of this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and  I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1318, the  Preventing Maternal Deaths Act, sponsored by Representatives Jaime  Herrera Beutler and Diana DeGette.   This is an important first step to addressing the maternal mortality  crisis that is claiming the lives of too many new mothers in our  country. Hundreds of women die each year from pregnancy-related and  pregnancy-associated complications in the U.S. More than 60 percent of  these deaths are preventable.   The Preventing Maternal Deaths Act encourages States to implement  maternal mortality review committees that track maternal deaths and  identify their underlying causes. Together, the data generated by these  review committees will help experts identify trends, patterns, and  disparities that contribute to preventable maternal deaths in order to  save lives in the future.   It is shocking that the maternal mortality rate in the United States  has increased while in most of the rest of the developed world it has  fallen. It is also shocking that women of color, low-income women, and  women in rural areas are disproportionately more likely to face  pregnancy-related complications. This must change.   But in order to reverse this unconscionable trend, we must have the  necessary data so providers can monitor their practices and improve  their care delivery.   The mortality rate is a critical indicator of the quality of our  healthcare system, as well as how we prioritize women's health in this  country. While much more work still must be done, including improving  access to care, I am proud to support this bill and believe it will set  us on a path to understanding why women are dying and how we can stop  it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers. I  thank both Congresswoman DeGette and Congresswoman Herrera Beutler for  bringing this issue to our committee and also to the House.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a positive vote today, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
