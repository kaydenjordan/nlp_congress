 Mr. Speaker, when I was a little boy, I used to read  comic books, and one of them I read was Superman. In the Superman comic  books, way back in the 1960s, Superman had an alterego that lived on  Bizarro World.                                time  1615    In Bizarro World, everything was a little bit off-kilter. When I  listen to my sincerely good friends on the minority side, I think they  are on Bizarro World. I know they mean well, but they are not seeing  the same planet I am seeing.   I have told this story a number of times about my brother John at the  age of 40 having liver cancer. He had exhausted all conventional  therapy. He was given less than 3 months to live.   Being a Member of Congress and on the Energy and Commerce Committee,  I had access to the National Institutes of Health and the FDA. I  called, and I said: Are there any experimental programs that you could  get my brother into that might help him?   They checked, and they had a clinical trial, I believe, in San  Antonio, Texas. We called down, and they got him into it. But they told  him: This is experimental. It has helped a lot of people so far, but it  doesn't help everybody. And if it doesn't help you, it accelerates your  disease.   He and his wife prayed about it, and his mother and myself and his  brother and sister, and we all decided, why not?   They put John in the trial, and it didn't help him, but we were at  peace because we had used every available remedy that we could to try  to help him.   This bill--which has passed the Senate, and if we pass it today, it  goes to the President and it is going to be signed this week--gives  patients, if their doctors approve, the right to try.   It has to be an investigational drug that is in an FDA clinical trial  that has passed phase one, which has proved that it is nontoxic.   It gives them the right to try. There is no downside to this. This  could become law. It would give a statutory right to try at the Federal  level.   Why in the world my friends on the minority side have a problem  with--it passed the Senate unanimously, which means, under the current  Senate, 49 Democrats voted for it by a voice vote.   There is no downside to it. The FDA is still in control of what drugs  are passed through this phase one clinical trial. And the doctor has to  recommend it, and the patient has to accept it.   So I hope we will vote ``yes.''    Mr. Speaker, the bill has already passed the House on a  bipartisan vote. I think I am right that it passed with 261 votes the  last time we sent it.   The House bill is a little bit better bill than the Senate, but the  Senate bill is better than no bill. So please vote ``yes'' when the  time comes this afternoon.
