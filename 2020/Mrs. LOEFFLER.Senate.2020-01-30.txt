 I send a question to the desk on behalf of myself and  Senators Hawley, Cruz, Perdue, Gardner, Lankford, Hoeven, Toomey, Scott  of Florida, Portman, and Fischer.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Loeffler and the other Senators is for the  counsel of the President:         As reported by Politico, ``in January 1999, then-Sen Joe       Biden argued strongly against deposing additional witnesses       or seeking new evidence in a memo sent to fellow Democrats       ahead of Bill Clinton's impeachment trial.'' Politico reports       that Sen Schumer agreed with Biden. Why should the Biden rule       not apply here?    Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, in a  memorandum dated January 5, 1999, that is captioned ``Arguments in  Support of Summary Impeachment Trial,'' Senator Biden discussed some  history first regarding two Senate impeachment proceedings that were  put forward in the Senate that were summarily decided. This is what he  said:         These two cases demonstrate that the Senate may dismiss       articles of impeachment without holding a full trial or       taking any evidence. Put another way, the Constitution does       not impose on the Senate the duty to hold a trial. In fact,       the Senate need not hold a trial even though the House wishes       to present evidence and hold a full trial (Blount) and the       elements of jurisdiction are present (English).    He went on to say:         In a number of previous impeachment trials, the Senate has       reached the judgment in its constitutional role as sole trier       of impeachments does not require it to take new evidence or       hear live witness testimony.        This follows from the Senate's consideration of motions for       summary disposition in at least three trials [and it listed       the three trials of Judges Ritter, Claiborne, and Nixon]. In       each, the Senate considered a motion for summary disposition       on the merits and in no case did the Senate decline to       consider a motion for summary disposition as beyond the       Senate's authority or as forbidden by the Constitution.    The Framers did not mean that this political process was to be a  partisan process. Instead, they meant it to be political in the higher  sense. The process was to be conducted in the way that would best  secure the public interest or, in their phrase, the ``general  welfare.'' That was the Biden doctrine of impeachment proceedings.   Now, some Members in this Chamber agreed with that. Some Members that  serve on the--as managers also agreed with that. But now the rules are  different. The rules are different because Manager Schiff just moments  ago did what he is now famous for and created a conversation,  purportedly from the President of the United States, regarding Russia  hacking of Burisma. And it is the same thing he did when he started his  hearings.   So this is a common practice. But if we want to look at common  practice and common procedures, the Biden rule is one. I would like to  address something else because we have heard it time and time again  about two judges have decided this issue of executive privilege. I want  to address two things very quickly.   My very first case at the Supreme Court of the United States--and it  was a long time ago, over 30--over 30 years ago, 33 years ago. My  client lost in the district court. They said: Well, we will appeal to  the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. We went to the Ninth Circuit Court  of Appeals, was not so successful and did not win there either. My  client said: Well, what do we do?   I said: We have one option. We can file a petition for certiorari to  the Supreme Court of the United States. Chances are they are not going  to take the case. But at this point, it is an important issue to you,  so why don't we proceed. My client agreed to proceed.   A petition for certiorari was granted, and the Court reversed 9 to 0.  And that is why you continue to utilize courts when appropriate. That  is why you do it. And you don't rely on what a district court judge  says.  [[Page S737]]    The last thing I want to say, they are asking you, as a Senate body,  to waive executive privilege on the President of the United States.  Think about that for a moment. They are asking you to vote to determine  or have the Chief Justice in his individual capacity as Presiding Judge  vote to waive executive privilege as it relates to the President of the  United States. And that is what they think is the appropriate role for  this proceeding to continue. I think you should adopt the Biden rule.    Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Colorado.
