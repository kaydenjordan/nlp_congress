 Mr. Speaker, what is going on with regard to the  attempted coup on a United States President is really outrageous. It is  playing out now in the House of Representatives.   I am on the Judiciary Committee, as are other friends.   Andy Biggs-- who just addressed us--our friend,   Andy Harris, and others went down  to the SCIF where there is supposedly a hearing going on about  impeachment. I was not allowed in, nor were the others with me who are  Members of Congress.   We were told: No, you are not allowed in.   I asked: Who gave that order? Because until a vote is held on the  rules to change the rules of precedent, it goes through the Judiciary  Committee. They couldn't explain.   They said: Well, our staff boss says an elected Member of Congress  cannot go sit in on a hearing like that.   It is outrageous. They couldn't say who said it. It is outrageous.  This coup needs to stop now.                            ____________________
