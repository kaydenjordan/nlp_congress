 Madam Speaker, I am honored to have been able to vote  ``yes'' last week for the American Rescue Plan Act and join my House  colleagues in sending this critically important legislation to the  Senate.   It is past time that we enact bold relief that delivers critical  resources to individuals, families, and communities throughout our  Nation so that we can get back to work and past this health crisis.   I am pleased that this legislation includes vital health care  provisions to support community vaccination sites, scale up testing and  tracing, and address care disparities.   Further, this legislation includes significant resources to assist  schools in reopening. We must continue to do all we can to support our  intrepid teachers and the critical work that they are doing in this  challenging time to engage students and prepare them with the life  skills they need for their career endeavors.   Madam Speaker, the momentum is on our side to defeat this virus. I  encourage my Senate colleagues to take the next step in approving this  legislation as soon as possible so that we can provide all of our  communities and our valiant essential workers with the resources they  need.                            ____________________
