 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, notwithstanding what we sometimes hear  about a deadlocked Washington, there are times when both parties work  together. Three months ago, Republicans and Democrats came together,  and we reached a bipartisan budget agreement. Republicans and Democrats  together reached an agreement to lift the budget caps and provide  relief from sequestration but, most importantly, to make responsible  and new investments in the American people over the next 2 years. Then,  President Trump, as he stated earlier that he would do if we reached  that agreement, signed it into law.   But now, even though he signed it into law and even though the  agreement had been worked out with Republicans, Democrats, and the  White House together, the President has proposed--and, unfortunately,  House Republicans have drawn up a proposal--to claw back vital funding  for children's healthcare, to claw back funding for rural communities,  to take back funding for our infrastructure programs, and to take back  funding for law enforcement.   These programs from which the White House and, apparently, their  allies in the House want to raid the money aren't Democratic  priorities. They are bipartisan, American priorities. Ivanka Trump has  said that American families need relief. The policies that allow women  with children to thrive shouldn't be just for a press conference or a  photo opportunity. They should be the norm.   President Trump's proposal would claw back $7 billion from the  Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. If you can't keep a child  healthy, what are they going to be like as an adult? CHIP currently  provides health insurance for 8.7 million vulnerable children from low- income families. Millions of families from red States and blue States,  urban and rural, depend on CHIP to keep their children healthy and  happy and to make them the healthy and happy future generation. I don't  know how pulling $7 billion out of this program aligns with the  policies to allow children to thrive and to say that should be the  norm. You can't say at a press opportunity: This will be the norm--to  allow children to thrive--but oh, by the way, we are going to take back  the money to make that work. And if the money can no longer be  dedicated to the CHIP program, well, then reinvest it in other  important programs as we have done in the past--programs that support  our Nation's children and families, including Head Start, the Child  Care and Development Block Grant Program, opioid prevention, and  cutting-edge research at NIH.   The President's proposal also takes away $159 million from our law  enforcement. I began my career in law enforcement. I can't understand  taking $159 million from law enforcement. The President claims that he  is going to ``support our police like our police have never been  supported before.'' This week is National Police Week. Today, May 15,  is designated as National Peace Officers Memorial Day. This is when we  pause to thank and recognize our Nation's law enforcement officers for  their important work and those officers who sacrificed their  [[Page S2660]]  lives. How does cutting $159 million in resources support our law  enforcement?   Then the President's proposal will claw back $462 million from  infrastructure programs. The President has tweeted often that our  infrastructure will, again, be the best in the world--the greatest in  the world, he tweets. A tweet doesn't cost anything, but if you are  going to match your actions and your words, it may cost something. It  doesn't help if you are going to take almost half a billion dollars out  of our infrastructure at the same time that you are saying and tweeting  that we are going to make it the best in the world.   He said he is going to cut $252 million that is meant to combat  infectious diseases that threaten the United States and threaten  millions of Americans who travel, work, serve, and study abroad. Just  last week, there were confirmed cases of the Ebola virus in the  Democratic Republic of the Congo. This is not a fight we should be  retreating from.   We shouldn't say we will stop money to fight infectious diseases but  then we send our soldiers abroad. We send our Peace Corps abroad. We  send our diplomats abroad, and Americans travel abroad. We have  students who go abroad. Don't retreat from that fight.   The United States will not be ready to face the flu pandemic until it  improves its vaccines, its healthcare infrastructure, and its  coordination with other countries--all of which we are told are top  priorities for the White House, according to a National Security  Council official who said on Monday:         Influenza is a priority to the White House, and represents       both a health security and a national security threat. Today,       however, we cannot respond with the speed that we need to.    This is probably because of the large number of deaths of Americans  inside the United States during the last flu season. But what do they  do? They cut back a quarter of a billion dollars meant to combat  infectious diseases. The photo op where they say that we are against  these kinds of infections in the United States looks good. Nobody is  going to disagree with being against it. I hope my colleagues will  disagree with cutting out the money we need to carry out the  President's promise.   Then, there is the proposal to claw back $1 billion meant to invest  in our rural communities. Almost 2 months ago, in about March--it seems  so long ago--Secretary Perdue testified before the Senate that  ``prosperity in rural America is particularly vital, not just for the  rural communities we love, that many of us call home, but also for our  entire Nation.'' I agree with Secretary Perdue. Many of us do call  rural communities home. My own town has 1,800 people in it. I love it,  so I agree with him, but whether it is a rural community in my State or  any of the 50 States, we don't invest in their prosperity, as the  administration has promised, if we strip $1 billion in resources from  them.    In fact, the President's promises this will not be his last proposal.  He is going to send another package in the coming weeks that would  attack the foundation of the bipartisan agreement--an agreement  Republicans and Democrats reached in Congress and was signed into law  by the President. He is going to go back on that, adding even more  rescissions.   I am sure he is looking at the deficit. The President's tax giveaway  to billionaires and corporations increased our Nation's deficit by $1.9  trillion. According to the CBO, the rescission bill the House will  debate next week will save only $1 billion--a tiny, tiny fraction of  what has been given away to billionaires and corporations.   The President's actions should match his words. He says ``America  First,'' but then just in the last few days, he has gone out of his way  to fight to save jobs, but they are Chinese jobs. I would rather he  fight to save jobs in our State. I wish that rather than spending his  time fighting to save Chinese jobs, the President would work to save  American jobs. We have people who could use jobs in our country. Let  China worry about China's jobs. Don't have the President spending his  time, first, cutting the money to create jobs in America and then  spending time fighting to save Chinese jobs in China. You can't strip  investments from the American people and say you are in favor of saving  jobs in China and say that somehow this is making America strong.   In the Senate, though, there is good news. We are focused on moving  forward, on a bipartisan basis, on the fiscal year 2019 process. Just  yesterday, Chairman Shelby and I announced a schedule. We will mark up  all 12 of the appropriations bills by the end of June. Our staffs,  Republican and Democratic alike, are going to be working nights and  weekends to get us in this position. We, as Senators, are committed to  spending whatever amount of time it takes--whether we have to go into  the evening, whether we have to go throughout the week--to get all 12  of them marked up by the end of June.   I hope the House Republican leader will abandon this ill-considered  rescission bill. This is not the start to the fiscal year 2019 process  I would have hoped for.   Chairman Shelby and I have different patterns and different  philosophies, but we want the Senate to work. We are working very hard  together. I have great respect for him in putting together our 12  appropriations bills. We can do it. We will be a better body if we do  it. Let's stop the tweeting and the sloganeering, and let's deal with  substance.
