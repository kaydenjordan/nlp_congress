 Mr. President, as you may know, I strongly supported the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that passed the Senate and was signed into law  last year. Over the 6 months since its passage, the law's positive  impact on our country's economy has become more apparent. Companies,  both large and small, have directly experienced the benefits of the law  and as a result are distributing bonuses, raising wages, and making new  investments in their businesses. As chairman of the Senate Committee on  Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I enthusiastically supported the  tax law because I believed it would reduce the tax rate for small  businesses, encourage investment in small businesses, and increase the  overall health of our economy. Over the last few months, I have been  making this series of speeches to illustrate the benefits this law  provides for small businesses.   While much attention has been given in the past 6 months to the ways  in which the law is leading to a positive business outlook and is  lowering tax rates for individuals and corporations, the benefits that  small businesses receive are not always noticed. Today I wish to draw  attention to how tax reform is benefitting Li-Lac Chocolates, a small  business in Brooklyn, NY. Li-Lac Chocolates makes a variety of  chocolate treats the old-fashioned way. Li-Lac was founded by George  Demetrious in 1923, with a single location in Manhattan's Greenwich  Village neighborhood, and today the company has four retail locations  across New York City and a 9,000-square-foot plant in Brooklyn. After  many years of steady success in Greenwich Village, Anthony Cirone and  his partners purchased the company in 2011 with plans to expand the  company's sales and make the brand better known. To ensure that the  taste and craftsmanship the company was known for was not lost, Cirone  enlisted the expertise of master chocolatier Anwar Khoder, who has  worked at Li-Lac since the late 1980s and is now a part owner. Though  the new owners have made changes to the packaging design and have  focused on increasing online sales, Khoder still follows Demetrious's  original recipes and even uses manufacturing equipment from the  company's earliest days.   Because of last year's tax law, this small chocolate manufacturing  business has been able to immediately deduct improvements made to new  storefronts. This enables the company to increase its cash flow, hire  more workers, and open new locations at a more rapid pace. Before the  implementation of the new tax law small businesses had to deal with a  complex expensing formula that took many years to make use of and made  improvements much less attractive to small business owners. The  immediate deduction of property improvements for small businesses is  one of the reasons that I supported the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Overall,  the new tax law has been good for small businesses, and it has pushed  many small businesses to increase their capital investments, hire  additional workers, increase wages, and will lower small businesses'  annual tax payments. I am pleased that small businesses like Li-Lac  Chocolates will be able to reduce their tax burden by making use of  this modified provision and look forward to watching the company's  continued success.                            ____________________
