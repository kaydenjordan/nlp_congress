 Madam President, the disability rights movement is one of  the great civil rights achievements of our time, and Chicago's Marca  Bristo was that movement's Rosa Parks.   Marca was a visionary and inspiring leader, who helped change Chicago  and change the world when it came to the rights of the disabled, and  she was my friend.   Sadly, Marca died last week in her adopted hometown of Chicago at 66  years of age.   In typical Marca style, she worked right on up to the few days before  her death, trying to bend the arc of history just a little more toward  justice before she drew her last breath.   I was happy to join my colleague Senator Tammy Duckworth this week in  sponsoring a resolution honoring Marca's life and work.   I would like to take a few moments on the floor today to remember  this amazing woman.   While most Americans have never heard of Marca Bristo, few lives went  untouched by her lifelong quest on behalf of people with disabilities.  She was a nationally and internationally acclaimed leader in the  disability rights movement.   She helped to write and to pass the Americans with Disabilities Act  in 1990, which outlawed discrimination against the estimated one in  four Americans with disabilities, and she spent the rest of her life  making sure the ADA was faithfully implemented.   Along with leaders like Justin Dart, Marca changed the way Americans  thought about disabilities. She persuaded us to view the disability  experience as a civil rights issue, not just a medical issue.   To Marca's mind, what kept many people with disabilities from leading  full lives was not their disability but the barriers they faced. What  needed to change, she said, was not the person with disabilities but  those obstacles that blocked their path. The problem was not that her  wheelchair was too wide for certain doors; the problem was the doors  were too narrow for her wheelchair. Remove the barriers, and people  with disabilities can lead rich and full lives and make enormous  contributions. That is part of what Marca taught me.   She was tough, smart, funny, determined, and fearless. She knew how  to motivate others and how to build coalitions.  [[Page S5502]]    Her parents actually named her Marcia, but during her freshman year  in college, a classmate called her Marca. She liked it, and it stuck.   She moved to Chicago and earned a nursing degree from Rush University  College of Nursing in 1976.   In 1977, when Marca was 23 years old, working as a labor-delivery  nurse at a Chicago hospital, she and her friend were sitting on the  shore of Lake Michigan, when a dog grabbed her favorite pair of sandals  and ran into the water with them. Marca dove in to retrieve her shoes,  not realizing the water was shallow. She broke her neck and was  paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of her life.   Because of her paralysis, she lost her job, her health insurance, her  home, her car, and the ability to navigate the city she loved. She  thought she would never work again, but luckily the director of  Northwestern University's Prentice Women's Hospital thought otherwise  and convinced her to return to nursing.   At one point, she attended a work conference in San Francisco and saw  for the first time an abundance of curb cuts--curb cuts that enabled  people with disabilities to cross the street. It was an eye-opener for  Marca.   As she later wrote:         No longer did I see curbs or stairs or inaccessible buses       and bathrooms as a problem around which I needed to navigate.       Rather, I saw them as examples of societal discrimination--      and felt a responsibility to get involved to help people with       disabilities, in Illinois and beyond.    In 1980, Marca founded Access Living in Chicago, a nonprofit  dedicated to helping people with disabilities live as independently as  possible rather than warehoused in institutions.   Access Living led the fight to make public transportation in Chicago  more accessible. Marca was not a shrinking violet. In 1984, she joined  others, chaining themselves to Chicago Transit Authority buses. She  ended up getting arrested, and they ended up filing a lawsuit in reply  against the transit agency.   Her determination led to the installation of wheelchair lifts and  critical changes to CTA buses and rail stations. Access Living became a  disability leadership model for other cities around the country and  around the world.   In 1992, Marca cofounded the National Council on Independent Living,  which she led for many years.   In 1993, President Clinton named her to head the National Council on  Disability. She was the first person with a disability ever to hold  that post, and she held it until 2002.   She was elected president of the U.S. International Council on  Disabilities and traveled around the world advocating for people with  disabilities and their families.   She participated in the negotiation for the U.N. Convention on the  Rights of Persons with Disabilities, a global accord based on the  Americans with Disabilities Act. More than 160 nations have signed that  treaty, including the United States. Sadly, this Senate has failed to  ratify that treaty. I worked hours and hours with Marca to try to win  the votes in the Senate for this bipartisan measure to help people with  disabilities. We even brought former U.S. Senator Bob Dole, a World War  II hero and a father of the ADA, to sit on the floor of the Senate when  we cast the votes on this treaty. Unfortunately, it did not pass.   Marca called July 26, 1990, the day President George H.W. Bush signed  the Americans with Disabilities Act, ``Our Independence Day.''   On that day, she said:         This ragtag army of people who couldn't see, hear, walk and       talk did what everyone said couldn't be done. We passed the       most comprehensive civil rights law since the passage of the       1964 Civil Rights Act.    In a 2015 video interview for Rush University Medical Center,  celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities  Act, Marca said: ``The law for the first time enshrined in federal law  that disability is a normal part of the human condition, and the world  needed to change.''   In July 2017, days before another ADA anniversary, Marca was again  fighting for justice. She was 1 of more than 60 who were arrested for  protesting against the proposed deep cuts in the Medicaid Program that  had been included in a Republican effort to repeal the Affordable Care  Act.   As the Capitol Police wheeled her away, Marca raised a clenched fist  and smiled. That is how I am going to remember her: optimistic,  determined, even against long odds.   Days after her arrest, another American hero with a disability, John  McCain, came to this floor and in the well of this Senate, shocked his  party and the Nation by becoming the deciding vote against the repeal  of the Affordable Care Act. I like to think my colleague from Arizona,  John McCain, saw in Marca Bristo and her determined friends the same  courage he had witnessed so often in our military.   My wife Loretta and I extend our condolences to Marca's husband of 32  years, Bob Kettlewell; their two children, Samuel and Madeline; her  granddaughter, who was born in June; to Marca's sister Gail; and to her  countless friends and colleagues.   Marca made the lives of hundreds of millions of people better. I am  going to miss her warm smile, her wise advice, her vision, and her  courage.    I announce that the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Bennet),  the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker), the Senator from California  (Ms. Harris), the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator  from Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.

Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Michigan and  those who have joined together on the Democratic side to speak out on  the issue of gun safety this afternoon and this evening.   I guess one of the real blessings in life is to have a grandchild,  and I have got six really good ones. One is a little girl who has just  entered the third grade in a public school in Brooklyn, NY. She is a  sweetheart, and I love her to pieces.   She came home to tell her mom and dad last year, when she was in the  second grade, that they just had a drill in her classroom, and they  told her what to do if someone showed up in the hallway or outside with  a gun: hide under the desk, stay away from the windows.   To think that little 7-year-old girl had to receive that kind of  warning in America today breaks my heart. Why?   Does anyone really honestly believe that when the Second Amendment to  the Constitution was written they envisioned the fear that would go  through the minds of children who, after Connecticut, worry that some  shooter will come in with a semiautomatic weapon and kill dozens of  kids in one moment? That is the reality of gun violence today. That is  one of the realities, and it is one that just breaks my heart as a  father and grandfather.   Over the past few weeks, our Nation has been rocked by mass shootings  in El Paso, Dayton, and Odessa, TX, that left 38 victims dead and  dozens more injured.   According to the Gun Violence Archive, so far this year there have  been 300 mass shootings. That means shootings where more than four  people were shot in one event. This is in addition to  [[Page S5514]]  the daily toll of gun homicides, suicides, and accidents that kill  nearly 40,000 Americans a year.   Every week, I see the grim statistics of people killed and wounded by  gunfire in my home State of Illinois. Just this past weekend--just this  past weekend, in Chicago, at least 8 people were killed and 19 more  injured by gunfire.   Gun violence is an epidemic in America. It affects communities large  and small. I have met countless people who have lost loved ones or who  have been traumatized by gun violence.   Millions of Americans now live in fear that when they send their  kids--or grandkids--off to school, when they go to a movie theater, a  concert, or to church, or even when they sit on their front porch, they  could be shot. This is unacceptable. America is better than this.   There are many people in this great Nation who are doing all they can  to try to reduce the epidemic of shootings--parents, community leaders,  teachers, faith leaders, law enforcement, the medical community, and  public officials, but what are we doing in the U.S. Senate? The answer  is nothing--nothing.   There is no single reform that can prevent every shooting, but we  know there are big gaps in our gun laws that make it easy for felons,  abusers, and mentally unstable people to get their hands on guns.  Closing these gaps and loopholes in our background checks system would  significantly reduce shootings and save lives.   It is estimated that 22 percent of gun sales nationwide currently  occur without a background check. Now, I know the critics say: Oh,  great, Senator. You are going to have better background checks. Let me  tell you, the people who want these guns are not going to go through  that process. It turns out that, last year, 100,000 of them were  ignorant enough to try, and they were caught in the act. They had been  disqualified from purchasing a firearm under Federal law, and yet they  made that try. Why would we ever let them successfully buy a firearm?  Without a real background check, they will.    Gun show and internet loopholes are the problems that haunt us today.  They enable unlicensed sellers to make sales without even checking on  the background of the buyer. According to news reports, the gunman in  the Odessa, TX, mass shooting bought his gun through a private sale  with no background check because he previously failed a check. Clearly,  there is a gap in the law that needs to be closed.   Polling consistently shows that 90 percent of Americans support  closing these gaps in the background check system. How many other  issues do 90 percent of Americans agree on, to have that kind of  number, for Democrats, Republicans, and Independents?   The people of America are trying to tell the Senators to do  something, and yet Senator McConnell refuses. Even the conservative  Republican Lieutenant Governor of Texas, Dan Patrick, has called for  closing these gaps in the background check system. I hope the Senators  from Lieutenant Governor Patrick's State are listening. The House of  Representatives have listened, and they have done so.   The bipartisan House background check bill, H.R. 8, passed the House  240 to 190, on a bipartisan rollcall on February 27. Here we are, over  200 days later. The Senate, which does virtually nothing every single  day, through Senator McConnell's leadership, refuses to even consider  this bill. Senate Republicans refuse to even consider the bipartisan  House-passed gun safety legislation that Americans of both political  parties overwhelmingly support.   In fact, they are avoiding taking up any bills at all. Week after  week after week, we vote on nomination after nomination after  nomination. We hardly ever debate. We hardly ever vote on legislation  to address the needs the American people say are the primary concerns  on their minds.   While Republican leadership in the Senate these days doesn't seem to  like to vote, they do like to tweet. Perhaps we shouldn't have been  surprised when one of our Republican colleagues, the junior Senator  from Texas, responded to a recent mass shooting by tweeting criticism  of gun laws in the city of Chicago.   There seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding by this Senator and  some other Republicans who believe that, despite what the maps show us,  Chicago is actually an island. Well, it is not. They seem to think  there is no way that people could actually drive 20 minutes into  northwest Indiana, go to a gun show, buy a truckload of guns, and sell  them in the alleyways of the city of Chicago at night. It happens. It  is the reason why a State law can't solve the problem.   Chicago's mayor--my friend--Lori Lightfoot, pointed out the obvious  to the junior Senator from Texas. Sixty percent of illegal firearms  recovered in Chicago come from out of State. That is why we need a  Federal background check reform bill like the one that passed the  House.   Mayor Lightfoot is right. She graciously invited Senator Cruz, our  colleague, to come visit Chicago, to see that it is not an island--it  is connected to other States--and to see what the city is doing, trying  to work to reduce the scourge of gun violence, and how Republican  Senators, if they really want to help, can help by passing legislation  for true background checks. I hope that the Senator from Texas accepts  the invitation. It is a great town. We would like to show it to him.   Another area in which this do-nothing Senate has fallen short is when  it comes to public safety threats posed by violent White supremacists.  I have introduced the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act. It is the only  legislation pending in the Senate to address White supremacist  violence.   The gunman in the August 3 mass shooting in El Paso posted a White  supremacist manifesto before he shot and killed 22 people and injured  24 others at a Walmart. Unfortunately, this was not an isolated  incident.   An unclassified May 2017 FBI-DHS joint intelligence bulletin found  that ``white supremacist extremism poses [a] persistent threat of  lethal violence.'' It also found that White supremacists ``were  responsible for 49 homicides in 26 attacks from 2000 to 2016 . . . more  than any other domestic extremist movement.''   At a July hearing, FBI Director Mr. Wray told me that the majority of  domestic terrorism arrests this year involved White supremacists, White  nationalists--and now they call themselves White identitarians,  whatever that means.   It is clear that violent White supremacists are the most significant  domestic terrorism threat facing America today. What have we done to  address this? Nothing. Just like H.R. 8, just like the gun safety  legislation, which we should be considering, Senator McConnell refuses  to bring anything before the Senate.   My bill, cosponsored by 21 Senators, including the Democratic leader,  Senator Schumer, would establish offices to combat domestic terrorism  at the Justice Department, FBI, and Department of Homeland Security.  These offices will be required to take concrete steps to prevent  domestic terrorism, including assessing and publicly reporting on  domestic terrorism threats, focusing limited resources on the most  significant threats, and providing information, training, and resources  to assist State and local and Tribal law enforcement.   This would produce a sustained and coordinated effort with  significantly more resources directed towards combating White  supremacist violence. It would make America safer.   It is time for the Senate Republican majority leader, Senator  McConnell, to let the Senate be a Senate, to actually debate. I stand  tonight on the floor--and I am honored to be here, but let's face it, I  am giving a speech to a largely empty Chamber in the hopes that some  following the speech on C-SPAN or reading it later may take some  information of value from it. I would much rather be engaged in a  debate at this very moment on H.R. 8, how to pass it--if necessary, how  to amend it--but to do something to respond to gun violence in Chicago,  in Illinois, and across the entire United States.   It is time for Senator McConnell to let the Senate be the Senate and  vote on the House-passed gun background check bill. We need to take up  other critical legislation as well to prevent gun violence and domestic  terrorism. I hope he will consider my bill to address White supremacist  violence. This legislation can make us safer and save lives if we can  just bring it to a vote.  [[Page S5515]]    I yield the floor.
