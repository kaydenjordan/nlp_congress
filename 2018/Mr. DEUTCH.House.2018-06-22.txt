 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the work of  NephCure Kidney International.   Roughly 31 million Americans live with kidney disease, and 3 in every  100,000 people suffer from nephrotic syndrome.   Nephrotic syndrome is not a disease itself; rather, it is an umbrella  term for the signs and symptoms that result from damage in the kidneys'  filtering units.   NephCure Kidney International is the only organization committed  exclusively to supporting research into finding the cause of the kidney  disease focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or FSGS, and nephrotic  syndrome.   I am proud of the work of this organization and their leaader, Dr.  Irving Smokler, NephCure's president and founder and a constituent of  mine.   In 1999, Dr. Smokler launched the NephCure Foundation, inspired by  his son, Matthew, who was diagnosed with FSGS when he was just 11 years  old.   Dr. Smokler has since dedicated himself to the fulfillment of the  foundation's mission: to find the cause of and cure for FSGS and  nephrotic syndrome.   Mr. Speaker, today I call on all of our colleagues to recognize and  support the goals of this important organization and to support robust  funding for research at NIH to help find a cure for FSGS and nephrotic  syndrome.                            ____________________
