 Mr. Speaker, I come before you today in support of my  colleague Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib.   All Members of Congress are entitled to freedom of speech. We also  recognize that words matter and that they have the power to uplift or  to harm others.   While I have joined the statement rejecting certain harmful  phraseology that has been used, I believe Congresswoman Tlaib's  statement that she did not intend to wish harm to the Jewish community  by her words.   Congresswoman Tlaib has all since clarified that she was intending to  make an aspirational call for freedom, human rights, and peaceful  coexistence, not death, destruction, or hate.   The ability to have free speech but to be willing to discuss and to  change and clarify is not just mature but democratic. No Member should  express harm to others, and Congresswoman Tlaib has been willing to  listen, clarify, and express compassion.   Yet on the other side of the aisle, we have seen repeatedly  Republican Members make disparaging comments that have threatened our  fellow colleagues and their families.    We have had members of the Republican Conference make  floor speeches about the great replacement theory that is suggestive of  white nationalism.   As a Black woman, I am offended.   Will you censure the co-chair of your Conference, Mr. Speaker?    We need to uplift. We need to allow free speech.
