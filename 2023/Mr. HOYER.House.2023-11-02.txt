 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I will  be quick, but hopefully pointed.   If the Republicans had not put a poison pill on this bill, it would  pass on suspension with over 400 votes, but they did not do that.   Mr. Speaker, we must provide Israel with the resources it needs to  protect itself and the Israelis, a mission that I absolutely support,  and we must do it now.   However, I rise in strong opposition to this legislation, the  dangerous precedent it sets, and the unsettling message it sends. At  any point, the majority could and should have put a bill on the floor  providing crucial aid to Israel and Ukraine.   The Israel bill alone would get over 400 votes, and support for  Ukraine has consistently gotten 300 votes. The new Speaker chose  neither.   Instead, he has constructed a political gotcha bill. The majority  tries to score political points at the expense of Jewish lives and the  competence of both our allies and enemies in our resolve and  reliability. They undermine the critical aid for Israel with their  misguided attacks on the IRS, delaying this vital funding for our ally  while adding $12.5 billion to the deficit.                                time  1545    That is the exact opposite of what the offset claims to be its  objective. How ironic. How perverse. The only thing this bill offsets  is America's reputation and the world's greatest defender of democracy.  It signals to Putin, Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran, Xi Jinping, Kim Jong-un,  and other despotic regimes around the world that America may no longer  be willing to pay the price of freedom. Such doubt is dangerous. It  signals to our allies that our support is contingent, not on our shared  values, but on partisan issues unrelated to this bill.   Vote ``no'' for Israel, and for precedent.    Will the gentleman yield for a colloquy?    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Scalise and I have been partners in being very, very  strong supporters of Israel and making sure Israel has the funds it  needs to be successful, sovereign, secure, and safe. We remain in that  position.   The reason I asked the gentleman to yield is I don't know what is  going to happen to this legislation. I do know that the chairman of the  Foreign Affairs Committee has said this legislation we are considering  is dead upon arrival in the Senate. I don't know whether that is the  case.   I am no longer the leader, but I will tell my friend, the leader of  the Republican Party, that if you would bring a bill to the floor  tomorrow that has this $14.3 billion--I would like it to have Ukraine,  but if it doesn't have Ukraine in it, I would like it to have  humanitarian relief, but if it doesn't have humanitarian relief--I  believe it would pass on suspension overwhelmingly with votes from your  side and votes from this side. I would ask the gentleman to consider  that alternative.    Will the gentleman yield for a colloquy?    Mr. Speaker, the gentleman is very generous.   The irony, as I pointed out, Mr. Speaker, is that in the pay-for that  they have used, CBO scores that as a $12.5 billion increase in the  debt, not a decrease. The reason for that is, it cuts $28 billion,  essentially, that we would otherwise collect and that we spend $14  billion of that, so there is a net $12 billion plus remaining to add to  the deficit.   I understand and I agree with the gentleman that the debt is  important. We need to deal with it. I agree with his observation that  our defense officials see that as a clear and present danger to our  country. We need to deal with it. I suggest respectfully to the  gentleman that the offset does not accomplish that objective.
