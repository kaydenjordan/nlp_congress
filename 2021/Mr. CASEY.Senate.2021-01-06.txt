 Mr. President, I rise tonight to defend the people of the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania--to defend the more than 6.9 million  voters who voted in this election--and to condemn, in the strongest  possible terms, this attempt to disenfranchise the voters of  Pennsylvania based upon a lie, a falsehood. That same lie sowed the  seeds of today's violence and today's lawlessness here in the Capitol.   One of my constituents, Susan, from Lehigh Valley--the community of  our State where Senator Toomey lives--recently wrote to my office and,  perhaps, said it best:         We cannot allow ANYBODY to overturn the legal votes of the       citizens of Pennsylvania. This would be the ultimate       destruction of our democracy.    Susan had it right. We cannot allow ``ANYBODY''--and she put that  word in all caps--to overturn the legal votes of the people of our  State.   Let me address the allegation regarding the Pennsylvania Constitution  and the general assembly and somehow that the general assembly didn't  have the authority to enact ``no excuse mail-in voting''--that  process--for the people of our State.   First, the law in question, Act 77, was passed in 2019 and was  implemented without any serious question as to its constitutionality.  The law was passed by a Republican-controlled general assembly, house  and senate. It was only after the 2020 election, when it became clear  that President-Elect Joe Biden won Pennsylvania by a little more than  80,000 votes, that some Republican politicians in our State decided to  challenge the constitutionality of the law.   Second, Act 77 is plainly constitutional. My colleagues allege that  the State constitution requires in-person voting except under limited  circumstances. This is not true. While Pennsylvania lays out specific  situations in which absentee voting is required, there is no in-person  requirement in our State constitution. The constitution sets a floor,  not a ceiling, for this type of voting.   Third, apart from the argument made by my colleague, there is  bipartisan agreement across our State--at the local, State, and Federal  levels--that our election was fair, secure, and lawful. On Monday, my  colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Toomey, wrote in an op-ed: ``The  evidence is overwhelming that Joe Biden won this election.''   There is simply no evidence to justify the outrageous claims of  widespread voter fraud or election irregularities that have been  suggested by those seeking to overturn the election. There have been 60  cases in court after court, all throughout our State and throughout the  country, including in the Supreme Court, that have dealt with this  bizarre argument that we know is based upon that lie.   In one court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, Judge  Bibas, appointed by President Trump, wrote:         The campaign's claims have no merit. The United States has       free and fair elections, which are the lifeblood of our       democracy. Charges require specific allegations and then       proof. We have neither here.    So said Judge Bibas.   Finally, a word about those election officials who did such work.  These election officials all across our State--Republicans and  Democrats from red counties and blue counties--did their jobs. They are  patriots, and these objections are an attack on these Pennsylvania  public servants. I will give you one example from Republican  Commissioner Al Schmidt, of Philadelphia.   He wrote:         There really should not be a disagreement, regardless of       party affiliation, when we're talking about counting votes .       . . by eligible voters. It is not a very controversial thing       or, at least, it shouldn't be.    After election day, Commissioner Al Schmidt, his family, and his  colleagues were subjected to death threats simply because he was trying  to do his job with integrity. It calls to mind that great line from  ``America the Beautiful": ``O beautiful for patriot dream, That sees  beyond the years.''   These election officials, like so many of our patriots--and we heard  from Senator Duckworth tonight, a real patriot--did their jobs. Let's  support these patriots. Vote against this objection   I yield the floor.   The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority leader.
