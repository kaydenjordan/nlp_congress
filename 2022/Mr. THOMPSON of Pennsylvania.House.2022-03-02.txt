 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor,  thank, and express my sincerest gratitude for an incredible group of  students at the Pennsylvania State University--Penn State.   On February 18 at 4 p.m., Penn State students, staff, family,  friends, volunteers, and spectators filled the Bryce Jordan Center for  the 50th Penn State IFC/Panhellenic Dance Marathon, more widely known  as THON, to raise money for the Four Diamonds Foundation.   Since 1973, student volunteers have come together at Penn State to  raise money for the Penn State Health Children's Hospital. In 1977,  THON partnered with the Four Diamonds Foundation, and since then not a  single Four Diamonds family has received a medical bill thanks to the  tireless work and dedication of Penn State students.   The Four Diamonds was founded by Charles and Irma Millard in 1972  after their son, Christopher, lost his battle with cancer at age 11.  Before Christopher passed away, he wrote a story about a great knight  who sought out the four diamonds of courage, wisdom, honesty, and  strength to be saved from an evil sorceress. His parents realized those  four qualities were all necessary to overcome cancer, and they created  the Four Diamonds Fund in his memory.   Mr. Millard passed away in November of 2021 at the age of 93, but his  legacy through THON and his foundation will no doubt live on forever.   Over the past 50 years, THON has grown into the largest student-run  philanthropy in the world. In the first year, 78 students danced for 30  hours straight and raised just over $2,000. Today, THON is a 46-hour no  sitting, no sleeping dance marathon celebrating nearly 17,000 students'  yearlong fundraising efforts to help end childhood cancer.   Thankfully, after a virtual event last year, 667 dancers and tens of  thousands of student volunteers and supporters attended the event in- person. Students stood from 6 p.m. on Friday, February 18, until 4 p.m.  on Sunday, February 20. While it was an impressive feat to hold, what  is even more incredible is the drive, fortitude, and flexibility these  students showed in their commitment to this cause.   This past year, the pandemic prohibited students from hosting many of  their traditional bake sales, ribbon sales, or other fundraisers that  Pennsylvanians have been accustomed to seeing throughout the  Commonwealth. Despite this, THON shattered previous fundraising records  by bringing in more than $13.7 million for the kids.                                time  1045    Over the last 50 years, THON has now donated more than $200 million  to Four Diamonds Fund, undoubtedly saving hundreds of lives.   While it is no easy feat to stand for 46 hours, the real highlight of  this event comes on Sunday afternoon, shortly before the event  concludes. During what is known as Family Hour, THON invites Four  Diamonds families onto the stage to share their experiences with the  Children's Hospital, Four Diamonds, and THON.   This year, Jacquie Homan shared the story of how her son was  diagnosed with synovial cell sarcoma at age 2. Thanks to Penn State  Children's Hospital, Declan is officially 5 years cancer-free, and  Jacquie said that the support from the THON community had an  immeasurable impact on helping their family cope with and move forward  from this diagnosis.   I am inspired by Declan and every other child and family who find  themselves battling cancer and am in awe of their strength and their  spirit as they keep fighting.   I am also proud of the Penn State students who continue to be so  committed to this cause. And I am incredibly proud of the work done by  the Four Diamonds Foundation and Penn State Children's Hospital as they  conduct lifesaving research and ensure no family ever receives a bill.   Congratulations, once again, to everyone involved in this year's  THON.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  acknowledge the distinguished career of Penn State University President  Eric Barron.   President Barron assumed office in 2014 after leaving his post as  president at the Florida State University. But his service to the  university began when Dr. Barron served as dean of the College of Earth  and Minerals Sciences and founding director of the Earth System Science  Center in Penn State.   In his tenure as president of Penn State University, President Barron  elevated Penn State as a leader in higher education. President Barron  has also worked to support State funding, increase access and  affordability to students through scholarship programs, and prepare  students graduating from Penn State for success after college.   In my time working with President Barron, he has always made it a  point to meet with the Pennsylvania Congressional Delegation regularly  and share Penn State's vision, work, and culture. He took the time to  build meaningful relationships which ultimately benefited the  university and the Commonwealth as a whole. I am happy to call him my  friend and wish him well in his retirement.   Mr. Speaker, Penn State remains one of the top institutions in the  country in part because of the work of President Barron. He leaves a  great legacy behind.   I thank President Barron for his service, and I wish him joy in his  retirement.                            ____________________     I thank the gentleman for his  leadership in this Special Order hour and for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise today during this Special Order to offer  thoughts on the real state of our Union. Last night, President Biden  addressed the Nation and attempted to rewrite the history of his first  year in office.   His speech included a lot of Washington-speak and was short on  solutions to our everyday challenges: Record-high inflation, the  skyrocketing cost of gas, and supply chain disruptions affecting  everything from food to consumer goods.   President Biden owns this energy crisis, which is the direct result  of his administration crippling domestic production: Ending the issuing  of permits, the production on Federal lands, the  [[Page H1265]]  stopping of pipelines, the list goes on and on and on.   When we don't produce our own energy, it makes us more vulnerable to  global market fluctuations such as those caused by Russian aggressions  in Ukraine. You heard my good friend talk about how America under  President Biden is buying over half a million barrels of oil a day. In  some small part or large part, America is funding, through that, the  Russian aggression into Ukraine.   President Biden continues to ignore the national emergency at our  southern border. I was just there last week, and it was incredible. We  have unprecedented illegal migration, we have millions of apprehensions  and limited deportations. This is a serious situation that continues to  threaten our national security.   Madam Speaker, actions speak louder than words, and no amount of  grandstanding is going to change the fact that the American people have  a starkly different view from the President on the direction of our  country.
