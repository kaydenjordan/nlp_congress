 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment,  which emphasizes the need to provide adequate funding for construction  of the Department of Energy (DOE)'s Versatile Neutron Source or  Versatile Test Reactor.   The Versatile Test Reactor is a critical piece of DOE R&D  infrastructure that will allow U.S. nuclear researchers to test and  validate a wide range of advanced nuclear reactor designs on U.S. soil.  Any responsible U.S. nuclear energy strategy must include robust  support for this user facility.   Last Congress, my bill, the Nuclear Energy Innovation Capabilities  Act (NEICA), was the first step towards making this DOE user facility a  reality. To build on the success of NEICA, the central piece of my  nuclear legislation this Congress, H.R. 6796, the Nuclear Energy for  the Future Act, is the authorization of full funding for this necessary  work.   That's why I am very concerned to see that the 2021 appropriations  bill provides less than a quarter of the funds needed to keep the  Versatile Test Reactor project on budget and on schedule. If we are  serious about our clean energy future and if we want to decrease our  dependence on competitors like China and Russia for advanced nuclear  R&D, we must continue to strengthen our advanced nuclear energy  industry by prioritizing our investment in essential research  infrastructure.   The United States should lead the world in advanced nuclear research  and development. I believe that this amendment identifies one of the  fundamental and immediate needs of the U.S. nuclear industry and  provides a strong commitment to addressing it. Moving forward, I will  continue to work with my colleagues to prioritize fundamental research  that will support nuclear innovation and keep America safe,  independent, and globally competitive.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
