Congregation Beth Israel Shooting     Mr. President, before I begin the substance of my  remarks, I want to offer a few words in reaction to the terrible  hostage situation this weekend in Texas.   Saturday's hostage crisis at Congregation Beth Israel was a  horrifying reminder that the ancient poison of anti-Semitism continues  to this day. I am relieved that all of the hostages made it out alive,  and I commend the quick thinking of the first responders and of Rabbi  Charlie Citron-Walker, who acted valiantly, and all those present for  bringing this crisis to an end.   Moving forward, we must get to the bottom of what inspired the  terrorist attack on Saturday but increase our vigilance against all  forms of anti-Semitism and racially motivated violence.   Here in Congress, we must continue working to increase our investment  in nonprofit security grants to groups that are targets of hate. We  need to give our communities the tools they need to protect themselves  so they can live without fear of being targeted for just who they are.   On this day, I stand in solidarity with the congregation of Beth  Israel, the Jewish community of Greater Dallas-Ft. Worth, and with all  Jewish Americans for whom Saturday's attack was a traumatic reminder of  the hate we have yet to overcome.                                Voting Rights    Mr. President, this is on defending democracy. The eyes of the Nation  will be watching what happens this week in the U.S. Senate.   Just a few days removed from what would have been Dr. Martin Luther  King, Jr.'s 93rd birthday, the Senate has begun debate on the Freedom  to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act--for the  first time, the first time in this Congress.   Democrats have tried for months to hold a voting rights debate on the  floor, but we have been blocked each time by Republicans. We brought  commonsense proposals four times on the floor of the Senate and only  once did one Senator--Lisa Murkowski, to her credit--agree to even  begin debate on voting rights. On all three other votes, not a single  Republican joined us. Every one of them voted to block even a debate on  voting rights.   So, today, we are taking this step by using a message from the House.  Now, it is just a step, but an important step moving forward, in that  we will finally debate this one issue that is so central to the  American people, to our history, and to our democracy.   As we debate these measures, the Senate will confront a critical  question: Shall the Members of this Chamber do what is necessary to  pass these bills and bring them closer to the President's desk?   Today, we have just taken the first steps that will put everyone-- everyone--on the record. Much has been said over the past few days  about the prospects of passing voting rights legislation in this  Chamber. Senate Democrats are under no illusion that we face difficult  odds, especially when virtually every Senate Republican--every Senate  Republican--is staunchly against legislation protecting the right to  vote.   But I want to be clear. When this Chamber confronts a question this  important--one so vital to our country, so vital to our ideals, so  vital to the future of our democracy--you don't slide it off the table  and say, ``Never mind.'' Win, lose, or draw, Members of this Chamber  were elected to debate and to vote, especially on an issue as vital to  the beating heart of our democracy as voting rights. The public is  entitled to know where each Senator stands on an issue as sacrosanct as  defending our democracy. The American people deserve to see their  Senators go on record on whether they will support these bills or  oppose them. Indeed, that may be the only way to make progress on this  issue now, for the public to see where each of us in this Chamber  stands. The public deserves to see it, and that is exactly, precisely,  what the Senate is going to do this week.    Make no mistake about it. Using Dr. King as an inspiration, Democrats  will continue to fight on this issue until we succeed, and I believe  history will vindicate us.   Mr. President, the fight over voting rights is as old as the Republic  itself. Recently--well, let me say, when the Republic was founded, in  many States you had to be a White male Protestant property owner to  vote. As is obvious by who is in this Chamber, we have made progress-- inexorable progress--in expanding that franchise.   History does not regard those restrictions that occurred early on as  worthy, but we must continue the fight. We have not reached the place  where every person can vote easily and openly and honestly. So we have  to keep it up.   I have been reading the biography of Ulysses S. Grant by Ron Chernow.  The No. 1 thing the southern segregationists wanted to take away from  the newly freed slaves was the right to vote. Segregationists back then  knew that if recently freed Black slaves didn't have the right to vote  in the South, they would have no power at all: no power over laws, over  resources, over the future of the country. And that was the No. 1 thing  segregationists wanted to prevent: the right of the newly freed slaves  to vote.   It is why, a century later, Dr. King made a direct appeal to Congress  for acting on voting rights: ``Give us the  [[Page S231]]  ballot,'' he said in 1957, ``and we will no longer have to worry the  federal government about our basic rights.'' ``Give us the ballot'' and  all other rights will follow. With the ballot, he argued, voters could  end the worst of racial segregation. They could elect good men and good  women to government. They could subdue the dangers of the mob and keep  democracy alive. But the ballot had to come first. The ballot had to  come first.   Dr. King might as well have been speaking to us, because across the  United States, in 2022, ballot access is not being expanded; it is  being repressed. And our democracy is not safe; it is under attack.   A year ago, a violent mob incited by the President and his Big Lie  attacked this very building in order to reverse the results of a free  and fair election. Last week, for the first time, the Department of  Justice announced sedition charges against a number of the rioters who  were here that day.   A year later, at least 19 States have passed 33 laws that make it  harder for people to vote, using the Big Lie--the Big Lie, as false as  it is--as a justification. Those States together are home to 55 million  Americans, and new laws are certainly coming once the State  legislatures return to session this year. And the kind of violence--the  threats of violence--we saw on January 6 by that insurrectionist mob is  now being threatened increasingly against countless election workers  across the country.   Just this weekend, the Houston Chronicle reported that ``County  officials in urban areas across the State [of Texas] say they've been  forced to reject an unprecedented number of mail ballot applications  [thanks to the new Republican voter suppression law.]   And this past Saturday, Donald Trump once again repeated the same  conspiracy theories about the 2020 election that have paved the way for  voter suppression at the State level.   So, unfortunately, the dangers that face our democracy are alive and  well, and the laws that suppress the vote at the State level are being  enacted on a partisan basis.   We have seen periods of regression, in terms of voting rights and  equality and fairness to people of color. We have seen regression  occur. And this seems to be a period of regression in what the  legislatures are doing, and fight it we must.   So the Senate must act. We must step in and act. We must do  everything to pass voting rights legislation, just as this Chamber has  done in the past, just as the Constitution permits us to do. That is  why we will vote this week on the Freedom to Vote Act and the John  Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. And if Republicans choose to  continue their filibuster of voting rights legislation, we must  consider and vote on the rule changes that are appropriate and  necessary to restore the Senate and make voting legislation possible.   As I have recounted already, these laws are urgently needed. We must  not--we cannot--allow another period of that regression, which we have  seen throughout American history.   Here is what some of the laws would do--our two laws would do:   They would set basic commonsense standards for all Americans for  access to the ballot as well as restore preclearance provisions that  were passed by this Chamber for decades on a bipartisan basis. They  would establish clear and consistent standards for early voting across  the country and make it easier for voters to access absentee ballots.  They would protect election workers from unlawful intimidation. We are  seeing so much of that now. It is disgraceful--disgraceful. They would  end the toxic practice of partisan gerrymandering, and they would take  new steps to fight the power of dark money corroding our elections.  Senate Democrats repeatedly tried, over the last year, to bring  Republicans to the table to debate these issues.   I will remind my colleagues that this is not the old Republican  Party. I would remind the American people how dramatically the  Republican Party has regressed. The Republican Party used to be one  that supported voting rights. Presidents Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and  George W. Bush worked to renew voting rights bills.   No, sadly, unfortunately, this is Donald Trump's Republican Party.  And it is the one now trying to take away the vote from younger Black  and Brown, elderly, minority, and low-income voters.   And yet every time we try to engage our Senate Republican colleagues,  they resist it. So we have no choice. We are moving ahead on our own.   Once again, no one denies the path ahead is an uphill struggle.  Republicans have been clear, they will entertain no bipartisan  compromise on voting rights, but long odds are no excuse for this  Chamber to avoid this important issue.   Again, Members of this Chamber were elected to debate and to vote. We  are going to vote. We are all going to go on the record. And  Republicans will have to choose which side they stand on--protecting  democracy or offering their implicit endorsement of Donald Trump's Big  Lie.   For months, Senate Republicans have come up with excuses and  subterfuges to avoid doing what they know is the right thing, just like  so many others have come up with similar lame excuses and subterfuges  in the past. But as history shows, doing the right thing will  eventually prevail. Justice will flow like mighty waters, as the  Prophet Amos has said.   The direction of voting rights in America is enough to have shaken  the faith of even the most optimistic champion of America--of  democracy. Sometimes it seems like for each step forward, the country  takes two steps back, but fights like this are not unusual in American  history.   The story of our country has been a long, arduous march toward  expanding the promise of freedom for all Americans. We find ourselves  in such a struggle today.   Dr. King had simple, powerful advice for his followers during moments  like this: Keep moving. Keep fighting. The road to justice is often  painful and full of setback, but we must keep moving. We must keep  moving, he said, against every obstacle and prodigious hilltop and  mountain of opposition. Let nothing slow you down. And even after you  cross the Red Sea only to find yourself in the desert, just keep moving  forward through the wilderness. ``And if you will do that with  dignity,'' he said, ``when the history books are written in the future,  the historians will have to look back and say, `There lived a great  people.'''   We will keep fighting in the same spirit to protect our democracy in  this day and age. And if we do that, I have faith that one day the  history books will likewise look back at this generation of Americans  and conclude, ``There lived a great people,'' too.   I yield the floor.
