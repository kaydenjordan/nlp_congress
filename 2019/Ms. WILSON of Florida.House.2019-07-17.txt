 Mr. Speaker, 50 years ago, the Apollo 11  mission sent a crew of pioneering women on a journey of incredible  significance. All were astronauts.   Symbolically, it was a representation that with enough hard work,  dedication, and will, America could achieve the seemingly impossible.   The mission left lasting imprints, from the eternal footprints left  on Tranquility Base to the values engraved into an entire generation.   The Moon landing inspired all who watched it to believe in the power  of innovation, dedication, and most especially, unwavering courage. But  today, I want to draw attention to some of the unseen heroes of the  Apollo 11 mission. I will refer to them as the ``hidden figures.''   Ms. Katherine Johnson, Ms. Dorothy Vaughan, and Ms. Mary Jackson have  [[Page H5922]]  only recently been recognized for the incredible work they put into the  mission that defined generations, thanks to the film ``Hidden  Figures.''   Only Ms. Johnson is still alive today to receive our overdue  gratitude for these women.   Before we began carrying calculators in our pockets, Ms. Johnson, Ms.  Vaughan, and Ms. Jackson did manual calculations of astronomical  problems using only pen and paper.   The stakes were incredibly high. The working conditions were  segregated and tense. Yet, these women produced work at a caliber high  enough to send men to the surface of the Moon.   That is what I call some Black girl magic.   Ms. Johnson, Ms. Vaughan, and Ms. Jackson each defied intense  discrimination and overwhelming adversity. Their lifetimes were  metaphorical Apollo missions: astronomically successful despite all  odds.   But they were hidden figures. We did not know them.   I am proud to recognize them today on the floor as women of  distinction with unrivaled talent. I am proud to know that their  contributions are finally being recognized.   On a very personal note, as a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority,  Inc., I am proud to call them my sisters.   Their legacy of Black female excellence and newfound recognition will  undoubtedly inspire a generation of young people to pursue STEM  careers, despite whatever odds may be against them.   Black girls can learn about the Apollo 11 mission and know that there  are heroes who look just like them. First-generation college students,  low-income children, and children of color can discover how it is  possible to defy the odds with STEM.   To help make this possible, my long-term friend and colleague from  Florida (Mr. Posey) and I worked together to pass H.R. 2726, the Apollo  11 50th Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act, which honors the Apollo 11  crew, NASA scientists, engineers, astronauts, and Americans from every  State who made the mission possible. The bill supports college  scholarships for future scientists, engineers, and astronauts.  Surcharges from the sale of the coins will help promote STEM education,  space exploration, and scientific discovery.   I am grateful that throughout my lifetime, these hidden figures have  finally been brought into the light and celebrated in the manner they  have deserved since 1969. They are no longer hidden. Now, we all know  them, celebrate them, and thank God for their brilliance and  magnificent contributions.                            ____________________
