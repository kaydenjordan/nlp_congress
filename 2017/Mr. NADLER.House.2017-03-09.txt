 Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 725, the  misnamed Innocent Party Protection Act. The main purpose of this bill  is to make it easier to remove State cases to Federal courts, where  large corporate defendants have numerous advantages over consumers and  injured workers.                                time  1515    Let's not talk about the emotional devastation. We are talking about  large, corporate defendants. We are not worried about their emotions.  Their litigation departments are quite capable of handling the  emotions.   This bill will clog the Federal courts, drain judicial resources,  upset well-established law, and delay justice for plaintiffs seeking to  hold businesses accountable for the injuries they cause. It is yet  another attempt by the Republican majority to stack the deck in favor  of large corporations.   This bill is the opening salvo of this week's series of bills by the  Republicans to close off access to the courts to ordinary Americans.  With every step they take, whether it be to remove more State cases to  Federal courts, to make class action suits more difficult to bring, or  to reclassify more lawsuits as frivolous and subject to mandatory  sanctions, they are limiting access to court help for ordinary  Americans.   The so-called Innocent Party Protection Act would upend the century- old doctrine of fraudulent joinder, in which a defendant from the same  State as the plaintiff is improperly added to a case in order to defeat  diversity jurisdiction in Federal court, and, therefore, keep the case  in a State court. Under current law, a defendant claiming fraudulent  rejoinder has the burden of showing that there is ``no reasonable  basis'' for a claim against the instate defendant, and, therefore, the  case should remain in Federal court.   This bill would turn that process on its head by placing the burden  on the plaintiff to show that there is a ``plausible'' claim against  the instate defendant and that the plaintiff has a ``good faith  intention'' to pursue a claim against that defendant. Both standards  are undefined in the bill, but it is likely that many plaintiffs would  find these hurdles impossible to overcome at the initial stages of  litigation before discovery.  [[Page H1971]]    Furthermore, defendants will use this forum shopping bill to delay  justice by routinely challenging jurisdiction. It will drain court time  and allow corporate defendants to force plaintiffs to expend their  limited resources on what should be a simple procedural matter. Under  this bill, the preliminary determination of jurisdiction would become a  baseless, time-consuming mini-trial before a second time-consuming  trial on the merits. While large corporations could easily accommodate  such costs, injured workers, consumers, and patients cannot.   The practical effect of this bill is to force cases based on State  law, which should properly be heard in State courts, to be considered  in our overburdened Federal courts instead. Large corporations  generally believe that Federal courts are a friendlier forum,  especially since they are overburdened and they can afford to wait  whereas the plaintiffs cannot, and they believe that they have a better  chance of escaping liability for their actions in the Federal court.   There is no evidence of a systemic crisis of fraudulent joinder, nor  is there evidence that the courts cannot properly handle whatever  issues may arise under current law. There is certainly no evidence that  what wealthy corporations need are greater advantages in the courts.  Yet, this bill hands them yet another gift from the Republican  majority, and it is ordinary consumers and injured workers who will  suffer.   Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on this legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 985, the so-called  Fairness in Class Action Litigation and Furthering Asbestos Claim  Transparency Act.   This outrageous legislation would severely limit the ability of  injured consumers and workers to obtain relief through class action  lawsuits. If that were not bad enough, the bill also contains a totally  unrelated measure to violate the privacy of asbestos victims, and  subject them to potential discrimination. Together, this legislation is  just one more measure in the Republican parade of bills this week to  further tilt the playing field in favor of wealthy corporations over  ordinary people.   Class action suits are an essential tool to enable victims of  corporate wrongdoing to be compensated for their injuries and to deter  future misconduct. Plaintiffs often seek to band together as a class  when the potential damages they could receive individually are too low  to make it practical to hire a lawyer and bring a lawsuit alone. But,  as members of a class, they have the power to secure relief from a  multimillion-dollar company and put an end to its illegal practices.   That is exactly why the big corporations oppose them. It makes it  harder for those companies to operate with impunity from the law, with  little regard for the injuries they may cause.   It was class action lawsuits that helped uncover years of corrupt  practices in the tobacco industry and began to turn around a public  health disaster, not to mention recover billions of dollars. It was  class action lawsuits that revealed contamination of groundwater that  cause certain forms of cancer. It was class action lawsuits that  revealed fraudulent pricing practices and misleading advertising by  drug companies, widespread employment discrimination, and predatory  payday lending practices. Class action lawsuits also helped expose and  bring down the sham university peddled on winning victims by the  current occupant of the White House.   But this bill includes a range of provisions that would make such  class action suits practically impossible. For example, it would  require each member of a class to suffer ``the same type and scope of  injury'' as the named class representative. What this means is that if  two people use a defective product, but one suffers first-degree burns  while the other person suffers third-degree burns, they cannot join  together in a class because their injuries are of a different scope. Or  take a company with a pattern of racial discrimination. If some workers  are being paid less than others for doing the same job while other  workers find themselves repeatedly passed over for deserved promotions,  they cannot join in the same class action because they would not be  deemed to have suffered the same type of injury--one having been paid  less, the other having been passed over for promotions--despite being  victims of the same discriminatory policies.   This is just one of a host of unnecessary and onerous requirements  placed on victims by this bill that makes it virtually impossible to  form a class. When added together, it amounts to a giant bailout for  wealthy corporations at the expense of injured consumers and workers.   Mr. Chairman, we do not want the Federal courts to be simply  collection agencies to large corporations. We need justice for the  small, ordinary person.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to defeat this legislation.
