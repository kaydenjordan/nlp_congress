 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, sometimes around here, in what a lot of  people refer to as the ``ivory tower,'' we talk about issues like they  are abstract issues, like they don't have any real world effect. And I  just wanted to touch on something, before I begin on my other subject  here today, which is related to recent information that has been put  out by the Department of Agriculture, the USDA's Economic Research  Service, which is the arm that does projections on the economy and the  farm economy, generally. What they are now concluding is that in 2022,  there are going to be record cash receipts--record cash receipts--crop  production, livestock production--record levels, 14-percent higher year  over year. But what they go on to say is that even with record cash  receipts up by 14 percent, net cash farm income is going to be down.  Net cash farm income is going to be down by 1 percent.   Why is that? Well, because if you look at what has increased,  increased costs on farmers in this country, they have reached some  record levels. If you look at, for example, fertilizer. Farmers will  spend 84 percent more, or $21 billion more, on fertilizers than they  did in 2020; 65 percent, or nearly $8 billion, more on fuel and oil;  and more than $18 billion more on feed for livestock. Then you add in,  on top of that, debt, which, for a farm operation, obviously, they are  a very debt-intensive operation. So with higher interest rates and  record farm debt of $496 billion, that is expected to increase interest  payments by 37 percent, or more than $7 billion, from 2020, or 2 years  ago.   So my point, simply, is that, at least in my part of the country,  with corn, soybeans, wheat, livestock, and cattle prices expected to go  up in record numbers in terms of overall gross farm income--gross cash  receipts--that you would think would lead to good times in American  agriculture, because of inflation, a 14-percent increase in gross cash  receipts is going to result in an actual loss, a reduction year over  year from 2021, when it comes to inflation-adjusted net farm income.   So I make that point simply to illustrate how critical it is that, as  policymakers, we acknowledge what is happening in the real world,  because I think around here the Biden administration tries to downplay  this inflation issue like it is a nonissue.  [[Page S4454]]    It is a real issue. It is hitting the pocketbooks of every American  in this country to the tune 8\1/2\ to 9 percent for a family. I said  this before, but the analysis is out there. For an average family in  this country, you are talking about, year over year to buy the same  basket of goods you bought last year, an additional $9,000 over last  year--$700 and some per month, year-over-year, month-over-month  increases in costs for average families in this country. That is a  $9,000 tax increase on every family in this country.   Now, it is borne arguably more easily by people in high-income  categories, but if you are a working family who is trying to make ends  meet and is putting more and more on your credit card or dipping into  savings--and there are more and more people in this country. I just saw  this number yesterday where one out of every six Americans now is  behind in their utility payments. There are people living paycheck to  paycheck, and inflation is killing them. And it is like this  administration has a blind eye to that and wants to talk about a lot of  other issues. And I can see why, because this is an issue I would not  want to have to take responsibility for.   In many respects, all the spending--all the spending pushed through  here, advocated by the President--the $2 trillion last year, the  American Rescue Plan, and just in the last month, another $750 billion  in spending and taxes, and the heavy-handed regulation, the shutdown of  oil and gas production in this country, which drives up the cost of  energy and which is reflected, as I pointed out, in a lot of these  numbers--if you look at the fuel costs year over year, you actually  have a situation in American agriculture today where you have record  gross cash receipts and a reduction in inflation-adjusted net income.  That is the impact of inflation.
