 Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon, and I  certainly thank my colleague from Nevada for giving me an opportunity  to speak for a few minutes. I also thank my friend from Oregon for  being steadfast on this subject.   It has been 16 years since we passed the DREAM Act. We have been  through a lot. We made it here on the floor of the Senate. We passed it  on the floor of the Senate. There was an effort at comprehensive  immigration reform which included the DREAM Act. It was a glorious day  when it passed with a strong bipartisan vote and then a bitter  disappointment in the months that followed when it languished on the  floor of the House of Representatives and never was called for a  hearing or a vote on the floor. So many of these thousands of young  people who would be protected under the DREAM Act didn't know what the  future would hold.   President Obama stepped in and created DACA through Executive order,  and with DACA protection, some 800,000 young people were given a chance  to be part of America--something they always dreamed of. They went to  college, got jobs, and they did important things in their lives that  they had put off and frankly reached the conclusion that they would  never be able to do.   One of the things that many of them did, which surprised people, was  to pursue their goal of being part of the U.S. military. We have an  All-Volunteer military. These young people, undocumented in America,  who have no legal status in our Nation, were prepared literally to give  their lives for our country, the only country they have ever known. Is  there any question in your mind as to their devotion to this Nation?  Not in mine.   When you hear their stories, you will understand why. I have a story  I want to tell you tonight. It is a story about Alan Torres.   Alan Torres was brought here as a child from Mexico. He grew up in  North Dallas, TX, where he was a great student and athlete. In high  school, he was placed in a program for advanced math and science. He  took advanced placement courses in a variety of subjects which I  dutifully avoided in high school, subjects such as physics, chemistry,  anatomy, and physiology. He was captain of the high school varsity  cross country team, where he won the district championship. He was the  company commander in his high school's Junior ROTC. Not only was Alan  an academic overachiever, he was also an artist on top of everything.  His work was displayed and sold at regional level competitions, and he  earned many awards.   His most vivid memory of high school, however, was none of these  things but of 9/11, the day of the terrorist attack on the United  States. He was sitting in school, wearing his JROTC uniform in Texas,  and he cried with his classmates when they heard what happened to  America. He said he thought to himself, ``I can't believe this happened  to my nation.'' My Nation. You see, as a kid, Alan always believed this  was his Nation. It wasn't until he was unable to do things many of his  friends could do that he realized he was undocumented in America, with  no legal status. He couldn't get a driver's license like his buddies  did. He couldn't apply for financial aid to go to college.   Alan still pursued his dream despite these obstacles. By the time he  graduated from high school, he was working three jobs to save up enough  money to go to school. He attended a local community college because he  didn't have any money. He needed low tuition. He received an  associate's degree from Dallas Community College. Then he transferred  to the University of Texas, Arlington. There, he got a bachelor's  degree in information systems management. After all his hard work, he  graduated from college debt-free. That is how hard he worked. He paid  for his education out of his pocket because he couldn't count on any  Federal loans or financial aid.   Today, Alan Torres--this young, undocumented man, protected by DACA-- is a software engineer for IBM. He developed software that helps  medical providers across the country to better manage the health of  over 50 million patients.  [[Page S7967]]    He wrote me a letter saying:         [DACA] is what I would pray for all those nights when I       would stay up late doing homework or lay awake full of       anxiety for the future. It has allowed me to fulfill my       potential and reach my goals without the fear of not knowing       if I am going to wake up in a strange country tomorrow. . . .       Dreamers are not perfect, but we work hard, love this       country, and would love the opportunity to show it.    Alan is one of 31 Dreamers working for IBM. People like Alan are the  reason that IBM and a lot of business leaders are calling us and  saying: Are you crazy, Senator? You would deport Alan Torres? He earned  his education in the country the hard way. He succeeded where others  failed. He has the ambition and drive that we all pray for in our  children and those we admire, and you want to tell this man to leave  the United States of America?   These business leaders are pretty hard-nosed about this. For their  part, they have an excellent employee, and they don't want to lose him.   More than 400 business leaders wrote a letter to Congress urging us  to pass the bipartisan Dream Act or DACA or whatever you want to call  it. The letter says:         Dreamers are vital to the future of our companies and our       economy. With them, we grow and create jobs. They are part of       why we will continue to have a global competitive advantage.    That is the business viewpoint on this whole issue of the Dream Act.   In a few weeks, we want to go home for Christmas. We want to  celebrate with our families. We understand that it is a special time of  year for so many in America, this Christmas and Hanukkah season. We  know we give thanks at Thanksgiving, but we give it again on Christmas  Day as we count our blessings. One of the blessings we count on is the  blessing of opportunity.   We know that in this great Nation, people have an opportunity to make  a better life for themselves, their kids, for their future, and for our  Nation. Think about Alan Torres over this Christmas, and think about  800,000 just like him, uncertain about what the new year will bring,  uncertain because we have failed to act in Congress.   It was the President and Attorney General on September 5 who  challenged us to do something. The President said: I am going to do  away with Obama's Executive order, and now, Congress, do something. But  all I hear from many of my colleagues is, well, let's see tomorrow if  we can work this into the schedule or maybe next month or maybe the  month after. We can't do that. There has to be a sense of urgency on  our part too.   These young people--many of them have tearful speculation about their  own future. I just talked to one of my colleagues from Colorado who  came back from a meeting with half-a-dozen Dreamers, and as they told  their story, they all broke down in tears. Do you know why? They are  just about to give up hope--not on our country but on us--on the  Senate, on the House, on politics, on Congress. I think we are better  than that.   This Nation of immigrants has many people with many great stories.  The Presiding Officer told a great story about his family and what it  meant personally growing up. I have heard it and I am inspired by it,  as I am and he is by many other stories we hear. This is what America  is all about.   This issue really tests who we are and what we believe in and what  our values will be. There are 100 ways to get to the finish line, but  we need to do it by December 22. That is when we are supposed to break  for Christmas. Let's make sure that as we break for Christmas, we give  these young people, these Dreamers, these DACA people we have  protected, a bright future for a happy new year, literally.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.
