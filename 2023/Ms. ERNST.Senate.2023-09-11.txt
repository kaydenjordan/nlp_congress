 Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week it is my privilege to recognize KPI  Concepts of West Burlington, IA as the Senate Small Business of the  Week.   KPI Concepts was founded by Craig Upton in 1984 out of his garage in  Burlington, IA, building cabinetry for local businesses. Two years  later, KPI Concepts moved to a 4,200 square foot building with a  workshop. The original building was expanded to 42,000 square feet  between 1986 and 2006, and in 2007, they purchased an additional  65,000-square-foot location. The second location expanded a few years  later. After starting as a commercial cabinetry business, they evolved  to manufacture wind turbine blade components in 2008 with the KPI  Composites division. In 2013, they added a west coast location in  Hurricane, UT, while maintaining their West Burlington headquarters.  Over the years, KPI Concepts has grown to include the KPI Metals  division as well.   Craig Upton attributes his success to his father and the Southeastern  Community College for his successful business career. After graduating  from Burlington High School in 1973, he went on to attend Southeastern  Community College where he earned an associate's degree in mechanical  technology. He later went on to work as a design draftsman, welder, and  in the data processing department. When he lost his job, his father,  who had a passion for woodworking, urged Craig to pursue his dream and  start KPI Concepts. Because he pursued his dreams, KPI Concepts  celebrated its 39th business anniversary in 2023.   In addition to being the president and founder of KPI Concepts, Craig  Upton gives back to the community. In 2014, he was recognized by  Southeastern Community College with the Distinguished Alumnus Award.  Earning further accolades, the KPI Metals team was awarded the  Manufacturer of the Year Award by the Greater Burlington Partnership in  2017.   KPI Concept's commitment to providing high-quality commercial  cabinetry, wind turbine parts, and metal manufacturing services to  customers throughout the United States while maintaining their Iowa  roots is clear. I want to congratulate Craig Upton and the entire team  at KPI Concepts for their continued dedication to providing industrial  services to Iowans. I look forward to seeing their continued growth and  success in Iowa.                            ____________________
