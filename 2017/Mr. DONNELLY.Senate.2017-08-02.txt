 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize and honor the  extraordinary service and sacrifice of U.S. Navy Hospital Corpsman  First Class Ryan Lohrey of Middletown, IN. Dedication to his country,  loyalty to his fellow servicemembers, and a deep love for his family  were the qualities that defined Ryan's life.   A native of Middletown, IN, Ryan graduated from Shenandoah High  School in 2005. Two years after graduation, he joined the U.S. Navy,  where he served our country as a special amphibious reconnaissance  corpsman, providing medical care to his fellow servicemembers.   On Monday, July 10, 2017, Ryan and 15 other servicemembers died  tragically when the KC-130 aircraft they were on crashed in  Mississippi. The plane was carrying servicemembers from Marine Aerial  Refueler Transport Squadron 452 and the 2d Marine Raider Battalion, a  special operations unit. Hundreds gathered on July 27 as a military  procession honored Ryan from Indianapolis International Airport to New  Castle, IN. He received military honors during his funeral in  Middletown on July 31, 2017.   Ryan is remembered for his selfless sacrifice, humility, patience,  and infectious smile. He distinguished himself through his service in  the U.S. Navy, where he deployed with the 2d Marine Reconnaissance  Battalion and later with the 2d Marine Raider Battalion. He was a  veteran of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and Operation  Inherent Resolve in Iraq. Ryan had qualification as an enlisted fleet  marine force warfare specialist, marine combatant diver, and Navy and  Marine Corps parachutist. He rose to become a special amphibious  reconnaissance corpsman. For his service, among the awards he earned  were a Purple Heart, Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, Combat  Action Ribbon with Gold Star in lieu of second award, and Good Conduct  Medal with two Bronze Stars in lieu of second and third award.   Ryan was a devoted patriot, son, husband, and father, who loved  football and making others laugh. He is survived and will be deeply  missed by his wife, Cassie; his two children, Gavin and Maelyn; his  parents, Michael and Teresa Lohrey of Middletown; and his grandparents,  Barbara Lohrey of Middletown, and George Lohrey, of Sulphur Springs; as  well as friends, the U.S. Navy family, and Hoosiers across the State of  Indiana.   As Ryan's grandmother said, ``Ryan was my hero. He's everybody's  hero.'' Ryan set an example for others and will be remembered for his  strong character. Let us always remember and emulate the shining  example this brave man set for us and honor his commitment to serving  his fellow citizens. May God welcome Ryan home and give comfort to his  family and friends.                            ____________________     Today I wish to recognize and honor the extraordinary  service and sacrifice of Lt. Aaron Allan of the Southport Police  Department. Dedication, loyalty, and compassion for those in need were  the qualities that defined Lt. Allan's life.   Lt. Aaron Allan was a 6-year veteran with the Southport Police  Department, who began his career in law enforcement in 2001. A kind and  caring person, Lt. Allan was a family man who devoted his life to  serving his community. Lt. Allan earned the nickname ``Teddy Bear''  because of his kind heart and willingness to help anyone in need.   Lt. Allan had dreamed of being a police officer since he was 5 years  old. Before he joined the Southport Police Department in 2011 as a  volunteer officer, he previously worked as an officer at the Indiana  School for the Deaf and for Franklin Township Schools. In 2015, he was  named Southport Police Department's ``Officer of the Year,'' after  saving two lives. Among his efforts, he performed CPR to save a man at  the Indiana State Fairgrounds before backup officers arrived with a  defibrillator. In recognition of his work, he became the only full-time  paid officer in an all-volunteer force of reserve officers. He was a  devout volunteer, leader, and role model in Southport, who believed in  community policing and prided himself on stopping to talk with  residents and getting to know them. Lt. Allan made a difference in the  community and always put the safety and well-being of his fellow  citizens first. When he encountered a family whose car would not start  and the husband had been diagnosed with a brain tumor and the wife  cared for her husband and young daughter, Allan went to an auto parts  store and bought the family a new car battery with his own money. It  went beyond that. He participated in ``Shop with a Deputy,''  volunteering to take underprivileged children Christmas shopping. He  also excelled responding to difficult calls, whether a citizen had  overdosed and needed Narcan or he encountered a drunk driver. He  enriched and touched so many lives through his service, and he made the  ultimate sacrifice while responding to fellow citizens in need.   On Thursday, July 27, 2017, Lt. Allan was doing his job, responding  to an incident involving an overturned vehicle in Southport, when he  was shot. Hours before Lt. Allan was killed, he walked his 5-year-old  son, Aaron, Jr., to the bus for his first day of kindergarten. He put  his life on the line so that Hoosiers could have the chance to live in  peace and safety, and we are eternally grateful. He died doing what he  loved, and his legacy will live on.   Lt. Allan was a devoted citizen, son, husband, father, and friend,  who loved his children and his fellow brothers and sisters in blue. He  loved his job as a Southport Police Officer, and no amount of gratitude  can repay Lt. Allan or his loved ones for his sacrifice.   Lt. Allan is survived and deeply missed by his wife, Stacy, their two  sons, his fellow officers in Southport, and citizens across Indiana.  Let us strive to remember and emulate the shining example Lt. Allan set  for us, and honor his selfless commitment to serving his fellow  citizens. May God welcome Lt. Allan home and give comfort to his family  and friends.                            ____________________
