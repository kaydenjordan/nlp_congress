 Madam Chair, I rise today to share my disappointment  and to oppose H.R. 1.   As a Representative of California, I work to find solutions that deal  with price spikes at the pump, bring down high heating bills, and  deliver lower costs overall to my constituents.   You can imagine my optimism when I first saw on our agenda a bill  that supposedly aims at lowering energy costs.   When I read it, I was shocked to see that the only lower thing that  it does is lower standards for our Nation's polluters.   This bill doesn't deliver less cost to families. It only forces more  giveaways of our public lands to Big Oil, the same oil companies that  already have thousands of unused drilling permits.   This bill doesn't decrease energy prices. It increases the number of  loopholes in our public health laws.   This bill just doesn't fail to help families bring their utility  bills down. It actually repeals solutions that we put in place last  year to bring down heating costs and to help folks upgrade to more  efficient home energy appliances.   Higher levels of pollution, higher costs for families, and, let's not  forget, higher budget deficits to the tune of $2.4 billion over the  next decade--is that being fiscally responsible?   Madam Chair, putting polluters ahead of people is bad enough, but  actually raising energy costs and our Federal deficit while proclaiming  to care about this is even worse.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' so we can actually  work together to build on the laws we have passed that promote clean  energy, cut energy costs for families across the country, and reduce  the deficit.
