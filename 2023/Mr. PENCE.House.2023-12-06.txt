 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of my colleague's  legislation, the Choice in Automobile Retail Sales Act.   I thank my colleague, Congressman Walberg, for leading on this  important legislation. After 3 years, it has become abundantly clear  that the administration's approach is bad for my Hoosiers and bad for  the Nation.   You can't create demand by forcing supply. EVs continue to pile up on  dealer lots across the country and in my district.   Almost daily, we hear of auto manufacturers that are tempering  investor expectations because of underwhelming sales. The money is  leaving.   Simply put, people are not buying EVs.   EPA's aggressive rule is a de facto mandate on Hoosiers to switch to  EVs.   This legislation would curb EPA's electrification-or-nothing approach  and allow consumers to choose the best type of vehicle that fits the  needs of their family.   As I have repeatedly stated, this administration is fundamentally  ignoring the reality of energy distribution.    EVs may make sense for densely populated areas, but the  lack of range and insufficient towing capabilities do not meet the  needs of rural Indiana's Sixth District.   The CARS Act will begin to bring sensible policy back to the  forefront and allow American innovation to lead the way to the next  generation of transportation.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.                                time  1300
