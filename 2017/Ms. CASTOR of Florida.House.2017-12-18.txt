 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr.  Courtney, for yielding the time and for his advocacy on behalf of  America's families.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 3759, the RAISE Family Caregivers  Act, and I want to thank my good friend and colleague Congressman Gregg  Harper for being my partner in this endeavor to bring more attention to  the struggle of so many families across the country for more balance,  more support, when they must take care of a sick family member or a  friend.    I would also like to thank Senator Susan Collins and Senator Tammy  Baldwin, who have been tireless champions for caregivers and their  families.   Family caregiving has become the new normal in healthcare here in  America because it is oftentimes astronomically expensive to hire a  caregiver or to get a little respite. Some do, but for many families,  the better decision is a tough one, oftentimes, to make a very  significant personal sacrifice: quit your job or go part-time while  they devote themselves to their loved one.   All too often, caregivers are the only support system for their child  with special needs or an aging family member, and they have little to  no support for themselves.   Many of America's veterans stay integrated in communities because of  the sacrifices of their family members to make sure that they get out  and about and get to their appointments and get the care and  interaction that they need.                                time  1645    Family caregivers help with many basic activities, like eating,  dressing, transportation, bathing; and sometimes they are called upon  to do things that are a little more complicated, such as even a little  bit of medical care or nursing care.   Here are some of the shocking statistics: about 40 million family  caregivers provide about $470 billion annually in unpaid care to their  loved ones, and about 3.7 million family caregivers provide care to a  child under the age of 18 due to a medical or behavioral condition or  disability.   Because of the massive commitment of time, many caregivers leave the  workforce. Caregivers age 50 and older, who leave the workforce to care  for a parent, lose, on average, nearly $304,000 in wages and benefits  over their lifetime. Women are most often the main caregivers and their  average is even higher, about $324,000 in lost benefits and wages.   In my home State of Florida, there are almost 3 million caregivers at  any given time and they provide over 2.6 billion hours of care.   A closer look at the work-related effects, as well as the personal,  financial, and emotional hardships, demonstrates an increasing need to  come together to better understand the unique needs of our caregivers  and what we can do to support them.   That is why Congressman Harper and I introduced the bipartisanship  Recognize, Assist, Include, Support, and Engage--RAISE--Family  Caregivers Act. The RAISE Family Caregivers Act will create and  maintain a common national family caregiver strategy led by the  Secretary of Health and Human Services so that we can develop some  additional support systems for the folks back home.   Our bill will bring together a diverse spectrum of stakeholders,  experts, folks who are working every day to take care of their loved  ones to be a part of the advisory council that will help develop some  additional recommendations, hopefully for this Congress.   We must ensure that family caregivers have the resources and tools  they need to face lost wages and the personal demands of taking care of  their loved one while ensuring that their loved one does receive the  best care.   I would like to thank the AARP, the Alzheimer's Association, the  Elizabeth Dole Foundation, the Family Caregiver Alliance, and so many  more that have encouraged us on this important piece of legislation.   As the complexity and intensity of family caregiving increases, I  believe that this legislation will help boost families and allow us to  be smart and efficient with our resources.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this important bipartisanship bill.
