 Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of my good  friend, the Senator from Oklahoma. I look forward to working with him  on ways that we can try to come together and solve some of these big  problems.   In a minute, I am going to talk about the Affordable Care Act, which  is probably the signature accomplishment of a Democratic Senate and  Congress. It is notable that the Affordable Care Act, for all of its  controversy, reduced the deficit. It did not increase the deficit. It  is also notable that the signature accomplishment of the Republican  Congress and the Republican Senate was a tax reduction bill that has  dramatically spiraled the deficit out of control. There is $2 trillion  of additional deficits in that provision.   I share the concerns about the deficit, and I find it curious that  this Congress, under Republican control, has chosen to dramatically  increase deficits, making us on pace for having the biggest deficits in  our legislative history--with enormous additional new elements of debt  as well.
