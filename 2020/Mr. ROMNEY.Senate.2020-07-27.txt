 I yield the floor.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I rise today to propose the TRUST Act of  2020. This is bipartisan legislation. It is sponsored by 14 other  Senators, both Democrats and Republicans, and supported by 30 Members  from each party from the House.   Its purpose is to preserve the Social Security and Medicare trust  funds, among others, both of which have been pushed closer to  bankruptcy due to the pandemic. The Committee for a Responsible Federal  Budget projects that Medicare Part A will now become insolvent in only  4 years, and the Social Security retirement trust fund by 2031.   Under the law, insolvency would trigger drastic benefit cuts, or, if  approved by a future Congress, draconian tax hikes. Our TRUST Act is  designed to save these trust funds in addition to other vital Federal  trust funds.   The TRUST Act also addresses our ballooning national debt, a burden  which has become even greater due to the COVID-19 crisis. The CBO  projects that the Federal budget deficit will be $3.7 trillion this  year. Our national debt will exceed $27 trillion. That could eventually  mean backbreaking interest payments, runaway inflation, or national  financial calamity.   Modeled loosely after the Simpson-Bowles fiscal commission, the TRUST  Act would create a process to rescue these funds. Under the bill, an  individual rescue committee would be created for each of the trust  funds. Each committee would be tasked with drafting bipartisan  legislation that would provide for its solvency.   Members of the rescue committees would come equally from the House  and the Senate and equally from each party. If the majority of a  committee supported a solvency plan and if at least two members from  each party endorsed that plan, it would be brought, on an expedited  basis, to the floor.   The TRUST Act has strong bipartisan consensus among Senators and  Members of the House, as well as policy advocates across the political  spectrum, from Freedom Works to the Brookings Institution, as well as  from Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles   This is the right time to act. Our trust funds are approaching  insolvency even more rapidly due to the pandemic. More importantly, if  we don't act now, it will never happen before we face an overwhelming  crisis. One of the lessons the COVID-19 crisis has taught us is that it  is far better to prepare and hopefully prevent a crisis than to wait  for a crisis to fall upon us.   The TRUST Act is the only bipartisan, bicameral solution that has  been proposed to save our trust funds and to restore fiscal stability.  I urge this body to work in good faith to advance this proposal as part  of additional pandemic relief                                  ______                                         By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Brown, Ms. Baldwin,          Mr. Durbin, Mr. Casey, Ms. Rosen, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Leahy, Mr.          Reed, Mr. Van Hollen, Ms. Smith, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr.          Blumenthal, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Kaine, Ms. Warren, Mr. Heinrich,          Ms. Harris, Mr. Udall, Mr. Markey, Mr. Merkley, Mrs.          Gillibrand, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Cardin, Ms. Stabenow, Mr.          Booker, Mr. Wyden, Ms. Duckworth, Mrs. Shaheen, and Mr.          Bennet):   S. 4328.
