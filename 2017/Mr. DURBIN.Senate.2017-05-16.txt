 Mr. President, I had a meeting last week in Illinois, and  I asked hospital administrators, doctors, nurses, pediatricians, those  who are in the substance abuse treatment area, what they thought of the  Republican bill. It was all Republicans who passed the healthcare  finance act, whatever the name of it is--their version of the  healthcare system that they are calling for reform in the House of  Representatives. It was interesting. They were unanimously opposed to  it, all of them--hospital administrators, doctors, nurses,  pediatricians, across the board.   Why would all the medical providers in my State be opposed to the  Republican plan that just passed the House of Representatives? Well,  because they have read it. Here is what they found. It threatens the  survival of downstate and inner city hospitals. The Illinois Hospital  Association came out against the Republican plan and said we could lose  60,000 jobs in Illinois, and we could see cutbacks in services in our  hospitals.   I know the Acting President pro tempore from the State of Oklahoma  knows what rural hospitals mean to these small towns. It is not only  life and death to have access to quality healthcare, they are some of  the best paying jobs in town. The thought that those hospitals are  going to see services cut back, people laid off is worth sitting up and  taking notice.   They also are worried because the Congressional Budget Office never  gave an analysis of the Republican plan that passed the House of  Representatives. That is unheard of. When we passed the Affordable Care  Act in the U.S. Senate, we waited week after weary week for the  Congressional Budget Office to analyze each of the major changes. We  didn't want to make a mistake, and we felt obligated to tell the  American people what we were doing to the healthcare system, which is  one-sixth of the national economy.   Somehow the Republican leaders in the House of Representatives paid  no attention to that and passed a bill without a Congressional Budget  Office analysis. Possibly it is because the first version of that bill,  which was analyzed by the CBO, found that it was devastating. Twenty- four million Americans would lose their health insurance under the  Republican plan in its first phase. Twenty-four million Americans lose  their health insurance.   In Illinois, 1 million people--in a State of 12\1/2\ million people,  1 million people living in my State would have lost their health  insurance coverage by the plan proposed initially by the Republicans in  the House, and we also know it would shorten the lifespan of Medicare,  for one thing. We know it allowed for waivers by Governors to eliminate  what they call nonessential services in health insurance.   One of them hits close to home. I can remember as a new Senator  coming to the floor and watching Paul Wellstone, who used to be at that  desk, and Pete Domenici, who used to be at that desk, get up on a  bipartisan basis and argue again and again that every health insurance  plan in America should cover mental illness and substance abuse  treatment. It seems so obvious, and yet they had to fight the insurance  industry for years before we finally achieved it. Now when you buy  health insurance in America, it covers mental illness and substance  abuse treatment. Thank goodness. We need it. We desperately need it.  Yet that becomes one of the nonessential elements in the Republican  analysis of health insurance.   What are they thinking? Have they listened or read recently about the  opioid and heroin crisis in America? I have sat at tables with victims,  addicts who, thank goodness, had an intervention, had an opportunity,  and now can speak of their addiction in the past tense.   These are amazing young people whose lives were compromised and  threatened because of addiction. How did they turn the corner? They  turned the corner because of loving families, their personal  determination, and the availability of medical treatment under their  health insurance plans.   Now the Republicans are arguing in the House of Representatives that  we don't need that coverage, we don't need that protection. We do now  more than ever.   When I hear the Republican leader come to the floor and criticize the  Affordable Care Act, I basically have to ask him, Is this a problem  that is of your own creation?   The Republicans, including the leader, have refused to sit down with  Democrats and work on a bipartisan solution. In fact, when the  Republican leader sat down to determine how the Senate would respond to  the House action, he put together a group of, I believe, 12 Republican  Senators--no Democrats allowed--to sit down and write the alternative.  That is not a good way to start this.   What we ought to do is to say, first, we are not going to repeal the  Affordable Care Act; we are going to improve it, and we will do it on a  bipartisan basis. If the majority leader wants to suggest that, I would  like to be part of it. Many Democrats would like to be part of it. Take  repeal off the table before the conversation on repair begins. I think  that is essential. Let's make sure that within health insurance in  America we have some basics.    First, if you have a preexisting condition, you shouldn't be  disqualified from  [[Page S2939]]  health insurance or you shouldn't have to pay twice the premiums. That  is something that is now built into the law that the Republicans want  to repeal. Well, I want to make sure that preexisting conditions are  protected.   As I have said on the floor before, a couple of weeks ago I had a  heart procedure, a catheter procedure, an outpatient procedure.  Apparently it worked pretty well. I am standing here talking to you  today. I feel good. But a lot of people go through this, and I became a  statistic the day that happened. I guess I now have a preexisting  condition; so be it. One out of three Americans fit that category. Why  would we not protect them in any health insurance reform bill? That  seems like the starting point in our conversation. Yet the bill that  passed the House, the Republican bill that passed the House allows  Governors to basically ask for waivers so that health insurance plans  in their States will not cover people with preexisting conditions or  allow people with those conditions to have the same premiums. That is  not a good starting place. It is a terrible starting place.   Let's try to make sure that if we are going to move forward on real  healthcare reform, we do it in a sensible fashion. Let's put forward a  bill not like the one that passed the House, but let's put together a  bill that has the support of hospital administrators across the Nation.  Let's put together a bill that protects the Medicaid expansion that is  part of the Affordable Care Act.   Medicaid is an essential part of healthcare in America for tens of  millions of people. Medicaid--most people think, oh, that is health  insurance for poor people. Really? That is not an accurate description.  For example, in the State of Illinois, Medicaid provides health  coverage for half of the children who are born in my State--prenatal  care, postnatal care, and the actual delivery of half of the children  in my State, under Medicaid.   That is not the most expensive part of Medicaid. The most expensive  part in my State and across the Nation is the fact that Medicaid is  there to help your mother or grandmother or your dad or your  grandfather when they are in a situation in life where they need a  helping hand. They may be in an assisted care facility, and the Social  Security check is not enough; Medicare is not enough. Medicaid steps in  to make sure they have the quality of care they need. Are we going to  eliminate that kind of protection?   Ask disabled people and ask the organizations that represent them  what it means to have a good strong Medicaid system. These people rely  on Medicaid for maintaining their health through disability, day in and  day out.   So when the Republicans propose an $840 billion cut in Medicaid  protection across America over 10 years, sadly, they are setting out on  a path that could compromise the basic care we need for babies and new  moms, for the elderly in assisted care facilities and nursing  facilities, and for the disabled who live in our States. We don't want  to see that happen.   It is interesting that my Republican Governor in the State of  Illinois seldom comments on Federal legislation. He came out in  opposition to the bill that passed the House of Representatives. He  said that this is a significantly bad bill for the State of Illinois,  and I agree with him. I am glad he spoke up. I don't know how the seven  Republican Congressmen who voted for it in my State can ignore that  reality. Our Governor--our Republican Governor--believes it is bad for  our State in cutting back Medicaid. The hospitals believe it is bad for  our State in the impact that it will have on down-State hospitals.  Doctors, nurses, and pediatricians also oppose it.   What can we do? What should we do? First, we ought to try to see what  we can do to make the Affordable Care Act work better. We can do that  on a bipartisan basis. We want to make sure, as the Senator from  Kentucky said earlier, that there are available health insurance  programs in every county of every State. Certainly, one thing we can do  is make sure that a public option is there for everyone if they choose  it--something that looks like Medicare.   People respect Medicare. Medicare is a great program for millions of  Americans who are seniors and disabled. Why wouldn't we create a  program like Medicare--a not-for-profit, government-operated program  like Medicare for people who wish to have it? Those who don't can stick  with private insurance if that is their choice, but I believe more and  more people will move toward the Medicare option. That is something I  would like to put on the table in reforming the Affordable Care Act.   Secondly, we need to address the cost of pharmaceutical drugs in  America. The costs are out of control.   This week I received a publication from the AARP, the American  Association of Retired Persons, and they are talking about what is  happening to pharmaceutical prices across America. You don't have to  tell seniors or those who buy prescription drugs what the reality  happens to be.   Let me give you a few numbers to demonstrate why we need to have a  new program to make sure drug prices don't go out of control. According  to AARP, Americans spent $457 billion on prescription drugs in 2015, up  about 8 percent over the previous year--$457 billion. The rise in  prices for the most popular brand name drugs from 2008 to 2016 is over  200 percent. They have more than doubled in that 8-year period of time  for the most popular drugs.   The median salary of a pharmaceutical firm's CEO in 2015 was $14.5  million, more than any other industry; $6.4 billion is the amount drug  companies spend advertising directly to consumers in the U.S. annually;  $24 billion is the amount drug companies spend per year marketing to  doctors. We are one of only two nations in the world that allows direct  consumer advertising. Think about what that means.   When you see all these ads on television for drugs with names you  can't pronounce, why are they doing it? It is because the drug  companies know that consumers across America will write down the name  of the drug and go ask the doctor to prescribe it. Many times, the  doctor, rather than debate the issue with the patient or suggest they  don't need it or should use a generic, will just write out the  prescription. What happens? More expensive drugs get into the system,  raising the cost of healthcare, raising the cost of premiums for health  insurance. It doesn't make us healthier; it just means healthcare is  more expensive.   I love to listen to the warnings on these drugs that go on and on and  on. One of my favorites was this: Be sure and tell your doctor if you  have had a liver transplant. I am thinking to myself, yeah, I think I  would probably mention that somewhere along the way to a doctor.   These warnings should give us fair warning that this is inflating the  cost of healthcare across America. It is not making us healthier, and  it is running up profits dramatically for pharmaceutical companies. Why  is it that exactly the same drugs made in the United States sell for a  fraction of their cost in America in places like Canada and Europe? It  is a legitimate question. We ought to address it. Do we have the  political nerve to do it? I hope so, as part of the Affordable Care Act  reform. I hope we sit down and do something on a bipartisan basis to  deal with the challenges we face, but first, take repeal off the table.   Let's make the Affordable Care Act stronger. Let's do it on a  bipartisan basis. Let's set out to come up with a solution that doesn't  do what the House version did, which could eliminate health insurance  for millions of people across America and a million people in my State  of Illinois.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, last week, the American people were  stunned by what we learned happened in the White House. We saw an  alarming set of developments about how this President is handling the  investigation into Russia's interference with our democracy.   Last Monday, the Senate Judiciary Committee heard testimony from  Sally Yates, whom President Trump had asked to serve as Acting Attorney  General when he was first sworn into office. Ms. Yates testified that  soon after the inauguration, she twice visited White House Counsel Don  McGahn to warn him about National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. She  warned that General Flynn had been compromised by his secret  communications with Russian Ambassador Kislyak and that General Flynn  could be blackmailed.   Ms. Yates first visited White House Counsel McGahn on January 26.  McGahn invited her back to ask followup questions the following day, on  January 27. Those followups included questions about General Flynn's  potential criminal exposure.   What else happened on January 27? The President of the United States  brought in FBI Director James Comey for a one-on-one dinner, where he  reportedly asked Director Comey for a pledge of loyalty. Is the timing  of this Comey dinner curious? You bet it is. According to Press  Secretary Sean Spicer, President Trump was briefed immediately by White  House Counsel McGahn after Ms. Yates' warning. That means the President  knew about the Justice Department's concerns with Flynn when he met  Director Comey for dinner.   Was the President's request for loyalty from Director Comey an  attempt to impede the Justice Department's investigation into General  Flynn? Was it an effort by the President to inoculate himself from  Russia-related investigations? These are unanswered questions. But when  Director Comey reportedly refused to swear his loyalty to President  Trump, he apparently sealed his fate as Director of the FBI.   Last Tuesday evening, President Trump fired Director Comey while  Comey was giving a speech to FBI agents in Los Angeles. The reason?  Well, on Thursday, the President made clear that the Russia  investigation was on his mind when he fired Director Comey. He said to  Lester Holt of NBC: ``When I decided to do it, I said to myself, you  know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made up story.''  President Trump later said that the Russia investigation ``should be  over with, in my opinion, should have been over a long time ago.''  Then, on Friday, the President found time to threaten Mr. Comey on  Twitter, implying that he had taped their conversations and that he  would release the tapes if Comey disclosed what he knew.  [[Page S2943]]    Let's be clear. The President is in dangerous territory here. What  the President is doing when it comes to potential obstruction of  justice is similar to a chapter in history many of us remember. On  October 20, 1973, President Nixon fired special prosecutor Archibald  Cox when his Watergate investigation got too close to the White House.  That sparked a constitutional crisis in America.   Now we have learned that President Trump has disclosed highly  classified information to the Russian Foreign Minister and that same  Ambassador, Kislyak. The Washington Post reported that the President  specifically revealed extremely sensitive intelligence considered so  sensitive that details were being withheld from America's allies and  tightly restricted even within our own government. Last night, the  White House denied this happened. This morning, however, President  Trump confirmed in two separate tweets that the story was true.   This kind of disclosure is what former Director Comey and just about  every other congressional Republican described last year as ``extremely  reckless'' in the handling of classified information. It jeopardizes  critical intelligence sources in the fight against ISIL and the broader  fight by America against terrorism.   This morning, European officials reacted, told the Associated Press  that at least one European country might stop sharing intelligence with  the United States if this is how it is going to be treated. That is  not, as the majority leader described it this morning, ``drama.'' This  is a real consequence of a dangerous President putting American lives  at risk. This is truly incredible and historic. It is a national  security breach by the President of incredible proportions. How in the  world can we trust the President to put the national security needs of  the American people ahead of his own?   There are a lot of parallels between the Watergate era and what we  see today, but one major difference from the Nixon era to the Trump era  is the willingness of Republicans in Congress to speak out against the  abuse of power and to actually serve as a check on the Presidency. Back  in Nixon's day, there were Republicans in Congress who were willing to  speak truth to power, to say: Enough of the lies and damage to our  democratic institutions, and to put the country ahead of party.   Listen, in November of 1973, just a few weeks after the Saturday  Night Massacre, Senator Edward Brooke of Massachusetts was one of the  first Republicans to stand up and say he did not feel the country could  ``stand the trauma that it has been through for the past few months.''   In July of 1974, Republican Congressman Lawrence Hogan of Maryland  said:         The evidence convinces me that my President has lied       repeatedly, deceiving public officials and the American       people. . . . Do we want to be the party loyalists who in       ringing rhetoric condemn the wrongdoings and scandals of the       Democratic Party and excuse them when they are done by       Republicans?    On the same day, Republican Congressman William Cohen of Maine said:         I have been faced with the terrible responsibility of       assessing the conduct of a President that I voted for,       believed to be the best man to lead this country, who has       made significant lasting contributions toward securing peace       in this country and throughout the world, but a President who       in the process, by act or acquiescence, allowed the rule of       law and the Constitution to slip under the boots of       indifference and arrogance and abuse.    Republican Congressman from Virginia M. Caldwell Butler said:         For years we Republicans have campaigned against corruption       and misconduct. . . . But Watergate is our shame.    Republican Congressman Paul Findley of Illinois, whom I ran against  when I first had the privilege to serve in the House and whom today I  call a friend, said a month later:         Hearings of the Judiciary Committee and developments in the       courts have, I believe, clearly established gross negligence,       maladministration and moral insensitivity on the part of the       President.    That same month, Republican Senator Barry Goldwater from Arizona  said:         There are only so many lies you can take, and now there has       been one too many.    In fact, at the same time, Senate Republicans nominated Goldwater to  deliver a direct message to President Nixon. Goldwater, along with the  House Republican leader, John Jacob Rhodes, and the Senate Republican  leader, Hugh Scott, went to the White House, sat directly in front of  President Nixon's desk, and explained that enough was enough.   These courageous Republicans were, of course, talking about lies,  corruption, the obstruction of justice, and a danger to our democratic  system of government emanating from the Nixon White House. They took  our oath of office to protect the Constitution against all enemies,  foreign and domestic, and certainly above a party or short-term policy  gain--they took it seriously, and to their courage, we and history owe  them a debt of gratitude.   So I ask today, amid a swirling and deeply troubling mix of lies-- nearly 500 in just the first 100 days of this new Presidency-- obfuscation, the withholding of information, attempts to interfere with  Federal investigations regarding possible collusion with a foreign  adversary, and thinly veiled threats against those involved in such  investigations by our current President, where are the many Republican  patriots who are ready to stand up against these troubling abuses and  threats?   It has now been more than 7 months since 17 of our intelligence  agencies provided overwhelming evidence of a Russian attack on our  democracy and an attempt to help elect someone seen as more favorable  to their interests, not our interests. The evidence was damning and  continues to emerge. Yet what has this Congress done during this same  7-month period to uphold our oath to ``support and defend the  Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and  domestic''?   Have congressional Republicans launched an independent investigation  into this historic cyber act of war as we did after 9/11?  Unfortunately, no.   Have congressional Republicans retaliated against Russia for its  actions by imposing sanctions or taking other actions, making sure its  leadership knows it will pay a price for such attacks and think twice  before doing so against the United States or at the expense of our  allies? No.   Have Republicans in Congress passed meaningful cybersecurity  legislation to help protect America against future attacks and help any  States that request help? No.   Have Republicans demanded the appointment of a special prosecutor and  insisted that the White House turn over all documents regarding the  Trump campaign and ties with Russia, including potentially Russian  intelligence? No.   Have Republicans demanded that the President explain why he keeps  denying Russia's attack on our election in the face of overwhelming  evidence? No.   In fact, has the majority party done anything to respond to, protect  against, or even address these troubling attacks and refusals to  cooperate from the White House? Sadly, no.   Let me tell you what the majority party has found time to pursue  during the 7 months after an attack on our Nation--a cyber act of war  that will live in cyber infamy. Some of this you simply cannot make up.   The Republican majorities in the House and in the Senate passed  legislation making it easier to kill baby bear cubs and their mothers  in their dens, making it easier to work with corrupt regimes overseas,  making it harder for Americans to save for retirement, and they are  trying to strip healthcare away from millions of Americans in order to  pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America.   This is, quite simply, an abdication of the majority party's  responsibility in Congress to address an attack by a foreign power on  our Nation and investigate possible collusion by an erratic and  sometimes deceptive White House.   Let me close by asking my Republican colleagues, whom I know care  very deeply about the Senate and our Nation, When will you speak up  about the travesty unfolding? When will you take even a fraction of the  action that would have most certainly occurred if these outrages had  occurred under a Democratic President?   We need Republicans in Congress to stand up and protect our  democratic institutions and to support a special prosecutor and an  independent investigation into the Russian election interference now.   I am hopeful some Republican Senators will have the courage to join  us  [[Page S2944]]  in calling for a special prosecutor. We need someone above politics and  above the controversy whom we can trust to really pursue the facts and  the evidence, wherever it may lead, to determine what we can do to  protect America from another Russian attack in our next election and to  hold Russia accountable for what we have been through. It is time to do  this on a bipartisan basis. America is waiting.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Flake). If no one seeks recognition, time  will be charged equally to both sides.   The Senator from Louisiana.    Mr. President, Congress often considers issues that have  far reaching consequences for millions of people, but in 2010, a law  was enacted that literally meant life-or-death for millions of people  in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The law stems the flow of  financial support to warloads in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  Many may not realize that more than 5 million people have been killed  during long-running conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,  which have been the most deadly since World War II. Tragically, women  and children have suffered the most, as is too often the case when it  comes to conflict.   Millions have been displaced from their homes, and the prevalence of  rape and sexual violence as a weapon of war is almost beyond belief,  earning eastern Congo the grim distinction of being the ``Rape Capital  of the World.'' Sam Brownback first took me there in 2005, and I  returned again in 2010. At the time, the U.N. reported that about 1,000  women were sexually assaulted every day in Congo, roughly equivalent to  12 percent of all Congolese women. I can still vividly remember walking  across the lava-strewn refugee camps and visiting the victims of sexual  assault in the heroic Heal Africa Hospital. I also recall the hearing I  held in the Judiciary Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law about  rape as a weapon of war. Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege testified about  the horrors of the region's sexual violence he helped treat at Panzi  Hospital. One of the drivers and funders of this conflict was  paradoxically that which fills the DRC with such potential: its natural  resources. Instead of paying for the nation's peace, education, roads,  and public health programs, the DRC's mineral wealth was being siphoned  off to fund the armed groups that vie for local and regional control of  vast areas far from Congo's capital, Kinshasa.   Tin, tantalum, tungsten, and gold are found in everyday electronics,  jewelry, airplanes, and manufacturing equipment, but these minerals  also have provided weapons and salaries to fighters, including  conscripted child soldiers, who then commit unspeakable horrors on  innocent civilians. That is why, in 2009, I joined Senators Brownback  and Feingold and Congressman McDermott in drafting a simple reporting  requirement for US-registered corporations that source these four  minerals from the DRC or its neighbors. It passed and became law in  2010 to help stem the flow of financial support from illicit mining to  the region's horrific violence.   It wasn't a ban. It was simply a transparency measure that said if  you use any of these key minerals from the region, you had to note in  your filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission what, if  anything, you were doing to not source from those fueling the region's  violence. If a company isn't taking any action to avoid fueling the  region's violence, there isn't a penalty, but at least consumers would  know that. This gives consumers the final decision on what electronics  they want in their pockets. On a broader scale, the measure aimed to  use collective industry action to clean up the supply chain of these  minerals, which I am proud to say has worked.   For example, before the law, not a single smelter of tin, tungsten,  tantalum--also known as the 3Ts--or gold had submitted to and passed an  audit about dealing in conflict minerals. Today, 76 percent of the  world's smelters of the 3Ts or gold have passed such an audit. Today  more than 200 mines have also now been certified as conflict free. The  effects of supply chain due diligence in this region are remarkable and  are due to the leadership of many in the industry, including Intel,  Apple, Kemet, and a number of companies from Illinois, including  Motorola and AAR Corp. This process is far from complete or perfect,  but the conflict minerals law has helped clean up the minerals trade  and ease the grip Congolese warlords have had on the mining sector.   So imagine my dismay when I recently learned the Acting Chairman of  the Securities and Exchange Commission, Michael Piwowar, unilaterally  instructed his staff to halt enforcement of the law. In his April 7  statement, he mistakenly conflated aspects of an earlier court decision  to justify his actions. It sets a dangerous precedent when an Acting  Chairman decides which laws the SEC should and should not enforce.   Let me be clear, this unilateral action was without legal basis and  is beyond the scope of the Acting Chairman's authority. As such, I urge  the Acting Chairman to rescind his directive and allow full enforcement  of the Conflict Minerals law and rule. This isn't just about enforcing  the law as written by Congress, this is life-or-  [[Page S2962]]  death for millions of people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.  The Acting Chairman would be well advised to remember that.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to  acknowledge Ann Kalayil. Earlier this year, after 6 years, Ann stepped  down as Regional Administrator of the U.S. General Services  Administration's--GSA--Great Lakes Region. Ann Kalayil is a  trailblazer. She is the first woman--and first Asian American--to serve  as GSA Administrator of the six-State Great Lakes Region. I am honored  to congratulate her on a job well done.   Headquartered in Chicago, IL, the GSA is the Federal Government's  real estate and procurement manager. As Regional Administrator, Ann  Kalayil was responsible for 128 Federal buildings, 986 leased  locations, 11 U.S. land ports, nearly 1,000 employees, and about $150  million in contracts to small and economically disadvantaged  businesses. To say Ann Kalayil had a big job is an understatement, but  it will come as no surprise to the people who know her that she met the  challenge head-on and thrived in the role.   Her story is the story of the American dream. Born in Chicago, Ann  was the daughter of Indian immigrants. When she was 5 years old, her  parents moved back to Kerala, India. It was the first time Ann met her  siblings, Tom, Sales, and Lisa. They were ecstatic to meet their baby  sister but spoke very little English and struggled to communicate with  each other. So what did Ann do? She took it upon herself to learn  Malayalam, a South Indian language native to Kerala, India. Malayalam  is an extremely complicated language, but Ann picked it up immediately,  and people never guessed it wasn't her first language. This is how Ann  would handle situations throughout her career. She never feared going  out of her way to learn the needs of the community or group, even if it  meant she would do most of the work. All that matters to Ann Kalayil is  getting results.   People who know Ann best describe her as fierce, outspoken, and  compassionate--just like her late father, Philip Kalayil. Her dad  taught her the importance of these shared values and public service.  Philip Kalayil was a Chicagoland legend. He was leader in the Indian  American community, starting organizations to help people stay in touch  with their culture and religion. Later, he would start the Indo- American Democratic Organization, empowering people to register to vote  and make their voices heard. Ann would later serve as its president. In  2008, Philip was recognized by the Association for Asian American  Studies with its Heart of Asian America Community Award, a well- deserved honor.   You could say public service was in Ann's blood, and although Philip  is no longer with us, I know he would feel the same way. What a proud  moment it must have been for him, watching his youngest daughter being  sworn in to a top Federal job--appointed by the President of the United  States--while holding the family Bible.   Growing up as Philip Kalayil's daughter, Ann had a front row seat in  how to be a leader in the community and has waged countless successful  campaigns, issues ranging from education policy, campaign finance  reform, immigration reform, and documenting Asian American history.  During the 2008 Presidential campaign, Ann cochaired Obama's Asian  American and Pacific Islander Leadership Council and was among a select  few who was in a reserved area near the stage in Grant Park when Obama  greeted a crowd of nearly 200,000 to celebrate the historic election.  For all she takes on, her brother Tom only recalls seeing Ann nervous  once, and it was when she was asked to throw the first pitch at a  Chicago White Sox game following her appointment at the GSA.   Prior to her appointment at the GSA, Ann worked for more than 12  years at the University of Chicago in Information Technology Services  in Emerging Technologies and Communications and as director of Client  Services and Support. Like her father, she was also a teacher. Ann  taught interdisciplinary courses on Asian Americans at DePaul  University, Loyola University Chicago, and the University of Illinois  at Chicago. Ann also holds a bachelor's degree in political science  from the University of Illinois at Chicago, a bachelor's degree in  computer science from Northeastern Illinois University, a master's  degree in Asian studies from the University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, and a doctorate from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.   I want to congratulate Ann Kalayil on her wonderful career and her  outstanding service to our community and the country. I wish her all  the best.                            ____________________
