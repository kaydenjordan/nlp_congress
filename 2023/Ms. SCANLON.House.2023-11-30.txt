 Mr. Speaker, while gun deaths in the United States far  outpace those of other countries and now are the leading cause of death  among children under 18, recent CDC  [[Page H5993]]  data shows a glimmer of hope: Gun homicides are down slightly from  2021.   We have seen this reduction in places like Philadelphia and Chester  as a host of community violence prevention programs, funded by the  American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, take  hold.   Tragically, the data also shows gun suicides reached a record high  last year with nearly 27,000 people across the United States dying from  gun suicide. More than half of gun deaths in Pennsylvania alone were  from suicides last year.   We have ways to reduce gun suicide in this country, red flag laws,  safe storage, and waiting periods, all of which have been proven to  reduce gun suicide, but the NRA and extremist Republicans continue to  block these commonsense constitutional measures which can save lives.   When we speak about gun violence, we often say there are solutions,  research-based solutions. We don't have to live this way. Today, I will  add that in the case of gun suicide, we should also be mindful that  people don't have to die this way.   By creating legal space between a person in crisis and access to a  firearm, more people will live and more families will be spared the  immeasurable pain of losing a loved one. We need Congressional action  now.                      Election Misinformation Continues     Mr. Speaker, election misinformation continues to plague  our country as leaders who know better repeat or fail to contradict  baseless conspiracy theories and lies about the integrity of our  elections. Not only do these lies and conspiracy theories undermine  public faith in our democracy and elections, they cost taxpayer  dollars.   Since the 2020 election, in the county where I live, we have seen  multiple baseless lawsuits filed seeking to overturn or audit election  results. None of them have produced evidence of misconduct or  inaccurate results. What they have done is cost taxpayer dollars in  legal fees, court resources, and time and effort by county employees  and election officials that have to be diverted to defending these  groundless suits.   I am proud of the professional administrators and volunteers who work  so diligently every election to safeguard our democracy and make it  work, but it is also important that leaders from across the political  spectrum step up and stand up for our democratic processes and call out  those who are trying to undermine them, as well as call out those who  are wasting taxpayer dollars.                            ____________________
