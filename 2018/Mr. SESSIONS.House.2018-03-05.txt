 Mr. Speaker, it is my honor tonight to recognize and  honor my fraternity, Pi Kappa Alpha International Fraternity.   I came from Alpha Omicron Chapter in Georgetown, Texas, Southwestern  University.   Pi Kappa Alpha is an international fraternity, a values-based men's  fraternal organization with more than 225 chapters across the United  States and Canada, approximately 16,000 undergraduate members, and over  290,000 lifetime members.   In 2018, Pi Kappa Alpha celebrates its 150th anniversary from its  founding on March 1, 1868, at the University of Virginia, when six  young men joined together and resolved to form a fraternity for the  establishment of friendship on a firmer and more lasting basis.   Their commitment to the high ideals of scholarship, leadership, and  gentlemanly behavior remains strong to this day, which is the reason  why I not only pledged my support to the fraternity, but why I support  them today.                            ____________________
