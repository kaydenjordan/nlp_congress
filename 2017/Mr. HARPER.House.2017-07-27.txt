 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the  Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 3298) to authorize the Capitol Police  Board to make payments from the United States Capitol Police Memorial  Fund to employees of the United States Capitol Police who have  sustained serious line-of-duty injuries, and for other purposes, with  the Senate amendment thereto, and concur in the Senate amendment.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.
