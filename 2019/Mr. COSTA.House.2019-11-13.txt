 Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk about an important  issue affecting our country, and that is Dreamers, many of whom are in  Washington this week, fighting for their lives in front of the United  States Supreme Court.   Dreamers are Americans just like you and me, and they should be  treated as such. When the Obama administration established the Deferred  Action for Childhood Arrivals, these were infants from 6 months to 6  years of age and anywhere in between. These Dreamers came here through  no choice of their own, but for them, this is the only country they  have ever known.   They were qualified and granted, under this program enacted by the  Obama administration, to be protected from deportation and, thus,  granted a legal status.   Since then, these young people have made immense contributions to our  society every day. They are our friends. They are our neighbors.   But they have been betrayed by this administration's cruel policies  toward migrant communities, including the efforts to repeal the  Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, otherwise known as DACA, and to  dismantle the advance parole initiative, which was a part of this  effort and allows Dreamers to visit their loved ones in the event that  there is a wedding, a funeral, and some other critical moments in their  lives with their families in the country that they originally came  from.   These cruel and shameless policies have thrown the lives of these  people, most of them young, into chaos. They live in fear every day,  fear to see if they will be removed, deported from the only home that  they have ever known, from the only country they really have ever  known.   Living with this uncertainty is not right. It is unfair, and it is  unjust. It is not the American way.   For 243 years, America has been a beacon of shining light for  immigrants around the world. In this case, we made promises to protect  Dreamers. If the Supreme Court rescinds these protections, I believe  Congress must keep fighting. I will keep fighting.   I know these Dreamers. I have visited with them. They are in my  schools, in the community colleges, and in the State universities.                                time  1745    And so I want them to know, I want you to know because these Dreamers  reflect and represent what? The American Dream.   What is the American Dream? The American Dream is about immigrants  past and immigrants present, and it is the embodiment of what Dreamers  are a part of.   So I ask my colleagues to join with us this afternoon in standing up  and speaking out for those Dreamers.
