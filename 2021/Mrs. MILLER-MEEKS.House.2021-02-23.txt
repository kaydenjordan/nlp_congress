 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  accomplishments of someone in my district who is not as vertically  challenged as I am.   This past weekend, University of Iowa men's basketball player Luka  Garza broke the University of Iowa's all-time scoring record in  basketball. The new record of 2,126 points put Luka ahead of the late  Roy Marble, who held the previous record of 2,116 points for over 30  years.   A native of the D.C. area, Luka was a star player for the Maret  School, leading the Frogs to a city championship while being named  Gatorade D.C. Player of the Year and setting the school points record.   Luka has been a dominant player in college basketball since his first  game as a University of Iowa Hawkeye against Chicago State. Since then,  he has gone on to win numerous conference and national awards,  including Big Ten Player of Year and the Sporting News Player of the  Year last season.   As a former faculty member at the university, I was thrilled when  Luka decided to return to Iowa City for his senior season instead of  heading to the NBA draft. With four regular season games, the Big Ten  Tournament, and March Madness left, I have no doubt that Luka will  continue to break his own record and make Iowa proud and the best place  to live, work, play, and raise a family.                            ____________________
