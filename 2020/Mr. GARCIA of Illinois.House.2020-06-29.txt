 Mr. Speaker, I thank Madam Chair for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Emergency Housing Protections  and Relief Act. This bill provides much-needed relief for renters and  homeowners while more than 40 million people have filed for  unemployment insurance and struggle to make ends meet.   My constituents need the help. My district is a working-class,  largely immigrant district, and many people have not qualified for any  relief so far.                                time  1500    Families just down the street in the barrio where I live and have  lived for 50 years are being forced to choose between paying rent and  putting food on the table or between making the mortgage payment or  buying prescription medicine. Families are staring down the barrel at  yet another first-of-the-month difficult decision: Will my family have  a place to live?   Will we have food to eat?   Where will we go?   These are the very real questions that families are asking  themselves.   Mr. Speaker, we must act with urgency to protect families. This  Emergency Housing Protections and Relief Act is a lifeline for  communities like mine. It prohibits landlords from evicting tenants for  failure to pay rent; it provides $100 billion of assistance to renters  and $75 billion to homeowners to keep everyone in their homes; and it  strengthens the mortgage forbearance protections.   I know what a housing crisis looks like. During the last financial  crisis, I saw my neighbors lose their homes. Without protections in  place, economic recovery will be all but impossible. Congress must act  now and pass H.R. 7301 to support our renters and homeowners.
