 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and  congratulate Plant City Fire Rescue's Firefighter of the Year, Devin  Johnson.   Mr. Johnson has the true heart of a public servant and has selflessly  served our Plant City community for the past 5 years as a paramedic and  firefighter.   In 2021, Mr. Johnson completed the necessary certification to become  a standalone paramedic and provide the highest level of lifesaving care  to our community.   This year alone, Mr. Johnson has provided over 1,000 hours as a field  training officer in the paramedic internship program, leading and  guiding students to better their community. He has also worked more  than 500 hours of overtime to keep the fire rescue running  operationally.   Mr. Johnson's Plant City Fire Rescue colleagues recognized him for  his hard work, reliability, expertise, and continued dedication to the  department and to our community.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Firefighter Johnson, and I thank him for  his service to our community.                            ____________________
