 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a member of the Climate  Solutions Caucus to speak on the issue of climate change. The caucus is  a bipartisan group of members committed to implementing economically  viable options to reduce climate risk.   The caucus has a ``Noah's Ark'' membership rule. Members can only  join in pairs, one from each party. Under the leadership of co-chairs  Mr. Curbelo and Mr. Deutch, the caucus is helping to break the partisan  gridlock on this issue and show that promoting climate solutions can be  truly bipartisan.   The formation and rapid growth of the Climate Solutions Caucus  represents a recognition of both the challenges and opportunities and  has demonstrated that there is bipartisan will to take action.   In recognition of the fact that 60 Members of Congress have come  together to fight climate change in a bipartisan fashion, I organized  this time for my colleagues to join me on the floor to let the American  people know what we, as their elected leaders, are doing to address  climate change.   We know, from scientific evidence, that our climate is changing. The  global average temperature has increased by about 1.4 degrees  Fahrenheit over the last 100 years. Sea levels are rising, the ocean is  becoming more acidic, precipitation patterns are changing, and heat  waves are becoming more frequent and longer in duration.   Each of these changes produces a cascade of effects that impact our  lives and livelihoods, including flooding, changes in crop yields,  power shortages, declines in fisheries, and increases in cardiovascular  disease.   Recent events in our own country, such as devastating hurricanes in  the Southeast and wildfires in the West have brought this issue to the  forefront of everyone's minds. Now climate  [[Page H8375]]  change can't be directly blamed for all these problems, but the  evidence strongly suggests that it contributes to each of them, and  there are things that we can do to limit its effects.   Climate change also has a significant impact on public health. A  groundbreaking study published just this week in a medical journal, The  Lancet, unequivocally showed that climate change is a serious public  health threat. The study involved 24 institutions from around the world  and included staggering statistics, such as the fact that air pollution  caused 1.9 million premature deaths in Asia in 2015, and that the range  of common disease-transmitting mosquitoes increased 9.5 percent since  1950.   We know that high temperatures exasperate health problems and that  burning fossil fuels creates pollution that causes cardiovascular  disease. The National Academies estimate that air pollution causes  around $120 billion per year in health-related damages, including  healthcare costs, missed days of work and school, and premature death.   We also know that changing climate has altered the range, in some  cases accelerated the spread of vector-borne diseases likes Zika and  the West Nile virus. Responsibly transitioning to a clean energy  economy will not only reduce the greenhouse gas emissions that  contribute to climate change, but it will also reduce air pollution and  help all Americans breathe easier.   What I want to talk about for a few minutes, before I turn to some of  my colleagues, is a very common misperception about the relationship  between implementing climate solutions and growing jobs.   Some people think that this is a zero-sum game. That is, they think  if you have more of one, you get less of the other. But that is simply  not true.   Implementing climate solutions can grow jobs, especially new high- paying jobs. The U.S. needs to take advantage of these economic  opportunities. Regardless of what we do here in the U.S., the rest of  the world has committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and  reaching the targets laid out in the Paris Agreement, as have many  cities, States, and companies here at home.   To achieve that goal, significant technological development and  innovation will be needed, as well as infrastructure, markets, and  distribution channels to get that technology to the people and places  that need it.   The national economies that produce this clean energy technology will  benefit greatly. The U.S. still leads the world in technology and  innovation. Countries around the world try to recreate the innovation  ethos that exists in Silicon Valley and in other places across our  Nation.   The United States also has the workers who are needed to build these  innovations. So we have what it takes, and if we seize the opportunity  to invest in clean and climate-resilient technologies, then our economy  and the American people will benefit as the world adapts to climate  change and America grows good-paying jobs all across our Nation.   But if we let this opportunity pass us by, then profits and jobs will  instead flow to foreign countries that develop the technologies the  world needs, and American cities and States will be forced to buy  foreign products as they upgrade to climate-resilient infrastructure.                                time  2000    That is why I will soon be introducing a bill called Challenges and  Prizes for Climate Act. This bill will establish five or more prize  challenges overseen by the Department of Energy to harness the  ingenuity of the research community in the private sector to solve big,  complex climate problems.   Challenges have been used in the past by a wide range of  organizations, including the XPRIZE, who used the challenge to jump- start the commercial space transportation industry. This industry is  now flourishing.   I was just recently at SpaceX in California and saw their impressive  manufacturing facility they have there. The U.S. is now relying on  SpaceX in order to bring supplies up to the International Space Station  and their plans to soon be flying astronauts. This commercial space  transportation industry began with those who reached to try to meet  this challenge and get the XPRIZE.   The Federal Trade Commission also used the prize challenge to help  bring a robocall blocking service to the market, something that we can  all very much appreciate. That is why I am going this direction.   My bill will create challenges that fall under five themes: carbon  capture and reuse, energy efficiency, energy storage, climate  adaptation and resiliency, and data analytics for better climate  predictions.   Using authority from the America COMPETES Act, the Department of  Energy will convene working groups from across agencies, universities,  nonprofits and the private sector to help plan the challenges, and even  to contribute to the prizes.   The goal of the challenge is not just to reward the winner of the  best solution, but also to bring visibility to the range of innovations  competing for the prize and to help society envision the future. This  bill will help us see what our clean energy future will look like, and  I urge all of my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I want to begin hearing from the bipartisan group of  climate leaders who have joined me here on the floor this evening.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Fitzpatrick), my Republican colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Fitzpatrick for his leadership  and jumping in, in his firm term here in the House leadership, on  coming to solutions on climate change.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney),  my colleague who I have been working with for a number of years here in  the House, a very dedicated Member, especially when it comes to issues  of science and climate change.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. McNerney for all the work that  he does on this issue and many other issues here in the House.   Mr. Speaker, I am going to go back to the other side of the aisle. I  yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Faso).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Faso for his work,  understanding that we are only going to make progress on this through  bipartisan action. I am very happy to join working with him on the  Climate Solutions Caucus to bring that action forward.   Mr. Speaker, my next speaker is a woman who I work with on the  Science, Space, and Technology Committee, who has done some fantastic  work on that committee, especially when it comes to the issue of  climate change and dealing with climate change.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici).                                time  2015     Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Bonamici for speaking tonight.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman who really deserves a  tremendous amount of credit for all of us being here tonight. He is the  co-chair of the Climate Solutions Caucus, the gentleman from Florida  (Mr. Deutch).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Deutch for his leadership of  the Climate Solutions Caucus.   Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining.    Mr. Speaker, with that, I yield to my colleague, the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Suozzi).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for all of his work  on this and other issues.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Carbajal), my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Carbajal for his work. That  was a great lead-in to our next speaker. We just had, a couple of  speakers ago, the Democratic co-chair of the Climate Solutions Caucus.  Our next speaker is the Republican co-chair. I give him a lot of credit  and I thank him for the work that he has done in putting this caucus  together.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Curbelo for his leadership and  for pointing out some of the victories that we already have had here on  this House floor, the Climate Solutions Caucus. That is just the  beginning. There will be plenty more to come as we grow this caucus and  do the work that we are here to do.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Panetta),  a freshman Member who is already making a big splash here getting a lot  done in Washington, working especially on a bipartisan basis on a lot  of these issues, getting some good things done.     Mr. Speaker, at this time, I just want to thank all my  colleagues for their leadership on this issue. The time to take action  on climate is now. We can't leave this problem to future generations to  solve for us. As we heard this evening, there is no shortage of good  ideas for how to do so.  [[Page H8381]]    I want to close by reading the mission statement of the Climate  Solutions Caucus, which reminds us of the many reasons why our  bipartisan group has come together to take action:   ``The members of the Climate Solutions Caucus acknowledge the fact  that, if left unaddressed, the consequences of a changing climate have  the potential to adversely affect the health of all Americans and the  strength of our economy, consequently imposing substantial costs on  both State and Federal budgets.   ``By seeking to reduce climate risk, we will, in turn, ensure the  protection of our economy, infrastructure, and public safety, all while  attaining energy independence from the world's most volatile regions.  Therefore, it is our goal to take a market-based approach to  substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the United States in  order to leave a better planet and stronger economy for future  generations.''   Mr. Speaker, this is something that all Americans can endorse and  support. It is a better world and a better country.   So I thank, again, all my colleagues for joining me here tonight, and  for their work, all of the 60 members--30 Democrats, 30 Republicans-- for their work on the Climate Solutions Caucus.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
