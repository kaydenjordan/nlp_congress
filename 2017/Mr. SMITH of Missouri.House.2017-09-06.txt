 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division H (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used in contravention of section 642(a) of the Illegal       Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996       (8 U.S.C. 1373(a)).    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from Missouri (Mr. Smith) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is very  straightforward. It just requires that funds in Transportation, Housing  and Urban Development, and Related Agencies only go to cities and  States that uphold Federal law.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, immigration enforcement is  a Federal responsibility. Local law enforcement is not and should not  be the long arm of ICE. And if it is perceived to be the long arm of  ICE, it is going to be very difficult to work with the community to do  what needs to be done for local law enforcement and community  protection.   The end result would tear entire communities apart, would greatly  hinder the ability of local law enforcement to effectively do their  job.   Furthermore, this amendment has no place in the T-HUD appropriations  bill. The employees of the Department of Transportation, Housing and  Urban Development are not law enforcement. They do not routinely need  to interact with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. This amendment  would insert unnecessary controversy into the bill. It does nothing to  improve transportation. It does nothing to provide housing for  vulnerable Americans. It doesn't change existing law, nor does it  change the way HUD and DOT programs are administered.   The underlying bill has enough challenges as written without adding  something of this moment and this divisiveness. So I urge defeat of  this needless and partisan distraction.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the gentleman across the aisle  is correct when he says that this does not change current law and it is  just enforcing current Federal law. I would just urge the body to  support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Smith).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.   Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Missouri  will be postponed.                    Amendment No. 57 Offered by Mr. Perry    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 57  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.
