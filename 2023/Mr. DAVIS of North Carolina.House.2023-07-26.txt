 Mr. Speaker, last week, a tornado ripped  through Rocky Mount, North Carolina, severely damaging one of Pfizer's  key facilities. We are grateful there were no fatalities, and we thank  God for the first responders who ensured our community's safety.   Even during times of adversity, Pfizer's CEO, Dr. Albert Bourla, made  an extraordinary commitment to continue operations in Rocky Mount, the  heart of North Carolina's First Congressional District, guaranteeing  job security for the employees at this site and contributing to our  local economy.   The decision to stay and invest in Rocky Mount preserves the  livelihoods of thousands of employees and sends a powerful message.   As the recovery process continues, I genuinely appreciate the vital  role Pfizer plays not only in the Rocky Mount community but across the  East, America, and the world.   Mr. Speaker, I say to the businesses and residents affected by this  natural disaster, please know I will stand with you.                            ____________________
