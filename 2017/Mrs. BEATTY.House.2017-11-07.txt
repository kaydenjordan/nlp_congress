 Mr. Speaker, today, I come to the people's House floor  in strong opposition to the Ryan-McConnell billionaires-first tax plan,  a plan that overwhelmingly benefits the superrich and well-connected,  and scams the middle class and our most vulnerable Americans.   But don't just take it from me. According to the Institute on  Taxation and Economic Policy, working families in my home State of Ohio  would see their taxes increase by $1,000 per year, while the wealthiest  Americans, people like President Trump, would see their taxes decrease  by as much as $747,000, according to the Tax Policy Center.   Not to be overshadowed, the Tax Policy Center also concluded that  nearly 80 percent of the bill's benefits pad the pockets of the  wealthiest Americans. At the same time, it eliminates the medical  expenses deduction, student loan deduction, and the new markets tax  credit. That does not seem like fair taxes to me.   Instead of raising taxes on the middle class, what we should be doing  is allowing for a better future, better opportunities, better jobs, and  better wages for all Americans.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, first let me say I certainly want to join  my colleague, Congressman Steve Stivers, in thanking Congressman  Bilirakis and Congressman Walz for all of their work in allowing us to  make this possible to be here today.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to rise to offer my enthusiastic support  for the National Veterans Memorial and Museum Act, H.R. 1900,  designating it as a public museum for the exclusive purpose of sharing  the experience and voices of veterans across all eras, conflicts, and  branches of the military.   As you have heard, it will be housed in my district, so I am  especially pleased that it is being built in a partnership with private  pay, a partnership with government, and a partnership that is blessed  by the veterans of central Ohio and across the Nation.   The museum concept was the brainchild of the Nation's good friend:  World War II veteran, legendary astronaut, and former U.S. Senator from  Ohio, John Glenn, who was a dear friend and one of my constituents.  John also chaired the Veterans Committee.   Mr. Speaker, if Senator Glenn were here today, he would share with us  how this museum will honor, connect, inspire, and educate all Americans  about the unified service and sacrifices of our Nation's more than 40  million veterans.   I salute this Congress and my community for recognizing the need for  veterans of all eras to have a museum to collectively call their own.   Mr. Speaker, I could not stand here without again thanking my  colleague and veteran, Congressman Steve Stivers, for his relentless  work, for his leadership, and his partnership throughout the  development of this project.   This project certainly shares with us what bipartisan work can do.   Mr. Speaker, I also would like to thank Congressman Tiberi for  joining us. I greatly appreciate and want to personally thank the  leadership of Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz, and also the  subcommittee leadership, because they expressed their concerns. We  addressed the concerns in a very constructive way. That is what  partnerships and leadership is all about. Because of their good work,  it has strengthened the operations of the project and the viability of  the project.   H.R. 1900 has the support of The American Legion, the Paralyzed  Veterans of America, and the VFW.   Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues to support this legislation  and to come to Columbus when it is open to see it in person and how it  honors the stories and the sacrifices of our Nation's veterans.
