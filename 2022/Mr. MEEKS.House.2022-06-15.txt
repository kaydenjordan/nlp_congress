 Mr. Speaker, I thank Representative Green for yielding,  and, of course, I thank Chairwoman Waters for bringing this important  piece of legislation to the floor.    I heard Ranking Member McHenry talk today, and I think that the  American people understand that inflation is all over the world. It is  not a United States problem; it is a global problem predicated by  Putin's aggression in Ukraine and coming out of the greatest pandemic  that we have had in over 100 years. Democrats are focused on working  with the globe to make a difference.   I want to focus on this bill and talk about the Improving Corporate  Governance Through Diversity Act and the Ensuring Diversity in  Community Banking Act portions of this bill. On that, I thank Ranking  Member McHenry and other Republicans for the bipartisan support both  bills received when they unanimously passed out of the Financial  Services Committee.   We need to continue all efforts to promote racial and economic  justice in our communities, and this package of legislation does  exactly that. Investors want to know whether the C-suites and the  boardrooms in corporate America are actually working in their interests  and reflecting their ideals. I, along with Representatives Carolyn B.  Maloney and Ritchie Torres, worked to enhance the SEC's disclosure  regime by requiring public companies to disclose race, ethnicity,  gender identity, sexual orientation, and veteran status of these  companies. We want these spaces to truly reflect the diversity of this  Nation.   Also included in this package is my bill that emphasizes the  importance of minority banks and credit unions in serving our  communities. The Ensuring Diversity in Community Banking section will  address the issue of banking deserts and strengthen programs that  provide capital to these critical and crucial institutions. It also  creates an impact bank designation in order to promote banks that  predominantly serve low-income communities.
