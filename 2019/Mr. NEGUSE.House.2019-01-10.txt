 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the son of refugees, and the  first Eritrean American to be elected to the House of Representatives.   My father, who immigrated to this country 35 years ago, sat in this  same Chamber up there in the gallery only a week ago to watch his son  be sworn into the people's House.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a simple, solemn, and serious request:  that this administration stop its demonization of immigrants and reopen  the government.   The administration has manufactured a crisis based on fear and is now  holding our government effectively hostage, blatantly causing harm to  the economic security of American families across the Nation.   Bruce, a constituent in my district, had to close down his small  business in Estes Park as a result of the shutdown. As Rocky Mountain  National Park remains closed, small businesses have continued to  struggle under this burden.   Countless workers in my district--Federal lab workers, national park  employees, national firefighters, weather forecasters, and many  others--have been furloughed or are working without pay, and $700  million in national parks' revenue in Colorado has been threatened.   Mr. Speaker, enough is enough.   Mr. President, end the charade and reopen the government now.                            ____________________
