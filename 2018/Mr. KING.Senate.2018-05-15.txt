 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, every morning, across America millions of  people get up, get dressed, and go to work. They all have similar  experiences. They are getting ready for a new day. They are getting  ready for a new set of challenges. They are getting ready to serve  their company and the place where they work to the best of their  ability.   There is one group of Americans who get up every morning to go to  work, and it is a slightly different experience because when those  people report for work, they are knowingly and willingly putting their  lives on the line. I am referring to our police officers and law  enforcement personnel across the country.   I think it is an important distinction. All of us go to work. We all  think about it. But stop and think for a moment that when someone puts  on that blue uniform or green uniform, or whatever it is, to serve the  public, they are taking a risk with their life. They are literally  laying their lives on the line for the rest of us.   Fifty-six years ago today, President John F. Kennedy designated May  15 as a law enforcement memorial day, or Peace Officers Memorial Day,  and the week in which May 15 falls is designed and set aside by our  country ever since to recognize peace officers. I love that term--peace  officers. They are here to protect us.   The Constitution in its preamble lays out the basic outlines for our  government, and this is one of them: to ``insure domestic  Tranquility.'' What a lovely phrase that is--to ``insure domestic  Tranquility.'' That means, in many cases, law enforcement.   I rise today to recognize law enforcement officials across the  country but, also, particularly in my State of Maine. As Governor, I  spent 24 hours a day with the State Police. I learned in that job the  quality of the people we have serving us, the quality of the people,  who often could make more money and have more promotions in another  line of work but who had chosen to serve the public and put their lives  on the line.   In Washington, there is a memorial to our law enforcement personnel,  to our peace officers. On that memorial there are engraved the names of  those who have lost their lives in the service of their fellow  citizens. Two of those names that will be added this year are from the  State of Maine.   One was Chris Gardner. He was only 47 years old. He had worked with  the University of Maine Police, and then he worked with the Maine Drug  Enforcement Agency. He died November 15, 2016, from complications from  a training exercise. He was involved in the Maine Law Enforcement Torch  Run. Many law enforcement people across the country are involved with  the Torch Run, which raises money and visibility for the Special  Olympics. He is survived by his parents, his brother, his sisters, his  stepmother, and by many aunts and uncles. He is also survived by other  loved ones. Chris Gardner served his public, served his people, and  served his State and community, and he lost his life in that service.   Another loss last year that will be going onto the monument this year  is Nathan Desjardins. Nathan was a member of the Fryeburg Police  Department. He was only 20 years old. He had just begun his career in  law enforcement as a peace officer. He died on his first day of water  training, responding to an incident of a capsized canoe. The boat he  was on hit an object in the river. He was thrown out. Desjardins and  another emergency responder were thrown from the boat. He sustained a  head injury and died on June 6, 2017.   Again, he is survived by his parents, his brother, his grandmother,  and a large extended family. Both Nathan and Christopher will have  their names added to the memorial this week.   They got up, they went to work, they served their public, and they  served their citizens and their community. They put their lives on the  line, and, in this case, they made the ultimate sacrifice.   A name that will not be added to the memorial this year--the  additions are from the prior calendar year, but we had an unbelievably  tragic event in Maine barely 3 weeks ago--is that of Eugene P. Cole. He  was shot and killed in the line of duty on April 25, 2018. He was born  in a little town called Skowhegan, ME. He was raised in that area and  was the oldest of five. He graduated from high school and went into the  Army. He came back to Maine, worked in a repair shop, and then, in the  year 2000, he decided to pursue what was really his calling as a law  enforcement officer.   In 2006, at the age of 50, he went to the Maine Criminal Justice  Academy, and he became a rural patrol deputy for the Somerset County  Sheriff's Office. I used to live right across the street from the  Somerset County Sheriff's Office. I remember the sheriff when I was  there almost 50 years ago--Francis Henderson. Francis Henderson  epitomized law enforcement in Maine and then Somerset County, and his  followers as sheriffs have done the same.   Gene Cole was in that mold. He was admired in his community. He was  well-known in his community. He was respected. He embodied the values  of law enforcement, and he was an inspiration to the officers who  served with him.   He is survived by his wife Sheryl of 41 years, four children, several  grandchildren, his siblings Tom and Sheryl, his mother, and a large  extended family.   His funeral was in Bangor, ME, just a week and a half ago, and 3,600  people were there. Law enforcement officers from across the Northeast  and from across the country were there to pay their respects to one of  their fallen comrades.   Eugene Cole was a hero. He wouldn't call himself that. He would be  embarrassed to be called that. From my understanding, he was a modest  and unassuming man, but he was a hero because every morning he got up  to go to work. He put on his uniform, and he put his life on the line  for the people of Somerset County, Skowhegan, and Norridgewock and for  the people of the State of Maine.   I rise today to pay tribute to Gene Cole, to Chris Gardner, to Nathan  Desjardins, and to all of the peace officers, the law enforcement  officers--those across our country in our communities--who every day  are willing to put their lives on the line for us. Peace Officers  Memorial Day--and the week--is a fitting tribute to those brave people  across the country who serve us every day and every night around the  clock to ``insure domestic Tranquility,'' in the wonderful phrase of  our Founders.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor Dr. Susan J.  Hunter. Dr. Hunter, who currently serves as the president of the  University of Maine, UMaine, at Orono, will retire from that position  at the end of June. I want to recognize Dr. Hunter for her many years  of work at the university not only as president, but also as a  researcher, professor, vice chancellor of academic affairs, provost,  and more.   Dr. Hunter became the university's 20th president in June of 2014 and  was the first woman to lead the institution in its 150-year history.  Dr. Hunter has led the university to many achievements, including  advances in enrollment, fundraising, advocacy, and partnerships. During  her tenure, UMaine has welcomed the largest incoming classes and  largest number of out-of-State students in the university's history.  The school has also seen a 22-percent increase in private giving to its  annual fund. Dr. Hunter also continued the implementation of UMaine's  innovative five-year strategic plan, which was developed during her  tenure as Provost.   Dr. Hunter's influence is not limited to the halls on the Orono  campus. On July 1, 2017, she also became president of the University of  Maine at Machias. Dr. Hunter also served her community by serving on  numerous boards of directors, including the Maine School of  [[Page S2678]]  Science and Mathematics, the Bangor Symphony, the Maine Mathematics and  Science Alliance, and on the advisory network for the Olympia Snowe  Women's Leadership Institute.   While it is easy to see the impact Dr. Hunter has had on the  University and the Orono community, her lasting legacy will be her  impact on students. Thousands of students have benefited from Dr.  Hunter's knowledge and guidance over the years, and UMaine is lucky to  have also benefited from such an experienced educator and  administrator. The new programs Dr. Hunter brought to the university  have contributed to the region's cultural and economic development. Dr.  Hunter's contributions have been so important--to the university, the  region, and across the entire State of Maine--and we are so grateful  for her decades of service. She will be missed; however, I am confident  that the institution she leaves behind, ``the college of our hearts  always,'' will continue to benefit from her legacy of service for years  to come. In her honor, I ask that we ``fill the steins to dear old  Maine'' and ``drink to Maine, our alma mater, the college of our hearts  always.''                            ____________________
