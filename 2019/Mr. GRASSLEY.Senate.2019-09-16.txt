 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business for 1 minute.    Mr. President, this weekend I attended what some call  Iowa's own Super Bowl, the Iowa v. Iowa State football game. I talked  with Iowans while tailgating, and tailgating most of the time goes on  before the game for me. We talked about issues such as ethanol,  biodiesel, and trade.   This year, the game was in Ames, and Iowa State hosted ESPN's  football ``College GameDay,'' and this was the first time ever for  Iowans to do that. It was an opportunity to show off Iowa State's  campus and to celebrate the tradition of the annual Cy-Hawk game.   Congratulations to the Iowa Hawkeyes for winning this year's match- up, but both teams put up a strong fight, as you can tell from the  final score of Iowa's winning 18 to 17.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    Mr. President, last year, we on the Judiciary Committee  conducted an incredibly thorough review of a nominee to the Supreme  Court of the United States. We dug into Justice Kavanaugh's personal  and professional life and discussed concerns openly in front of the  public.   Allegations were raised against the Justice, but none could be  corroborated or verified. I know about this because I had a team of  dozens of lawyers and investigators chasing down each allegation we  received. My team spoke to 45 individuals and took 25 written  statements.   Anyone can review the 415-page investigation summary report that I  released last November. We laid out the information we received,  including some of the ugliest of claims. In the end, there was no  credible evidence to support any of the allegations. Brett Kavanaugh  then was duly confirmed to the Supreme Court by this body, as  prescribed in the Constitution.   Now, fast forward to this past weekend, and the issues that I and a  lot of other Members of the Senate are being asked about this very day,  just as if there is nothing else going on in this town, but you dig up  something that happened a year ago.   The New York Times published a book excerpt about Justice Kavanaugh's  younger days that has fueled a very fresh rumor from someone whose  friends claim contacted Senators on the committee. That person, Mr.  Stier, didn't reach out or provide information to the committee's  majority. Apparently, he also didn't provide any information to these  writers. It is only on the word of two anonymous sources that his name  and accusation come up in this story in the New York Times.   Again, my office never received anything from Mr. Stier or his  unnamed friends, and we never received an allegation against Kavanaugh  like the one referenced in the report over this weekend. After  interviewing eight people related to the Ramirez allegations, not once  was Mr. Stier's name mentioned. Had my staff received substantive  allegations or had he approached me or my staff, we would have  attempted to take a statement and interview him. But the alleged  victim, who also didn't speak to these writers, apparently, does not  recall the incident. That is a point that the New York Times failed to  include in its initial coverage.   Now, it happens that accountability is a cornerstone of democracy. I  welcome scrutiny of my work. I frequently refer to reporters and  journalists as the police of our democratic system, but today I am  reminded of a very old adage: Who will watch the watchmen? This  weekend's report included some embarrassing and irresponsible missteps.  They are mistakes that warrant serious self-reflection.   A year ago, after the interviews with dozens of people, the New York  Times couldn't even corroborate the allegations laid out by Ms. Ramirez  and declined to report on them. With nothing but a year of time and  another interview with Ramirez herself, the paper thought those  unverified claims were suddenly worth printing--no more corroboration  and no more verification. Coming only days before the release of the  author's book, I can't help but wonder if the timing had something to  do with the decision to run the story. Maybe it was to sell more books.   They also laid out what commentators are now calling a new  allegation. Let me be clear. This is not an allegation. It is barely a  third-hand rumor. These writers--can you believe this?--didn't even  speak to the man who they claim originally recounted this rumor. What  is left are only layers and layers of decades-old hearsay--no more  corroboration, no more verification, and not even anything from the  accuser himself, and, most importantly, nothing from the person who was  allegedly involved.   Now, the most shameful piece of this episode is that it took more  than a full day, after publication, for the editors to intervene and to  provide critical context. An editor's note added to the story last  night reads: ``The book reports that the female student declined to be  interviewed and friends say that she does not recall the incident.''   Let me quote again: `` . . . she does not recall the incident.'' That  is the alleged victim. That is the opposite of corroboration and  verification. In the legal world, this sort of thing is called  exculpatory information. When it is not laid bare to provide greater  context, it creates a serious credibility problem.   In this case, the New York Times withheld crucial facts that undercut  its own reporting. We now have an uncorroborated accusation, rooted  only in unnamed sources, with no direct knowledge of the event and that  the alleged victim doesn't even remember.   Now, you know about the New York Times. Their slogan is that they  only print what is ``fit to print.'' I just described this situation of  no corroboration rooted in an unnamed source without direct knowledge  of this event and that the alleged victim doesn't even remember.   Now, to get back to the slogan of the newspaper, when did this stuff  I described become something ``fit to print'' by the supposed American  paper of record?   The sad consequences of this article are a misinformed public, a  greater divide in our own discourse, and a deeper lack of faith in our  news media.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
