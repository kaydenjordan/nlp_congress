 Madam Speaker, our Nation is facing a  security crisis on our southern border.   As a record number of migrants are apprehended on American soil, we  have seen a staggering increase in the amount of fentanyl that is being  confiscated not only at ports of entry but also in the desert. So far  this year, there have been over 1 million illegal crossings along our  southern border.   Right now, liberals in Congress are attempting to obstruct the  Department of Homeland Security from working to keep Americans safe.  How many Americans have to be poisoned by fentanyl  [[Page H4254]]  before we stop the flow into our communities?   In Pennsylvania, over 5,000 people lost their lives in drug overdoses  last year. We have seen fentanyl is easy to get, and it is fast to  kill. We must put an end to the crisis and refuse any attempt to stop  the Department of Homeland Security from enforcing our laws and ending  this crisis on our southern border.                            ____________________
