 Mr. President, I am proud to speak in support of my  amendment with Senator Sanders to prioritize investments in our  communities over a bloated Pentagon budget. I thank Senator Sanders for  his leadership on this issue, bringing forth this fundamental tension  that exists within our society.   The men and women of the Armed Forces deserve our admiration, our  respect, and our support. Day in and day out, they defend our country's  interests in all corners of the world, and their families sacrifice  alongside them. But what makes America the envy of the world is not  simply the strength of our military but the strength of our people.   And 2020 has brought historic challenges: a global pandemic, a  growing recession, a reckoning on the systemic racism that pervades our  country. We have also seen an estimated 5.4 million American workers  lose their health insurance between February and May, leaving them even  more vulnerable to a virus surging in every corner of this country.   The Sanders-Markey amendment states that we cannot afford, in this,  our moment of national crisis, to spend three-quarters of a trillion  dollars on bloated defense spending--spending that is supposed to  protect or country yet did nothing to inoculate against the most  profound public health emergency in a century.   This amendment is also in keeping with President Eisenhower's  warning, as Senator Sanders said, that ``we must guard against the  acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by  the military-industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise  of misplaced power exists, and will persist.''   Persist it has. This $740 billion fiscal year 2021 budget before us  is the fulfillment of Ike's worst fears. In his address to the American  people, President Eisenhower also predicted that a permanent arms  industry would come to call the shots. After Japan surrendered aboard  the USS Missouri in 1945, ending the Second World War, that permanent  arms industry made its fixture.   After we emerged victorious in a historic and ideological struggle  against the Soviet Union that brought us to the brink of nuclear  holocaust, Eisenhower's feared permanent arms industry stuck around and  retooled to advocate for new weapons to fight the endless war to come.   The catastrophic attacks of September 11 led to more than a doubling  of the Pentagon's budget. Multiple Presidents have stretched a limited  authorization of military force to go after those responsible for the  9/11 attacks--to fight new enemies in new geographies, outside of  Afghanistan.   All told, so far, we have spent $6.4 trillion in the wars in  Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and other places since 2001. Even as those  wars wind down, the defense industry is pushing for costly new  acquisition programs to maintain superiority over China and Russia.   The forecasted ``permanent arms industry'' begins to explain why the  Pentagon accounts for half of the entire fiscal year 2021 U.S.  discretionary budget. Our military budget is larger than the next 10  countries combined. Our battle fleet is larger than the next 13 navies  combined, with 11 of those 13 navies represented by our allies or our  partners.   However, every dollar spent on the Pentagon is one fewer available to  fight the scourge of poverty in this country, to strengthen the social  safety net and protect American families. Our communities have suffered  while we spend ourselves into extreme U.S. military dominance.   I fear that the Pentagon budget we debate today shows to a child that  we don't prioritize giving him or her a quality education; shows  mothers and fathers that, in the wealthiest country in the world, they  will forever remain one illness away from financial ruin; shows a  family that the dream of homeownership, much less affordable rental  housing, will remain out of their grasp; shows frontline heroes working  in hospitals and nursing homes in Chelsea, MA, and across the country  that they have no choice but to go work sick because their employer  does not offer paid leave.   I reject the false choice between a strong U.S. military and strong  American communities. Trillions of dollars in defense spending did  nothing to protect us from the coronavirus pandemic. The defense  spending can't protect us from the destruction of the environment and  the worsening climate crisis. Yet we are due to spend nearly 70 times  more on defense than we will to protect against the next pandemic and  other global health challenges.   We must no longer equate national security with our inventory of  planes, missiles, and nuclear weapons system, and if coronavirus is  truly a war, as President Trump says it is, he is duty-bound to embrace  the fact that national security also means health, housing, and  financial security, and national security means doing everything we can  to save and improve lives in American communities, particularly  communities of color, that have been neglected for too long and that  have born the worst of the coronavirus impacts.    Our amendment begins that important work by making smart cuts of 10  percent to the budget of the Pentagon for this fiscal year and  redirecting those funds to the Department of the Treasury to administer  a grant program to strengthen vulnerable, low-income communities.  [[Page S4375]]    For example, in Massachusetts, we would be eligible to receive up to  $1 billion in Federal funding to create jobs by building affordable  housing, schools, childcare facilities, community health centers,  public hospitals, libraries, and clean drinking water facilities,  removing lead pipes and replacing vacant or blighted properties; to  improve education by hiring more public school teachers to reduce class  sizes, increasing teacher pay, providing universal nutritious meals,  and providing free tuition to attend public colleges, universities, or  trade schools; and to make housing more affordable by providing rental  assistance and eliminating homelessness.   We should prioritize eradicating poverty, not war. We should  prioritize battling global killer diseases, not developing a new weapon  designed to eradicate the human race. It is time we funded education,  not annihilation--Medicaid, not missiles.   Where do we start to make Defense Department cuts? First, we must end  the war in Afghanistan, which would save tens of billions of dollars.  The time is long overdue to bring our men and women home. And it is  time to double down on other tools of U.S. statecraft--diplomacy and  development--to shape a better future for Afghanistan, particularly  Afghan women.   As we work to put a stop to endless war and repeal the 2001 AUMF, the  Pentagon must realign its budget to reflect the cold, hard wisdom of  Ronald Reagan that ``a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be  fought.''   Between the Departments of Defense and Energy, we are due to spend  nearly $50 billion on nuclear weapons in fiscal year 2021. Over the  next three decades, we are on course to spend $1.7 trillion on nuclear  weapons overkill. We can field a safe, secure, and effective nuclear  deterrent--one that assures our allies and partners--all without  breaking the bank.   Our people, not our military parades, are the source of American  greatness. Over the past few months, this country has experienced a  reckoning, as Americans from all walks of life have had enough. They  have had enough of being lied to by the President about the true threat  of a deadly disease. They have had enough of people of color being  murdered in cold blood by the very police forces meant to serve and  protect them. And they have had enough of being told there just isn't  enough money to support the well-being of their communities, while they  can see billions in taxpayers' dollars going to unnecessary wars and  nuclear weapons programs and to benefit the President's friends and  family.   The choice today is very clear. We are ready to take the smallest  step, a 10-percent cut, to begin to address the gap in resources in  this country. This is the time for us to stand up. We are about to have  a debate on how much money we have to help families in this country  through this pandemic. We are being told that money is not there for  unemployment insurance; for cities and towns not to have to lay off  teachers; for cities and towns to have the testing, the contact  tracing, and the personal protective equipment to protect families in  our country; to make sure we can provide sick care leave; and to make  sure we can provide childcare for families in this country. We are told  there is not enough money. Yes, there is, and that money is in the  defense budget of the United States of America, so that we can protect  those families.   Too many people right now are nostalgic for a time that never was,  instead of having the idealism which we need to battle the issues of  today. But for the poor, the sick, the elderly, the disabled, the Black  and Brown and immigrant families in this country, the past is just a  memory and the future is their hard reality.   This is the time for the U.S. Senate to stand up and to begin the  funding of the programs which every family needs to protect themselves.  I urge an ``aye'' vote on this amendment, and, again, I thank Senator  Sanders for his incredible progressive leadership on this issue and for  so many others.   I yield back.                          Vote on Amendment No. 1788     Madam President, I rise to speak in support of S. 4019,  the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act--legislation that I have  introduced along with Senator Cornyn. We have 54 cosponsors and broad  bipartisan support that would make Juneteenth a Federal holiday. In a  few minutes, I will ask unanimous consent that the Senate take up and  pass this important bill.   Our country is in the midst of a long overdue reckoning on race and  justice. The murder of George Floyd by members of the Minneapolis  Police Department has galvanized the Nation as protesters have taken to  our streets, demanding justice--justice for George Floyd, justice for  Breonna Taylor, and justice for countless other Black and Brown  Americans who have been hurt or killed at the hands of law enforcement.  Yet this reckoning goes well beyond seeking accountability for police  officers who betray the trust we bestow upon them.   The disparate treatment and mistreatment of Black and Brown Americans  permeates our society. It infects our courts, our schools, and our  places of work. It reflects the unfulfilled promise of a nation built  upon the notion that all are created equal, and it has its roots in our  Nation's original sin--slavery--a crime against humanity that we have  for far too long failed to acknowledge, address, or come to grips with.   One way to further the process of racial reconciliation and healing  is to recognize, honor, and celebrate the formal end of slavery in the  United States and to do so at the Federal level. Perhaps the most  effective, direct, and far-reaching way to do that is with a Federal  holiday commemorating that historic event.   For more than 150 years, the Juneteenth holiday, which marks the  emancipation of slaves, has been observed one way or the other across  our Nation, including in Texas, but it is long past time to place  Juneteenth on par with other Federal holidays so that all Americans in  all 50 States will celebrate Juneteenth alongside Veterans Day,  Memorial Day, Martin Luther King Day, and other Federal holidays.   The celebration of Juneteenth dates back to June 19, 1865, when Union  soldiers, led by MG Gordon Granger, traveled to Galveston, TX, with the  announcement that the Civil War had ended and that the enslaved were  now free. This was 2\1/2\ years after the date of President Lincoln's  Emancipation Proclamation, but either the news of Lincoln's order had  not reached many, including those in Texas, or local officials had  refused to enforce it.   On June 19, 1865, Major General Granger read to the people of Texas  General Order No. 3, the first lines of which told them clearly and  unequivocally: ``The people of Texas are informed that, in accordance  with a Proclamation from the Executive of the United States, all slaves  are free.''   Juneteenth celebrations followed as did the recognition of Juneteenth  as the formal end of slavery in the United States. Since 1865,  communities all across the Nation have celebrated Juneteenth with  parades, cookouts, prayer gatherings, historical and cultural readings,  musical performances, and many other celebrations. These events have  provided many with the opportunity for reflection, education, and a  deeper understanding of our history as a nation--the whole history--and  how it has affected and shaped the lives of Black Americans.   Nearly every State and the District of Columbia have passed  legislation recognizing Juneteenth as a holiday or observance, and the  Senate has passed a resolution designating June 19 as Juneteenth  Independence Day, but Juneteenth has never received the higher status  it deserves as a Federal holiday. The Juneteenth National Independence  Day Act rights this wrong and makes Juneteenth a Federal holiday.   We still must travel a long and difficult road to justice and  equality in the United States, but we cannot get there without  recognizing the original sin of slavery and marking its end. It is  incumbent upon all Americans to truthfully acknowledge and understand  our past and how it affects our present and our future. Making  Juneteenth a Federal holiday will not right all of the wrongs of the  past or fix what remains broken, but it is an important step. It is the  truth of our history and the missing half of the story of our Nation's  freedom and independence. It is long past time to recognize Juneteenth  as a Federal holiday.   Let me stop there and recognize my partner in this effort, the senior  Senator from Texas    I thank the Senator from Texas. This is a thoroughly  bipartisan effort, and it is long overdue.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on the  Judiciary be discharged from further consideration and that the Senate  now proceed to S. 4019; further, that the bill be considered read a  third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Madam President, reserving the right to object, the  Senator's proposal--rather than allowing this unanimous consent request  to go through, the Senator proposes to hold it hostage to taking away  the leave benefits that come with paid holidays for American workers.  That is something we have never done before, and with good reason. We  shouldn't be penalizing our workers by taking away benefits, especially  not in the current environment and especially not as the price to pay  for recognizing a long overdue Federal holiday.   I object.
