 Mr. Speaker, today is a great day for America. It is  great day for American agriculture and American manufacturing.   Today, the President signs phase one of the China trade deal. But  this news, the most important news of the day, won't be covered much by  the national media. Instead, the story, the photo of the day will be  Speaker Pelosi parading her tardy Articles of Impeachment to the Senate  with pomp and circumstance. America can only hope this is the last  chapter on this side of the capitol of this made-for-TV impeachment  charade.   Why won't the national media cover this trade agreement story?  Because it is another example of a promise made, promise kept by our  President. It is another example of our President's policies working.   Once the Chinese trade agreement is completed, the President will  have renegotiated over half of our country's export-import business.  Now, that is making America great again. That is the art of the deal.   As part of the phase one agreement, China will buy $200 billion worth  of American goods and services over the next 2 years, nearly doubling  our U.S. exports to the country and further narrowing the gap of our  longstanding trade agreements and deficits. Agriculture goods will  account for nearly $100 billion of these purchases, providing a much- needed boost to the industry that accounts for more than 40 percent of  our Kansas State's economy. All this increase in exports only adds to  our Nation's GDP.   In the near term, this deal brings an end to the threat of additional  tariffs that have caused commodity prices to fluctuate, giving  producers more certainty and the ability to better plan for the  upcoming growing seasons. Our farmers and ranchers have borne the brunt  of the effects of this trade battle, and I am happy to say things will  get better soon. The patriotism our Kansas producers have shown has  been nothing short of honorable.   Now, concerns about China upholding its end of the phase one  agreement are indeed legitimate. Decades of China reneging on  commitments aren't lost on me, but thankfully our negotiation team, led  by our trade representative Bob Lighthizer and a fellow Kansan, Gregg  Doud, require that this deal include the authority for the President to  swiftly reinstate all tariffs and impose new ones, if needed, and thus  avoid the long, drawn-out decisions by the WTO.   Global trade disputes don't end overnight, and as the President and  his team have acknowledged, there is still a lot of work to be done on  China. Phase two negotiations are already well under way, and I will  continue to advocate for Kansas agriculture and manufacturing directly  to this administration.   President Trump's efforts to solidify deals with our four largest  export markets, Mexico, Canada, Japan, and now China will give Kansans  the confidence needed to move into the next decade and beyond. These  four countries, along with the completed trade deal with South Korea,  represent over half of our country's trade. This sets the stage for the  rest of our trade agreements.   We made it through this hard pass, and better days of fair and  reciprocal trade lie ahead for many generations.   I thank the President and our entire trade team at USTR for their  efforts to protect and grow American jobs, to improve wages, for their  commitment to make and keep America great. Keep up the good work.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, tonight, we mourn the 47th anniversary of  Roe v. Wade. Today, we mourn the loss of over 50 million American  lives.   Mr. Speaker, my good friend and colleague from New Jersey, and my  colleagues here tonight all know that I dedicated my professional life  to delivering babies. Every day, every other  [[Page H285]]  day for 30 years, I had the honor to deliver a baby. Sometimes it was  one. I delivered as many as 12 babies in a day.   But a subject I have never talked about up here, a subject that few  Americans talk about, is infertility and recurrent miscarriages.  Hundreds of thousands of women have these problems, and for whatever  reason, when I took care of women with miscarriages, women who so  desperately wanted to have a baby--it might be her third, her fourth,  her fifth miscarriage--and who were unable to have a baby, it was at  moments like that that I thought about Roe v. Wade.   It never made sense to me. This morning, I read from the Book of  Ecclesiastes trying to make some sense of life up here. Still, here I  am, 50-some years of age, and I haven't found the answer. How can I  live in a country where in one hospital I am fighting to help a woman  keep a baby, and 100 miles away, the largest abortion clinic in the  country is taking life away?   How can we live in that type of a country? Tonight I pledge, I  recommit my support and my efforts to protect life.
