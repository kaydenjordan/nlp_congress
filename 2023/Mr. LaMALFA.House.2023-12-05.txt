 Mr. Speaker, importantly, where we get our data from is  extremely useful and key to making wise decisions around here.   Since about half the focus of the speeches at this place and at every  committee and at every agency of the Federal Government seems to be on  what they call climate change, it is good to know where we are getting  our data. It tends to follow what percent of the atmosphere is  CO2 and what the temperatures are.   Well, here is an interesting little piece from the EPA on their data  and on the climate stations they have. They have all sorts of weather  monitoring devices across the country, a little over 1,060, I believe  it is. In some cases, the way they are set and where they are placed is  a whole conversation unto itself.   The old rules require that they be placed in areas that are not  skewing the temperature one way or another, but sometimes, you will  find them on rooftops next to air-conditioning units, parking lots,  areas that are going to be more prone toward heat sinks and to keeping  temperatures higher.   Nonetheless, a recent set of data that EPA themselves has allowed to  get out is that, since 1948, only 19 percent of those weather stations  have shown a mild increase in temperature. That means 81 percent did  not show an increase in temperature as per their own data.                                time  1045    Over 800 of those stations, I think 863, reported either a decrease  or no change in the number of hot days.   Interesting, isn't it? You would think that we are melting down. We  hear all this talking--even the committee I was just in--oh, sea level  rise. Well, you look at pictures, and the sea level hasn't risen;  certainly not to the extent that we are being threatened in the way  they are not asking us but forcing us to change our lives.   It is one thing if you want to buy an electric vehicle because that  might work for you in your commute. Hey, great. When you see my own  State of California forcing these mandates by 2035, or whatever round  year number they make up, as to when we have to get to what they call  net zero on CO2,  [[Page H6118]]  it is really going to negatively affect a lot of people's lives, not  just automobiles, which might be easier, but trucks that haul things.   For example, a typical truck, the total vehicle weight is 80,000  pounds, which the tare weight, or the empty weight of the empty truck,  is 25,000 pounds. You have got about 55,000 pounds worth of capacity.  If you convert that truck to an electric vehicle, it will take 16,000  pounds of additional weight of batteries to make it have any kind of  range. The payload has just decreased by about 16,000 pounds or so on a  truck.   Let's get back to the core numbers. What we are seeing is their own  climate stations, their own weather stations, 81 percent of them, have  shown as level or a decrease in temperature since 1948. Only a handful  have seen an increase. Even then we have got to see how skewed those  are with where they are placed, in parking lots or areas that are heat  sinks.   Let's look at the CO2 numbers since that is supposed to be  the killer that so many folks are whining about around here. Carbon  dioxide is only 0.04 percent of our atmosphere. Four one-hundredths of  1 percent are what they are making us change our lives for. It is also  putting America at a huge disadvantage economically, by exporting our  jobs, exporting our extraction of natural resources to places like  China or other areas around the world that have the ability to do the  mining that is needed to produce copper or, heaven forbid, all the  lithium and the cobalt and other things it is going to take to battery  and electrify everything.   Instead, let's not have mandates to take away our cars, our trucks,  and our trains. I even see silly pieces on the internet about one of  the major cargo carriers saying we need to look forward to electrifying  aircraft. The aircraft won't have any weight capacity to haul anything  if you load it down with batteries. Battery technology needs to make  leaps and bounds. We don't have it yet. Yes, we should keep researching  that, but, by golly, why do we have to hamstring ourselves right now?   The internal combustion engines we have now burn cleaner and better  than ever. If we are allowed to continue to refine them, they will be  even better, just through attrition, over time. By replacing trucks and  replacing vehicles with the newer, cleaner-burning ones, we are making  giant strides. We have already made giant strides from the bad old days  in the 1960s in the LA Basin and stuff with cleaner-burning vehicles.   Let's make progress on things that are within our range. Yes, we can  look into hydrogen and see if that can power vehicles, but this  battery-powered everything is really a farce at the end of it. It has  to be heavily subsidized to get people to buy the cars. We are seeing  the range. We are seeing the stories in the wintertime, et cetera.  Let's take a smarter look at what the heck we are doing instead of just  forcing it.                            ____________________
