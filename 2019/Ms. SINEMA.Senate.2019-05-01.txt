 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and  legacy of Eugenia ``Genie'' Zavaleta, a community leader who passed  away in Tempe, AZ, on April 6, 2019, at the age of 92. Genie Zavaleta  was a fighter for immigration reform, advocate for the DREAM Act, and a  dedicated voice for DACA recipients. Our State will miss her dearly.   Genie Zavaleta described her life's concerns as ``her family,  education, health care, family planning, the environment, poverty and  injustice, the Presbyterian Church and the Democratic Party.''  Throughout her life, she served these issues through educator and  advocacy roles within the Presbyterian Church, the Migrant Ministry of  the National Council of Churches, Planned Parenthood of Arizona, and  the Maricopa County Health Department.   Her immense advocacy work within the migrant community began in 1958,  when she and her husband Hector took on roles to serve migrant farm  laborers known as braceros. In 1965, Genie Zavaleta and her family  moved to Arizona, where she focused on helping migrant workers acquire  new skills to adjust to Arizona's rapid industrialization. Eventually,  Genie Zavaleta became a fierce advocate for DACA recipients and the  DREAM Act.   Genie Zavaleta is survived by her husband Hector, her sons Dan and  David, and their wives Nori and Linda. She will be dearly missed by  other family members, friends, and the hundreds of people whose lives  she touched. Please join me in honoring her memory.                            ____________________
