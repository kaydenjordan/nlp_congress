 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, every parent has the inherent right and responsibility to  decide what is best for their child, how to raise them, how to care for  them, and what information to expose them to or to protect them from.   My amendment protects the ability of parents to participate in the  education of their own child by reaffirming parental choice and  ensuring that children are not subject to the censorship of adults who  are not their parents.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's words and his  support of this. I also appreciate the chairwoman's support of this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.
