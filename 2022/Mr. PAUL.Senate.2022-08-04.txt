 Mr. President, gas prices are 64 percent higher in my home  State of Kentucky than they were in January of 2021. This means  Kentuckians are paying $1.43 more for gas than they were at the  beginning of last year.   For average Americans already struggling to put food on the table,  sky-high gas prices are a daily punishment.   Every additional dollar an American spends on a gallon of gas is a  dollar not going towards their mortgage, their retirement, or their  children's college fund.   Rising prices are robbing Americans of the chance to plan for the  future, as  [[Page S4023]]  they struggle to make ends meet in the present.   In an attempt to address rising gas prices, President Biden announced  on April 12 that he would allow the sale of E15 gasoline this summer.  Then-White House press secretary Jen Psaki had this to say about this  decision:         [This] waiver [that President Biden passed to allow E15] is       a critical step to address the fuel supply crisis and . . .       build real U.S. energy independence, support American       agriculture and manufacturing, and save Americans money at       the pump. At current prices, E15 can save a family 10 cents       per gallon of gas on average and many stores sell E15 at even       greater discount and today's waiver will allow families to       pay that lower price for months to come.    So this is a policy supported by President Biden, and it is currently  the law since he is waiving the regulation.   E15 is a gasoline blend containing up to 15 percent ethanol. It is a  renewable fuel typically made from corn. A 2008 study published in  Atmospheric Environment found that ethanol-based fuels like E15 emit up  to 16 percent less carbon dioxide than traditional gasoline.   A more recent study published by the U.S. Department of Energy's  Argonne National Laboratory found that these fuels emit up to 23  percent less carbon dioxide and provide a cheaper alternative to  typical gasoline, and yet the Clean Air Act currently prohibits the  sale of E15 during the summer. So we sell it for 9 months of the year;  we forbid it for 3 months of the year. But companies can't get used to  either selling it or making it or distributing it because of the  disruption during the summer.   Under the current law, gas with up to 10 percent ethanol, commonly  known as E10, can be sold during the summer. But, inexplicably, the law  treats E15 differently, even though the higher ethanol blend is better  for the environment.   American drivers ought to be able to access E15 year-round.  Prohibiting its sale in the summer months artificially restricts the  supply, especially when Americans are paying historically high prices  for a gallon of gasoline.   What we are asking to do today through this legislation is not to  subsidize ethanol, not to force people to use ethanol, but to allow  people to use ethanol at an E15 basis, a little bit higher than we are  allowed to use already.   Republican and Democratic Presidents have both waived this rule. This  is essentially what the law of the land is other than we are having to  suspend the law to get what we have. The last President and this  President have both waived the rule that we are trying to repeal today.   Both Presidents Trump and Biden approved the removal of barriers to  the sale of E15 during the summer months; but in Congress, we have it  in our power to permanently allow the sale of E15.   If we only do it by Presidential waiver, there is never enough  certainty for people in the marketplace to decide to sell it year-round  because they are worried that at any one moment a President will flip a  switch, and then we will go back to banning it again.   The EASE Act, which is what we will be asking to pass today, is a  bill that will allow the sale of E15 year-round and will provide relief  for Americans on the road--not only this year, but every year. This  change is long overdue. I have advocated this policy for 7 years. I  first introduced this legislation in 2015.   Passing the EASE Act would benefit consumers, farmers, and the  environment by increasing access.   So as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 4774, which is at  the desk; further, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered  read a third time and passed, and that the motion to reconsider be  consider made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Kentucky small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize  Larry's Mini Mart of Whitley City, KY, as the Senate Small Business of  the Week.   When Larry Sumner founded Larry's Somerset Oil in 1973, he had no  idea it would grow into the family business that it is today. Larry got  his start in business when he opened his service station in Whitley  City. It was there in McCreary County that Larry's children watched  their father run a business that bolstered their home-town community.  As the Sumner children grew older, they learned firstshand what it  meant to devote one's energy to their customers, so it was only natural  that they inherited their father's entrepreneurial nature. Thus, Larry  Sumner's business continues operating today in the exact location he  moved to in 1976, with the Sumner children at the helm of operations.   Today Larry's Mini Mart, as it is now called, is Whitley City's one  stop shop for full-service gas, kerosene, and diesel. Unlike the days  of old, most people nowadays pump their own gas and rarely interact  with the folks working at their local gas stations. That is not the  case for Larry's Mini Mart, as they carry on the tradition of pumping  gas for their customers, always doing it with a smile. Larry's is also  the local stop where folks can drop in to pick up cold drinks, snacks,  ice, and anything else they might need whether in a hurry or just for  an afternoon excursion. Larry's Mini Mart even goes beyond what a  typical service station offers by renting out their extra storage space  to their loyal customers .   When the late Larry Sumner first opened his business back in the  1970's, he wanted to create a place that was more than the average  filling station. He understood that offering quality service and a wide  variety of conveniences would make his store a success, but his dream  went beyond those of profits. Larry Sumner's goal was to create a place  that would foster community within the town of Whitley City.   When Larry Sumner's son Mark and daughter Marlo took over the  business in 1998 following their father's death, they stayed true to  his mission. Today, as it has always been, Larry's Mini Mart is a place  where locals can come to catch up on the latest news in the county,  whether that news travels through the local paper cir word-of-mouth. As  is often the case with small towns, sometimes it takes a trip down to  Larry's just to hear about the goings-on about town, and the late Larry  Sumner would not have it any other way.   Larry's has often been recognized for the quality service they  provide to their community. Most recently in 2020, Larry's Mini Mart  received McCreary County Chamber of Commerce Business of the Month.  They have also won McCreary County Business of the Year numerous times  due to the charitable spirit of the owners and staff. Throughout their  years of operation, Larry's Mini Mart has supported local school  systems and all their various sporting activities. Larry's has become a  well-known for hosting car wash fundraisers for various causes within  their community. Larry's Mini Mart has also contributed to the Banquet  of Blessings, a McCreary County tradition that provides a free  Christmas meal to anyone in need. Larry's has also contributed to the  local chapter of Relay for Life, a cancer awareness nonprofit.  Moreover, the public library, the local chapter of Veterans of Foreign  Wars, the American Legion, the McCreary County Chamber of Commerce,  right down to the McCreary County Little League baseball team, have all  seen support from the fine folks at Larry's Mini Mart.   Larry's Mini Mart is known not only for their quality service and  charitable spirit, but they also maintain their reputation for being a  fantastic place to work. Currently, Mark Sumner and his wife Stephanie  operate Larry's with the help of their daughter Taylor and their son  Tyler. This family affair fosters a friendly environment, so much so  that two of Larry's Mini Mart employees have worked for the business  for over 40 years. That type of longevity clearly shows that Larry's is  not your average service station. Larry's Mini Mart is a community  institution that goes above and beyond to support their friends and  neighbors, whether it be during or outside of their regular business  hours. Congratulations to the Sumner family and entire team at Larry's  Mini Mart. I look forward to seeing your continued growth and success  in Kentucky.                            ____________________
