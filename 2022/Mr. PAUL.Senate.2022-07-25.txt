 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of Daniel J. Whitfield, a ``happy warrior'' in the conservative  movement whose dynamic personality and disarming humor brought  countless conservative activists together in friendship for the cause  of liberty.   In addition to Dan's engaging presence at conferences, networking  events, and small gatherings, he was also a gifted writer and  communicator who channeled his mastery of the English language into  high-impact direct mail fundraising appeals and--later--gripping  fiction.   Dan was born in Birmingham, England, on September 14, 1982, to  Michael and Jennifer. He was a lifelong lover of liberty, joining the  UK Conservative Party at the age of 14. He proudly displayed a photo of  the Right Honourable Baroness, Margaret Thatcher, on his bedroom wall.   After graduating from Nottingham University, Daniel earned a M.A. in  history from the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Dan moved to the  Washington, DC, area shortly thereafter for an internship at the  Leadership Institute. Dan soon joined the LI staff full-time, where he  built up his resume by empowering conservative activists to become  leaders while developing lifelong connections across the conservative  movement in the United States.   After more than 2 years at LI, Dan became a copywriter for the Eberle  Communications Group, a job he cherished from the start as it allowed  him to stay in the U.S., where he would be able to pursue a career as  well as his future wife, Nena Bartlett. Dan remained a longtime  volunteer faculty member for LI, giving generously of his time to train  hundreds of conservatives to become better writers.   Daniel dreamed of having a big family and, after a truly unique  courtship, began building one with his wife, Nena, in 2014.   Dan and Nena brought three beautiful girls into the world: Dagny Joy,  Magnolia Jennifer, and Zora Katherine. Dan's incredible spirit shines  through in each of his daughters.   In addition to starting a family, Dan's other life ambition was to  become a published author. He achieved his goal with his first book,  ``Eagle Ascending,'' published by TouchPoint Press. His second book,  ``The Spider's  [[Page S3638]]  Revenge,'' will be published posthumously next year.   Dan touched the lives of countless thousands of conservative  activists in the United States and across the pond. His roots may have  been in Nottingham, but Dan Whitfield was American through and through.  Anyone lucky enough to have met Dan even for just a moment is better  for it. Dan's personal warmth and professional accomplishments have  left an indelible mark on countless people around the world. He will be  greatly missed.                            ____________________
