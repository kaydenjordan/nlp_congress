I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Ms. Hirono) is  necessarily absent.    Madam President, let me thank my colleague from Indiana.  You can't do better than ``Hoosiers.'' It is one of my favorite movies.  It is the story of a small Indiana town beating the big city players,  and, if I am not mistaken, my former colleague in the House, Lee  Hamilton, might have been one of those players on the big city team. I  think he told me at one point. It is a great story and all eyes are on  Indianapolis and Indiana now with the NCAA tournament and your  neighbors to the west, Illinois, headed across the border. It is going  to make a good showing, I hope, for the Fighting Illini.   Thank you very much for reminding us of that great American  tradition.
