The GBU-12: This is a 500 lb (BLU-111/B or Mk-82) guided       bomb fitted with the MXU-650 airfoil and the MAU-169 or MAU       209 computer control group to guide to its laser-designated       target.        6. GBU-49 and GBU-50 are 500 lb/2000 lb Enhanced Paveway II       (EP-II) dual mode laser and GPS guided munitions       respectively. The GBU-49/50 uses airfoil groups similar to       those used on the GBU-12 and GBU-10 for inflight       maneuverability, and uses a MAU-210 Enhanced Computer Control       Group. The ``enhanced'' component is the addition of GPS       guidance to the laser seeker. This dual-mode allows the       weapon to operate in all-weather conditions. Weapons       components are UNCLASSIFIED. Technical data and       countermeasures/vulnerabilities are SECRET. The overall       system classification is SECRET.        7. GBU-31 and GBU-38 2000 lb/500 lb Joint Direct Attack       Munitions (JDAM) is a guidance kit that converts existing       unguided free-fall bombs into precision-guided munitions. By       adding a new tail section containing Inertial Navigation       System (INS) guidance/Global Positioning System (GPS)       guidance to existing inventories of BLU-109, BLU-111 and       BLU-117 or Mk-84 and Mk-82 bombs, the cost effective JDAM       provides highly accurate weapon delivery in any       ``flyable'' weather. The INS, using updates from the GPS,       helps guide the bomb to the target via the use of movable       tail fins. The JDAM and all of its components are       UNCLASSIFIED; technical data for JDAM is classified up to       SECRET.        8. GBU-54/56 are the 500 lb/2000 lb Laser JDAM. These       weapons use the DSU-38/B/DSU-40/42 laser sensor respectively       and use both Global Position System aided inertial navigation       and/or laser guidance to execute threat targets. The laser       sensor enhances standard JDAM's reactive target capability by       allowing rapid prosecution of fixed targets with large       initial target location errors (TLE). The laser sensor also       provides the additional capability to engage mobile targets.       The addition of the DSU-38 laser sensor combined with       additional cabling and mounting hardware turns a GBU-38 JDAM       into a GBU-54 Laser JDAM. The addition of the DSU-40/42 laser       sensor combined with additional cabling and mounting hardware       turns a GBU-31 JDAM into a GBU-56 Laser JDAM. Weapons       components are UNCLASSIFIED. Technical data and       countermeasures/vulnerabilities are SECRET. The overall       system classification is SECRET.        9. GBU-39 Small Diameter Bomb (SDB-1): The GBU-39 is a 250       lb class precision guided munition that allows aircraft with       an ability to carry a high number of bombs. The weapon offers       day or night, adverse weather, precision engagement       capability against pre-planned fixed or stationary soft, non-      hardened, and hardened targets, with a significant standoff       range. Aircraft are able to carry four SDB-ls in place of one       2000 lb bomb. The SDB-1 is equipped with a UPS-aided inertial       navigation system to attack fixed, stationary targets such as       fuel depots and bunkers. The SDB-1 and all of its components       are UNCLASSIFIED; technical data is classified up to SECRET.        10. The AGM-154 Joint Standoff Weapon (JSOW) is a family of       low-cost standoff weapons that are modular in design and       incorporate either a sub-munition or a unitary warhead.       Potential targets for JSOW range from soft targets, such as       troop concentrations, to hardened point targets like bunkers.       The AGM-154C is a penetrator weapon that carries a BROACH       warhead and pay load. The AGM-154 hardware, software and       maintenance data is UNCLASSIFIED. Vulnerabilities and       countermeasures are classified up to SECRET. Overall system       classification is SECRET.        11. The AGM-84L-1 Harpoon provides a day, night, and       adverse weather, standoff air-to-surface capability. Harpoon       Block II is a follow on to the Harpoon missile, which is no       longer in production. Harpoon Block II is an effective Anti-      Surface Warfare missile. The AGM-84L-1 Harpoon incorporates       components, software, and technical design information that       are considered sensitive. The following Harpoon components       being conveyed by the proposed sale that are considered       sensitive and are classified CONFIDENTIAL include: IIR       seeker, INS, OPP software and, missile operational       characteristics and performance data. The overall system       classification is SECRET.        12. Software, hardware, and other data/information, which       is classified or sensitive, is reviewed prior to release to       protect system vulnerabilities, design data, and performance       parameters. Some end-item hardware, software, and other data       identified above are classified at the CONFIDENTIAL and       SECRET level. Potential compromise of these systems is       controlled through management of the basic software programs       of highly sensitive systems and software-controlled weapon       systems on a case-by-case basis.        13. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        14. A determination has been made that Bahrain can provide       substantially the same degree of protection of this       technology as the U.S. Government. This proposed sale is       necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification. Moreover, the benefits to be derived from this       sale, as outlined in the Policy Justification, outweigh the       potential damage that could result if the sensitive       technology were revealed to unauthorized persons.        15. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal are authorized for release and export to the       Government of Bahrain.                                   ____     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

The proposed sale       will support the Czech Republic's need for its own self-      defense and support NATO defense goals.        The Czech Republic is considering either the UH-60M or the       UH-1Y/AH-1Z to replace its aging Mi-24 helicopters. The Czech       Republic intends to use these helicopters to modernize its       armed forces and strengthen its homeland defense and deter       regional threats. This will contribute to the Czech       Republic's military goal of updating its capabilities while       further enhancing interoperability with the United States and       NATO allies. The Czech Republic will have no difficulty       absorbing these helicopters into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment will not alter the       basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractors will be Sikorsky Aircraft       Company, Stratford, Connecticut; and General Electric       Aircraft Company (GEAC), Lynn, Massachusetts. There are no       known offset agreements in connection with this potential       sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale may require the       assignment of an additional three U.S. Government and five       contractor representatives in country full-time to support       the delivery and training for approximately two-five years.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.

The PAC-3 MSE is a high velocity,       hit-to-kill, surface-to-air missile that provides critical       air and missile defense by intercepting and destroying       Tactical Ballistic Missiles (TBM), Air-Breathing Threats       (ABT), cruise missiles, and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS).        2. The PAC-3 MSE sensitive/critical technology is primarily       in the area of design and production know-how and primarily       inherent in the design, development and/or manufacturing data       related to certain components. The list of components is       classified CONFIDENTIAL.        3. Information on system performance capabilities,       effectiveness, survivability, missile seeker capabilities,       select software/software documentation and test data are       classified up to and including SECRET.        4. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems which might reduce system effectiveness or       be used in the development of a system with similar or       advanced capabilities.        5. A determination has been made that the Government of the       UAE can provide substantially the same degree of protection       for the sensitive technology being released as the U.S.       Government. This sale is necessary in furtherance of the U.S.       foreign policy and national security objectives outlined in       the Policy Justification.        6. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the United Arab Emirates.                            ____________________
