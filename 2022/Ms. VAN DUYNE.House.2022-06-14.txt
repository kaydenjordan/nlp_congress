 Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose the previous question  so that we can immediately consider H.R. 6858, the American Energy  Independence from Russia Act, to address U.S. energy security, the  production of oil and gas, and the importation and exportation of oil  and gas.   Gas prices have already topped $5 per gallon, and economists are  predicting they will be $6 per gallon by August. Every American driver  is paying nearly double since Biden took office, and the crisis is only  getting worse.                                time  1330    This administration should have seen this coming. You can say what  you want. You can blame whoever you want. This administration is  failing to recognize that its policies have had a direct result on gas  prices.   You don't block crucial pipelines. You don't block domestic  infrastructure. You don't shut down drilling on Federal lands, declare  war on the oil and gas industry, and become reliant on Russian oil and  not expect prices to skyrocket and our global standing to weaken.   This administration is obviously not going to do anything but make  this crisis worse, so this body must act.   The American Energy Independence from Russia Act will strengthen U.S.  energy security, counter Russia, create American jobs, and protect  domestic oil and gas dependency and production.   Republicans have proposed countless pragmatic bills, including the  Strategy to Secure Offshore Energy Act, which I recently introduced.  This directs the Department of the Interior to publish the next 5-year  plan for offshore oil and gas lease sales.   We must hold this administration accountable as they continue to  throw their hands up and blame everyone else for the energy crisis that  they created. This bill will help provide the certainty necessary for  continued investment in offshore production and support our domestic  energy security.   In my colleague's home State of California, gas has reached $9.60 a  gallon. Surely, we can all agree that that is unconscionable and must  be addressed.   Madam Speaker, I urge opposition to the previous question so that we  can pass needed legislation to put us back on course to unlocking  American energy independence.
