 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity very much.  You notice, Mr. Speaker, those who do not live in the great State of  Maine are very envious of those who do; so I take full advantage of the  moose, bear, and other critters that we have in the State of Maine.   Right now, today, Mr. Speaker, I am talking about H.R. 4263, the  Regulation A+ Improvement Act, and I want to congratulate the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. MacArthur) for the great work he has done on this  bill, and I want to thank Chairman Hensarling for bringing this bill to  the floor. It is very important for all of us to consider this.   Now, Mr. Speaker, we all know what we want in this country, which are  more opportunities and more jobs for our kids--better opportunities for  our kids so they will have better lives and more freedom. This cannot  happen, Mr. Speaker, unless our businesses are able to grow and hire  more individuals and pay them more.   Now, that mostly can only happen, Mr. Speaker, if businesses are able  to more easily borrow money. The chairman and I both know that the  government's job is to help our economy grow, not get in the way.   That is why Reg. A+ cuts through the red tape such that more small-  and medium-sized businesses are able to access capital, grow their  operations, and hire more people. In a sense, Reg. A+ has implemented,  Mr. Speaker, billions of dollars of new financing and has led economic  growth in small to medium businesses to grow and present more  opportunities for their workers. So Reg. A+ works. We know that because  the evidence is there.   With that, Mr. Speaker, I would like to close by saying, Mr.  MacArthur's bill is a commonsense technical adjustment to a bill--a  rule, rather, that works. It simply increases the amount that companies  are able to borrow under this rule that works.   Please, everybody, Republicans and Democrats, support Mr. MacArthur's  bill.
