 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 350,  the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act.   Here we are again, reeling from another horrific domestic terrorist  attack. This week a racially motivated  [[Page H5150]]  shooting in Buffalo, New York, perpetrated by an avowed white  supremacist.   In 2018, it was the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh. In April of  2019, it was a synagogue in Poway, California. On August 3, 2019, it  was my community of El Paso, Texas.   After every attack on minority communities by radicalized and heavily  armed young men who have embraced white supremacy, our media and even  some of our colleagues, leaders in this country, refuse to call this  violence what it is: domestic terrorism.   H.R. 350 calls on the Department of Justice and the Department of  Homeland Security to dedicate resources specifically to track and  combat the growing threat of white supremacy and neo-Nazism in the  United States.   H.R. 350 will give communities like mine a fighting chance the next  time an angry racist shares a deranged screed online and decides to  drive hours to attack vulnerable and innocent people at our grocery  stores or our houses of worship.   The Anti-Defamation League has tracked 450 murders over the last  decade committed by these terrorists. Rightwing extremists are  responsible for over 75 percent of these horrific attacks, and 50  percent of these horrific attacks are by white supremacists.   Mr. Speaker, America has a racism problem. America has a hate  problem. America has a domestic terrorism problem. We must address it.  The Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act is a crucial step in the right  direction.
