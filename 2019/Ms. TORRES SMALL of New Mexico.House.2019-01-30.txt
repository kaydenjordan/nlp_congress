 Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize the food banks and organizations across New Mexico that  supported Federal employees, contractors, and their families during the  shutdown.   I especially want to thank Arlene Murillo and the Border Patrol Agent  Family Network in Sunland Park, New Mexico. It was an honor to witness  their collaborative work, to feed their neighbors who were affected by  the shutdown, or otherwise fighting hunger for other reasons.   New Mexicans were among the hardest hit when the government stopped  paying its bills, but these organizations showed what it is to be New  Mexicans, and embody the value to always have your neighbor's back.   Now that the damage and disruption of the shutdown is over, we as a  Congress have a responsibility to ensure it never happens again. That  is why I joined fellow freshman and signed on to the Shutdown to End  All Shutdowns Act yesterday, to keep hardworking Americans from paying  the price for Washington's brokenness.   Madam Speaker, I invite my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  do the same.                            ____________________
