 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, today, the Senate is going to continue  focusing on confirming even more of President Biden's highly qualified  nominees, both to serve in his administration and for lifetime  appointments on the Federal bench.   Yesterday, we confirmed three more district judges through this  Chamber, each with bipartisan support. We are going to continue today  with two more nominees, and I hope we can see continued bipartisan  cooperation.   In less than a year, Senate Democrats have worked swiftly and  decisively to fill vacancies on the Federal bench with qualified,  mainstream, and dedicated jurists. We are well on our way to making  today's Federal bench the most diverse in a long, long time. Through  September, at least three-quarters of President Biden's circuit-level  nominees have been people of color.   Let me say that again because that makes me proud. Through September,  at least three-quarters of President Biden's circuit-level nominees  have been people of color.   Nearly a third of all of President Biden's nominees are former public  defenders, and several of them have impressive backgrounds as civil  rights lawyers, voting rights champions, and experience outside the  well-trodden path of corporate law or Federal prosecution.   By focusing intentionally on confirming judges that bring both  personal and professional experience to the judiciary, we are expanding  the possibilities of who merits consideration to the bench at all.   Judges, obviously, are an essential component of a healthy democracy.  We will strengthen the public's trust in a fair, independent judiciary  if the bench better reflects the rich diversity of this country, while  adhering to the rule of law.   One confirmation at a time, Democrats are swiftly restoring balance  to our courts, and we are full steam ahead to confirm more mainstream  and qualified and diverse judges as they become available.                            ____________________     Now, on Build Back Better, Mr. President. Yesterday was  another productive day as we make progress towards finalizing President  Biden's Build Back Better plan.   After another vigorous, spirited caucus lunch, meetings continue with  Senate colleagues and members of the White House, as well as with the  President. An agreement is within arm's length, and we are hopeful that  we can come to a framework agreement by the end of today; but we must-- we must--continue working a little more to make sure it is the best  deal possible for the American people.   I am working especially hard to strengthen Medicare and make  prescription drugs more affordable. Senator Sanders has worked hard to  push for many of these Medicare provisions, and I support them.   At its core, the goals of Build Back Better are about restoring the  middle class in the 21st century; helping people who are in the middle  class stay there; helping people who are struggling to get to the  middle class to get there; and give more Americans the opportunity for  good, fulfilling lives and better lives for their kids. And, of course,  we must take bold action to tackle the climate crisis, which could  overwhelm our globe all too quickly if we don't act.  [[Page S7394]]    It is an agenda that favors not those at the very top, but everyday  Americans who are struggling to achieve the American dream in the 21st  century. Unfortunately, the past 20 years in America have been a story  of middle-class decline. Even before COVID, the Federal Reserve  estimated that over 40 percent of Americans in this day and age would  still--still--have trouble covering an emergency expense of just $400,  which you can easily incur if you have to fix your car, make repairs at  home, or visit a doctor.   A few decades ago, the story was very different. For much of the  post-war era, most Americans had confidence that if you were willing to  work hard, you could save a little and you could leave something behind  for your loved ones. Nobody was guaranteed riches, but the basic  bargain in America was that those who put in an honest day's work would  be able to make ends meet.   Build Back Better is precisely--precisely--about rekindling that  faith in the American dream. That is no easy task. Americans face  serious, severe challenges today that did not exist in the past.  Raising a family is more difficult than ever. The challenges of finding  and affording childcare and pre-K have grown exponentially. Seniors are  struggling to afford basic drug care and basic drugs.   These are not luxury items. These aren't handouts or entitlements.  These are essentials. They are essentials that families need in order  to work and get ahead, and they are oftentimes much, much harder to  afford than they were in the past.   That is what we mean by providing ladders to the middle class and  helping families stay in the middle class. That is what we mean by  reviving that sunny American optimism, which this country has lost in  the last few decades. We have got to get it back, and the only way we  can get it back is by bold action that gives people renewed hope in  their futures and the future of their children.   The work we do right now will echo far into the 21st century. This is  the best opportunity we have had in a long time to make sure that the  decades to come will offer the same--or even greater--opportunities  that Americans enjoyed in the past.   And if Democrats keep working together, if we keep our eye on the  ultimate goal, and we keep negotiating to find that legislative sweet  spot, then we will succeed in rewarding the trust that the American  people have placed on us.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
