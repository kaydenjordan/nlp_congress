 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I am pleased the Senate is finally  debating S. 1 after three inexplicable Democratic attempts to  filibuster the bill. This package of Middle East policy bills, all of  which have bipartisan support, addresses a number of key issues.   For starters, this legislation will further strengthen our  relationship with our closest ally in the Middle East, Israel. It  authorizes 10 years of military support funding to Israel. It reaffirms  the U.S. commitment to ensuring that Israel has better weapons and  equipment than its enemies. It will also foster increased technical  cooperation between Israel and the United States to support the  security of both of our countries.   The legislation also strengthens our relationship with another close  ally of ours in the Middle East, the Kingdom of Jordan. The Senate  Intelligence Committee hearing on Tuesday was a timely reminder of the  importance of investing in our alliances. Senior intelligence officials  testified that China and Russia are becoming increasingly aggressive in  seeking to increase their influence, not just in their own regions but  in other parts of the world. Russia's support in the Syrian regime is a  prime example.   Now, more than ever, it is vital that we maintain close relationships  with our allies. The legislation before us also contains the Caesar  Syria Civilian Protection Act. This legislation will help hold  accountable individuals who have supported the atrocities of the Assad  regime. It directs the Treasury Department to investigate whether the  Central Bank of Syria launders money for the Syrian Government.   The conflict in Syria has claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and  driven literally millions of Syrians from their country. While the  United States cannot solve every conflict around the world, it is vital  that we make it very clear the United States will not tolerate those  who have contributed to the brutality of Bashar al-Assad's government.   Finally, the legislation we are considering today will protect the  right of State and local governments to decline to do business with  entities that have chosen to boycott Israel. As I said, all of the  bills in the legislation before us today have bipartisan support, and I  hope the Senate will pass this legislation with a strong bipartisan  majority.                               Amendment No. 65    Madam President, I also would like to take a few moments to talk  about an amendment the leader has proposed. As I noted, this week, our  intelligence community leaders gave a frank assessment of the threats  we face to our national security and to our interests, from ISIS and  al-Qaida to the danger posed by a growing alignment between Russia and  China, to Iran's destabilizing activities in the Middle East. As  intelligence officials made clear, the U.S. faces numerous persistent  threats, and we should be wary of letting our guard down or becoming  complacent about our strength. For that reason, I would like to state  my support for Leader McConnell's amendment to express the sense of the  Senate that we should be cautious about any premature withdrawal of our  troops from Syria and Afghanistan.   We don't have to look back very far for a reminder that prematurely  withdrawing our troops can create a power vacuum that terrorists and  others will step in to fill. Our too-hasty withdrawal from Iraq, on a  timeline we announced to our enemies, created the circumstances that  allowed for the rise of ISIS. We need to be wary about allowing  something like that to happen again.   Terrorist groups are not the only entities we have to worry about.  Adversaries like Russia and Iran are already trying to flex their power  in the Middle East and would be more than happy to take advantage of an  early U.S. withdrawal to strengthen their foothold in the region.   While I understand and respect President Trump's desire to bring our  troops home and to end these protracted wars, we must do so in a way  that ensures enduring stability and protects our interests and those of  our allies. The leader's amendment is an important reminder of the need  for caution and reflection as we consider troop withdrawals and would  reassure our allies that the United States does not intend to abruptly  leave them in the midst of the battle.   I hope all my colleagues will support the leader's amendment when we  vote on it later this afternoon.                             USS ``South Dakota''    Madam President, before I close, I would like to mention the  commission of the Navy's newest Virginia-class attack submarine, the  USS South Dakota, which will occur this Saturday, February 2, 2019, in  Groton, CT. Designated SSN 790, the USS South Dakota will be the 17th  submarine of her class, pushing the envelope of U.S. maritime  technology and undersea dominance.   We are proud the State of South Dakota will once again be represented  in the fleet by this engineering marvel, which will project America's  strength and protect our national interests throughout the maritime  domain and beyond.   In March 2012, I led the South Dakota delegation, which then included  Senator Tim Johnson and Congresswoman Kristi Noem, in writing Secretary  of the Navy Mabus to request that the Navy name its next attack  submarine the USS South Dakota. I join them and all South Dakotans in  saying we are excited to see this honor come to fruition.   The South Dakota will build off the legacy of her forebears, a  Pennsylvania-class armored cruiser that served as a troop escort in  World War I and a battleship that was one of the most decorated  battleships in World War II. The battleship South Dakota was a proud  representative of the 68,000 South Dakotans who answered their  country's call to serving the war, earning 13 battle stars in the  Pacific theater.   The South Dakota led with her nine 16-inch guns in the battles of the  Santa Cruz Islands and Guadalcanal, which earned her a reputation as a  fighting machine by defending U.S. aircraft carriers and disabling the  enemy's.  [[Page S778]]    In her second Pacific tour, the South Dakota supported marine  landings on the Marshall Islands with shore bombardments before joining  the Battle of the Philippine Sea and fighting through a bomb hit in  order to defend our fast carriers. As information on U.S. military  action was limited at the time, she was often referred to as  ``Battleship X'' and ``Old Nameless.''   The submarine South Dakota will continue this distinguished tradition  of service, and as is the nature of the submarine force, the  accomplishments of this new boat and her crew may be even more  secretive than those of her battleship predecessor's. In fact, it could  be decades until we fully appreciate all the South Dakota might do in  her 30-plus-year service life. We may very well read about her exploits  in a sequel to ``Blind Man's Bluff''--the daring account of early U.S.  submarine espionage and power projection.   Because of the nature of their work, the so-called Silent Service is  often an undersung hero of the U.S. military's. I have certainly never  seen a submarine at an airshow or coming down Main Street in a parade.  The nature of the sub force's mission is as secretive as it is high  stakes, but at any given moment, the U.S. submarine force is patrolling  the depths of the ocean and is monitoring littoral waters for threats  against our Nation and our allies.   The South Dakota will project power at sea and ashore with her  payload of torpedoes and Tomahawk cruise missiles, which can be  delivered without warning. Undetected, she will carry out the seven  core competencies of the submarine force--anti-submarine warfare, anti- surface warfare, the delivery of special operations forces, strike  warfare, irregular warfare, intelligence, surveillance and  reconnaissance, and mine warfare--all while keeping adversaries on  their toes.   While Saturday will be a time for our Navy and the country to  celebrate this milestone, the South Dakota won't just be talked about  here at home; around the world, our adversaries are taking note as this  submarine will further strengthen our global presence and ability to  protect the interests of the U.S. and our allies. Our adversaries are  already undertaking significant efforts to challenge U.S. military  capabilities and international order.   While they can try to copy our designs, mimic our operational  concepts, or even try to replicate the way we train, one thing they  will never be able to do is to imitate our people. The commissioning  crew has proven its aptitude and professionalism in the months leading  up to this point. The men and women of our submarine force, like those  who serve in the ranks across the Department of Defense, are the root  of America's military strength.   As Americans, we are grateful for all who have answered the call to  serve and the families who support them, especially those who endure  spending months apart during long deployments. The lives of submariners  are not easy, and they are not easy for their loved ones. We thank them  for their sacrifice.   The South Dakota's complement of 135 talented officers and sailors  will put its population in line with those of South Dakota towns like  Isabel, Pierpont, and Java. Like South Dakota's rural towns, the USS  South Dakota will be a tight-knit community of its own, albeit one that  is uniquely confined to a submersed vessel just over a football field  long and with a nuclear reactor.   The indigenous inhabitants and early pioneer settlers of the State of  South Dakota instilled a resourceful and resilient ethic in the culture  of our State that continues to this day. This was driven by the remote,  austere, and often unforgiving conditions on the Great Plains. I am  confident that such hardiness will be replicated in all officers and  crew members of the South Dakota as they live up to the boat's motto,  which means ``Under the sea, we rule.''   As boat sponsor Deanie Dempsey brings the boat to life on Saturday,  we thank the officers and crew of the South Dakota for their dedicated  service to our country.   May God bless the USS South Dakota and keep watch over her as she  patrols the seas.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture  vote on the McConnell amendment occur at 3 p.m. today, and the filing  deadline for second-degree amendments apply as if the vote occurred at  the originally scheduled time of 3:30 p.m.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator  from Tennessee (Mr. Alexander), the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Blunt),  the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Isakson), the Senator from Kansas (Mr.  Moran), the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Paul), the Senator from Georgia  (Mr. Perdue), and the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Sullivan).   Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Tennessee (Mr.  Alexander) would have voted ``yea,'' the Senator from Kansas (Mr.  Moran) would have voted ``yea,'' and the Senator from Alaska (Mr.  Sullivan) would have voted ``yea.''
