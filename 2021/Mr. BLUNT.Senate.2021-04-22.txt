 Mr. President, I rise today to honor a Springfield,  MO, resident who has dedicated 38 years of her life in service to the  city of Springfield by helping facilitate economic development,  creating and retaining thousands of jobs, and bringing life to the  downtown area. Mary Lilly Smith started her career in 1983 as a city  planner for downtown Springfield, where she helped create the city's  initial neighborhood conservation office. During the next 38 years,  Mary played an instrumental role in nearly 100 key economic  initiatives.   Mary is best known for her 17 years as the economic development  director. Along with her commitment to the downtown area, she created  the Economic Development Incentives Policy Manual, which became a  template for other towns and cities across the State to implement  development policies. In addition to her economic development  initiatives, Mary made sure to preserve the city of Springfield's  incredible history. Throughout her nearly four decades of service, Mary  has developed many different approaches to preserving and honoring the  history of the area. She also developed the city's first capital  improvement program, which facilitated a change in the review process  for protecting architecturally significant historical properties.   Mary leaves behind a legacy for the city of Springfield to be enjoyed  by all for years to come. For her many years of service, she has earned  her retirement. As she enters this new chapter of her life, I offer  Mary best wishes.                            ____________________
