 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time  and for his work.   Mr. Chair, when you drive up north through and past my district in  California, you go through some amazing places--Sequoia National Park,  Kings Canyon, then right on over to Yosemite. These are beautiful  places. American treasures. You don't have to go far off the road to  feel like you are remote and completely surrounded by the peacefulness  of nature.   I have had my troubles with the EPA--regulatory cap and trade, waters  of the U.S. rule. They are a couple that come to mind. But I do think  and believe there is a purpose to ozone standards that clean up our air  and make our communities healthier.   Yet the latest ozone and particulate matter regulations are so severe  and divorced from reality that even the national parks like Sequoia,  Kings Canyon, and Yosemite may not be clean enough. If such pristine  nature isn't clean, nothing can be.   The problem is that the EPA sets new standards before we reach the  old ones, and even before we have the technology to reach the new  standards, the only result will be failure.   California's Central Valley faces many disadvantages with air  quality. We have prevailing winds from the north to send us pollution  from San Francisco, and because of our topography, it traps it all in.  But we have made some amazing progress. Good days, when ozone isn't a  problem, are up 144 percent since 2002. Unhealthy ones are down over 75  percent in the same period. You see similar trends in particulate  matter as well.   But no matter how much better we make our air, we cannot catch up to  reach the latest unrealistic EPA hurdles. The head of the San Joaquin  Valley Air Pollution Control District said that, to do so, we would  have to stop all fossil fuel combustion in the Central Valley. If we  don't do that, don't stop all industry, stop building, stop businesses,  and even stop driving our cars, you know what will happen? We will be  punished, and we will be fined for where we live.   Now, something obviously has to change because these regulations are  not rooted in reality. In this legislation, Mr. Chair, Congressman Pete  Olson's Ozone Standards Implementation Act, we don't get rid of ozone  or particulate matter standards, we don't even oppose raising our  standards when we use our technology and abilities to improve. What we  do is make sure that the standards are set with a specific level for a  set time so that the EPA cannot come back and change the goalpost every  few years.   What we do is make sure that the EPA actually determines whether  something is technologically possible when setting new attainment  deadlines. What we do is make sure we aren't penalized for all things  affecting our air that we can't control.                                time  1530    We made sure that this legislation accomplished these goals without  rolling back the protections for our communities or without backsliding  on meeting current EPA standards in the Central Valley.   In the end, we must have clean air, but we have to be smart with this  and set achievable and fixed goals our communities can meet. Building  on our success, the people of our district and across America can  continue to have cleaner air tomorrow than we do today.
