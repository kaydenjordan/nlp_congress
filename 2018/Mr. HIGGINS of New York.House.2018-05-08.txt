 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of my friend Frank Mesiah, the recently deceased former longtime  president of the Buffalo NAACP.   After serving in the United States Armed Forces, Frank returned to  Buffalo in 1950, where he would serve in law enforcement and education  and would take on discrimination cases for the State Department of  Labor.   Frank left an indelible mark on Buffalo, dedicating his life to  fighting discrimination. Frank was a leader passionately committed to  positive change. Frank was instrumental in the desegregation of Buffalo  public schools and the successful integration of the Buffalo Police  Department.   Western New York is grateful for Frank's lifetime of tireless work to  advance the cause of justice and equality, the impact of which we and  future generations will feel for years to come.                            ____________________
