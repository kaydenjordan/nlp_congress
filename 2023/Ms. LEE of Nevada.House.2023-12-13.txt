 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as southern Nevada is  reeling in the wake of a horrifying mass shooting at the University of  Nevada, Las Vegas.   We remember Jerry Chang, Patricia Navarro-Velez, and Naoko Takemaru.  All three of these faculty members were killed last week at work in the  middle of the day while teaching our next generation of leaders.   Once again, 6 years after Las Vegas witnessed the Nation's deadliest  mass shooting, our community is coming together to mourn another  entirely preventable loss of life this week when four more people were  shot and killed in the northwest valley.   As we pick up the pieces of these tragedies, our community is once  again asking why. Why do we continue to accept these atrocities as  normal? Why do we tolerate this violence when we have legislation  before us that could save lives and stop the next tragedy before it is  too late?   Mr. Speaker, I have a son in college. He is a freshman. I worry every  day about the possibility that a tragedy like this would strike his  campus. For many parents in my community, that worry became a reality  last week. They saw texts and tweets with the breaking news that every  parent in this country has come to fear: an active shooter at their  child's school.   Students were instructed to run, hide, and fight. That is not normal.  For our kids, this reality is even more traumatic--the sound of  gunshots, barricading classroom doors, everyone hiding under their  desks, silence, not knowing whether the next person to walk through  that door is someone to save them or a murderous assailant. That is not  normal.   Let's not forget the resulting emotional trauma that will plague  everyone involved for years to come.   We are all incredibly grateful for the quick action of the first  responders, the University Police Services, and the Las Vegas  Metropolitan Police Department, who all bravely prevented that day from  becoming even deadlier.   Like so many mothers in this country, I am angry, and I am exhausted.  This has become a reality for far too many Americans for far too long.   Last week's shooting at UNLV was the 80th shooting at a school this  year, a year that has broken the record for mass shootings and claimed  the lives of over 40,000 children, parents, and neighbors. That is not  normal.   On that same day that we lost three of our own in southern Nevada,  Senate Republicans were busy blocking legislation that could prevent  another tragedy. Students, faculty, and university staff were hiding  for their lives, cowering in fear, while Washington politicians were  cowering behind the gun lobby that refuses to support policies demanded  by an overwhelming majority of Americans.   That should not be normal.   Nevadans are tired of it, and so am I. We cannot and should not  continue to accept this violence. Weapons of war on our streets are not  normal. Barricading classroom doors is not normal. Parents being afraid  to send their children to school, from kindergarten to college, is not  normal.   I don't want to hold another vigil. I don't want to hold another  moment of silence. What I want to do is I want this institution, which  Nevadans sent me to help fix, to stop accepting this violence and to  end this sick cycle of inaction.   Mr. Speaker, I am not naive enough to think that we can't prevent  every shooting, but, God, please, let us at least get caught trying.   Mr. Speaker, I am begging my colleagues and anyone who is listening  to consider why we have accepted this for so long. Please, let's honor  these victims with action.                            ____________________
