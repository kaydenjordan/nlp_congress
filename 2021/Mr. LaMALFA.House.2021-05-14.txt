 Madam Speaker, I rise today with deep concern over the  escalating attacks on the Israeli people by Palestinian terror groups  like Hamas.   After a period of relative stability in the region, these attacks  threaten to create an all-out war that will endanger millions. This is  an avoidable outcome born of inattention and incompetence.   It is no coincidence that this violence has erupted as the Biden  administration has pivoted away from the Middle East. The leadership  vacuum created by this absence can only allow radical elements who  would harm us and our allies. It is maddening to see the progress made  under the Trump administration toward stabilizing the Middle East  undone.   It was less than a year ago that the Abraham Accords, perhaps the  most significant move toward peace in the region in over a decade or  longer, were signed. We cannot let these gains be wasted.   The American people stand firmly behind the people of Israel. They  have every right to defend themselves. Their existence depends on it.   The Biden administration must abandon its retreat and reengage on the  previous successful peace process in the  [[Page H2348]]  Middle East. We cannot abandon our strong ally in Israel by our  indifference or inaction, especially when they need us most.                            ____________________
