 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding the time.   I rise in strong opposition to H. Res. 11, which would create a  select committee on China. The only reason why we are creating this  select committee on China is because extremist MAGA Republicans in last  week's circular firing squad election for Speaker, the Speaker had to  promise to allow creation of this committee.   We have watched China rise. We know their activities. We know what  kind of competition they pose to our economy, national security,  intellectual property, human rights, all of these issues. We know where  we stand with China, and each of those issues are covered by committees  of jurisdiction that exist right now. Any investigation that is done  can be done through the existing committees.   So why are we creating this committee?   I fear that it is to create a platform to unleash anti-Asian hate and  division. This committee should not be used as an open invitation to  engage and traffic in blatantly xenophobic anti-Asian rhetoric that we  know historically results in violence against the Asian people in this  country.   That is the reason why I oppose the creation of this select  committee.    I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H. Res. 12, the  insurrection protection committee, which Speaker McCarthy, the 21st  century McCarthyism, had to agree to last week in order to gain the  Speakership.   MAGA extremist Republicans forced, as a consequence of getting their  vote, the Speaker to promise to create this select committee. Donald  Trump had his hands in it. Donald Trump had his hands in it last week.  During this circular firing squad, he was calling the shots, and this  will benefit him.   This insurrection protection committee is set up to insulate the ex- President, along with various MAGA Republicans who are still serving  here in the House and who are under investigation. It is here to  protect them from that investigation. It is here to disrupt the flow of  justice in this country.   This is a dangerous, extreme committee that is put in the hands of a  group of people who even defied congressional subpoenas and refused to  come to testify before the January 6th Committee.                                time  1400    Now they are trying to interfere with the Justice Department  deliberations on whether or not they should be accused and charged with  committing criminal offenses in the lead up to, on January 6, and  thereafter. This is a very dangerous piece of legislation.   MAGA Republicans are behind it, led by the head election denier in  this country, who, by the way, instituted something down in Brazil this  weekend. It is a worldwide affair. This is dangerous. We must stop it.  Vote ``no'' on H. Res. 12.
