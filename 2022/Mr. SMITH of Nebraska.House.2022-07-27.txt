 Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time is  remaining?    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Iowa (Mrs. Miller-Meeks).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Murphy).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume. I will be brief in my remarks here.   I know that you have heard several concerns expressed about this  entire process, and I would certainly share those concerns.   I do think that this is a great opportunity to address a bipartisan  issue that is important across America. But it appears this bill was  negotiated quickly, in secret, and outside the committees of  jurisdiction. Neither outside stakeholders nor Members who have worked  extensively on telehealth policy were consulted, as far as I can tell,  and the closed rule under which this is being considered has precluded  any opportunity to improve or amend the bill.   An issue this important deserves an open and transparent process that  follows regular order, allowing Members to offer input and highlight  important needs which might otherwise have been overlooked. We call  this legislating.   If we had worked together on the Ways and Means Committee with our  Energy and Commerce friends and had included the various ideas and  innovations, this would have been a true and real bipartisan bill. I am  confident that the telehealth extension we are considering today would  be even better, as has been mentioned by my colleagues.   In fact, back in May, I introduced a bipartisan bill almost identical  to this one called the Connecting Rural Telehealth to the Future Act.  That bill extended all the provisions included in the FY22 omnibus  through at least 2024 and also included provisions to ensure critical  access hospitals can continue to provide telehealth services to their  patients. It also corrects a flaw in the CARES Act which shortchanges  federally qualified health centers and rural health clinics which offer  telehealth services.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record two letters from the National  Rural Health Association and the National Association of Rural Health  Clinics expressing their support for both the aims of H.R. 4040 as well  as the need to extend critical rural health provisions from the  Connecting Rural Telehealth to the Future bill.                                                      National Rural                                              Health Association,                                                      July 26, 2022.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Minority Leader McCarthy: The       National Rural Health Association (NRHA) applauds the House       of Representatives for prioritizing telehealth flexibilities       by scheduling a vote on H.R. 4040, the Advancing Telehealth       Beyond COVID-19 Act of 2022. This legislation will extend       important telehealth flexibilities enacted in the Coronavirus       Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, and extended       for 151 days post-public health emergency in the Consolidated       Appropriations  [[Page H7194]]       Act (CAA), 2022, until December 31, 2024. NRHA supports the       extension of telehealth flexibilities to show providers that       telehealth is here to stay but urges rural friendly tweaks to       the legislation.        NRHA is a non-profit membership organization with more than       21,000 members nationwide that provides leadership on rural       health issues. Our membership includes every component of       rural America's health care, including rural community       hospitals, critical access hospitals, doctors, nurses, and       patients. We provide leadership on rural health issues       through advocacy, communications, education, and research.        As the text is currently written, H.R. 4040 includes the       extension of distant-site status for Federally Qualified       Health Centers (FQHC) and Rural Health Clinics (RHC) at their       current reimbursement level. While continuation of this       flexibility is necessary, the reimbursement level for virtual       services is significantly lower than in-person services under       current statute. Should reimbursement remain as it is       currently written, by 2028 there will be nearly a $100       discrepancy between services provided in-person and virtually       at RHCs. NRHA believes this will cause rural communities to       utilize these important services less often than their urban       and suburban counterparts moving forward and will cause harm       to an already fragile rural safety net.        To remedy this discrepancy, NRHA urges this text be amended       to incorporate reimbursement updates as reflected in Section       9 of H.R. 7876, the Connecting Rural Telehealth into the       Future Act, introduced by Representatives Adrian Smith (R-NE)       and Terri Sewell (D-AL). Incorporating this legislative text       will bring payment parity between in-person and virtual care       at RHCs and FQHCs and ensure that rural communities have       access to the same health care delivery methods as their       urban and suburban counterparts.        NRHA applauds the House of Representatives for acting on       telehealth to show providers long-term stability. However, to       ensure that rural providers, and their patients, can properly       utilize these services tweaks are needed.            Sincerely,                                                       Alan Morgan,      Chief Executive Officer.                                   ____                                             National Association of                                            Rural Health Clinics,                                                      July 26, 2022.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Kevin McCarthy,      Republican Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy: The National       Association of Rural Health Clinics (NARHC) is grateful that       the House of Representatives is considering extending       Medicare coverage of telehealth through 2024 but we are       concerned that the current language in H.R. 4040 will       perpetuate inequitable payment policies for safety-net       providers.        Presently, our peers in traditional office settings are       able to bill for telehealth services as if the service was       provided physically in the office. In other words, they have       coding and reimbursement parity between telehealth services       and in-person services.        On the other hand, Rural Health Clinics (RHCs) and       Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs) do not use their       normal coding and reimbursement rules for telehealth. RHCs       and FQHCs instead have a ``special payment rule'' that       requires them to bill a single code, G2025, for all       telehealth services which is then reimbursed at a single       nationwide rate (currently $97.24).        We are concerned with this ``special payment rule''       methodology for a whole host of reasons. First and foremost,       the payment is significantly less than what most RHCs and       FQHCs would receive for providing the same service in person,       disincentivizing safety-net providers from offering the       service via telehealth. Second, the current rules require       RHCs and FQHCs to ``carve-out'' all telehealth costs from       their cost report, which adds significant administrative       burden to the cost-reporting process. Third, the use of a       single telehealth code, G2025, has prevented RHCs from       tracking annual wellness visits and other services provided       via telehealth severely hindering their ability to properly       participate in ACOs and other quality programs.        Complicating matters is the fact that for mental health       services provided via telehealth, RHCs and FQHCs do use their       normal coding and reimbursement mechanisms. This policy is       working well, and we believe that is should work this way for       all services, not just mental health services.        NARHC strongly believes that the best way to encourage       telehealth usage in underserved communities is to create       parity between in-person and telehealth policies. We strongly       encourage Congress to amend H.R. 4040 to include the payment       policy enumerated in Section 9 of H.R. 7876, the Connecting       Rural Telehealth to the Future Act introduced by       Representative Adrian Smith and Representative Terri Sewell.        Please feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss       this issue further.            Sincerely,                                                   Nathan Baugh,                                                 Executive Director,                      National Association of Rural Health Clinics.     Madam Speaker, these organizations fully  understand the vital role that rural health clinics and FQHCs and  critical access hospitals play in ensuring access to care for those in  rural and underserved areas.   Even with the passage of this bill, the future of telehealth after  the government-designated public health emergency is uncertain. More  work needs to be done to assess what has worked well over the last 2  years, what can be improved, and what can safely be left behind.   While I do encourage Members to vote ``yes'' on this bill, I hope in  the future we can work in a true bipartisan fashion under regular order  to address the gaps that we know exist in policy and set a long-term,  sustainable course for telehealth well beyond 2024.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1315     Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Hern), a member of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Herrell).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Steel).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Obernolte).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   I think we have had a good discussion here today. I think we have  laid out that we are acting in good faith, supporting an issue, moving  it forward, but also posing the scenario that there are so many other  things we can do to address the very matter that we are taking up here  today.   The surrounding details about how this bill came up and everything, I  think it is problematic for the institution. But the fact of the matter  is, we have an issue here that we need to address. I hope that we can  work to continue to make it permanent in the future so that we can  encourage investment, as was outlined previously, and encourage bending  of the cost curve, ultimately, on healthcare, which is lacking at this  point in time.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill, and I urge a  different kind of cooperation moving forward.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
