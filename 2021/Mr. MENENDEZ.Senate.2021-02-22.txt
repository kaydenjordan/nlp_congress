 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise today to support the nomination  of Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield as U.S. Representative to the  United Nations, the Security Council, and the General Assembly of the  United Nations.   Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield's impressive career in public service  makes her uniquely and eminently qualified for this role. For over 35  years, she has served this country faithfully and ably, under both  Democratic and Republican administrations, in senior Senate-confirmed  positions such as Ambassador to Liberia, Director General of the  Foreign Service, and Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs.   Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield understands at her core that foreign  policy is about forging connections and building relationships. So I  have no doubt that what she calls her personal brand of ``gumbo  diplomacy,'' which emphasizes connecting with others to solve problems,  will be of tremendous service to the United States at an institution  like the United Nations, where personal relationships matter a great  deal.   Our country is truly fortunate that the Ambassador has agreed to  return to public service, especially at this critical moment. We face  an array of formidable challenges, both around the world and at the  U.N., that demand someone with her skills and commitment to democracy,  good governance, human rights, and anti-corruption.   Over the last 4 years, the United States has accrued more than $1  billion in peacekeeping arrears, tried to pull out of the World Health  Organization in the middle of a pandemic, undermined international  protections for women, girls, and LGBTI individuals, defunded or cut  funding to key agencies like the U.N. Population Fund and the Office of  the High Commissioner for Human Rights, and pulled out of the Paris  climate agreement.   Meanwhile, China and other authoritarian countries have filled the  vacuum left by our absence. We must regain U.S. leverage and influence  at the Security Council, where Russia and China  [[Page S760]]  have used their veto powers and ability to bully nonpermanent members  to stymie the Council's work.   They have shielded abusive regimes, like the criminal dictatorship of  Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, and the government of Burma, which  committed genocide against the Rohingya.   Our loss of influence at the Security Council under the Trump  administration was on full display in the disastrous attempt to extend  the U.N. arms embargo on Iran, where the United States could muster  only one other vote of support on the Council--one other vote-- including some of our most longtime allies: Germany, France, Great  Britain, to mention a few. It was an embarrassment, an embarrassment.   Meanwhile, China has increased its role and activities at the United  Nations and in other international organizations and has worked to  pervert and distort the core values that make the U.N.'s work so  important, especially the U.N.'s long-held commitment to human rights.   Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield has a long history of expressed  opposition to China's use of debt-trap tactics and its increasingly  malign presence in world governance bodies.   She has spoken plainly about China's authoritarian ambitions, its  open hostility to universal human rights and democratic values, and has  committed to confronting them every step of the way at the United  Nations.   What the United States desperately needs right now at the U.N. is  renewal and reengagement with key alliances and institutions.  Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield has the expertise, the strength, and the  character to deliver on these priorities, to stand up for the  challenges that we face from China, to regain U.S. leverage and  influence in the Security Council, to reengage our allies and hold Iran  accountable, and to stand firm when Israel is subject to biased  attacks.   Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield has my full support, and I urge my  colleagues to support the nomination.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I ask unanimous consent that the vote be held  immediately.    Mr. President, I have 2 requests for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.
