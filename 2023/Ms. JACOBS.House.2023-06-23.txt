 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Ira  Sharp, a beloved member of the greater San Diego community who passed  away this month.   Ira was a native of St. Louis, where he came of age organizing sit- ins at segregated restaurants, activating students in support of civil  rights, and eventually practicing law.   He later lived here in Washington, D.C., where he and his wife Rose  Ann ran a successful small business in legal services and court  reporting, and in Naples, Florida, until they retired for good in San  Diego.   After their grandson was born and after the Parkland shooting, Ira  and Rose Ann cofounded NeverAgainCA, and Ira served on the national  board of the Brady Campaign. His fingerprints are on nearly every piece  of gun safety legislation in San Diego County and California in the  past decade.   Beyond his immense advocacy, Ira was a good friend. If he was proud  of you, he would tell you. If you had a cause for him to support, he  was there.   May his legacy live on as we continue the work to end gun violence,  and may his memory be a blessing.                            ____________________
