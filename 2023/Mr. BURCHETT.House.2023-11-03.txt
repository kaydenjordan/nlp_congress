 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor the life of my dear friend  John Lyell II, who passed away on October 21 at the age of 76.   The word lobbyist is an ugly word to some people, but as I have often  said: You are either at the table or you are on the dadgum menu.   John was one of the best of these. He always represented his clients  tenaciously, and he was always kind to me and never misled me on any  issue.   John knew my dad at the University of Tennessee. My dad was the dean  of student conduct, and John was a member of the Phi Sigma Kappa  fraternity. When Daddy entered his fraternity house one night after a  late night of parties, there was an empty bottle of Jack Daniel's on  the banister, and John was at the top of the stairs. He yelled down at  my dad, and said, Hey, mister, I don't know who you are, but we don't  allow alcohol at this frat house.   Of course, Daddy was getting ready to shut the whole place down, and  he laughed. He looked at John, and he said, You are either the dumbest  or the smartest--and I will leave the adjective out because we are on  the House floor.   John was just that kind of guy.   He was honorably discharged from the 134th Air Refueling Wing of the  Tennessee Air National Guard at the rank of staff sergeant in 1973. I  am proud to call him a friend.   John Lyell II is survived by his wife, Marilyn; his children, Chris  and John III; his sister, Jane Ann; and three grandchildren.   Mr. Speaker, he won't be forgotten by the folks who had the privilege  of knowing him, and I will truly miss him and his friendship.                            ____________________
