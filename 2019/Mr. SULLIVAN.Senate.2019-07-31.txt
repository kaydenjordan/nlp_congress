 Mr. President, it is the time of week again when I come  to the floor to recognize a very special person in my State--someone  who I believe helps to make Alaska the best State in the country. We  refer to this person as our Alaskan of the Week. It is one of my  favorite times of the week because I get to brag about my State and  brag about my fellow Alaskans and constituents. I think the pages enjoy  these stories about Alaska and what we are doing up there.   This week, that person is Cheryl Venechuk. She is our Alaskan of the  Week. She is a wife, a mom, a grandmother, an active member of her  community in Healy, AK, which is in the interior of Alaska, and a woman  who is very active not just in her community but in her chosen  profession. She is a proud member of Laborers Union Local 942 in  Fairbanks. That is part of the construction union, Laborers'  International Union, LIUNA.   Many people know it for its great men and women across our country-- one of the biggest construction building trades in North America. These  are men and women who like to go out and build stuff--roads, pipelines,  mines, build things. These are the type of Americans who made our  country great.   Let me talk about Cheryl's life--about raising her five children in  Healy, about her job, and about all she does for her community, which  is a lot. I certainly think she personifies the kind of self- sufficiency, toughness, kindness, and independent spirit that Alaska  and Alaskans are known for, not just in Alaska but really throughout  the country and the world. She personifies it.   Let me tell you a little bit about Cheryl's life. She was originally  from the Midwest--Michigan. When she was about 23 years old, a friend  of hers, Tom Bodett--who was a high school friend and eventually became  the voice of Motel 6's motto, ``We'll leave the lights on for you''-- told her that Alaska was a good place to make a living and raise a  family. So Cheryl and her husband Tim, with a child on the way, moved  to a beautiful part of Southeast Alaska, a community called Petersburg,  which is a beautiful fishing community in the southeast part of our  State.   They settled there. They made friends. They began to raise a family.  She worked at the local cannery, at the daycare, at the grocery store.  She loved Petersburg. We all love Petersburg. I encourage people  watching or watching on TV, when you visit Alaska, make sure to make  that part of your stops.   Eventually, three kids later, Cheryl and her husband Tim moved north  for Tim's work as a surveyor for Usibelli Coal Mine in Healy, AK. That  is about 100 miles southwest of Fairbanks in the interior.   Usibelli is another great story in Alaska. Several generations of  Usibelli family members have been producing coal for Alaska and the  world, and they are still doing it--a great company, great families.   What did Cheryl find in Healy? Certainly another welcoming community,  but a lot smaller, with a lot fewer amenities than she found in  Petersburg.   So as she does, Cheryl rolled up her sleeves, and along with other  young mothers in the area, she got to work to create a community that  her children--eventually five children--and all the other children and  families could enjoy in interior Alaska.   ``We made stuff happen,'' Cheryl said. They started a daycare. They  started Boy Scout and Brownie troops. They made sure hungry children  got a hot lunch. They went around town picking up cans and started a  recycling effort before recycling was even the rage. They helped build  an ice rink for the kids to play hockey on. They even went so far as to  haul the water for the rink in a truck and then spread it out to form  ice. She mentored countless kids and always had time for her five kids.   This is what one of her children said about her: You have a hockey  team that needs a hot meal? Call Cheryl. You need food for a wedding?  Call Cheryl. Your kid is in trouble? Call Cheryl. You need something  built? Call Cheryl.   Every community has a Cheryl--the backbone, the go-to person--who is  usually unsung. We all know someone like that, and they make our  communities so strong and caring, and in  [[Page S5222]]  many ways these kind of people are exactly what my ``Alaskan of the  Week'' series of speeches is all about. So it is very appropriate we  are talking about her right now.   When Cheryl was in her mid-forties, with her kids settled and in  college, like a modern-day homesteader, she yearned for the next  challenge. One day, she saw a group of workers doing road  construction--hard, but very important work--and she thought, I can do  that. Soon, she became a proud member of Alaska Laborers Local 942.  That was almost 20 years ago. Her hard work, along with fellow  laborers, is seen all across the State of Alaska, wind farms, trails,  roads, bridges, and pipelines.   Many people talk about the great natural wonders in Alaska, and we  have so many, but the manmade wonders are also remarkable--bridges,  roads slicing into giant mountains, oil rigs, mines--and she and her  fellow laborers have done so much to build up that part of the State.   She is a strong advocate for anybody who decides to work in the  building trades, and she is particularly focused on women in the  construction and building trades and recruiting them for these good  jobs. She said: These are good jobs. They are good-paying jobs, and  they build confidence. It is a great way to make money and to learn how  to use your hands and of course to give back to your community.   To that end, she and her daughter Halle created, at their own  expense, an Alaska ``Women in the Trades'' promotional calendar. The  calendar features women of all ages who are employed as heavy equipment  operators, welders, truckdrivers, tree trimmers, and on and on and on.  With her own money, she put this calendar together.   She drops these calendars off at laundromats, schools, cafes, union  halls, churches, and always keeps a few on hand to give to women who  might need a new way of thinking about a career, who might need hope.  She also gives them to people she just runs into--people like me. I was  out in Fairbanks, AK, a couple weeks ago in the O'Reilly Auto Parts  parking lot, and bumped into Cheryl and her daughter Halle, and I got  one of these.   This calendar, Alaska Women in the Trades, is a great calendar with a  couple of inspirational quotes:         Nothing is impossible. The word itself says, ``I'm       possible.''    Get it? Pretty clever.   How about another one:         Do something today that your future self will thank you       for.    Think about that, pages. It is good advice, even for Senators.   This is the kind of work she does, on her own dime, giving this kind  of inspiration to her fellow Alaskans.   My team and I have gotten many emails from Cheryl's five children  over the past few days, all of them talking about what a great mother  she is, how giving, caring, hard-working she is, how she is a hero to  all of them, and how she is an inspiring example. Let me quote from one  of the emails.   Her daughter Emmaline Hill, who, by the way, signed up for the U.S.  Marine Corps when she was 18, then went on to graduate from Notre Dame,  got her commission in the Marine Corps, and now is stationed in Japan  as a major in the U.S. Marines--here is what she said about her mom:         My mom believes in people, especially those who have a hard       time believing in themselves or don't think they are worthy       of it. She is a rugged champion for the underdog and a       tireless advocate for employing Alaskans and building our       communities through volunteerism and action.    That is a beautiful testament to her mom from her daughter who is a  major in the Marine Corps in Japan.   We are going to be going into our August work session. I am going to  be back home in Alaska the whole time. We are going to be coming up on  Labor Day, a very important holiday. I think it is important, when we  are thinking about Labor Day, to think about people like Cheryl, her  fellow laborers, and particularly the women who are doing this kind of  hard work. You don't always think about that in terms of the  construction and building trades, but they do great work.   So, Cheryl, thank you for all you have done. Thank you for your hard  work, your inspiration, your dedication and faith, your indomitable  spirit, and your example to your kids, to your fellow Alaskans, and now  to Americans, as we congratulate you for being our Alaskan of the Week.   I yield the floor.
