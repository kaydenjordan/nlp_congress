 Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from Connecticut for  yielding. I rise today to join my colleagues in strong support of H.R.  1309, the Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social  Service Workers Act.   Workplace violence impacts over 15 million healthcare workers in this  country. These workers offer critical assistance to some of the most  vulnerable members of our society. They work in our hospitals, our  nursing homes, our hospices, and they do this, despite the fact that  they are nearly five times as likely to suffer serious workplace  violence injury than workers in other sectors.   And those statistics account just for physical injuries. So when the  body recovers from workplace assaults, these professionals are often  plagued with career-ending post-traumatic stress disorders for the rest  of their lives.   So I am glad that the House is considering the gentleman from  Connecticut's bill today to finally compel OSHA  [[Page H9130]]  to create a standard to protect these workers in their places of work.   Madam Chair, it can take up to 20 years for OSHA to issue standards,  as in the case of its silica and beryllium standards. Our Nation's  healthcare and social service workers cannot afford to wait that long  while they serve under the constant threat of violence.   H.R. 1309 takes a different approach. It would require OSHA to issue  an interim standard requiring employers to develop and implement a  workplace violence prevention plan within 1 year and a final standard  within 42 months. Contrary to the claims of my friends on the other  side of the aisle, this is not a radical requirement.   OSHA has already held extensive public comment on this topic since  1996, and H.R. 1309 would allow OSHA to conduct a full public comment  and hearing process before a final standard is issued. Our healthcare  and social service workers cannot wait, and neither can we.   Madam Chair, I include in the Record a support letter from  organizations representing our Nation's healthcare and social service  workers, as well as a support letter from AFL-CIO.                                                  November 20, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the undersigned       organizations representing nurses, social workers,       psychiatric, home health and personal care aides, as well as       other workers in the healthcare and social service       industries, we urge you to vote yes on H.R. 1309, the       Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social       Service Workers Act. When healthcare and social service       professionals show up to work, they shouldn't have to worry       about whether they are going to be injured in an assault. The       many professionals who face risk of assault every day include       not only those working in hospitals, clinics and mental       health facilities, but also those providing services in       patients' homes, and outside the four walls of an office.        Healthcare and social service workers are nearly five times       more likely to be assaulted than other workers, and the       violence is growing. Between 2007 and 2017, the rate of       violent injuries grew by 123 percent in hospitals, 201       percent in psychiatric hospitals and substance use treatment       facilities, and 28 percent in social service settings. The       costs of this violence are high: in injury rates, in       professionals being driven from doing the work they love, and       in workers' compensation claims and staff shortages.        Currently, there is no federally enforceable violence       prevention standard specifically covering healthcare and       social services, and federal guidelines do not cover those       working in public facilities. H.R. 1309 would require       hospitals, residential treatment facilities, clinics at       correctional or detention facilities, substance use disorder       treatment centers, and other service facilities to develop       and implement comprehensive violence prevention plans and       provide whistleblower protections for workers. We hear from       members about violence all the time: a nurse choked to the       point of unconsciousness; a case manager who has suffered       bone fractures and debilitating brain injuries from being       thrown against walls and floors; social workers brutally       attacked, and even killed, when conducting visits to client       homes.        No one should face violence, intimidation, or fear for       their safety while working to help others and save lives.       Violence is not just ``part of the job,'' and studies show       that prevention plans work. Many violent incidents can be       predicted and minimized with the right staffing, policies and       protocols; and this legislation builds upon well-established       guidelines from the Department of Labor.        This bill is essential to making healthcare and social       service settings safer for workers, but also safer healing       environments for patients. When a patient harms a social       worker or other clinician, it is traumatizing not only for       the clinician but also for the patient; and it sets treatment       back for months, if not years. Patients witnessing violence       also are traumatized.        We urge you to support the nurses, social workers and other       healthcare and social service professionals in your district       by voting for H.R. 1309, the Workplace Violence Prevention       for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act.

House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: I am writing on behalf of the AFL-CIO       to urge you to co-sponsor the Workplace Violence Prevention       for Health Care and Social Services Workers Act (H.R. 1309).       This bill, sponsored by Rep. Joe Courtney (D-Conn.) would       direct the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to       issue a federal workplace violence prevention standard to       protect workers in health care and social services from       injury and death.        Workplace violence is a serious and growing safety and       health problem that has reached epidemic levels. Workplace       violence is now the third leading cause of job deaths, and       results in more than 28,000 serious lost-time injuries each       year. Nurses, medical assistants, emergency responders and       social workers face some of the greatest threats, suffering       more than 70% of all workplace assaults. Women workers       particularly are at risk, suffering two out of every three       serious workplace violence injuries.        H.R. 1309 would help protect these workers by requiring       employers in the health care and social service sectors to       develop and implement a workplace violence prevention plan,       tailored to specific workplace and employee populations. As       part of the plan, employers would be required to identify and       correct hazards, develop systems for reporting threats of       violence and injuries, provide training for workers and       management and protect workers from retaliation for reporting       workplace violence incidents. The bill ensures that frontline       workers have input, helping employers identify common sense       measures like alarm devices, lighting, security, and       surveillance and monitoring systems to reduce the risk of       violent assaults and injuries.        The bill's requirements for the workplace violence       prevention plan are based upon existing guidelines and       recommendations from OSHA, NIOSH and professional       associations. Scientific studies have documented that the       implementation of such prevention plans significantly reduces       the incidence of workplace violence. Similar measures have       been adopted in a number of states and implemented by some       employers. However, currently there is no federal OSHA       workplace standard, and OSHA has been slow to take action.       The majority of healthcare and social service workers lack       effective protection and remain at serious risk.        We urge you to support and co-sponsor H.R. 1309 to help       protect health care and social service workers from the       growing threat of workplace violence and unnecessary injury       and death.            Sincerely,                                                    William Samuel,                                      Director, Government Affairs.     I ask the House to pass without delay the gentleman from  Connecticut's legislation.
