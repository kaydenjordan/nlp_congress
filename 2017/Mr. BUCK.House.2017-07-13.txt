 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 85, after line 24, insert the following:       SEC. 316. ALTERNATIVE ENERGY USE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF                     DEFENSE.         (a) Cost Competitiveness Requirement.--        (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of       law, the Secretary of Defense shall not purchase alternative       energy unless such energy is equivalent to conventional       energy in terms of cost and capabilities.        (2) Cost calculation.--The cost of each energy source       described in paragraph (1) shall be calculated on a pre-tax       basis in terms of life-cycle cost. Such calculation shall       take into account--        (A) all associated Federal grants, subsidies and tax       incentives applied from the point of production to       consumption;        (B) fixed and variable operations and maintenance costs;       and        (C) in the case of fuel, fully burdened costs, including       all associated transportation and security from the point of       purchase to delivery to the end user.        (3) Research exemption.--Nothing in this Act is intended to       prohibit alternative energy research by the Department.        (b) Prohibition on Renewable Energy Mandates.--None of the       funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act or otherwise       made available for fiscal year 2018 for the Department of       Defense shall be used to carry out any provision of law that       requires the Department of Defense to consume renewable       energy, unless such energy meets the requirements of       subsection (a).    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 440, the gentleman  from Colorado (Mr. Buck) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.    I thank Chairman Thornberry for the opportunity to speak  about my amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2018.   Our military is the greatest fighting force in the world. I applaud  the Department of Defense's efforts to reduce its carbon footprint.  However, with our limited resources, we must ensure that these  resources are being put to use in the best possible way.   Every penny spent by the Department of Defense must be used to  advance our military's mission and support our troops. Incorporating  higher cost fuel sources into the Department's energy acquisition  process is money lost to repair planes, buy ammunition, and defeat the  enemy.   Moreover, Congress must ensure that we are being good stewards of the  American people's money. With our debt soaring towards $20 trillion, it  is irresponsible to ask American families to subsidize with their tax  dollars fuel sources that have not yet been proven cost-effective.   Of course, the Department of Defense would still be allowed to  research alternative sources of energy. My amendment ensures that the  Department of  [[Page H5793]]  Defense can conduct research on alternative fuels to ensure these  energy sources can be cost-competitive in the future.   My commonsense amendment is simple. It provides a framework for  ensuring the Department of Defense is engaging in responsible energy  acquisition practices. It prohibits renewable energy mandates placed on  the Department of Defense and ensures that every unit of energy our  military purchases is the most cost-effective option available while  still maintaining the ability to research new sources of energy.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I don't believe that asking the Department of  Defense to make a cost-effective decision in any purchase is an  unnecessary burden.   Mr. Chair, I disagree with my colleagues, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the United States military is the greatest  fighting force in the world. Our troops need to be focused on the  mission at hand and have every tool at their disposal to complete that  mission.   My amendment ensures that we practice fiscal discipline in the  Department of Defense's energy acquisition process by ensuring that we  are buying the most cost-effective source of energy.   I thank the chairman. I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.
