 Mr. Speaker, on behalf of many Americans,  enough--enough of cruelty disguised as border security, enough of  inflicting pain on children to make their parents stay away, enough of  picking on the weak to show that you are strong.   The people in this Chamber, who are the sons and daughters of  immigrants from all over the world, should know the history of this  Nation, and the fact that when the Irish came here, they were greeted  with signs in New York and Boston that said: ``No Irish need apply.''  Those of German descent were said to be too dirty to be Americans.  Italians were interned during World War II.   Are we a Nation that learns from our mistakes, or are we not? Are we  a country that adheres to our Constitution and strives to achieve the  words inside it, or are we just pretending?   This is a special Nation, a Nation that has been blessed by people  who have come here from all over the world, yet the policies of this  administration denigrate the history of this country and denigrate its  future.   These families must stop being separated. Just because you come up to  a border or cross a border does not make you nonhuman. They should be  treated as human beings, most especially by a country that is supposed  to be a moral beacon for the world over.
