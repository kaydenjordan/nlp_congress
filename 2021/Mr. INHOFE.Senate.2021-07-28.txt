 Mr. President, it is my understanding that prior to my  remarks on the floor, we were going to recognize the Senator from  Minnesota for 10 minutes or so. So if that is still desired by the  Senator from Minnesota, I would be glad to yield.   And since the Senator from Minnesota is not present, I will go ahead  and make my remarks.   I do ask unanimous consent that I be recognized as if in morning  business for such time as I shall consume.    Mr. President, first of all, I am here today to share  some news about a key subject we have been talking about for quite some  time, and that is Ligado. It is a complicated thing. It is something  where one company was able to get rushed over a weekend in April of  2020 and get recognized and get an agreement from the FCC to have an  operation that deals with the individuals that are wanting to be  involved in this group.  [[Page S5121]]    The 15 government Departments and Agencies signed a petition for  reconsideration of a flawed decision. Keep in mind that this is a  decision by the FCC with the NTIA, the National Telecommunications and  Infrastructure Administration, because they manage Federal spectrum.   Now, when the new administration was sworn in this January, the  petitions were still pending. The NTIA, which I just now used the  initials of, is very well-known. This is the one that has the  responsibility to take care of the Department of Commerce, some of  their instructions, some of their activities. So I spoke with Secretary  Gina Raimondo, who is the Secretary of Commerce for the new  administration, about the importance of continuing the petition for  reconsideration. I also followed up with a letter.   What is a petition of reconsideration? What we are talking about here  is that a decision was made by the FCC, and they have been petitioned  by almost every bureaucracy and many, many individuals--over 100--to  have a reconsideration. And this has not happened yet.   And so we changed administrations, and, of course, the new  administration came in and Secretary Gina Raimondo did a great job with  the importance of continuing the petition for reconsideration.   I wanted to make sure that even with the change in administration,  the government Departments and Agencies still wanted to see the harmful  order repealed. And here is the breaking news. I just got a letter from  Secretary Raimondo, confirming now that ``there has been no change to  the Department of Commerce's or [the] NTIA's opposition to the FCC's  Ligado Order.''   And that says it all. It says this administration is in full  agreement with the previous administration, and they will be acting  accordingly.   She also pledges that the NTIA will continue to pursue the petition  for reconsideration--the petition that represents the Departments of  Commerce, Defense, Interior, Justice, Homeland Security, Energy,  Transportation, NASA, FAA, and more--virtually, the entire government.   Now, this is huge. This shows, once again, that there is bipartisan  concern about the Ligado order and that it is continuing into the Biden  administration.   It is not an exaggeration when I say that the Ligado order would be  devastating to public safety, our national defense, and even our way of  life. And everybody knows that.   The reliability of GPS and satellite communications is necessary for  the safety of life operations, national security, and economic  activity.   Here are some of the day-to-day things people might not think of as  being a part of the users of GPS and how it affects our daily lives. A  big one is using your credit card or debit card when you are making a  purchase or anything in terms of making transactions.   Another one is making a phone call--even making a phone call. Cell  phone networks rely on GPS to synchronize the cell towers so calls can  be passed seamlessly. Otherwise, they could get bogged up, and if they  experience interference, your call could be dropped when moving from  tower to tower.   Here is one that most people don't expect, and that is energy. Why  would energy be dependent upon an accurate and reliable GPS system?  Well, whether that is filling up your tank at the pump or managing  electrical grids to light our homes, we rely on GPS timing to safely  operate underground pipelines and our electricity grid.   Farmers and ranchers depend on GPS and satellite communications when  planting crops, applying fertilizer, and during our harvest operations,  to move large critical machinery from place to place.   I was back in my State of Oklahoma last week and met with a bunch of  farmers, and I learned myself how farmers are using GPS now. This is a  thing that wasn't true just a few years ago, but it is true now.   Working out. A lot of healthy people are out there doing what they  ought to be doing with their bodies, and that is working out. A study  last year found that one-fifth--that is 20 percent--of all Americans  use a fitness tracker or smart watch, the majority of which use the GPS  to count steps and track distances.   Taking a flight. Commercial and civilian aviation relies on GPS  navigation and satellite communications to operate safely.   Driving around. Each day, countless Americans rely on Google Maps,  Waze, Apple Maps, and other forms of navigation systems to get them  from point A to point B. And they rely on GPS to do that.   And while no one hopes that they ever need a firetruck, an ambulance,  or other emergency services, 9-1-1 operators and EMS use GPS and  satellite communications to locate a caller and navigate as quickly as  possible.   We had a hearing just a few weeks ago, and we had the Helicopter  Operators Association talk about their emergency runs and what would  happen to them if they lost the reliability of GPS.   And there is more: weather forecasting, the movement of goods on our  highways, surveying maritime harbors and channels, operation with  construction and mining equipment. The list goes on and on.   I had a personal experience about 20 years ago with one of the uses;  that is, I had occasion with three individuals and participants to fly  an airplane around the world.   I am from Oklahoma. Of course, we are all familiar with Will Rogers.  Some people are not quite as familiar with Wiley Post. Wiley Post flew  around with Will Rogers. They flew around the world. So what I was  doing was replicating that flight in my plane around the world. I was  using a Trimble--that is the manufacturer--a Trimble TNL 2000. That was  the first time, I think--I haven't checked since then--that it has been  used for private use for flying around the world. Nonetheless, that is  a GPS system.   Because the FCC order allows Ligado to repurpose spectrum to operate  a terrestrial-based network, Ligado signals on Earth's surface will be  much more powerful than GPS, causing substantial and harmful  interference.   How do we know Ligado will cause interference?   The FCC told us when they approved the Ligado order. They said--you  should listen to the FCC statement:         Ligado shall expeditiously repair or replace as needed any       U.S. Government GPS devices that experience or are likely to       experience harmful interference from Ligado's operations.    That is a quote. Remember that quote. I will tell you about a bill we  will introduce to correct this problem that is serious to so many  people.   Last year, we also held a hearing on the Armed Services Committee to  hear how the Ligado order would impact the military and warfighter. All  of the witnesses--Dana Deasy, Michael Griffin, General Raymond--they  are all united.   Dana Deasy, the former Chief Information Officer at the DOD, said it  best when asked if he thought the Ligado order would have an impact on  DOD or the Federal spectrum. He said:         Yes, the fact that we're sitting here today, and you have       General Raymond here representing our military, would clearly       suggest that . . .    We wouldn't be sitting here today if it didn't have a heavy impact on  our military operations.   There has been multiple testimony about that. The NTIA petition filed  in April of 2020--and, again, signed by the Departments of Commerce,  Defense, Interior, Justice, Homeland Security, Energy and  Transportation, as well as agencies like NASA and the FAA--is also  clear and united. There is no division of opinion on this.   That alone should be enough to overturn the order. If not, we need to  make sure Federal agencies, State governments, and all others  negatively impacted by the actions of Ligado are not left holding the  bag when it comes to costs and, worse, aren't put in the position where  they have to push the costs onto the American consumers.   Everyone is on our side with this. The whole of government and over  100 private-sector groups all agree, and they all agree no one else is  on the side of Ligado except paid lobbyists.   Ligado said this order is about winning the race to 5G and beating  China. Those who claim Ligado's proposal is necessary to beat China's  5G push are deliberately mixing up two different and important spectrum  issues in order to sell their product: the sharing of mid-band 5G  spectrum by DOD with industry and harmful interference of Ligado's  signal with the low-band GPS  [[Page S5122]]  signals used in nearly every aspect of daily life.   Ligado's spectrum they are repurposing is not in prime mid-band  spectrum being considered for 5G, and Ligado's low-band spectrum was  not a part of the FCC's own plan to accelerate 5G development released  in September 2018, called the 5G FAST Plan.   Reliable GPS and satellite communications are important to everyone  in America and drives much of our Nation's economy. We should not  sacrifice GPS reliability. In the event the petitions for  reconsideration are not successful--I can't imagine they would not be  because almost every bureaucracy in most of the private sector are  behind these. This is happening all over the country. But in the event  that the petitions for reconsideration are not successful, I have  introduced legislation, and I won't give you the name of that because  it is one of these things where there are too many words involved. We  refer to it as the RETAIN Act to protect the users of GPS when, by  approving the Ligado order, the FCC did not.   Just last week, companion legislation was passed by the House of  Representatives, by   Jim Cooper,  Mike Turner, Frank Lucas, GT  Thompson,   Ken Calvert, Nydia Velazquez, Abigail Spanberger, and  Don  Beyer. They introduced companion legislation to that legislation that  we are currently introducing.   As of last week, we had more than 100 organizations who have signed a  letter supporting the RETAIN GPS Act to hold Ligado accountable for the  interference that they cause.   Clearly, the momentum is with us and the letter from Secretary  Raimondo I announced earlier is a great example of that. Clearly,  today's announcement is a big step for the good guys   Let me make sure people understand what we are talking about. We are  talking about those who are responsible--that is Ligado--for the use of  that spectrum, if and when, as most people are predicting, it does  something that damages the GPS system. We are talking about the system  that every user in America uses--that if they do that, then they have  to pay for it. That is all. They have to pay for it rather than have  the public pay for it.   Now, that is really the end of what I am trying to get across to  people how serious this is.   I want to put down in the Record all the agencies that are strongly  supporting this. We have the Department of the Army, Department of  Defense, Department of the Air Force, Department of the Navy,  Department of Commerce, NASA, Department of Interior, Department of  Justice, Department of Homeland Security, Department of Energy,  National Science Foundation, Department of Transportation, U.S. Coast  Guard, and the Federal Aviation Administration.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, at the conclusion of my  remarks, these organizations be printed in the Record.    I would add to that group the NTIA, which represents a  lot of government in addition to what I just read. I would like to add  the names--I have a list here of well over 100--talking about Aerospace  Association, Agricultural interests, the American Farm Bureau, all of  these--virtually every recognizable organization in America is among  the 105 organizations that are supporting this.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter also be  printed in the Record   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         The undersigned IRAC agencies endorse and support the       position stated by the Department of the Air Force and the       Department of Defense:        Ms. Sarah Bauer, Department of the Army; Mr. Rene (RJ)       Balanga, NASA; Mr. John Cornicelli, Department of Homeland       Security; Mr. James Arnold, Department of Transportation; Mr.       Kenneth Willis, Department of the Navy; Mr. Ramon L. Gladden,       Department of the Interior; Mr. George Dudley, Department of       Energy; Mr. Jerry Ulcek, U.S. Coast Guard; Mr. Ivan Navarro,       Department of Commerce; Mr. Quan Vu, Department of Justice;       Mr. Jonathan Williams, National Science Foundation; Mr.       Michael Richmond, Federal Aviation Administration; and NTIA.                                   ____                                                      June 29, 2021.      Hon. James M. Inhofe,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Jack Reed,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Tammy Duckworth,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mike Rounds,      U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senators: The undersigned companies and organizations       strongly endorse the Recognizing and Ensuring Taxpayer Access       to Infrastructure Necessary for GPS and Satellite       Communications Act or the ``RETAIN GPS and Satellite       Communications Act'' introduced today. This legislation would       ensure that the costs incurred by the public sector,       businesses and consumers as a result of the FCC's decision to       permit Ligado Networks LLC to use spectrum in a way that       would cause interference to GPS and satellite communications       would be covered by Ligado--the licensee benefiting from the       decision.        The FCC's Ligado Order already recognizes the potential for       interference to GPS receivers and requires that, ``Ligado       shall expeditiously repair or replace as needed any U.S.       Government GPS devices that experience or are likely to       experience harmful interference from Ligado's operations.''       But the Order failed to go far enough in three key ways.       First, it did not provide an adequate description of the       potential costs to federal agencies and thus the American       taxpayer. Federal agencies are responsible for ensuring       reliable GPS and satellite communications necessary for all       manner of safety of life operations. Second, while       recognizing the potential costs associated with interference       to Federal agency owned devices, the FCC order inexplicably       fails to require that Ligado also bear the costs of       interference to other government and private owners of       devices and applications that may be disrupted by Ligado's       proposed operations. Third, the Order improperly applies       interference limits that are fundamentally insufficient to       protect critical satellite communications and navigation       signals from unknown millions of Ligado devices operating       over wide geographic areas.        Ninety-nine percent of GPS receivers are used in critical       applications by non-Federal government users, businesses and       consumers. In addition, the Order similarly threatens the       satellite communications networks that can enable       technologies used to complement and support GPS. The       reliability of GPS and satellite communications is necessary       for safety of life operations, national security and economic       activity; critical communications capabilities; commercial       and civil aviation; first responders, 9-1-1 and other public       safety operators; military readiness and communications;       weather forecasting; the movement of goods on our highways;       the marking maritime harbors and channels; farmers planting       and harvesting crops; operation of construction and mining       equipment--and the list goes on and on.        The Retain GPS and Satellite Communications Act       acknowledges the harm to GPS and satellite communications end       users caused by the Ligado order and ensures the burden of       cost sits squarely where it belongs--on Ligado, rather than       our first responders, farmers, pilots, boat owners, surveyors       or construction companies. We commend you for recognizing the       expense and burden the Ligado order places on federal       agencies, American taxpayers, businesses and consumers, and       for providing clear and immediate relief to critical       stakeholders with this legislation. Thank you for your       leadership on this important issue.
