 Madam President, SGM Max English served the Nation  honorably for over 28 years in the U.S. Army. He fought in combat  operations throughout World War II and bravely led 36 men as a platoon  sergeant in the Battle of the Bulge. His extraordinary service  continued to the Pacific theater in the waning months of the war. Only  a few years later, he returned to the Pacific to fight in the Korean  war.   During his service in the Second World War, Sergeant Major English  was injured in Germany and was awarded the Purple Heart. During the  Battle of Bulge, Sergeant Major English fought and repelled repeated  Nazi attacks and ultimately helped break the back of Hitler's forces.  After sustained combat operations in Europe, Sergeant Major English  served in the Southern Pacific theater and pursued the treacherous  mission of rooting out irreconciled Japanese Imperial Army forces after  their country's unconditional surrender.   A member of ``the greatest generation'', Sergeant Major English again  answered the call of duty when he was deployed to the Korean war.  There, his unit was tasked with repatriating Americans formerly held as  prisoners of war during the conflict. The heroic actions of Sergeant  Major English's unit directly contributed to the implementation of an  armistice to stop the fighting on the Korean Peninsula.   Sergeant Major English is a man of exceptional character and  commitment to the United States who embodies the American spirit and  serves as an inspiration for today's fighting men and women. I join all  grateful Americans in congratulating him for his outstanding service  and patriotism and thank him for a job well done.
