 Mr. Speaker, I would like to raise awareness of  alopecia areata, an autoimmune disease that causes hair loss on the  scalp and other areas of the body.   Today, close to 7 million Americans live with alopecia areata,  including over 1 million children under the age of 12.   Alopecia areata is a greatly unpredictable disease and currently has  no known cause and no known cure.   Sadly, this disease often presents itself at an early age, with small  round, smooth patches appearing on the head.   With limited treatment options, many individuals use wigs, which come  at a significant out-of-pocket cost.   It was one of my constituents, Deirdre Nero, an alopecia patient, who  [[Page H4781]]  first brought to my attention the challenges facing the alopecia areata  community. That is why I have been proud to stand with my colleague,  Congressman Jim McGovern, and support H.R. 2925, legislation to provide  coverage for wigs as durable medical equipment under the Medicare  program.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to stand with alopecia  areata patients across the Nation and cosponsor this commonsense and  bipartisan measure.                                time  1015                     Honoring South Floridian Larry Adams     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a remarkable  south Floridian, Mr. Larry Adams.   Born in West Palm Beach in 1927 to a family of limited means, Larry  understood from a young age the importance of getting an education.  Larry also possessed a strong desire to serve his country during World  War II. He enrolled at Purdue University as a U.S. Air Corps Cadet and  served in the U.S. Air Force in Germany from 1945 to 1946.   Upon returning home, Larry attended my alma mater, the University of  Miami--Go Canes--where he excelled at both sports and academics,  including pitching for our university's baseball team.   In 1949, Larry began a 42-year career at Florida Power & Light  Company--42 years. Starting from the bottom, he worked his way from  being a lineman digging ditches and climbing power poles to being a  vice president of the State's largest electric utility.   While excelling at his difficult job duties, Larry reenrolled in  school while working for the company and earned a degree from Harvard  Graduate Business School's Advanced Management Program for executives.   Never one to limit himself, Larry also devoted extraordinary time and  effort to his community, serving in over 36 local, regional, State, and  national community service organizations, which earned him many  accolades.   Larry also played a founding and integral role in the development of  management systems to improve the quality and cost of goods and  services produced throughout our great Nation.   In 1987, President Ronald Reagan requested that certain U.S.  corporations provide a team of quality management experts whose mission  was to create an American Quality Management Award for Excellence  program. Florida Power & Light assigned Larry to work under the  direction of the U.S. Commerce Secretary and the National Institute of  Standards and Technology, where Larry co-chaired one of four teams of  professional quality improvement management experts provided by  American businesses.   Together, they developed and secured Presidential and congressional  approval to create the Malcolm Baldrige Foundation Award to empower  U.S. organizations to reach their goals and become significantly more  competitive in national and international trade and commerce. Today,  the now popular Sterling Management program is a derivative of the  Baldrige program and is managed by the Governors of each of our 50  States.   At the age of 89, Larry became the recipient of the 2016 Florida  Governor's Sterling Ambassador of the Year Award for successfully  coaching businesses, charitable, and government agencies to learn and  deploy Sterling and Malcolm Baldrige management systems during the past  25 years.   Larry has had an extraordinary life, which he has enjoyed with his  wife of over 65 years, Betsy Gregg Adams. Together, they have three  sons: Larry, Jr., an architect; Ron, a trial attorney; and Thad, a  commercial realtor.   Congratulations to my friend, Larry Adams, for a remarkable life well  lived.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, it has been 48 days since Ortega began  his brutal crackdown on the Nicaraguan people. With over 110  Nicaraguans killed, including one U.S. citizen, the U.S. must take  swift action to hold accountable those responsible for the bloodshed.  Though I appreciate the administration's remarks condemning the violent  attacks, actions must follow.   I sent a bipartisan, bicameral letter urging the administration to  sanction two key regime operatives: Francisco Lopez, head of Albanisa,  for money laundering and corruption; and Francisco Diaz, who leads the  national police, for orchestrating the repression and killing of  Nicaraguans.   I also urge our Senate colleagues to pass my NICA Act, to condition  our vote at international financial institutions until Nicaragua takes  significant steps to restore democratic order.   The U.S. has an opportunity to lead the way, Mr. Speaker. Let's do  that.                            ____________________
