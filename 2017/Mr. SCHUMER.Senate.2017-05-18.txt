 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, last night, Deputy Attorney General Rod  Rosenstein appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as a special  counsel to oversee the investigation into Russia's interference in the  2016 elections.   This was a very good first step. Mr. Rosenstein has done the right  thing. I applaud his decision for both its correctness and its  courage. A special counsel was much called for in this situation.  Former Director Mueller is the right kind of individual for the job. I  now have significantly greater confidence that the investigation will  follow the facts wherever they lead. Additionally, as special counsel,  Mr. Mueller must have broad latitude to pursue the Russia  investigation. In the appointment order, it stipulates that the special  counsel is authorized to investigate ``any matters that arose or may  arise directly from this investigation.'' That is a really important  power, given recent reports about an active FBI investigation into  General Flynn.    I am heartened by the news of Mr. Mueller's appointment, but it in no  way diminishes the need for Congress to play an active role in helping  to get to the bottom of recent events. Intelligence Committee Chairman  Burr and Ranking Member Warner should still pursue the congressional  investigation into these matters with just as much vigor. That  investigation has been proceeding in a bipartisan way, and it  absolutely should continue as such.   We should still seek testimony from Mr. Comey in both the Judiciary  and Intelligence Committees to discuss the events surrounding his  dismissal and be given access to memos and transcripts or tapes of his  conversations with President Trump. Mr. Comey was central to the events  of the past few weeks. We still need to hear from him. I thank the  bipartisan leadership of both the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees  for requesting both the records and public testimony of Director Comey.   Congress, specifically the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees,  should still be given access to any transcripts or related summaries of  the President's meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister and  Ambassador, during which reports have alleged he may have divulged  highly sensitive intelligence.   Finally, there is still a great need as before for the next FBI  Director to be someone who is nonpartisan, independent, fearless, and  of unimpeachable integrity. A career politician of either party or  anyone who suggests a lack of impartiality, should not be considered.  The appointment of Mr. Mueller is a great first step toward getting the  Russia investigation back on solid ground, but these other things also  need to happen: Mr. Comey testifying; the White House turning over to  Congress the relevant tapes and transcripts, if they exist; and the  selection of an independent, impartial FBI Director.   Later this afternoon, the Deputy Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein,  will brief all 100 Senators at the request of the two leaders, the  majority leader and myself. He can brief us on a great many things,  including the events of Mr. Comey's dismissal and the status of the  Russia investigation.   While the briefing itself will not take place in a public setting, I  hope that much of what we learn today can be shared with the American  public.   So in the interest of getting all the facts, we in Congress look  forward to hearing from Mr. Rosenstein this afternoon. It is a sign  that while we wholeheartedly applaud the appointment of a special  counsel, we in Congress must continue to do our jobs as well.                            ____________________     Now, on another matter, Mr. President, criminal justice  reform. Last week, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered Federal  prosecutors to ``charge and pursue the most serious readily provable  offense,'' even for low-level drug crimes. Functionally, this means  Federal prosecutors  [[Page S3025]]  will seek the harshest possible penalty even for nonviolent, low-level  drug crimes.   This is a significant reversal from the Obama-era Smart on Crime  Initiative, in which Federal prosecutors were instructed to focus on  more dangerous drug traffickers and avoid charging less-serious  offenders with crimes that required long, mandatory minimum sentences.  As a result of the Obama policies, Federal drug cases dropped by more  than 19 percent between 2012 and 2016, according to the U.S. Sentencing  Commission. Cases with charges carrying longer, mandatory minimum  sentences fell precipitously, from nearly 60 percent in 2012 to 45  percent last year. Thanks in part to this initiative, President Obama  became the first President since Carter to leave the White House with a  smaller Federal prison population than when he took office.   Meanwhile, prosecutions of the more serious crimes--the evil drug  dealers, those who run the drugs, often from out of this country to  here, they are the ones we can really go after and need to go after-- increased by 17 percent and 14 percent, which makes it the way we can  stop these evil drugs from coming into this country.   So that policy was tough on crime and smart on crime. Our law  enforcement agencies have finite resources. They should be focused on  combating violent crimes. When a prosecutor is spending hours in court,  days, for a low-level possession charge and not having the resources to  go after the drug runners, the drug dealers who poison our kids, that  is misplaced priorities.   What Attorney General Sessions has just ordered is the exact opposite  approach of what we need. Instead of giving judges and juries the  discretion to use their judgment in sentencing, it compels prosecutors  to seek as much jail time as they can get for every single offense,  treating low level and high level the same. It is a blunt instrument  that will result in more unnecessary, punitive sentences, overcrowding  of our prisons, and will be less effective in our fight on crime. It  runs completely counter to a bipartisan consensus here in Congress.   Many Members of this body, Democrats and Republicans, agree that  mandatory minimum sentences have led to bloated, costly prisons, and  disproportionately ravaged minority communities.   In the last Congress, a bipartisan group of Senators sought to make  meaningful progress with a sentencing reform proposal that had, among  its cosponsors, a diverse group of Senators, ranging from Senators  Durbin and Booker on the Democratic side to Senators Lee and Paul on  the conservative side. Unfortunately, those efforts to strike a  compromise to bring much needed reform to our Nation's criminal justice  system were derailed by the obstruction of, guess who--then-Senator  Sessions, with the cooperation of the Republican leadership. Now, after  making progress under President Obama and Attorney General Holder,  Attorney General Sessions has chosen to simply revert back to the one- size-fits-all approach that criminologists, police leaders, and  bipartisan lawmakers have determined is not the right answer.   In order to truly be tough on crime, we must be smart on crime. This  approach is dumb on crime. Congress, of course, still has the power to  legislate this issue. We have the power to override the Attorney  General's decision. So I hope this misguided change in the Department  of Justice's policy revives a bipartisan desire to pursue sentencing  reform. When we look for areas where there can be significant  bipartisan cooperation, this is one of them. I hope Leader McConnell  will choose to pursue it.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
