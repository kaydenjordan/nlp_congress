 Mr. Speaker, it is my great privilege to honor  Enterprise High School men's basketball team on winning their first- ever Class 7A championship.   As a Wildcat alum, I could not be prouder of these men for their  dedication and performance. The players who sweated through countless  practices, the coaches who led them, and the faithful Wildcat fans who  traveled to support the team should all be proud of this remarkable  achievement.   Coach Rhett Harrelson, a friend and fellow Enterprise native, and his  staff deserve great credit for leading our young men to this  championship. Our fans have our sincere appreciation for ensuring that  the home games were rowdy and our team always had familiar faces  screaming at the away games.   As a fellow Wildcat, I want to honor this amazing team for all they  have accomplished, and I look forward to watching this program continue  to grow.                            ____________________
