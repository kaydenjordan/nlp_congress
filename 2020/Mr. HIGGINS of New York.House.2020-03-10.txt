 Mr. Speaker, the coronavirus is a public  health crisis in need of a strong, clear, and consistent response from  Washington. The only way to stop the economic damage is to stop the  spread of the virus and to keep people from getting sick and dying.   Paid sick leave should be extended to 32 million Americans who  currently do not have it. A onetime Federal tax credit could offset the  cost of universal paid leave to help stop the spread of the virus.  Public health costs for testing and treatment at the local and State  level should be assumed by the Federal Government for spending on the  crisis response.   Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Institute and Erie County Health  Department in my community are doing that today at enormous expense and  dwindling resources.   Every dollar spent on public health provides an economic boost. The  time to stimulate the economy is after the virus has been controlled.  Once that occurs, we need to go big on infrastructure to inject both  growth and confidence in the American economy again.                            ____________________
