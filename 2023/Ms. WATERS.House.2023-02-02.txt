 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose H. Con. Res. 9, and I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, yesterday in the Committee on Financial Services, we  organized and considered the committee's oversight plan. We debated  homelessness and the lack of affordable housing, how to best protect  consumers, and the need to strengthen diversity and inclusion across  the financial services industry.   We also discussed the threat to our Nation's future if our country is  forced to default on our debt 4 months from today. We don't always  agree and, honestly, none of the Democratic amendments were adopted,  but it was a civil debate about the merits of policy.   I believe all of our committee members recognize that the legislation  that comes out of our committee has the potential to support wealth  creation, grow small businesses, support affordable housing, and build  a stable financial system and economy.   It is the contrast with the intentionality and seriousness of the  debate today that makes it so hard to understand why the very first  piece of legislation to come to the floor under a rule is not a  proposal to address the needs of any of our constituents, to provide  support to struggling small businesses, or the community banks and  credit unions that finance them.   It certainly doesn't provide our markets with certainty that our  country won't act recklessly and default on its debts; a situation that  will bring untold harm to all of us in America.   No, Mr. Speaker, this resolution today, in fact, does nothing except  spread lies and fear about a threat that does not even exist. The  rightwing extremists who are running this House have forced my  committee to consider as its very first piece of legislation a bill  that tries to say that our country will collapse in ruin because of-- wait for it--Social Security.   The resolution suggests that because we support seniors with health  insurance, our democracy will crumble. They think that because Congress  and the President have provided disaster relief to communities that  have been burned by historic wildfires or flooded by once-in-a- generation hurricanes that we will fall into ruin.   No, Mr. Speaker, Americans take pride in the ways that we come  together to do everything from building schools to sending a man to the  Moon.  [[Page H636]]    Mr. Speaker, Americans know better than the fear-mongering that we  see here today. They know, for example, that when the pandemic hit and  people were dying all across this country, it was the Federal  Government that stepped in to provide trillions of dollars of support  to small businesses, workers, renters, students, seniors--and would you  believe it--even Republican Members of Congress.   In fact, the government, using taxpayer dollars, provided $14 million  in PPP loans to a number of our House Republicans who asked and then-- guess what--received debt forgiveness.   Now some Republicans have tried to suggest that voting against this  resolution is saying that you support dictators like Pol Pot, Mao  Zedong or Stalin, which is ridiculous. No one in this Chamber supports  them, but do you know which dictator my extremist colleagues refuse to  condemn? Oh, they didn't say anything about Hitler.   Mr. Speaker, you have heard of him, right?   My colleague, Mr. Gottheimer noticed that somehow the Republicans  just forgot to condemn Hitler and offered an amendment to denounce his  atrocities and mass murder. But Republicans rejected it. And I think we  know why.   It is because Donald Trump--your true leader, the true leader of the  Republicans and North Star for House Republicans--was reported to have  frightened his own staff by saying that Hitler had done some good  things.   There is only one would-be authoritarian who refused to accept the  will of our voters and peacefully transfer of power after losing his  election. Instead, he incited a violent insurrection on January 6 to  block the election's certification that was happening in this very  Chamber, but you won't see his name in this resolution or his strongman  pals that he loves so much in Russia and China.   Mr. Speaker, we are a great Nation, not because we let everyone fend  for themselves, but because we care for one another. We are a great  Nation that comes together as communities as small as towns and as  large as a whole Nation to decide to organize and collectively pay for  fire departments, public schools, libraries, hospitals, roads, and  bridges, and a military.    We are a better Nation because we have programs that we love. We love  Social Security and Medicare. We are going to fight every inch of the  way to ensure that we keep Social Security and Medicare. We are not  going to let the opposite side of the aisle take away our seniors'  Social Security and Medicare. I will say it again--Social Security and  Medicare.   We are a better Nation because our form of capitalism includes  regulatory safeguards and strong cops on the beat patrolling our  financial system, like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.   Mr. Speaker, I urge you and the majority to stop these divisive  ``gotcha'' tactics. Get out of the way, and let my committee and this  Congress pass real legislation that puts the needs of our constituents  and Nation first.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  New York (Ms. Velazquez).    Mr. Speaker, Mr. Williams is my friend, but I do wonder  whether Mr. Williams views the $1.43 million he received in debt  forgiveness as being consistent with his views on socialism. I don't  get it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Meeks).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Georgia (Ms. Williams).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Takano).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Frost).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the last gentleman mentioned China, and I just remind  everyone of a quote by their President Trump, ``And I like President Xi  a lot,'' he said. ``I consider him a friend, and--but I like him a lot.  I've gotten to know him very well. He's a strong gentleman, right? . .  . he's a strong guy, tough guy.''   When are you going to denounce Trump?   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman from California just mentioned North  Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. Let me tell you what Trump said. He said,  ``Kim wrote me beautiful letters, and they're great letters. We fell in  love.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms.  Leger Fernandez).    Mr. Speaker, I would reiterate to my colleagues: I love  Social Security. I love Medicare.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Hoyer), the former majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, the ex-President who still thinks he is  President said, ``I went in yesterday and there was a television  screen, and I said, `This is genius.' Putin declares a big portion of  Ukraine--of Ukraine--Putin declares it as independent. Oh, that is  wonderful. . . . He used the word `independent' and we're gonna go out  and we're gonna go in and we're gonna help keep peace.' You gotta say  that is pretty savvy.''   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Nadler), who is the ranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Khanna).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, let me share a quote from the opposite side  of the aisle.   ``Socialism is a scare word they have hurled at every advance the  people have made in the last 20 years.''   They go on to say:   ``Socialism is what they called public power.   Socialism is what they called Social Security.   Socialism is what they called farm price supports.   Socialism is what they called bank deposit insurance.   Socialism is what they called the growth of free and independent  labor organizations.   Socialism is their name for almost anything that helps all the  people.''   This was a quote from the great President Truman, talking about  Republicans' claims 70 years ago. It has revisited itself.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California  (Mr. Sherman), who is also the ranking member of the Subcommittee on  Capital Markets.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I raise a question, and I direct it to the  Speaker. Was PPP socialism? No, of course not, but some Republicans  would claim it was.   Interestingly, many Republicans, including several sponsors of this  ridiculous resolution, not only applied for a PPP loan but also asked  that the government forgive the debt.   So I ask unanimous consent to enter this list of Republicans in the  Record.    I yield 1 minute----    I include in the Record the list of Republicans.         1. Ralph Norman (R-SC): $306,520--member of Rules.        2. Roger Williams (R-TX): $1.43 million--member of FSC.        3. Matt Gaetz (R-FL): $476,000.  [[Page H642]]             4. Marjorie Taylor Green (R-GA): $180,000.        5. Greg Pence (R-IN): $79,441.        6. Vern Buchanan (R-FL): $2.8 million.        7. Kevin Hern (R-OK): $1.07 million.        8. Brett Guthrie (R-KY): $4.3 million.        9. Ralph Abraham (R-LA): $38,000.        10. Mike Kelly (R-PA): $974,100.        11. Vicki Hartzler (R-MO): $451,200.        12. Markwayne Mullin (R-OK): $988,700.        13. Carol Miller (R-WV): $3.1 million.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, Americans are tired of this body wasting its time when  there are real problems to address.   I want to get started considering legislation to house the more than  a half million people who will sleep outside tonight because they don't  have a house of their own.   I want to get started on legislation to address the extreme wealth  disparities in our country, including where CEOs now make almost 400  times what the average workers make.   I want to stop Wells Fargo-like banks from ripping off millions of  consumers.   I want to get started finding ways for seniors and folks saving for  their retirement to have more confidence that those who would defraud  them will be thwarted.   Instead, we spend time talking about how Republicans want to force  Biden to slash Social Security and Medicare, or they will turn the  economy down by forcing a default on our debt.   The American people should rest assured that my Democratic colleagues  and I are united in our resolve to expand access to affordable housing  and good-paying jobs, protect consumers from abuse, strengthen our  economy, safeguard our national security, protect Social Security and  Medicare, and, above all, defend our democracy.   Let me say it again: Protect Social Security and Medicare.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
