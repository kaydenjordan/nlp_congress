 MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong  support of the Honoring our PACT Act, which will ensure comprehensive  benefits and care for our troops who suffer from toxic exposure,  especially from burn pits.   I thank Chairman Takano once again for his leadership, and it is now  time for us to finally send this bill to President Biden's desk.   As a daughter, sister, and wife of a veteran, caring for our veterans  is extremely important to me, as it should be to every American. The  Honoring our PACT Act will help over 3 million suffering veterans and  ensure that they can get the care that they need.   I note especially the similarities between this bill and my 9/11  Health and Compensation Act which supports the 9/11 first responders  who were exposed to dangerous toxins that made them sick, still to this  day.   Our veterans were there for us. We must be there for them. We should  all support this important bill.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York: Committee on Oversight       and Reform. H.R. 4176.
