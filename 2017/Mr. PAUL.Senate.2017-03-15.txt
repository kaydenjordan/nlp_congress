Mr. President, I note the Senator from Kentucky is  leaving the floor without justification or any rationale for the action  he has just taken. It is really remarkable that a Senator is blocking a  treaty that is supported by an overwhelming number--perhaps 98, at  least, of his colleagues. To come to the floor and object and walk  away--walk away--the only conclusion that can be drawn when he walks  away is that he has no argument to be made. He has no justification for  his objection to having a small nation that is under assault from the  Russians be part of NATO.   So I repeat again: The Senator from Kentucky is now working for  Vladimir Putin.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.    I object.   The PRESIDING OFFICER.
