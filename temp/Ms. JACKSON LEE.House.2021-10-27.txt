 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (H.R. 4035) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe  Streets Act of 1968 to prioritize veterans court treatment programs  that ensure equal access for racial and ethnic minorities and women,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4035         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Real Justice for Our       Veterans Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. EQUAL ACCESS TO VETERANS COURT TREATMENT PROGRAMS FOR                     RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITIES AND WOMEN.         Section 2991(i)(2) of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe       Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10651(i)(2)) is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(C) Report.--Not later than 3 years after the date of       enactment of this subparagraph, the Attorney General shall       submit to Congress a report on the effectiveness of veterans       treatment court programs. In preparing such a report, the       Attorney General shall conduct a national multi-site       evaluation of such programs, including an assessment of--        ``(i) the population served by such programs;        ``(ii) whether such programs use evidence-based treatments       for substance use and mental health, including medication for       addiction treatment;        ``(iii) recidivism rates of participants in such programs;        ``(iv) program completion rates; and        ``(v) whether racial and ethnic minorities and women have       equal access to such programs and an equal opportunity to       complete such programs, including by collecting and analyzing       data related to admission in such programs and completion of       such programs, to ensure there are not disparities related to       race, ethnicity, or sex.''.       SEC. 3. VETERANS PILOT PROGRAM ON PROMISING RETENTION MODELS.         (a) Establishment.--The Attorney General, acting through       the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance, shall carry       out a pilot program to make grants to eligible units of local       government to improve retention in veterans treatment court       programs (as such term is defined in section 2991 of the       Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C.       10651)) and drug court programs.        (b) Eligibility.--In order to be eligible for a grant under       subsection (a), a unit of local government shall operate a       veterans treatment court program or a drug court.        (c) Application.--A unit of local government seeking a       grant through the pilot program under subsection (a) shall       submit to the Attorney General an application at such time,       in such manner, and containing such information as the       Attorney General may reasonably require, including--        (1) a description of the therapeutic or treatment modality       that the unit of local government plans to implement and data       to support the use of the therapeutic or treatment modality,       including information showing how the therapeutic or       treatment modality will promote retention in and completion       of veterans treatment court programs and drug court programs;       and        (2) detailed plans on how the applicant would test the       efficacy of the therapeutic or treatment modality.        (d) Reporting Metrics.--Not later than 180 days after       receiving a grant under subsection (a), a unit of local       government shall submit to the Attorney General a report,       which includes demographic information of participants in the       veterans treatment court program, and completion rates of       such participants. The Attorney General shall develop       guidelines for the report required under this subsection.        (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized       to be appropriated $3,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2022       through 2027 to carry out this section.       SEC. 4. ADMISSION OF VETERANS TO DRUG COURTS.         In the case of a jurisdiction that does not operate a       veterans treatment court program (as such term is defined in       section 2991 of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets       Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10651)), but that does operate a drug       court under part EE of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe       Streets Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10611 et seq.), a veteran who       would be eligible to participate in a veterans treatment       court program may participate in the drug court, including a       veteran who is a violent offender (as such term is defined in       section 2953(a) of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets       Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10613(a))).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am the proud sponsor and proud of H.R. 4035. The Real  Justice for Our Veterans Act is before the House for consideration, and  I ask all my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill today.   I authored the Real Justice for Our Veterans Act to help our Nation's  justice-involved veterans to improve the delivery of services in  veterans and drug courts. The bill before the House today has three  discrete aims.   First, the bill would expand data collection regarding the  effectiveness of veterans courts.   Second, it authorizes a pilot program that would investigate and  promote promising retention models in veterans and drug courts.   Lastly, and perhaps most critically, it would open up drug treatment  courts to veterans in areas where there may not be a veterans court, so  very important for those who have interacted with our committee and  have made note of the fact that there are many jurisdictions in the  United States where there are veterans and no veterans court.   Each of these critical changes would promote higher participation and  higher rehabilitation of veterans who have mental health and substance  abuse issues.   The need for this legislation is painfully clear. Generations of  veterans have served abroad in recent decades, and we must redouble our  efforts to support veterans and expand the services they need to  thrive.   The rapid expansion of veterans treatment courts speaks not only to  the need for such courts but, more importantly, to the benefit of the  specialized approach to rehabilitation and treatment the courts offer.   The holistic treatment model, which includes input from the  prosecutor, defense counsel, and the court, centers on the supervised  comprehensive treatment provided by the Department of Veterans Affairs  or community organizations.   Because each veterans court offers different management services, we  need to do more to identify which treatment options are successful so  that these promising models can be expanded. That is why the elements  of the Real Justice for Our Veterans Act are so important.   The bill also calls for additional data on the demographics of who is  referred to veterans treatment courts and asks for information on  completion rates. This information will be critical to advancing our  understanding of how the programs are used.   Additionally, the legislation authorizes a new pilot program that  will allow DOJ to test promising retention programs that promote  greater enrollment and participation by veterans through the duration  of their treatment program.                                time  1245    Legislative efforts to strengthen veterans treatment courts have  yielded bipartisan support in the past, and the same is true today.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Rutherford), for cosponsoring the bill and working with me in this  effort.   I urge my colleagues to take a look at their congressional districts.  You will probably find places of refuge for our veterans; some may be  homeless. I have several facilities in my congressional district that  deal with the housing of homeless veterans, or deal with services for  homeless veterans, or deal with services, period, for veterans.   I can assure you that a comforting judicial system on veterans who,  because of combat injuries, PTSD, and  [[Page H5941]]  other issues dealing with them, losing their family, being separated  from the family, being miles away from their home because of combat- impacted injuries, that the judicial system is one they may come in  contact with.   To be able to have courts that are responsive to their service and  their record, and to be able to help move them away from the judicial  system is a tribute to our commitment to the service of our men and  women.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to continue this record of support  for veterans treatment courts by voting for this bill today.

I urge my colleagues to continue this record of support for veterans  treatment courts by voting for this bill today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   MR. BENTZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this has been a journey for me in terms of dealing with  veterans who are in need of help.   Some years ago, I joined with the late and former member of the  military, Chairman Murtha, to bring a satellite site to my  congressional district for post-traumatic stress disorder. The center  was outside of the veterans hospital but could be accessed by veterans  through TRICARE.   So I have seen the needs of veterans who have experienced the impact  of combat, the impact of the service, but are still committed to duty.  This particular legislation responds and respects that duty. That is  the duty that we owe to those who have fallen along the highway of  challenges.   Mr. Speaker, I want to make sure that we have the treatment for those  who have experienced substance abuse, as well as that we have the  judicial system that responds to that need. It may cross the gamut of  substance abuse, alcohol abuse, and of course, encounters with the  criminal justice system.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Nadler of the Judiciary  Committee. And I thank members of the Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland  Security Subcommittee because it shows that our work is expansive. It  includes rehabilitation and treatment and fairness and justice. Finding  ways to have people steer away from incarceration and, of course,  encounters over and over again with the judicial system or the criminal  justice system.   So veterans treatment court programs around the country have  successfully provided support to veterans struggling with substance  abuse or mental health issues. We have seen them work effectively. The  need to expand veterans treatment court services is real and immediate.   We look forward to this bill moving in the other body and the  President of the United States signing it, saying to veterans, we want  to be helpful to you in your time of celebration of who you are as a  veteran, but also in your time of need.   Based on the most recent data, the Bureau of Justice Statistics  estimates that approximately 181,500 veterans are incarcerated in jail  as well as State and Federal prisons. Mr. Speaker, that is too many who  have been lost to the abusing of drugs, alcohol, and substance abuse.   H.R. 4035 would help rehabilitate justice-involved veterans and  ultimately make for a safer community and give them a better quality of  life; and might I say, give their families a better quality of life.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of  this important bill.

Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H5942]]     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (S. 921) to amend title 18, United States Code, to further  protect officers and employees of the United States, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 921         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Jaime Zapata and Victor       Avila Federal Officers and Employees Protection Act''.       SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that--        (1) since the founding of the Nation, officers and       employees of the United States Government have dutifully and       faithfully served the United States overseas, including in       situations that place them at serious risk of death or bodily       harm, in order to preserve, protect, and defend the interests       of the United States;        (2) securing the safety of such officers and employees       while serving overseas is of paramount importance and is also       in furtherance of preserving, protecting, and defending the       interests of the United States;        (3) Federal courts, including the United States Court of       Appeals for the Second Circuit, the United States Court of       Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and the United States Court of       Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, have correctly interpreted       section 1114 of title 18, United States Code, to apply       extraterritorially to protect officers and employees of the       United States while the officers and employees are serving       abroad;        (4) in a case involving a violent attack against Federal       law enforcement officers Jaime Zapata and Victor Avila, a       panel of a Federal court of appeals held that section 1114 of       title 18, United States Code, does not apply       extraterritorially, creating a split among the United States       circuit courts of appeals;        (5) in light of the opinion described in paragraph (4), it       has become necessary for Congress to clarify the original       intent that section 1114 of title 18, United States Code,       applies extraterritorially; and        (6) it is further appropriate to clarify the original       intent that sections 111 and 115 of title 18, United States       Code, apply extraterritorially as well.       SEC. 3. PROTECTION OF OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE UNITED                     STATES.         Part I of title 18, United States Code, is amended--        (1) in section 111, by adding at the end the following:        ``(c) Extraterritorial Jurisdiction.--There is       extraterritorial jurisdiction over the conduct prohibited by       this section.'';        (2) in section 115, by adding at the end the following:        ``(e) There is extraterritorial jurisdiction over the       conduct prohibited by this section.''; and        (3) in section 1114--        (A) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before ``Whoever'';       and        (B) by adding at the end the following:        ``(b) Extraterritorial Jurisdiction.--There is       extraterritorial jurisdiction over the conduct prohibited by       this section.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 921, the Jaime Zapata and Victor  Avila Federal Officers and Employees Protection Act. This Senate-passed  bill would correct a manifest wrong by making clear that the law  prohibiting the killing of Federal employees extends beyond American  borders.   Our Justice Department must have the ability to ensure that anyone  who kills or attempts to kill individuals serving our country outside  the United States are brought to justice under current law.   The tragic circumstance that makes this bill necessary bears  repeating. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Special Agents Jaime  Zapata and Victor Avila were assigned abroad to protect American  interests. In early 2011, while traveling in a convoy near San Luis  Potosi, Mexico, the American agents were attacked by agents of the Los  Zetas drug cartel.   In the firefight, both Agents Zapata and Avila were shot. Tragically,  Agent Zapata died from his wounds. A thorough investigation brought the  perpetrators of this heinous act to the United States to stand to  account for the acts, and they were convicted. Yet, justice remained  unfulfilled.   In January 2020, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the murder  conviction of two Los Zetas cartel members responsible for the murder  of Agent Zapata and attempted murder of Agent Avila.   In doing so, the Court of Appeals found that the law we are amending  today did not contain an adequate expression that it was intended to  apply to crimes committed outside the United States.   Today, we correct this errant and apparently unfair judicial  interpretation. This bill does not extend criminal laws or penalties,  nor does it create a new crime, it merely clarifies Congress' original  intent.   Because of this bill, the United States Government may prosecute  anyone who killed or attempted to kill a Federal officer or employee,  whether they be agents or diplomats, while they were performing their  official duties outside of the United States. The rule of law will  prevail.   Interestingly enough, since the killings in that tragic incident, we  have seen a number of attacks against many of our outstanding Federal  employees, diplomats, and others overseas. That is all this bill would  do, but it is an important thing to do.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my fellow Texans, Mr. Cuellar and Mr. McCaul,  for leading the House companion to this bill, and I urge my colleagues  to support this legislation out of basic and endearing justice for all,  and for the families of these men.   I rise in support of S. 921, the ``Jaime Zapata and Victor Avila  Federal Officers and Employees Protection Act.''

[[Page H5943]]    I thank my fellow Texas Representatives Henry Cuellar and Michael  McCaul for leading the House companion to this bill. And I urge my  colleagues to support this legislation today.       Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar), the original sponsor of this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  to close.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is necessary to ensure that Federal  employees who are serving overseas can be protected by the American  umbrella of justice.   We have seen since this tragic incident of those who were serving our  country and lost their life and were injured. We have seen a myriad of  attacks on diplomats and others outside of the boundaries of war. We  have been stunned by actions against diplomats in embassies and outside  of embassies.   So this is a bipartisan bill that was adopted by the Senate by  unanimous consent, and I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting  this legislation so the President can sign it into law and to be able  to tell all of our Federal employees and diplomats who are standing in  the name of that flag that is shown behind you, Mr. Speaker, that we do  care about their service and their safety.

Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (S. 1502) to make Federal law enforcement officer peer support  communications confidential, and for other purposes.

The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 1502         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

SEC. 3. BEST PRACTICES AND SUPPORT.         (a) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) First responder.--The term ``first responder'' has the       meaning given the term ``public safety officer'' in section       1204 of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets       Act of 1968 (34 U.S.C. 10284).        (2) First responder agency.--The term ``first responder       agency'' means a Federal, State, local, or Tribal agency that       employs or otherwise engages the services of a first       responder.        (3) Peer support counseling program.--The term ``peer       support counseling program'' means a program provided by a       first responder agency that provides counseling services from       a peer support specialist to a first responder of the first       responder agency.

SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.         It is the sense of Congress that Federal, State, local, and       Tribal police officers, sheriffs, and other law enforcement       officers across the United States who serve with valor,       dignity, and integrity deserve the gratitude and respect of       Congress.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting S. 1502,  the COPS Counseling Act, a bill that will encourage the adoption of law  enforcement peer counseling programs across the country and protect the  privacy of Federal officers as they seek mental health support.   It is important to all of us that we promote the mental health and  well-being of our law enforcement officers, not only in order to help  individual officers but also because it helps bolster the safety of our  communities and the people our officers take a solemn oath to protect.   Law enforcement officers play a special role in our communities. They  are specifically called upon to protect and serve. Often they see,  encounter, and respond to horrendous situations that are both dangerous  and stressful and often life-threatening.   I don't know how many times, Mr. Speaker, we have heard on the news  where officers have said: I have never seen this in my lifetime. I have  never seen this horrific scene. I have never seen a car crash. I have  never seen the violence.   With the pandemic of COVID-19, we have seen officers coming to scenes  that they expressed that they have never seen. That has an impact even  though they must continue to rise the next day and serve.   They are indeed first responders, on the scene when unthinkable and  tragic events take place, whether they be mass shootings, terrible  incidents of domestic or sexual violence, and other horrific instances  of victimization. Even after the incidents are over and the threats  addressed, these situations can long remain with officers. As they seek  to protect us, we must also seek to protect them when they are in need.   We have a hearing today on issues dealing with gun safety. That is  not this bill. But what I will say is that the officers in times of  crisis are always the first ones to come to school shootings, violent  scenes where they see children who are wounded or tragically are dead.  Imagine an officer having to pick him or herself up and carry on after  you have seen, yes, little children--high school, middle school,  elementary school--who have been fallen because of school shootings.  That is a particularly unique circumstance. But there are many, many  others.   That is why I support this bill which would help officers who seek  counseling. The bill provides confidentiality to Federal law  enforcement officers by restricting individuals who participate in a  peer support counseling session from disclosing communications arising  out of peer support counseling session.   In doing so, however, the bill defines clear and necessary exceptions  to confidentiality in circumstances including explicit threats of  suicide; any admission of criminal conduct; any explicit threat of  imminent and serious physical harm or death to an individual; any  information relating to the abuse or neglect of a child, older person,  or vulnerable person; or any information that is required by law to be  reported. That had to be clarified.   Additionally, this bill encourages implementation of peer counseling  programs within the entire first responder community by requiring the  Department of Justice to make best practices publicly available on its  website. Information I have found has been the key in helping to  restore the stability of these individuals who are needing the kind of  counseling that we offer.   The Department of Justice is also required to provide a list of  training programs for public safety officers to become peer support  mentors. Always we have been told that to have a like fellow traveler,  a like experienced person, a like person in your career or profession,  Mr. Speaker, is sometimes the best medicine, the best cure, and the  best direction toward treatment.   These are important steps that will help our officers and the  communities they serve.   As we take action on this Senate-passed bill, I want to recognize our  colleague from Maryland, Representative   David Trone, for his work in  introducing the House companion legislation. I thank the chairman of  our committee, Mr. Nadler, for being focused on this legislation, and I  am delighted that my subcommittee is also very interested in this kind  of work.   Mr. Speaker, this is an important bill, I am proud to support it, and  I ask my colleagues to do the same.   Today, I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting S. 1502, the  ``COPS Counseling Act,'' a bill that will encourage the adoption of law  enforcement peer counseling programs across the country and protect the  privacy of federal officers as they seek mental health support.   It is important to all of us that we promote the mental health and  well--being of our law enforcement officers, not only in order to help  individual officers but also because it helps bolster the safety of our  communities and the people our officers take a solemn oath to protect.

That is why I support this bill, which would help officers who seek  counseling.

As we take action on this Senate-passed bill, I want to recognize our  colleague from Maryland, Representative David Trone, for his work in  introducing the House companion legislation.   This is an important bill. I am proud to support it and ask that my  colleagues do the same.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I want to again emphasize the massive number of law enforcement  officers across the Nation. There are, first of all, 18,000 police  departments of varying levels, meaning that we think of police,  constables, or sheriffs, all of them law enforcement officers. And  every day, as we speak, they are out on the front lines and, again,  seeing enormous tragedy.   I really want to emphasize what it means to come upon a scene dealing  with an injury to a child. Gun violence, car crashes, fires, police go  to those scenes as well. For too long, we have not stopped for a moment  to provide these resources and to provide these services.   I hope that, as we pass this legislation, this will be the catalyst  for local entities to build on their mental health relief and that they  will also focus on peer-directed mental health relief.   We can imagine, in the course of all the scenes that we have seen in  this body, on this floor, in this year, starting with January 6, where  police officers were involved, that there is no doubt that this  legislation is crucial. But it works across the Nation, and it should  be a tool for ensuring the strength and the stability of our officers  who are out there, men and women, family members, every single day.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I am very glad that we are able to come together, recognizing that  our law enforcement officers face dangers every day. When I look to the  support for that community, I really look to the family of citizens,  the family of the community, no matter where you are, and I think that  should be the statement and the litmus test.   When you speak to community persons who generally go about their  daily business, and local governments, you can be assured that there is  an embodiment of support.   There is the sense of horror when we see circumstances that  tragically hit this very Congress, this very House, on January 6, when  that was not how brave law enforcement officers were treated. But we  are well aware of the everyday work that is done.   Before I left to come to Washington, I had the tragic duty of going  to the funeral of a fallen. What an amazing individual that Deputy  Atkins was, and the outpouring of love and affection by the community  reflected that.   To show the humanity of officers--they have moms and dads and wives  and children--they read a letter from his mother. I just simply want to  put this letter in from his mother.   ``When I last saw you, before you said good-bye, I said the prayer I  taught you, `As I lay me down to sleep.' Nadia heard me and told me you  always said that prayer.'' Nadia was his wife.   ``And that made me really feel good, Kareem. I love you so much and I  will never stop loving you,'' the letter said.   A mother, a father, a fallen son. These are the true human aspects of  service.   So this help to officers who have seen, or been engaged, or seen  fellow officers lose their lives, or been wounded, or, again, come upon  that scene that they will be interviewed, saying that they have never  seen it before, never seen something so devastating like it before,  this is an important step forward, as was the real justice bill for  veterans, some of whom turn out to be police officers.   I think we are moving so much in the right direction to be  effectively concerned about the whole person, and that is what this  legislation, I believe, will move forward on.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from the Houston  Chronicle.                [From the Houston Chronicle, Oct. 25, 2021]     Deputies Line Up by the Dozen To Honor Slain Pct. 4 Deputy Kareem                                   Atkins         Hundreds gathered at a north Houston church Monday       afternoon to pay their respects to Kareem Atkins, the       Precinct 4 deputy constable who was fatally shot while trying       to stop a robbery.        The day began with a private service for Atkins' family.       Officers lined up hours before the memorial service at       Champion Forest Baptist Church to take a last look at their       friend, removing their hats and saying a few words over the       flag-draped casket at the front of the massive church hall.        A slideshow played on screens next to the altar, with       images of Atkins cuddling with his wife, Nadia Aweineh, and       their young children, Adalynn, a toddler, and Aiden, a       newborn. In other photos, Atkins was pictured in uniform with       fellow deputies and posing for group shots while out on the       town with friends, a broad smile on his face.        While some attendees silently wiped away tears after       viewing Atkins' casket, others laughed and shared stories,       remembering Atkins as the ``loving, protective, funny, great       dancing (or at least so he thought), outgoing and flashy       guy'' described in the funeral's program.        ``It seemed to me Kareem had many, many, best friends, and,       on a daily basis, I saw his co-workers routinely look to him       for guidance,'' Precinct 4 Constable Mark Herman said at the       memorial. ``Despite his young age, he was someone you could       count on to be calm, cool and collected. He had a unique       strength about him. He was the rock we all leaned on.''        ``If I had 100 more Kareem Atkinses (in my department),       this boss would sleep much better at night,'' Herman said.        Atkins' godsister and former babysitter also spoke, sharing       a letter Atkins' mother, Celine Pemberton-Atkins, wrote to       her son after his death. In the letter, Pemberton-Atkins       reminisced about the times her son would surprise her with       visits home to New York City, where he was born, and about       the inside jokes they shared that would not make sense to       anyone else.  [[Page H5947]]         His mother noted in her letter that she'd just learned he       was planning to travel home and surprise her for       Thanksgiving.        ``When I last saw you, before you said goodbye, I said the       prayer I taught you, `As I lay me down to sleep.' Nadia heard       me and told me you always said that prayer . . . and that       made me feel really good, Kareem. I love you so much and I       will never stop loving you,'' the letter said.                                 end of watch         After the service, attendees filed out of the church for a       color guard ceremony. The rows of friends, family and       officers sat in silence amid a few isolated sobs as       pallbearers wheeled Atkins' casket to the family. The color       guard folded the American flag that was covering the casket       and handed it to the constable, who gave it to Atkins' wife.        Police dispatchers declared the ``end of watch'' over the       air. A three-volley salute followed. Then Atkins' coffin was       placed in a hearse to be taken to Klein Memorial Park       Cemetery in Tomball.        The funeral came more than a week after Atkins was shot and       killed--and two other Precinct 4 deputies were wounded--while       attempting to arrest a robbery suspect at 45 Norte Sports       Bar, where they worked side jobs as security guards.        The shooter, who opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle,       wounded Deputies Darryl Garrett and Juqaim Barthen, according       to police. Garrett remained in the intensive care unit       Monday, while Barthen, who attended the service, is still       recovering.        On HoustonChronicle.com: `They were the 3 amigos,' fiancee       of wounded Precinct 4 deputy says after ambush in north       Houston.        Police have not identified or apprehended any suspects in       the shooting. A reward for information leading to the       assailant's arrest and conviction was increased Wednesday to       $75,000.                         making time fly on the shift         In comments during the funeral, Harris County Judge Lina       Hidalgo declared Oct. 25 ``Deputy Kareem Atkins Day'' in       Harris County from this year forward.        ``When somebody ambushed Deputy Barthen, Deputy Garrett and       Deputy Atkins, that attack on our protectors, that attack on       you all, was an attack on our entire community,'' Hidalgo       said.        ``They tried to tear down what makes our community great,       to tear down that spirit of service, to break that trust that       binds us, to bring fear, but we won't tolerate that. The way       we fight back against that, and honor Deputy Atkins' life, is       by living by the values he embodied,'' Hidalgo said.        Others attending the funeral remarked about Atkins' good       humor and generous spirit.        Indrani Boodram and her co-workers came to support Atkins'       father, who worked with them at a medical center in north       Cypress.        She remembered how the younger Atkins helped her move about       five years ago, despite never having met Boodram. ``He had       just moved here from New York and he knew no one. He even       bought pizza when he came and told me he would stay with me       until I was completely done.''        Canray Warren, who worked other security jobs with Atkins       at bars and clubs around the area, remembered the 30-year-old       as someone who made the time fly on nights when the staff       were tired and wanted to check out for the night. When it was       nearing time to start closing shop, the pair would simply       exchange looks and start cracking up.        ``He kept us laughing and kept a smile on our face,'' he       said. ``We'd joke about telling the DJ to play boring songs       so everybody could move out of the club faster,'' Warren       said.        Warren explained he wouldn't want to take a shift if he       learned that Atkins wasn't working with him. And now, looking       forward, work won't be the same without him.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   As I indicated in my discussions, I think the idea of the COPS  Counseling Act is a profound statement that we see the whole person in  law enforcement. We don't just see the person's uniform externally, but  we see the whole person.   The reading of the words of Deputy Atkins' mother was to indicate we  see the family members, the children; we see the neighbors; we see the  communities. In order to do that, we must then have a holistic approach  to the service of these officers.   I can't help but think about officers coming upon an injury to a  child in whatever form it is, and I have heard them speak of it. It is  the worst investigation case to have. It is the worst scene that they  have ever seen because it is a child.   The COPS Counseling Act will help our law enforcement officers and  also the communities they serve. We can and must do both. When officers  are in need of counseling, we should remove barriers and disincentives  that are standing in the way.   Therefore, I ask my colleagues to see the whole person as they serve  the community and the Nation, and join me in supporting this  legislation so that the President can sign it into law.   Mr. Speaker, the COPS Counseling Act will help our law enforcement  officers and also the communities they serve.   We can and must do both.   When officers are in need of counseling, we should remove barriers  and disincentives standing in the way.   Therefore, I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting this  legislation so that the President can sign it into law.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass  the bill (S. 1511) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets  Act of 1968 with respect to payments to certain public safety officers  who have become permanently and totally disabled as a result of  personal injuries sustained in the line of duty, and for other  purposes, as amended.

SEC. 9. SAFEGUARDING AMERICA'S FIRST RESPONDERS.         Section 3 of Safeguarding America's First Responders Act of       2020 (Public Law 116-157) is amended--        (1) in subsection (a)(1), by striking ``between January 1,       2020, and December 31, 2021'' and inserting ``during the       period beginning on January 1, 2020, and ending on the       termination date'' and        (2) in subsection (b)(1), by striking ``between January 1,       2020, and December 31, 2021'' and inserting ``during the       period beginning on January 1, 2020, and ending on the       termination date''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following:        ``(c) Termination Date.--For purposes of this section, the       term `termination date' means the earlier of--        ``(1) the date on which the public health emergency       declared by the Secretary of Health and Human Services under       section 319 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 247d)       on January 31, 2020, with respect to the Coronavirus Disease       (COVID-19), expires; and        ``(2) December 31, 2023.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I support S. 1511, the Protecting America's First  Responders Act of 2021, which will make important improvements to the  Department of Justice Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program.   Every day, public safety officers put their lives on the line for the  greater good of those whom they have taken an oath to serve and  protect. Unfortunately, some of those brave men and women make the  ultimate sacrifice and die while in the line of duty.   The Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program, which is administered  by the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Assistance, was  established in 1976 to provide certain benefits to families of these  officers, as well as to officers who are disabled as a result of their  service.   A death benefit is provided to eligible survivors of public safety  officers whose deaths are sustained in or due to actions in the line of  duty.                                time  1330    An education benefit is provided to spouses and children of public  safety officers killed or disabled while on duty, and the program  provides disability benefits to officers catastrophically injured in  the line of duty.   This program provides critical support to these officers and their  families, and it is important that Congress continually oversee  implementation and periodically update it to make it more effective and  more efficient. That is what this bill would do.   Specifically, the bill would expand the program's restrictive  definition of disability so that permanently disabled first responders  are able to perform work for therapeutic purposes, work that involves  simple tasks, or work that provides special accommodations and still  receive PSOB benefits.   The bill would provide for retroactive disability benefits to public  safety officers who responded to the September 11, 2001, terrorist  attacks, allowing those first responders who became permanently  disabled as a result of their work at Ground Zero to reapply for  disability benefits under the bill's expanded disability definition.   I am not from New York. I represent Texas. But I was at the edge of  the creation of the Homeland Security Committee, which was generated  around the tragic terrorist acts of 9/11, and interacted with those  individuals who, time after time, went onto the smoldering grounds of  Ground Zero to recover the remains of all who had fallen on that day.   They never stopped, Mr. Speaker, month after month, day after day. We  honored those persons in the 20th commemoration of 9/11. I will speak  about that as we continue this debate. There was no more moving,  powerful, tragic, or devastating a moment in America's life, among  others.   This bill would address lengthy delays in processing benefit claims  by permitting the DOJ to use subpoena power to expedite claims so that  impacted officers and families aren't left waiting for their owed  relief during the most difficult of times.   For cases pending longer than 365 days, the bill would index the  award amount to the date of the final determination, rather than the  date of death or injury, so that families aren't financially penalized  for any delays.   The bill would extend benefits to certain public safety officers not  currently covered, including Good Samaritan officers who act outside of  their jurisdiction in an emergency situation, trainee officers, and  fire police who handle traffic and crime scene management.   The bill would close a loophole in the program where children born  after the death or disability of a public safety officer are not able  to receive education benefits and mandate that the DOJ provide backpay  of educational benefits to children previously left out.   Finally, this bill also includes an extension of Safeguarding  America's First Responders Act concerning the provision of benefits for  officers who contract COVID-19 in the line of duty.   I thank the gentleman from New Jersey, my dear friend, Representative  Bill Pascrell, for his leadership of the House companion to this bill  and his longstanding service as champion of the Congressional Fire  Services Caucus, which I am delighted to have been a part of, and I  urge all of my colleagues to support this bill today.

I thank the Gentleman from New Jersey, Representative Bill Pascrell,  for his leadership of the House companion to this bill, and I urge all  my colleagues to support this bill today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield again to  the distinguished gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Pascrell, who I have  worked with, as have many others, as he has been on the front lines of  helping first responders. He continues to do it, and I will continue to  work with him.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Pascrell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Ruiz), who is a committed emergency medicine physician  and chair of the Hispanic Caucus and co-chair of the bipartisan COVID- 19 Task Force.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), another committed advocate for first  responders and who has continued his work on that issue.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  You have seen the bipartisan and bicameral support of this legislation.  I am grateful for that because I think this is an important statement  in the midst of intense negotiations on Build Back Better and the  INVEST Act, which will be an enormous gift to the American people,  including our law enforcement, first responders, firefighters, and  others. We now take a  [[Page H5953]]  moment to ensure that there are special benefits for public safety  officers.   As I indicated, I had the privilege of being in New York at Ground  Zero for the 20th commemoration and to hear stories of family members  where the pain is still deeply embedded, to see babies that are  relatives of the deceased that they never got a chance to see.   It was an honor to see the children of those who perished speak. They  were just babies when their loved ones lost their lives in the line of  duty in a brave manner.   The visual that I had in getting to that area during the recovery,  still going on months later, hearing the whistle blow, seeing the  gurneys come in carried by firefighters and others, the remains placed  gently on that gurney makes this even more potent and powerful and  important to be able to help.   In addition, there are two deputies who were wounded in the same  tragic incident as the death of Deputy Atkins, and they, too, need  comfort and support, and potential benefits that are necessary for  their continued survival. I think this legislation impacts any number  of men and women around this Nation.   Having participated with Local 341 President Marty Lancton just this  past weekend at the Fire Memorial in Houston, Texas, to note those  firefighters who passed in this last year--some suffering from COVID- 19, others that we are remembering who died in fires and other tragic  incidents--this emphasizes more and more the importance of this  legislation.   The Public Safety Officers' Benefits Program is an important program  to address the terrible circumstances in which officers give their  lives or are disabled due to their actions in the line of duty. Now we  work to improve and strengthen this program in the ways we have  discussed today.   I thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) and all of the  cosponsors. I was glad to also have the commitment of our House  Judiciary Committee as well as the work of Senator Grassley.   This is a bipartisan bill that was adopted by the Senate by unanimous  consent, and therefore I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting  this legislation so the President can sign it into law.

Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Yesterday, I said there was going to be breaking  news, and there is breaking news. Does anyone know that the great  Houston Astros are in the World Series, and that this Congressperson  representing Minute Maid and the Houston Astros is saying they are in  it to win it?   Madam Speaker, I am challenging my sister from Georgia (Ms.  Williams), with Dusty Baker as a coach and stellar baseball people, for  some catfish and barbecue that you have never eaten before, against  those Atlanta Braves.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Georgia.    Madam Speaker, I love it. Catfish and barbecue, yes,  Dusty Baker, and all of our ball hitters and Barbara Jordan. We are in  it to win it. Go Astros.                            ____________________
