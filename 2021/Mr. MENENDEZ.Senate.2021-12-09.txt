 Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.

Also       included were ACMI (P5) Training Pods, Reece Pods (DB-110),       Conformal Fuel Tanks (CFTs), Identification Friend/Foe (IFF)       system, AN/AVS-9 Night Vision Goggles (NVG), ARC-210 UHF/UVF       radios, LAU-118(v)l/A, LAU-117-AV2A, associated ground       support, training materials, mission critical resources and       maintenance support equipment, the procurement for various       weapon support and test equipment spares, technical       publications, personnel training, simulators, and other       training equipment, U.S. Government and contractor       engineering, technical and logistics support services; and       other related elements of logistical and program support. The       estimated total cost was $21.1 billion. Major Defense       Equipment (MDE) constituted $11.5 billion of this total.        On January 5, 2018, Congress was notified by Congressional       certification transmittal number 0C-17 for the replacement of       the previously notified two hundred (200) AGM-65H/K       (Maverick) missiles (MDE), with two hundred (200) AGM-65G       (Maverick) missiles (MDE); the inclusion of eighty (80) AAR-      57A Common Missile Warning Systems (MDE), which were included       in the total value of the DEWS systems previously notified,       but not enumerated as MDE in the original notification; the       replacement of five hundred (500) BLU-111B bombs, five       hundred (500) BLU-117B bombs, and six (6) MK-82 Inert bombs       (all MDE), with five hundred (500) BLU-111B or MK-82 (500lbs)       bombs, five hundred (500) BLU-117B or MK-84 (2,000 lbs)       bombs, and six (6) MK-82 Inert bombs (all MDE); and the       inclusion of the following sub-components of JDAM and Laser       JDAM guidance kits. The MDE sub-components were included in       the total value previously notified, but not enumerated in       the original notification:        a. Two hundred fifty (250) GBU-38 JDAMs with KMU-572 Air       Foil Groups (AFG) (MDE);        b. Two hundred fifty (250) GBU-31 JDAMs with KMU-557 AFG       (MDE);        c. Two hundred fifty (250) GBU-54 Laser JDAMs with KMU-572       AFG (MDE) and DSU-38 Laser Seeker; and        d. Two hundred fifty (250) GBU-56 Laser JDAMs with KMU-557       AFG (MDE) and DSU-40 Laser Seeker.        The replacement or upgrading of the equipment to MDE did       not result in a change to the estimated cost of MDE of $11.5       billion. The total estimated case value remained $21.1       billion.        On November 28, 2018, Congress was notified by       Congressional certification transmittal number 0L-18 reported       the inclusion of additional training assets as MDE to support       the previously notified AGM-65 (Maverick) missiles: five (5)       TGM-65 Maverick-Missile Aircrew Trainer; one (1) TGM-65       Maverick-Missile Load Trainer; and one (1) TGM-65 Maverick-      Missile Maintenance Trainer. The estimated value of the       additional MDE items was $3.5 million but its addition did       not result in a net increase in the MDE value notified. The       total estimated case value remained $21.1 billion.        This transmittal reports the inclusion of up to Five       Hundred (500) GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bombs Increment I (SDB       I) (MDE); One (1) GBU-39 A/B Focused Lethality Munition (FLM)       Practice Bomb (MDE); One (1) GBU-39 B/B Laser SDB Practice       Bomb (MDE); Four (4) MS-110 Reconnaissance Pod Retrofit Kits       (non-MDE); Two (2) Transportable Ground Station Upgrades       (non-MDE); One (1) Fixed Ground Station Upgrade (non-MDE);       and associated spares; systems/materiel; support; and       services. These additional MDE and non-MDE items are valued       at $35 million in MDE and $220 million in non-MDE. However,       the total estimated case value will remain $21.1 billion.        (iv) Significance: This notification is being provided to       report the inclusion of MDE that were not enumerated at the       time ofthe original notification. Inclusion of these items of       MDE/non-MDE results in an increase in capability over what       was originally notified. This equipment will support the       requested weapon system, support the capabilities of Qatar's       F-15QA fleet, and contribute to interoperability with the       United States.        (v) Justification: This proposed sale will support the       foreign policy and national security objectives of the United       States. Qatar is an important force for political stability       and economic progress in the Arabian Gulf region. The       procurement of SDBs, MS-110 Retrofit Kits, and associated       materiel/services will significantly improve Qatar's defense       capabilities to meet current and future threats and deter       regional aggression.        (vi) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The GBU-39/B Small Diameter Bomb Increment I (SDB I) is       a 250-pound weapon designed as a small, all weather,       autonomous, conventional, air-to-ground, precision glide       weapon able to strike fixed and stationary re-locatable       targets from standoff range. The SDB I weapon system consists       of the weapons, the BRU-61/A (4-place pneumatic carriage       system), shipping and handling containers for a single weapon       and the BRU-61/A either empty or loaded, and a weapon       planning module. It has integrated diamond-back type wings       that deploy after release, which increase the glide time and       therefore maximum range. The SDB I Anti-Jam Global       Positioning System aided Inertial Navigation System (AJGPS/      INS) provides guidance to the coordinates of a stationary       target. The payload/warhead is a very effective multipurpose       penetrating and blast fragmentation warhead couples with a       cockpit selectable electronic fuze. Its size and accuracy       allow for an effective munition with less collateral damage.       A proximity sensor provides height of burst capability.        2. An MS-110 Retrofit kit converts a DB-110 into an MS-110.       The MS-110 is a NonProgram of Record tactical reconnaissance       pod with long range, day/night, multispectral sensor       technology. The multi-spectral sensor lets. the end user see       color and better distinguish subtle features that a DB-1 l0's       dual band imagery cannot. The pod can transmit imagery via a       datalink to ground-stations for near-real time analysis and       exploitation. The pod is designed for carriage on fighter       jets. There are no advanced technologies in the system,       subsystems, equipment or technical manuals that could be       exploited by a technologically-advanced adversary.        The highest level of classification ofdefense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        (vii) Date Report Delivered to Congress: December 8, 2021.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have an  NJ.com article by Roland Armando Alum, titled ``Opinion: Six Decades  After Dictator's Assassination, Dominican Republic Flourishes While  Cuba Is Miserable'' be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:      Six Decades After Dictator's Assassination, Dominican Republic                     Flourishes While Cuba Is Miserable                          (By Roland Armando Alum)         As we commemorate Memorial Day this weekend in the U.S.,       the Dominican Republic's people mark 60 years since the fall       of Rafael Trujillo's dictatorship on May 30, 1961. Considered       Latin-America's bloodiest dictator, Trujillo beleaguered       Dominicans for 31 years, until a patriots' cabal executed him       with the secret assistance of U.S. officials.        Up to the 1959 rise of the Fidel & Raul Castro brothers in       Cuba, Trujillo was unmatched as the despotic model in the       Americas, as historian Lauren Derby noted in ``The Dictator's       Seduction'' (2009). It behooves us to draw some chronological       contrasts from both countries in the last six decades,       developments that--incidentally--have affected our own local       demographics.        Indeed, northern New Jersey is home to sizable and dynamic       Hispanic communities of Cubans and Dominicans; some of them       have attained prominent positions in every walk of life       (admittedly, sometimes to the chagrin of self-appointed       ``guardians-of-the-gate'').        Ironically, the geneses of the Dominican and Cuban       emigration are opposite. Dominicans began to emigrate en       masse after 1961, when freedom of movement became guaranteed;       while Cubans fled in disapproval of the Castros' converting       the previous Pearl of the Antilles into a bankrupt vassal       state of the now defunct Soviet empire. In summer-1980 alone,       about 1.5 percent of Cuba's population ``voted with their       feet'' via the unprecedented Mariel Freedom Flotilla, many of       whose refugees and their descendants flourished in this great       Garden State of ours.        Both countries emerged from traditional militaristic       dictatorships around the same time, 1961 for the D.R., and       1959 for Cuba, after Afro-Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista       fled the island-nation. Cuba's undeniably remarkable economic       prosperity was accomplished despite Batista's relatively       brief authoritarianism (1952-58) and the pitfalls of the       preceding 1902-1952 republican epoch.        Conversely, conditions were wretched in the D.R. while       Trujillo was ruling the country as a private fiefdom. The       instability that  [[Page S9091]]       followed ended with the U.S. military intervention that       eventually fostered a classic tripartite constitutional       government, with multiple competing political parties       alternating in power. Moreover, the jobs-creating business       sector and the labor movement thrive. A year ago, Dominicans       elected their eighth post-Trujillo president: successful       businessman Luis Abinader (born in 1967), D.R.'s first chief       executive born after Trujillo's downfall.        All this sharply contrasts with socialist Cuba, a stagnant,       closed society controlled by the Castro family and its hand-      picked, mostly military, non-elected cronies still chanting       discredited Marxist slogans. True, the Castros counted on       initial popular support, but it soon vanished as they       hijacked the liberal-inspired anti-Batista political       rebellion and turned Cuba into a nightmarish dystopia. While       the D.R. steered toward the Open Society ideal, Cuba rushed       in the opposite direction with the Castros' tropical version       of the failed Soviet-Russian mold.        Dictatorships of all genres customarily attract foreign       apologists who, comfortably from abroad, extol alleged       relative achievements. Trujillo, who even received an       honorary doctorate from a U.S. university, was praised by the       same New York Times that characteristically propagates       ridiculous excuses for Cuba's oppressors. Likewise, the       academic world brims with fake-news reports intent on       laundering the Castros' fiascos, while also defaming Cuban-      Americans.        As we salute Dominicans upon their celebrating six decades       free of despotism, one should commiserate with the Cuban       people, still suffering three generations of anachronic       totalitarianism; in fact, so far over twice as long as       Trujillo's dictatorship lasted.                            ____________________
