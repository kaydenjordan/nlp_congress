 Mr. Chairman, I rise to urge the whole House  to support this Republican budget, H. Con. Res. 71.    Let me just say a few things.   First, this is a budget that reflects our first principles: freedom,  freedom enterprise, a government accountable to the people it serves.   It is a budget that will help grow our economy, and it is a budget  that will help rein in our debt. It strengthens our national defense.  It supports our men and women in uniform. It eliminate mindless,  endless spending, and it maximizes American's tax dollars. It reforms  Medicaid. It strengthens Medicare.   This is a budget that keeps our responsibilities to our children and  our grandchildren. Remember, we have a responsibility here, each and  every generation, each and every Member: leave the country better off  so your kids and your grandkids can prosper.   That American legacy is seriously at risk because of our growing  deteriorating budget situation, because of the coming debt crisis. This  budget tackles that.   There is one more thing that this budget does that is so important.  It paves the way for historic tax reform. It unlocks the reconciliation  process. We need to pass this budget so that we can deliver real relief  for middle-income families across this country. We need to pass this  budget for the people who are living paycheck to paycheck in America,  who are trying to juggle it all. They are looking to get under a  hopelessly broken Tax Code.   We haven't reformed this tax system since 1986. We need to pass this  budget so that we can help bring more jobs, fairer taxes, and bigger  paychecks for people across this country. The time for this is now, and  the opportunity is right in front of us.   I want to especially commend Chairman Black for her commitment to  this vision. I want to especially commend the members of the Budget  Committee for their steadfast commitment to this vision. We would not  be in a position today to pass this budget without her tireless  leadership and the leadership of her members of the committee.   It is so encouraging that the Senate has passed their budget out of  committee. They are on the track, too. That means we look forward to  working with the Senate to take the next step.   We have an opportunity to make right by our fellow countrymen. We  have an opportunity to make right by the people we represent. We have  an opportunity to actually restore prosperity in this country.                                time  0945    We haven't seen that kind of economic potential in this country in at  least a decade. We can fix that this year.   We know a debt crisis is coming. We know if we do nothing, the next  generation will be worse off. We can stop that, fix this, and make them  better off.   That is what this budget paves the way for, and that is why I urge  all of my colleagues to support this budget.   I thank the chair for her steadfast support. I thank the Members for  getting us to where we are today, and I really look forward to the day  where we can look at this moment as when we got the country on the  right track.
