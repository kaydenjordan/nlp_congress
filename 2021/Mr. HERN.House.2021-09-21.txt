 Mr. Speaker, since gaining complete control of the U.S.  Federal Government with the presidency, a narrow majority in the House,  and the deciding vote in an equally split Senate, Democrats have  started on a big and historic deficit spending spree. The national debt  exceeds $28.7 trillion, and it is growing fast. There is no end in  sight.   To continue doing what the government has done for decades-- recklessly spending money with no regard to the impact on future  generations--is the coward's way out. True leadership takes courage. It  doesn't take much effort to stand here today and tell you about how  stupid this kind of spending is, Mr. Speaker. The real challenge is  actually doing something about it. Writing a budget, passing the  budget, and appropriating money according to the budget is a process we  have not completed on time since the nineties.   Secretary Treasurer Janet Yellen recently said that failing to raise  the debt ceiling risked ``irreparable harm to the U.S. economy and the  livelihoods of all Americans.''   Ignoring their own Treasury Secretary's warning, Democrats decided to  leave the debt ceiling increase out of their partisan budget  reconciliation bill, risking financial disaster for the entire Nation.   I recently led a letter to over 100 colleagues asking them to suspend  this continuing resolution. While the Democrats want to wave a magic  wand and pretend the debt doesn't exist, our debts are very real. Our  Democrat colleagues need to do something about this.
