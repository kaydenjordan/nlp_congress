 Mr. Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed so many  vulnerabilities in our communities, our economy, and our healthcare  system. None of us were prepared for the endless virtual meetings,  school closings, and weeks spent in quarantine. Nor could we have been  ready for the tragic loss of our neighbors and loved ones who were  living in long-term care facilities across the Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today about the grave impact the negligent  policies implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic had on the most  vulnerable in our communities.   Over the past nearly 2 years, we watched our grandparents in nursing  homes and our family and friends in group homes struggling to maintain  their health, dignity, and will to go on as they were left without the  care and attention they deserved over long periods of isolation.   When I was sworn in to serve in the 117th Congress, one of the first  bills I introduced was the bipartisan Essential Caregivers Act. This  bill is a critical step to ensure that residents of long-term care  facilities are not left to suffer in isolation during this or any  future public health emergency.   While shut out from their family and loved ones in isolation, many  long-term care residents began suffering from depression, extreme  loneliness, and a major decline in mental and physical health. It is  the injustice of this century that this is going unaddressed by  Congress.   Since introducing the Essential Caregivers Act, we have started a  coalition of passionate and tenacious fighters across the country. It  is the Essential Caregivers Movement.   With me today, I have a book authored by Karla Abraham-Conley, an  amazing constituent of mine who also was prohibited from providing the  needed care for her mother because of negligent policies in place by  our former Governor. This is her great book. It is absolutely  beautiful. ``Protecting Them to Death'' is the title.   Folded into each page of Karla's book are harrowing stories from  individuals who either lost a loved one in a long-term care facility or  witnessed from a distance as their loved ones suffered from serious  declines in their mental and physical health.   These are not just the stories of New Yorkers. These are accounts  from all across the Nation as you go through each part of this book. I  could flip every page of this book and tell you a story from every  single State. They are heartbreaking. They are cruel. Most importantly,  they motivate those with the power and responsibility to make a  meaningful change for our future.   When I see this book, I see the ways our laws have failed our  constituents. I see the pain, but I also see the opportunity on every  page, a chance for this Congress to stand up on behalf of these hurting  Americans and boldly say: I will act. I will defend your rights as an  essential caregiver.   Before I close, I would like to share an excerpt from Karla's  personal story. ``I was my mother's essential caregiver every single  day prior to the lockdown. Suddenly, I wasn't there anymore, and she  was incapable of understanding why.''   Karla continues by saying her mother ``was left to die alone in her  bed, and not from COVID-19. She said to me via a virtual visit, `Get me  outta here. They're going to kill me,' which is exactly what  happened.''   When Karla was shut off from her mother, her mother's state of health  rapidly declined. Karla's mother developed sepsis, renal failure, high  sodium levels, swelling of the brain, and other symptoms that went  unnoticed. After Karla fought tooth and nail to admit her mother to the  emergency room, her mother passed away a week later.   Mr. Speaker, what you have heard is unacceptable by all standards,  but it is just one of thousands of stories I wanted to share.   I thank Karla and so many essential caregivers, including our own  VoicesForSeniors, another advocacy group in New York State, for sharing  this dark chapter in their lives.   Not many people can turn grief into action and start a nationwide  movement. Yet, in a time of incredible sadness and loss, so many strong  men and women chose to stand up and do just that. I applaud their  courage, their bravery, and their tenacity in this fight. I introduced  the Essential Caregivers Act for each of them and their loved ones.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to lead this fight in Congress, but I am  not leading it alone. I am joined by our colleagues from both sides of  the aisle, including the bill's cosponsor and co-lead, Congressman    John Larson of Connecticut. We are so grateful for his advocacy as  well.   Mr. Speaker, I urge more of my colleagues to join us to pass this  bill, to make it a reality and help these people who are advocating  across the Nation to protect those who could be in this jeopardy in the  future. I will remain committed to this fight for so many families who  were forced to comply with the careless policies that prevented them  from caring for their loved ones.                            ____________________
