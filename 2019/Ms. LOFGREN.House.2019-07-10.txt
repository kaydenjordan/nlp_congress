 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1044) to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to  eliminate the per-country numerical limitation for employment-based  immigrants, to increase the per-country numerical limitation for  family-sponsored immigrants, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

SEC. 3. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1044, the Fairness for  High-Skilled Immigrants Act, a bipartisan bill that would make a  modest, but important change to our immigration laws to alleviate  hardships associated with lengthy visa backlogs.   Let me begin by explaining what this bill does do and does not do.  H.R. 1044 does not increase the overall number of immigrant visas that  are available each year. Although raising the ceiling on visas is the  only viable way to eliminate backlogs, there is, in my view,  unfortunately, no consensus on that issue at this time.   But there is broad consensus that we should do what we can to make  the system more equitable. This is the focus of H.R. 1044. By  eliminating the per-country limit on employment-based visas, all  immigrant visa applicants will eventually be restored to a level  playing field, where one's country of nationality has no bearing on  their place in line.   Under our immigration laws, employment-based visas are granted to  individuals under a five-tiered ``preference system.'' The first three  preference categories are reserved for priority workers, individuals  with advanced degrees, and other professionals and skilled workers.   To be eligible for a visa under one of these categories, the  applicant must generally have an offer of employment from a U.S.  employer, and must submit extensive documentation of their  qualifications for the job and the relevant preference category. The  applicant's country of birth is simply not a factor, and rightfully so.  What does a person's nationality have to do with their merit as an  employee?   However, country of birth does become relevant after the applicant  has qualified for a visa and is waiting in line for a visa number. The  so-called ``per-country'' limit prohibits any one country from  receiving more than 7 percent of the immigrant visas that are available  each year.   Because of this, the visa backlogs have a particularly harsh impact  on nationals of countries with high populations, and thus, high demand  for visas, such as India. As a result, it can now take a decade or more  for an Indian physician working in a medically-underserved area, or a  particle physicist with a Ph.D. from MIT to receive a green card. How  is this good for our country?   Our immigration system is in desperate need of reform. We all know  too well the plight of Dreamers and the undocumented population. We  know now more than ever that our agriculture sector, which relies  heavily on immigrant workers, is struggling to satisfy its labor needs  and provide a safe domestic food supply.   We are reminded daily of the concern we have of the situation  unfolding at the border.   On top of these very real and very serious issues, we also remain  inextricably bound by the imperfections of an immigration framework  that was formulated nearly 30 years ago and is out of touch with the  needs of the 21st century.   Major reforms are required to truly fix our outdated legal system.  But as we all know, such reforms have been hard to come by for a long  time.   If we want to get anything done, if we want to do what is right for  our country, we have to find common  [[Page H5325]]  ground, and we have to compromise. On an issue as contentious as  immigration, our failure to work together in a fully bipartisan fashion  can only result in legislation that will go nowhere in the Senate.   H.R. 1044 is one of those rare proposals where we can agree. H.R.  1044 has strong bipartisan support, with more than 200 Democratic and  more than 100 Republican cosponsors. In 2011, the House passed a  version of this bill by a margin of 389-15. I urge all of my colleagues  to once again vote in favor of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Khanna), my colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Krishnamoorthi).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I do want to address the points made by the ranking  member of the full committee.   This bill has been around a while. It was introduced in 2011. At that  point, we did have a hearing and even a markup. We have had it on the  floor before. We have, at this moment, 312 Members on the bill,  bipartisan.   Addressing the issue that he was reading, and I don't think it is at  all confusing, the Department of State is actually the agency that  allocates the priority dates. They keep track of the visas. We have  communicated with them frequently over the years.   We provided in this bill a transition period because as time has gone  on, the delays have gotten even worse for large countries, so we wanted  to put a transition period in the bill. That is what the section that  he read about would do.   We do think that this has become an emergency in some sectors.   I recently met with a physician and his wife, who is also a  physician, who are here on H-1B visas, and they have been for a number  of years. They are serving a medically underserved community. Their  children, who are here legally as dependents, are about to ``age out.''  They haven't been back to the country of their birth in who knows how  long; they don't speak the language; they don't have anybody in the  country of their birth; and they are about to be out of status even  though they have played by all the rules.   Those two physicians told their patients that they were going to  close their practice and move to Canada because they just couldn't go  on like this.   That is not a situation we can countenance. That is happening all  over the country. We need to fix it.   Mr. Speaker, this bill does fix it, and I hope that we can support  it. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for the excellent work he has  done on this bill; the collaboration that we have had on bringing it  forward so it could be considered today; and the tremendous  bipartisanship that has been exhibited throughout dealing with this  question, going back for nearly 10 years of work on this.   I would note that the vast majority, way over 90 percent, of  employment-based immigrants who have been sponsored for green cards are  already working in the United States on some form of temporary visa.  This doesn't bring in additional people. These are people who are  already here.   The question is, are they going to be able to get the stability that  legal permanent residence provides? If they do, it will be good for our  country in several ways.   One, they are contributing to our economy, whether they are  physicians serving in medically underserved areas, whether they are  scientists breaking new ground, or whether they are H-1B nurses who are  serving in underserved areas.   Further, we know from studies that people who are legal permanent  residents are not vulnerable to those who might be abusive employers  trying to suppress their wages. So, this is good for American workers  as well as those who would gain bargaining power by gaining legal  permanent residence.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that we can have a great vote of support for this  bill today. I thank all the cosponsors and those who worked so hard to  get us here today.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
