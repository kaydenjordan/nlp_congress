 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, this amendment, that my friend has brought up, seeks to  include an attempt to remove something that is very needed and  necessary among civil service. And I say to Mr. Connolly that this  amendment coming within the NDAA, is a poor attempt at reversing  something that is important to remain.   The legislation was written to override President Trump's executive  order 13957, as has been mentioned, which was entitled ``Creating  Schedule F in the Excepted Service,'' and I supported President Trump's  order in that regard. But it guaranteed--and this is the issue--that  civil servants in policy-making roles could not be held accountable  when they were insubordinate to the President and members of the  President's administration.                                time  0140    Why in the world would we not want there to be accountability when  there is insubordination? That just is common sense. It is common sense  that we have the ability to stand up when people are opposing or being  insubordinate.   The bottom line is that the voters elect the President, and then the  President nominates administration officials to implement the policy  that the voters have elected the President to implement. When career  officials resist implementing those mandates, then they are, in effect,  resisting the voters.   This is, to me, at the heart of this whole issue right here. To  resist the President's orders that have been supported by the voters is  unacceptable, and we need the means to hold those individuals  accountable.   America is supposed to be a government of the people, by the people,  and for the people. It is not a government in which career bureaucrats  dictate the way things will go, particularly when they are doing so in  direct opposition to the will of the President, regardless of which  party is represented in the White House.   My colleague, Mr. Connolly, is of the view that President Trump's  order somehow reinstated a 19th-century-style political patronage  system, but he is sorely mistaken. President Trump did not create  Schedule F to reinstate a patronage system. Had he wanted to do that,  he could have converted Schedule F to employees and to the same kind of  at-will political employees that Schedule C has. That is not what he  did.   President Trump's order simply made it easier to discipline or remove  civil servants in policymaking roles who actively work to undermine the  policies of their politically accountable superiors.   It also made it easier to deal with just plain poor performers. Who  among us really wants to deal with poor performers? The executive order  originally avoided meddling with Senior Executive Service individuals  and preserved protections for nonpolicy-related civil service  positions. In fact, those are the very types of positions that were the  original object of the 19th century civil service reforms that  eliminated the patronage system.   Regardless of one's view of Schedule F, this amendment simply is not  needed, in spite of the fact that President Biden reversed it. This  amendment is not needed. It is not wise. The personnel reforms  President Trump's order attempted have been sorely needed and should  not be precluded from any future administration, as well.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.
