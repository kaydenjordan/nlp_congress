 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support the disaster  supplemental package, especially as it relates to agriculture and rural  development.   As chairman of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug  Administration, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, I worked with the  ranking member and other members who represent districts that have been  impacted by this historical weather that is related to disasters to  support bipartisan relief to the farming and rural communities.   From hurricanes to volcano activity, to deadly wildfires, this  supplemental provides Federal financial relief to those most negatively  impacted by the national disasters. While many of us favor limited  government, there are times like these where Federal assistance is  needed and is warranted.   Members from the Southeast to California, to Hawaii, to communities  in between represent districts with agriculture and rural constituents  who have suffered devastating losses to their livelihood. In my home  State of Alabama, for example, producers of cotton to vegetables have  lost everything. In Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, and South  Carolina, producers of crop or livestock lost their source of income  now and into the future.   At a time when hardworking farmers invested limited dollars and  countless hours of labor, their livelihoods were wiped out within hours  by a once-in-a-lifetime storm. These farmers and producers take  financial risks that are unknown to most Americans. Even if the  delivery of this critical relief is delayed by the normal  administrative process, lenders and bankers must see a signal from the  Federal Government that financial support will be coming before the  next crop-year.   I want to highlight, just briefly, those parts of the package that  relate to agriculture and rural communities.   The agriculture portion of the bill totals $1.4 billion. A majority  of the funding supports the hardworking farmers and ranchers who  produce crops and livestock for food on our dinner tables. The package  also provides funding for critical watersheds damaged by the hurricanes  and fires. Lastly, the funding provides for basic nutritional needs for  those who qualify in the Northern Mariana Islands.   In closing, I ask my colleagues to support this bill as we build  America's communities impacted by these natural disasters.                                time  1915
