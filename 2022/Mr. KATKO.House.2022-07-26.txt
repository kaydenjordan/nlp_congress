 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the previous question  so we can immediately consider H. Res. 1255 led by my good friend and  colleague   Michael Guest, the vice ranking member of the Committee on  Homeland Security.   Let's be clear: The situation at the southwest border is absolutely  unsustainable. Since President Biden took office, U.S. Customs and  Border Protection has had more than 3 million encounters at the  southwest border. That is 3 million. That is an incredibly unbelievable  record.   Yet, despite doing their best in impossible conditions, Border Patrol  agents continue to be vilified by this President and others in the  party.   This is exemplified by the response from the Biden administration and  Congressional Democrats when unsubstantiated claims were made against  Border Patrol agents responding to tens of thousands of migrants that  attempted to illegally cross the border in Del Rio, Texas, in September  of last year.   Without any investigation, any opportunity to review evidence, or any  semblance of due process, here is what was said about our brave law  enforcement officers as they simply tried to deal with the untenable  situation at the border created by this administration.   Let's start with President Biden:         It was horrible to see people treated like they were.       Horses nearly running them over. And people being strapped.       It's outrageous. I promise you, these people will pay.    Vice President Harris:         This has invoked some of the worst moments in our history,       where that kind of behavior has been used against the       indigenous people of our country. It has been used against       African Americans during times of slavery.    Secretary Mayorkas:         I was horrified by what I saw. The pictures I observed       troubled me profoundly. One cannot weaponize a horse to       attack a child. That is unacceptable.    Finally, Speaker Pelosi:         Reports of the mistreatment of Haitian migrants fleeing       from violence and devastation from natural disasters are       deeply troubling, including the inappropriate use of what       appears to be whips by Border Patrol officers on horseback to       intimidate migrants.    Jumping to conclusions and casting dispersions against our law  enforcement officers without any forethought is unconscionable. It is a  fundamental tenet of what I did as a Federal prosecutor for 20 years,  that you never reach a conclusion and seek to prove it. You let the  facts take you where they do. They didn't do that on this occasion.  They reached a conclusion and sought to prove it.   After months of an extensive investigation that was promised within  weeks, Customs and Border Protection's own Office of Professional  Responsibility published a report in July that concluded there is no  evidence--none--no evidence that Border Patrol  [[Page H7139]]  agents struck, intentionally or otherwise, any migrants with their  reins from their horses. There were no whips, there were no reins used  as whips, no one was struck, and absolutely no one was strapped, as the  President alleged.    Mr. Speaker, after being cleared of any criminal  wrongdoing, not a single top Democrat, including the President or  anyone within his administration, including Secretary Mayorkas, has  acknowledged that their knee-jerk comments were wrong and unfair, and  it destroyed the lives of those officers.   To make matters worse, Border Patrol agents are leaving in record  numbers due to low morale, an impossible mission, and no support from  this administration.   The constant vilifying of the Border Patrol and law enforcement has  got to stop. This is not what agents signed up for. They deserve  better. They deserve our support, and, by God, they are going to get  it.   Mr. Guest's resolution sets the record straight and acknowledges our  responsibility to support law enforcement.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  defeat the previous question so we can take this measure up and provide  these brave men and women who risk their lives every single day with  the support they deserve.    Madam Speaker, I appreciate the comments of my colleagues,  Ms. Waters and Mr. Hill, and I adopt those comments as well.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 1842,  the Harriet Tubman Bicentennial Commemorative Coin Act.   It is an honor and privilege to speak in support of this bill, which  comes to the floor just over 200 years from the time of Harriet  Tubman's birth.   Across this country and around the world, Harriet Tubman is  remembered as an icon of freedom and an agent of change. After her  escape from slavery and work as a conductor on the Underground  Railroad, Harriet Tubman resided in Auburn, New York, for several  years--right down the road from her friend and mentor, William Seward.   Her former home has become a cherished site in central New York, and  I have been proud to represent the Harriet Tubman Home and work with  its caretaker since I came to Congress. Today's vote represents one of  the most significant steps forward in strengthening Federal recognition  of the Harriet Tubman Home since its designation as a national park in  2017.  [[Page H7149]]    Specifically, I am pleased that the coins issued under this  legislation bearing Harriet Tubman's likeness and symbolizing her  legacy will directly benefit preservation and education efforts at the  Tubman Home in Auburn for years to come.   Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Meeks for joining me in  introducing the House version of this bill, as well as Senators Portman  and Rosen for their successful efforts to unanimously pass this  legislation in the Senate earlier this year.   Madam Speaker, I look forward to sending this bill to the President's  desk for signature, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of  honoring a truly great American hero who was tough as nails.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to follow the recommendation from  Mr. Katko and support H.R. 1842, and I yield back the balance of my  time.
