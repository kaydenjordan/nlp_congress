 Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Chandler Mayor  Kevin Hartke, who took his oath of office earlier this month. Mayor  Hartke previously served on the Chandler City Council, where he was,  most recently, the vice mayor.   Mayor Hartke and his family are longtime Chandler residents, and they  are extremely active in their community. He and his wife, Lynne, have  been married for 37 years, and have four children and four  grandchildren. He served on one of my advisory councils in the last  Congress, offering a distinct perspective on how my staff and I could  engage the faith-based community.   Madam Speaker, individuals like Mayor Hartke provide stability and  vital leadership to our cities and towns. Chandler was recently rated  as the number ten city in the country for job seekers. Under Mayor  Hartke's direction, I have every confidence that he will continue to  help Chandler's  [[Page H1271]]  economy prosper. I have enjoyed working with Kevin thus far, and I look  forward to our efforts to serve our constituents in the East Valley.                            ____________________
