 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the  passing of my dear friend Florine Mark, an icon and trailblazer in  Michigan and the international business community.   A role model, entrepreneur, and businesswoman, Florine established  the first Michigan Weight Watchers franchise in 1966, holding her first  meeting in a school auditorium. Over the next 50 years, Florine grew  her portfolio, acquiring franchises in 13 States, Canada, and Mexico,  to become the largest franchise holder of Weight Watchers  International, employing over 4,200 people.   Behind Florine's drive for success was a deeply held desire to uplift  and inspire others to see and act upon the best in themselves. From her  early childhood, growing up in a family with very limited means,  Florine's bubbie instilled in her the importance of giving back to  others. She often spent Sundays with her grandmother, raising funds for  Jewish charities and was an active member of her congregation at Adat  Shalom Synagogue.   Florine's signature saying, ``love, love, love,'' not only reflected  her love of family, but also her commitment to improving the lives of  others. Florine shared her time and expertise to countless community  organizations throughout Michigan, including Children's Hospital of  Michigan, Detroit Institute for Children, Business Leaders of Michigan,  Detroit Regional Chamber, Henry Ford Health System, University of  Michigan Cardiovascular Center, Women of Tomorrow, and several others.  She was an active board member of the Michigan Fitness Foundation; the  Governor's Council on Physical Fitness, Health, and Sports; the  Governor's Economic Council Advisory Board; and was on the board of  trustees of the Community Foundation for Southeast Michigan since 1992.   As a strong advocate for women's professional development and  leadership roles in business, Florine sat on the Women's Leadership  Board at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. She  also served a 3-year term on the Detroit branch of the Federal Reserve  Bank of Chicago, was on the Michigan Committee supporting the  Smithsonian American Women's History Museum, and on the board of  directors for English Gardens.   A well-known motivational speaker, she hosted ``Today's Takeaway with  Florine Mark,'' during which she interviewed celebrity guests and  everyday individuals about physical and mental health, relationships,  and other self-care topics. Through her ``Ask Florine'' and  ``Remarkable Women'' segments on local broadcasts, she sought to uplift  women leaders while raising self-esteem by providing an avenue for  advice, support, and dialogue.   Florine's leadership earned her several awards throughout her career,  including the 2003 ``Entrepreneurial Visionary Award'' from the Women's  Business Center in Washington, DC. She was also recognized among the  100 Most Influential Women in Detroit by Crain's Detroit Business  Magazine, was the recipient of the William Davidson Lifetime  Achievement Award, and was the first woman to receive the Neal Shine  Award for Exemplary Regional Leadership. She received honorary degrees  from Eastern Michigan University, Central Michigan University, Oakland  University, Walsh College, Wayne State University, and Lawrence  Technological University. Five of these were honorary doctorates. And  just earlier this month, Florine received the Women Who Make a  Difference award from the International Women's Forum for her  accomplishments and contributions to her community and the world.   Through a lifetime of efforts big and small, Florine cemented a  legacy as an icon in Michigan, across the country, and around the  world. She willingly and selflessly made time for her community, her  friends, and especially for her family whom she cherished more than  anything. I personally know how deeply proud Florine was of her seven  children and her many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.   I am proud to honor the life and legacy of my friend, Florine Mark. I  ask that we offer our sympathies to her family and thank them for  sharing Florine with us all. She will be sorely missed.                            ____________________
