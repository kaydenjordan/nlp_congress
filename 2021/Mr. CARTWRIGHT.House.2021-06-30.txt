 Madam Speaker, I am thrilled that, this week, we  bring up the INVEST in America Act, part of Joe Biden's American Jobs  Plan, something that we have been waiting for for many years.   We have had infrastructure week after infrastructure week. We  actually have a real one this week because we will be voting on the  INVEST in America Act, something that will invest $700 billion into  America's roads, bridges, tunnels, rail systems, water systems, and  sewer systems, things that the Greatest Generation handed down to us.  They came back from World War II after all the suffering and all the  losses, and they sucked it up and actually contributed more.   All of these investments in American infrastructure that happened  after World War II, we have been disinvesting in those things. It is  time for us to step up to the plate and invest in America with the  INVEST in America Act.   Let's get it done, and let's do it on a bipartisan basis. We all need  to invest in our great Nation.                            ____________________
