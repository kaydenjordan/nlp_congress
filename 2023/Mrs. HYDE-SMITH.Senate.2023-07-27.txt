 Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the  Vicksburg District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers--USACE--for 150  years of exceptional service to the people of Mississippi and our  Nation.   Founded in 1873 when Captain William Henry Harrison Benyaurd created  a USACE office in Monroe, LA, the Vicksburg District now covers 68,000  square miles in Mississippi, Arkansas, and Louisiana; nine major river  basins; 278 miles of the Mississippi River; and 460 miles of mainline  Mississippi River levees. In 1884, the first permanent Vicksburg office  was formed by Captain Eric Bergland. Vicksburg National Military Park  was largely constructed by the Vicksburg District in the early 1900s.  In response to the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 and as directed by  the Flood Control Act of 1928, the Vicksburg District designed and  implemented an extensive flood control program, commonly referred to as  the Mississippi Rivers and Tributaries--MR&T--project, which continues  to serve the people of Mississippi to this day.   The benefits the Vicksburg District brings to Mississippians and the  Nation are hard to quantify, but should not be taken for granted. The  average annual benefits of the MR&T project alone are valued at $1.46  billion, but the positive impacts associated with the many watersheds,  ports, locks and dams, reservoirs, and flood control structures the  district manages go far beyond any dollar amount.   The Vicksburg District continues to boast some of the brightest  engineering minds in the world as it designs, constructs, and maintains  premier civil works projects. In addition to fulfilling its mission of  flood control, it also excels in its other mission areas, including  navigation, hydro-power, recreation, water supply, emergency  operations, and environmental restoration. I am grateful for its  important work to protect the people, economy, and natural resources of  Mississippi, and I look forward seeing what the Vicksburg District  accomplishes in the future.                            ____________________
