 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it has been 2 months since Ambassador  Lighthizer notified Congress of the administration's intent to enter  into negotiations with Mexico and Canada on the North American Free  Trade Agreement. During that time, I launched something called NAFTA 4  AZ, which is an initiative to allow Arizonans to share their stories  about how NAFTA has changed their lives for the better.   I have heard from Arizonans across the State who work in a multitude  of industries--from dairy farmers to call center employees--and the  responses I have received are overwhelmingly positive. For example,  Matt Mandel, who serves as chief operating officer for SunFed, a  company based in Rio Rico, shared his personal story.   Matt wrote:         Fresh produce trade has kept my family working here in the       State of Arizona for three generations. Arizona imports over       17  [[Page S4129]]       billion pounds of fresh, healthy fruits and vegetables--      bilateral trade between the United States and Mexico       representing over $40 billion. Let's modernize NAFTA.    Mignonne Hollis with the Arizona Regional Economic Development  Foundation tweeted:         NAFTA and our trade partners in Mexico have allowed us to       grow the aerospace industry in southern Arizona, which is key       to our economic development.    Dairy farmer Jim Boyle notes:         Most of our customers are local--right here in our State--      but our biggest customer outside of Arizona is Mexico. We       ship daily loads of cheese, powder, and tank loads of cream       all the way through Mexico. Please, let's keep NAFTA working       for the American farmer.    Other comments I have received through my website include statements  like ``I have enjoyed a constant supply of fresh fruits and vegetables  in these years of NAFTA. I have also noticed . . . how relatively  inexpensive many household items have been since'' and ``We supply  parts that cross the border multiple times before they reach final  assembly in the U.S. Free trade is vital to our success and the success  of our customers who not only get us where we need to go but protect  our shores and vital interests.''   The Arizona Chamber of Commerce noted in its comments on NAFTA:         Agreement is central to the State's economic prosperity.    The NAFTA agreement, that is.         Mexico is Arizona's leading trade partner. Canada is the       State's second leading trade partner.    In an interview focused on the NAFTA renegotiation process, the CEO  of Arizona's Hispanic chamber stated: ``We know that Mexican nationals  spend over a billion dollars a year in just Pima County.'' That is just  one county.   It is hardly surprising to hear such overwhelmingly positive support  for NAFTA, considering the benefits it has had on Arizona's economy.   NAFTA 4 AZ has helped to put on paper what Arizonans know all too  well: NAFTA plays a critical role in supporting jobs, opportunity, and  economic growth. It has been great to hear from people all over the  State talking about how NAFTA has helped them and asking the  administration to modernize NAFTA, not to end it.   NAFTA 4 AZ submissions, as well as comments submitted to the USTR  from Arizona stakeholders, share one common plea: Do not harm the  trilateral structure and the reciprocal market access of NAFTA.   Earlier this week the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative made  public its negotiating objectives for NAFTA. Based on what the USTR  released, it appears the administration has recognized the importance  of this central tenet of NAFTA. I am pleased that it appears that the  administration will seek to modernize NAFTA along the well-worn lines  of what was negotiated for the now defunct Trans-Pacific Partnership  Agreement.   I think we can all agree that addressing the issues of digital trade  and intellectual property in the agreement, which is more than 20 years  old, is the key to NAFTA's continued success. Let's modernize it, not  end it.   However, these negotiating objectives mark the next step in a long  process that will have tremendous impact on Arizona's economy, for  better or for worse. Unfortunately, the path forward for NAFTA remains  uncertain and there is a long road to travel before we get to a place  where the United States, Mexico, and Canada can all agree to an updated  NAFTA.   From the vegetable fields of Yuma to the warehouses in Nogales, to  the small retailers along the southern border, to the hotels throughout  the valley, to the ranches up north where I grew up in Snowflake, NAFTA  is important to all Arizonans.   I will review the administration's objectives closely as I continue  to talk to Arizonans about what they need to ensure vibrant cross- border trading.   I look forward to continued consultation between Congress and the  administration as this process to modernize NAFTA moves forward.   Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.
