 Mr. Speaker, while extremists threaten to shut down the  government if they don't receive reckless cuts to vital programs that  families in Ohio's 13th Congressional District rely on, like Social  Security, K-12 education, and nutrition assistance, I am committed to  funding the government and keeping these critical services running.   My constituents are worried about how they will pay their bills or  put food on the table if the government shuts down. That is why I  introduced two bills last week, the Pay Our Military Act and the Feed  Our Families Act. Both put people over politics to protect Americans'  livelihoods in the case of a government shutdown.   The bipartisan Pay Our Military Act would ensure our servicemembers,  people who sacrifice every day to keep our country safe, aren't forced  to serve without pay.   The Feed Our Families Act would ensure no family who relies on SNAP  benefits goes hungry throughout the shutdown.   House Republicans can easily prevent a government shutdown by simply  upholding their end of the bipartisan budget agreement, but if they  won't, I remain committed to Ohio's 13th Congressional District and our  country.   It is time to stop the political games. Put the American people first  and fund our government. In the event that extremists won't--which it  seems like they won't, based on the shenanigans and utter foolishness  of today--I encourage my colleagues to support and bring to the floor  the Pay Our Military Act and the Feed Our Families Act.                            ____________________
