 Mr. Speaker, just a few years ago, there was serious  deliberation, prayer, much review, the utilization of experts as the  House of Representatives voted for the Iran deal of the P5+6. I  remember extensive deliberations and the probing of experts on the  compliance aspect of this nuclear deal.   As I speak, the President has announced a pullout--or will be  announcing such, I think--with drastic consequences. It is certainly  appropriate to look at bilateral agreements, but to all that have  reviewed, Iran is complying with this agreement. As we approach North  Korea, it will be baffling to them as we try to engage in a final  agreement.   This is not about campaign pledges or your dislike for the former  President of the United States. It is about the safety and security of  the world and the containment of nuclear products and the utilization  of such.   So I would argue that the Congress needs to stand up, make good on  its commitments, protect the American people and the world from nuclear  catastrophe.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I speak in support of H.R. 3170, the  Small Business Development Center Cyber Security Training Act of 2017.   H.R. 3170 amends the Small Business Act to require the Small Business  Administration to establish a program for certifying employees of small  business development centers to provide cybersecurity planning  assistance to small businesses.   Cybersecurity threats faced by small businesses are as serious as  those faced by large businesses and government agencies.   According to the Better Business Bureau's 2017 report ``State of  Cybersecurity Among Small Businesses in North America'' found that  small business owners are becoming more and more aware of cyber  threats, continue to be concerned about cyber risks, and are taking  some proactive security steps in spite of their unique challenges in  regard to cybersecurity.   Global spending on cybersecurity is expected to reach $170 billion by  2020 as businesses and governments work to security networks and the  data they contain.   Cyberattacks in the form of ransomware, phishing, point-of sale  malware, keyloggers, tech support phone scam, remote access Trojan or  rat are some of the threats faced by small businesses.   According to the trade journal Small Business Trends:   43 percent of cyberattacks target small businesses;   14 percent of small businesses rate their ability to mitigate cyber  risks, vulnerabilities, and attacks as highly effective;   60 percent of small companies go out of business within six months of  a cyberattack;   48 percent of data security breaches are caused by acts of malicious  intent, human error, or system failure; and   Small businesses are most concerned about the security of customer  data.   Cyber criminals are not only interested in what may be of value on a  small business computer or computing device.   Criminals can also see value in taking control of a small business'  computers or computing devices to launch an attack on a third party.   These types of attacks can shield the attacker from being identified  and cause problems for the small business as networks label their  computing devices or web addresses as the source of an attack.   The overall impact of a cybersecurity incident according to the  National Institute for Standards and Technology could include:   damage to information or information systems;   regulatory fines and penalties/legal fees;   decreased productivity;   loss of information critical to running your business;   damage to reputation or loss of consumer confidence;   damage to credit and loan worthiness; or   loss of business income.   There is a growing shortage of cybersecurity professionals with over  a quarter-million positions remaining unfilled in the U.S. alone and a  predicted shortfall of 1.5 million cybersecurity professionals by 2019.   Solutions like the ones contained in the bill before us would  increase the number of cybersecurity professionals in the Small  Business Administration to serve the cybersecurity needs of small  businesses.   The bill would require the SBA to have staff at their Small Business  Development Centers (SBDCs) receive training in cybersecurity so that  they will be prepared to assist businesses with cybersecurity planning.   Small Business Development Centers provide an array of technical  assistance to small businesses and aspiring entrepreneurs.   By supporting business growth, sustainability and enhancing the  creation of new businesses entities, SBDCs foster local and regional  economic development through job creation and retention.   As a result of the no-cost, extensive, one-on-one, long-term  professional business advising, low-cost training and other specialized  services SBDC clients receive, the program remains one of the nation's  largest small business assistance programs in the federal government.   The SBDCs are comprised of a unique collaboration of SBA federal  funds, state and local governments, and private sector resources.   SBDCs provide services through professional business advisors such  as:   development of business plans; manufacturing assistance;   financial packaging and lending assistance; exporting and importing  support;   disaster recovery assistance; procurement and contracting aid; market  research services;   aid to 8(a) firms in all stages; and  [[Page H3800]]    healthcare information.   H.R. 3170, would add to this list cybersecurity planning assistance.   I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.
