 Madam Speaker, 99 days ago House  Democrats passed the HEROES Act to provide much-needed relief to the  American people suffering from this pandemic.   What was the reaction from the GOP?   A shrug.   Funding for State and local governments to protect jobs of first  responders and teachers?   Mitch McConnell said: Let them go bankrupt.   Feeding hungry children and families?   They said: Let's hit the pause button.   Funding for testing, treatment, and hospitals as death tolls soared  over 175,000?   Donald Trump said: It is what it is.   Unemployment benefits and eviction protection?   Not right now.   In May, we also funded the post office, a critical service enshrined  in our Constitution, a lifeline to seniors and veterans, like John, who  called me yesterday from my hometown who had to wait an extra week to  get his medication.   It is a pillar of our democracy allowing people to vote safely from  home this fall. We are here today to defend this institution from slow  deliveries and removal of critical mail infrastructure. Twelve mail  sorting machines in my home State have been removed.   When Mr. DeJoy was asked about this, he said: They are not needed.  [[Page H4288]]    Donald Trump said he didn't want those ridiculous ballots delivered.   We will not stand by while the Postal Service is dismantled and good  jobs are lost. We will fight so that every vote is counted.   Vote ``yes'' for the Postal Service. Vote ``yes'' for the people.  Vote ``yes'' for democracy.
