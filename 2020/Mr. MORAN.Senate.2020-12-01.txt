 Mr. President, today I want to take a few minutes to  recognize MAJ Mark Bedrin for his exemplary dedication to duty and  service as an Army congressional fellow and congressional budget  liaison for the Assistant Secretary of the Army, Financial Management  and Comptroller. Major Bedrin is transitioning from his present  assignment to continue his service to our country as an Army officer.   The cornerstone of Mark's success as an officer is his family. He is  a dedicated husband to his wife Katie and a devoted father to his  children: daughter Elizabeth and son Patrick. They provide the  foundation for Mark's service, and they are his off-time partners in  travel, canoeing, fishing, and exploring the great outdoors.   A native of Kirkwood, NY, Major Bedrin graduated from Pennsylvania  State University in 2009, with a bachelor of arts in history, and  commissioned into the Infantry branch, where he served as a platoon  leader and company commander. Other notable previous assignments  include platoon leader, Attack Company, 1-32 IN, 3rd BCT, 10th Mountain  Division at Fort Drum, NY, and Afghanistan; assistant operations  officer, rifle troop commander, and headquarters and headquarters troop  commander, 1st Squadron, 2d Cavalry Regiment, U.S. Army Europe, in  Germany, Afghanistan, and Egypt. His operational deployments include  two combat tours in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in  Afghanistan and one peacekeeping tour supporting the Multinational  Force and Observers, MFO, in Egypt.   Following a successful command tour, Mark applied to and was selected  for the highly competitive U.S. Army Congressional Fellowship Program.  This program enables outstanding military officers and DOD civilians to  bring their talents to the hill and to work in a Member's office as a  congressional defense fellow to learn firsthand how Congress operates.  It also provides an opportunity for the fellow to earn a master's  degree in legislative affairs at George Washington University, GWU.   Mark joined my office as an Army congressional fellow in January  2017, and we had the great benefit of his service on Team Moran for a  year before he departed for the Pentagon in January 2018 for a  utilization tour as a congressional budget liaison with the Assistant  Secretary of the Army, Financial Management and Comptroller.   Mark has worked tirelessly with Members of Congress and congressional  staff to accurately articulate and to timely provide the Army's budget  positions to the Appropriations Committees and to answer questions  related to Army programs and priorities for Members of Congress and  congressional staff. His dedication, professionalism, and commitment to  the Army are unmatched, and his work both as a fellow and as a liaison  successfully represented the U.S. Army and the Department of Defense to  the U.S. Congress.   Throughout his career, Major Bedrin has positively impacted soldiers,  peers, and superiors. Our country has benefited tremendously from his  extraordinary leadership, judgment, and passion. I join my colleagues  today in honoring his dedication to our nation and invaluable service  to the U.S. Congress.   It has been a genuine pleasure to have worked with Major Mark Bedrin  over the last 3 years. On behalf of a grateful nation, I join my  colleagues today in recognizing and commending Mark for his service to  our country, and we wish Mark and his family all the very best in their  future endeavors.                            ____________________     Mr. President, Mike Heldstab joined my staff in June of  2014. Serving as my State military liaison, he assisted well over a  thousand Kansas veterans and Active servicemembers during his 6\1/2\  years on my staff. Mike would often travel the State in my stead,  between communities in south central Kansas and our military  installations--namely, Fort Riley and his hometown of Junction City.   Mike is a tireless advocate for servicemembers and veterans. He is  well known in the Kansas military and veterans communities as a trusted  resource who produces results. Most notably, Mike advocated for a  policy change in the VA's Specially Adapted Housing Program after  working with the family of a disabled Army veteran to adapt their home.  His efforts resulted in new legislation that was signed into law on  August 8, 2020, that expanded this critical grant program so disabled  veterans can adapt their homes to fit their disability. I am confident  that Mike's selfless approach to service will continue in every aspect  of his life.   In addition to his work assisting veterans and military  servicemembers, Mike was involved in Wichita-area volunteer  organizations and strived to be a community leader. Mike has a passion  for economic development that I am certain will serve him well in his  next chapters in life. I commend his efforts to make Kansas and Wichita  a better place.   Mike's highlights from his years on staff include being able to  travel and meet with Senator Bob Dole between 2014 and 2015 when  Kansas's Favorite Son was touring all 105 counties. He also cherished  his opportunities to interact with our military, which provided him the  chance to fly in Air Force tankers out of McConnell Air Force Base and  playing wheelchair basketball with wounded warriors.   While Mike is leaving our staff, I know I will see him many more  times in the years ahead as a friend and trusted adviser. Thank you,  Mike, for your many years of service to the citizens of Kansas, and I  wish you all the best as you start this new chapter of your career.                            ____________________
