 Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Tax Cuts and  Jobs Act. We know the world has changed a whole lot in the last 30  years--the way we travel, how we communicate, the way we work, our  hairstyles, the clothes we wear, the movies we watch, the music we  listen to--but one thing hasn't changed: Our outdated Tax Code hasn't  kept up. We simply can't afford to wait any longer. Now is the time to  act.   Hoosiers need a raise. Working families across America need a raise.  American businesses need to remain competitive in what is an  increasingly global and hypercompetitive economy.   The bill we are voting on today will provide real relief to all  Americans, especially middle-class families and those of modest means.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will creates a Tax Code that is simpler, that  is fairer, and that allows Hoosiers to keep more of their hard-earned  money, and that is what they want.   This bill we are voting on today will help create an environment  where jobs and businesses can grow by making permanent a corporate tax  reduction to 21 percent. We have the highest corporate tax rate in the  industrialized world. That is no way to remain competitive.   We will lighten the burden on small businesses with this legislation.  I come from a small business family. My dad worked 6, 7 days a week  growing up. He sold HVAC equipment and spent a lot of time on the road.  I know because he told me that it irked him that when he added up his  profits, he discovered toward the end of the year that over half of  what he earned he paid to various forms of government. We provide  relief to businesses like that.   We shift the structure of the international tax system so that  foreign profits from U.S.-based companies will be invested right here  in American communities, not overseas.   Throughout this process, I have listened carefully to extensive  feedback from the people of Indiana, and I have to say that I am  grateful for all the Hoosiers who weighed in over the course of this  effort. They helped me shape this work product in a way that will more  benefit the people of Indiana today and for future generations.   I heard, for example, from Susan from Indianapolis. Susan said:         Our tax system has become so complicated--the average       person needs to hire someone with expertise to help. If most       of us didn't have to hire help--right there we'd be saving       money.    Susan, you are right, and that is why we have lightened the burden  for millions of Americans with this proposal.   Under this act that we will be voting on this evening, 9 out of 10  Americans can take the standard deduction. We have doubled the standard  deduction, vastly simplifying compliance with a convoluted, unfair Tax  Code that picks winners and losers. We undo so much of that with this  bill we will vote on this evening.   I heard from Debbie from Clark County. Debbie contacted my office  about her business's challenges. Debbie said the following:         We are constantly striving to reinvest in our company       through new equipment and increased wages to hire and retain       good employees. A lower corporate tax rate will allow us to       buy more equipment and offer . . . better wages.    It is common sense, and I am glad that Debbie contacted me to  reinforce what is on the mind of so many Hoosier business owners.   This bill continues and expands the support for Indiana's highest  priorities, and that is why I will be supporting it. Among these  priorities are deductions for contributions to benefit our charitable  organizations essential to communities throughout Indiana and  throughout our country and keeping tuition waivers for graduate  students untaxed. I again thank the graduate students and all the  stakeholders throughout Indiana who had concerns related to this issue.  They weighed in. We made changes to the legislation to accommodate  their concerns, and this will enable Hoosiers to be better equipped to  thrive in this ever-changing global economy in which we live.   We managed to maintain the earned income tax credit so that work pays  more than joblessness. We expanded the child tax credit for families  trying to make ends meet. We protected the adoption tax credit so that  caring adults can become loving parents. We preserved private activity  bonds. These benefit low-income housing and help to build hospitals and  schools and other essential programs in the communities that need them  most.   Now, the bill also makes good on our promise to repeal what many  regard as the most oppressive aspect of ObamaCare--the individual  mandate tax. I promised Hoosiers for years and years that I would get  rid of the individual mandate. Tonight we will be fulfilling that  promise.   In Indiana nearly 140,000 Hoosiers chose to pay this tax instead of  buying insurance they either don't want or can't afford. In my home  State, 81 percent of those who paid this tax made less than $50,000 per  year. This comes from the IRS. And 40 percent of the people who pay  this tax make less than $25,000 a year. Tell me this isn't a tax on the  working poor.   This bill lifts the burden for families in Indiana and across the  country, and it is one of the many reasons that I will be proudly  supporting it. Collectively, this is a no-brainer. This legislation  will lead to an increase in capital investment, which will lead to an  increase in economic growth. This bill will make workers more  productive so that they earn higher wages. This bill, across every  income category, will cause Americans to see a reduction in their tax  rates and more take-home pay--more of their hard-earned money in their  pockets. So many Americans haven't seen an increase in take-home pay in  well over a decade. It is time to provide relief to hard-working  American families. It is time to create certainty for our job creators  so that they can create more jobs.   I look forward to helping to move this legislation across the finish  line this evening. I hope we get some bipartisan support in that  effort.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I want to offer a few brief comments on  the confirmation of Ms. Jennifer Newstead and the situation in Yemen.  Ms. Newstead was nominated to serve as the legal adviser of the  Department of State.   This is an incredibly important position. The legal adviser is the  principal adviser to the Department of State on all legal matters,  domestic and international. The legal adviser is also the principal  adviser to other Federal agencies on legal matters involved in foreign  relations. Through the Secretary of State, the legal advisor advises  the President and the National Security Council. For an individual to  serve well in this position, they must understand the law and be  willing to provide objective and reliable legal advice.   I believe Ms. Newstead is well qualified to serve in this position.  She has an impressive educational background, and she has served in  senior positions at OMB, the Department of Justice, and in the White  House. That is why I supported her nomination in committee.   With that said, before she received a floor vote, I wanted to confirm  that she had a full and accurate appreciation for U.S. law as it  relates to impediments to humanitarian assistance, and the clear  application of those statutes to Saudi Arabia and Yemen. That is why,  over several weeks, I engaged in three rounds of specific written  questions and answers with Ms. Newstead related to the law.   After those detailed exchanges, I am confident that Ms. Newstead  understands the proper application of laws like 22 U.S. Code 2378-1 to  Saudi Arabia and Yemen.   I appreciate her written statements to me regarding that and other  statutes, and I appreciate her commitments to be as transparent and  responsive to my office as possible.   Before I conclude, allow me to offer a few words on the situation in  Yemen. Yemen is experiencing the world's largest food insecurity  crisis. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  published a report earlier this month. The report found that  [[Page S8145]]  almost 18 million people in Yemen are food insecure with more than 8  million facing starvation.   The war and Saudi Arabia's impediments to the delivery of food, fuel,  and medicine are the primary causes for this crisis. Saudi Arabia's  impediments to humanitarian assistance in Yemen violate international  law, humanitarian principles, and U.S. law. They also undermine U.S.  national security interests.   Since March, I have taken a number of steps to demand an end to the  Saudi impediments to humanitarian assistance and to encourage the  administration to use its significant leverage with Riyadh.   On December 6, the President said, ``I have directed officials in my  Administration to call the leadership of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to  request that they completely allow food, fuel, water, and medicine to  reach the Yemeni people who desperately need it. This must be done for  humanitarian reasons immediately.''   In my view, we now need to see action from the Saudis, not just  assurances.   The Saudis must finally and completely end all impediments to the  delivery and transport of humanitarian aid in Yemen. Each day costs  many lives and patience is running out in Washington.   If Saudi Arabia continues to be unresponsive to the President's  demands and demands from Congress, failing to permit the delivery of  the U.S. taxpayer funded cranes to Yemen's most important humanitarian  port and continuing to block the delivery of commercial fuel shipments,  I stand ready to take legislative action.   I was proud to support Ms. Newstead's confirmation today, and I look  forward to working closely with her.   Thank you.                            ____________________
