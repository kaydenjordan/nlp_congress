 Madam President, first, I extend the Senate's  condolences to the people of Lebanon following yesterday's horrific  explosion in Beirut. Reports indicate that at least 100 have died and  that more than 4,000 others were injured.   The Lebanese people have seen more than their share of tragedy--civil  war, Syrian occupation, terrorism and assassination, sectarian  violence, economic and political corruption, the burden of caring for  more than a million refugees fleeing Syria.   Now, unfortunately, once again, in the wake of great tragedy, the  Lebanese Armed Forces will have to demonstrate they serve the state of  Lebanon and its people, not a political party or sect. Since the end of  Syrian occupation, the LAF has demonstrated it can be a unifying and  national force, largely free from sectarianism that corrodes other  Lebanese institutions. Now it must do so again   The people of Beirut are beginning the hard work of rebuilding their  city. Their nation continues its hard work to restore its democracy and  sovereignty. On these fronts, the Senate  [[Page S4884]]  and the American people stand with them in their journey.                            ____________________     Madam President, on an entirely different matter, stop  me if the story I am about to tell sounds familiar.   The Speaker of the House and the Democratic leader summon President  Trump's representatives to the Capitol. They meet for a long while. The  Democrats emerge, saying they have permitted a few millimeters of  progress, but a deal is still far off, leaving millions of Americans in  the lurch. Then they continue to push their $3 trillion wish list that  even their own Democratic colleagues brush off as absurd. We have had  variations on this theme daily for more than a week now.   Yesterday, the Speaker of the House called their far-left proposal a  ``well-developed strategic plan,'' but even Members of her own caucus  know that is not true.   Back when the Speaker's wish list was rammed through the House, one  Democratic Member came right out and said that the so-called Heroes Act  ``isn't a plan. It's a wish list.''   Another said that Members of her caucus had taken the bill as ``an  opportunity to make political statements . . . that goes far beyond  pandemic relief and has no chance at becoming law.''   Others said it was ``not focused'' and ``partisan gamesmanship.''   These are Democrats I am quoting.   Even the Speaker's own rank and file know it is comical to say your  ``strategic plan'' for COVID-19 involves sending taxpayer checks to  people who are here illegally, paying people more not to work than  essential workers earn by working, soil health programs--so-called  ``environmental justice'' grants--and a massive tax cut aimed directly  at wealthy people in New York and California.   That last point needs special attention.   Now, in ordinary negotiations, Members of Congress like to bring  things home for their core supporters, but it is a little too on the  nose for the Speaker from San Francisco and the Democratic leader from  New York City to be holding up $1 trillion in emergency aid for the  entire country unless they get big tax breaks for millionaires in their  hometowns.   Economists across the political spectrum say this demand of theirs is  a bad idea because 94 percent of the benefit would flow to people who  make north of $200,000.   In the words of one progressive economist, who ought to be on their  side:         This is not a good idea. . . . It would not help the       economy heal and would not benefit the people who need help.    Yet my friends in the Democratic leadership are not deterred. More  than a week into these talks, they are still threatening to block any  and all relief for struggling people unless big city penthouses get  these tax cuts. The Democratic leader said just yesterday that he is  still holding out for this.   Now, this isn't the only bad policy they are hung up on. The Speaker  and the Democratic leader continue to insist that Federal unemployment  assistance should pay people more not to work than the essential  workers who have kept working. Let me say that again. The Democratic  position has been that these millions of laid-off people should get  nothing unless they get a higher salary than the people who are still  working. This isn't just bad economics if you are trying to reopen a  country; it is also just simply unfair in the simplest terms.   The Republicans want to keep providing some supplemental Federal  unemployment. We just don't think it is remotely fair for the Federal  Government to tax essential workers who have kept working every day so  Uncle Sam can pay their neighbors a higher salary to stay home. Let me  say that again. We just don't think it is remotely fair for the Federal  Government to tax essential workers who have kept working every day so  Uncle Sam can pay their neighbors a higher salary to stay home.   Outside of the Democratic leader and the Speaker of the House, even  Democrats concede it is a bit upside down to pay people more not to  work.   Last week, the House Democratic majority leader said: ``It's not $600  or bust.''   Our colleague, the senior Senator from Maryland, has said: ``We  certainly understand we don't want to have higher benefits than what  someone can make working.''   Just yesterday, the senior Senator from West Virginia stated plainly  that Speaker Pelosi's position was untenable. ``I don't think we're  going to stay at the $600.''   Let's bear in mind, even $200 would be eight times what the Democrats  put in place with unified control of the government during the last  crisis in 2009. It is unthinkable they will hold every bit of relief  hostage unless we land back at $600 and pay workers a bonus if they do  not help to reopen our country. Maybe the Speaker and the Democratic  leader will get the memo from their colleagues sometime soon.   Then there is the Democrats' demand for $1 trillion more to hand out  to State and local governments even though they have only spent a  fourth of the money we sent them back in March.   Yesterday, I received an urgent letter from the city of Malibu, CA-- and I promise I am not making this up--asking Congress for hundreds of  billions of dollars for State and local governments because it has had  to delay its ``conversion to an all-electric city fleet.''   I guess that is an emergency in Malibu when they can't keep buying  brandnew electric cars as quickly as they would like. Well, this  emergency is hitting most of America very differently.   My constituents in Kentucky have bigger problems. They need actual  relief to go straight to struggling families, and, frankly, they needed  it yesterday, not a $1 trillion slush fund for bureaucrats who haven't  spent what we sent them back in March.   Those are just some of the fantasy items that are in the Democrats'  demands. I haven't even gotten to all of the important things they left  out. Their bill costs three times as much as the Senate Republicans'  HEALS Act, but they skip over major, serious things that we took care  of.   The Democrats proposed fewer resources than the Republicans for the  fund to help schools reopen safely. The Democrats completely  shortchanged the successful Collins-Rubio Paycheck Protection Program,  wherein our bill would fund a whole second round. The Democrats have no  real equivalent to our proposals to strengthen domestic supply chains  for PPE and critical resources, and they propose no legal protections  at all for the doctors and nurses who have fought this unknown enemy or  for the schools, universities, churches, and businesses that are trying  to reopen. Apparently, those soil health experiments and diversity  initiatives didn't leave enough room for the critical policies that  would actually help the country.   But, remember, our Democratic colleagues told us from the beginning  their goal was never a targeted plan for COVID-19.   In March, one of the Speaker's top lieutenants said the Democrats  should view this deadly disease and mass unemployment as a ``tremendous  opportunity to restructure things to fit our vision.'' Speaker Pelosi  herself called this crisis a ``wonderful opportunity.'' It is clear  they view it that way because, while Americans are struggling, the  Democratic leaders have moved about 1 inch in 8 days.   For the sake of the millions and millions who need more help, let's  hope they decide to get serious soon.                            ____________________     Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
