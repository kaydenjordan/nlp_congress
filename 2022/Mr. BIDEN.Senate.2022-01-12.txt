 Mr. President, my friends and colleagues, I have       not been here as long as Senator Byrd, and no one fully       understands the Senate as well as Senator Byrd, but I have       been here for over three decades. This is the single most       significant vote any one of  [[Page S178]]       us will cast in my 32 years in the Senate. I suspect the       Senator would agree with that.        We should make no mistake. This nuclear option is       ultimately an example of the arrogance of power. It is a       fundamental power grab by the majority party, propelled by       its extreme right and designed to change the reading of the       Constitution, particularly as it relates to individual rights       and property rights. It is nothing more or nothing less. Let       me take a few moments to explain that.        Folks who want to see this change want to eliminate one of       the procedural mechanisms designed for the express purpose of       guaranteeing individual rights, and they also have a       consequence, and would undermine the protections of a       minority point of view in the heat of majority excess. We       have been through these periods before in American history       but never, to the best of my knowledge, has any party been so       bold as to fundamentally attempt to change the structure of       this body.        Why else would the majority party attempt one of the most       fundamental changes in the 216-year history of this Senate on       the grounds that they are being denied ten of 218 Federal       judges, three of whom have stepped down? What       shortsightedness, and what a price history will exact on       those who support this radical move.        It is important we state frankly, if for no other reason       than the historical record, why this is being done. The       extreme right of the Republican Party is attempting to hijack       the Federal courts by emasculating the courts' independence       and changing one of the unique foundations of the Senate;       that is, the requirement for the protection of the right of       individual Senators to guarantee the independence of the       Federal Judiciary.        This is being done in the name of fairness? Quite frankly,       it is the ultimate act of unfairness to alter the unique       responsibility of the Senate and to do so by breaking the       very rules of the Senate.        Mark my words, what is at stake here is not the politics of       2005, but the Federal Judiciary in the country in the year       2025. This is the single most significant vote, as I said       earlier, that I will have cast in my 32 years in the Senate.       The extreme Republican right has made Federal appellate Judge       Douglas Ginsburg's ``Constitution in Exile'' framework their       top priority.        It is their purpose to reshape the Federal courts so as to       guarantee a reading of the Constitution consistent with Judge       Ginsburg's radical views of the fifth amendment's taking       clause, the nondelegation doctrine, the 11th amendment, and       the 10th amendment. I suspect some listening to me and some       of the press will think I am exaggerating. I respectfully       suggest they read Judge Ginsburg's ideas about the       ``Constitution in Exile.'' Read it and understand what is at       work here.        If anyone doubts what I am saying, I suggest you ask       yourself the rhetorical question, Why, for the first time       since 1789, is the Republican-controlled Senate attempting to       change the rule of unlimited debate, eliminate it, as it       relates to Federal judges for the circuit court or the       Supreme Court?        If you doubt what I said, please read what Judge Ginsburg       has written and listen to what Michael Greve of the American       Enterprise Institute has said:        I think what is really needed here is a fundamental       intellectual assault on the entire New Deal edifice. We want       to withdraw judicial support for the entire modern welfare       state.        Read: Social Security, workmen's comp. Read: National Labor       Relations Board. Read: FDA. Read: What all the byproduct of       that shift in constitutional philosophy that took place in       the 1930s meant.        We are going to hear more about what I characterize as       radical view--maybe it is unfair to say radical--a       fundamental view and what, at the least, must be       characterized as a stark departure from current       constitutional jurisprudence. Click on to American Enterprise       Institute Web site www.aei.org. Read what they say. Read what       the purpose is. It is not about seeking a conservative court       or placing conservative Justices on the bench. The courts are       already conservative.        Seven of the nine Supreme Court Justices appointed by       Republican Presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan, and Bush 1--seven       of nine. Ten of 13 Federal circuit courts of appeal dominated       by Republican appointees, appointed by Presidents Nixon,       Ford, Reagan, Bush 1, and Bush 2; 58 percent of the circuit       court judges appointed by Presidents Nixon, Ford, Reagan,       Bush 1, or Bush 2. No, my friends and colleagues, this is not       about building a conservative court. We already have a       conservative court. This is about guaranteeing a Supreme       Court made up of men and women such as those who sat on the       Court in 1910 and 1920. Those who believe, as Justice Janice       Rogers Brown of California does, that the Constitution has       been in exile since the New Deal.        My friends and colleagues, the nuclear option is not an       isolated instance. It is part of a broader plan to pack the       court with fundamentalist judges and to cower existing       conservative judges to toe the extreme party line.        You all heard what Tom DeLay said after the Federal courts       refused to bend to the whip of the radical right in the       Schiavo case. Mr. DeLay declared: ``The time will come for       men responsible for this to answer for their behavior.''        Even current conservative Supreme Court Justices are       looking over their shoulder, with one extremist recalling the       despicable slogan of Joseph Stalin--and I am not making this       up--in reference to a Reagan Republican appointee, Justice       Kennedy, when he said: ``No man, no problem''--absent his       presence, we have no problem.        Let me remind you, as I said, Justice Kennedy was appointed       by President Reagan.        Have they never heard of the independence of the       judiciary--as fundamental a part of our constitutional system       of checks and balances as there is today; which is literally       the envy of the entire world, and the fear of the extremist       part of the world? An independent judiciary is their greatest       fear.        Why are radicals focusing on the court? Well, first of all,       it is their time to be in absolute political control. It is       like, why did Willy Sutton rob banks? He said: Because that       is where the money is. Why try it now--for the first time in       history--to eliminate extended debate? Well, because they       control every lever of the Federal Government. That is the       very reason why we have the filibuster rule. So when one       party, when one interest controls all levers of Government,       one man or one woman can stand on the floor of the Senate and       resist, if need be, the passions of the moment.        But there is a second reason why they are focusing on the       courts. That is because they have been unable to get their       agenda passed through the legislative bodies. Think about it.       With all the talk about how they represent the majority of       the American people, none of their agenda has passed as it       relates to the fifth amendment, as it relates to zoning laws,       as it relates to the ability of Federal agencies, such as the       Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental Protection       Agency, to do their jobs.        Read what they write when they write about the       nondelegation doctrine. That simply means, we in the       Congress, as they read the Constitution, cannot delegate to       the Environmental Protection Agency the authority to set       limits on how much of a percentage of carcinogens can be       admitted into the air or admitted into the water. They insist       that we, the Senate, have to vote on every one of those       rules, that we, the Senate and the House, with the ability of       the President to veto, would have to vote on any and all       drugs that are approved or not approved.        If you think I am exaggerating, look at these Web sites.       These are not a bunch of wackos. These are a bunch of very       bright, very smart, very well-educated intellectuals who see       these Federal restraints as a restraint upon competition, a       restraint upon growth, a restraint upon the powerful.        The American people see what is going on. They are too       smart, and they are too practical. They might not know the       meaning of the nondelegation doctrine, they might not know       the clause of the fifth amendment relating to property, they       may not know the meaning of the tenth and eleventh amendments       as interpreted by Judge Ginsburg and others, but they know       that the strength of our country lies in common sense and our       common pragmatism, which is antithetical to the poisons of       the extremes on either side.        The American people will soon learn that Justice Janice       Rogers Brown--one of the nominees who we are not allowing to       be confirmed, one of the ostensible reasons for this nuclear       option being employed--has decried the Supreme Court's       ``socialist revolution of 1937.'' Read Social Security. Read       what they write and listen to what they say. The very year       that a 5-to-4 Court upheld the constitutionality of Social       Security against a strong challenge--1937--Social Security       almost failed by one vote.        It was challenged in the Supreme Court as being       confiscatory. People argued then that a Government has no       right to demand that everyone pay into the system, no right       to demand that every employer pay into the system. Some of       you may agree with that. It is a legitimate argument, but one       rejected by the Supreme Court in 1937, that Justice Brown       refers to as the ``socialist revolution of 1937.''        If it had not been for some of the things they had already       done, nobody would believe what I am saying here. These guys       mean what they say. The American people are going to soon       learn that one of the leaders of the constitutional exile       school, the group that wants to reinstate the Constitution as       it existed in 1920, said of another filibustered judge,       William Pryor that ``Pryor is the key to this puzzle. There's       nobody like him. I think he's sensational. He gets almost all       of it.''        That is the reason why I oppose him. He gets all of it. And       you are about to get all of it if they prevail. We will not       have to debate about Social Security on this floor.        So the radical right makes its power play now when they       control all political centers of power, however temporary.       The radical push through the nuclear option and then pack the       courts with unimpeded judges who, by current estimations,       will serve an average of 25 years. The right is focused on       packing the courts because their agenda is so radical that       they are unwilling to come directly to you, the American       people, and tell you what they intend.        Without the filibuster, President Bush will send over more       and more judges of this nature, with perhaps three or four       Supreme Court nominations. And there will be nothing--      nothing--that any moderate Republican friends and I will be       able to do about it.        Judges who will influence the rights of average Americans:       The ability to sue your HMO that denies you your rights; the       ability to keep strip clubs out of your neighborhood--because       they make zoning laws unconstitutional--without you paying to       keep the  [[Page S179]]       person from building; the ability to protect the land your       kids play on, the water they drink, the air they breathe, and       the privacy of your family in your own home.        Remember, many of my colleagues say there is no such thing       as a right to privacy in any iteration under the Constitution       of the United States of America. Fortunately, we have had a       majority of judges who disagreed with that over the past 70       years. But hang on, folks. The fight over judges, at bottom,       is not about abortion and not about God, it is about giving       greater power to the already powerful. The fight is about       maintaining our civil rights protections, about workplace       safety and worker protections, about effective oversight of       financial markets, and protecting against insider trading. It       is about Social Security. What is really at stake in this       debate is, point blank, the shape of our constitutional       system for the next generation.        The nuclear option is a twofer. It excises, friends, our       courts and, at the same time, emasculates the Senate. Put       simply, the nuclear option would transform the Senate from       the so-called cooling saucer our Founding Fathers talked       about to cool the passions of the day to a pure majoritarian       body like a Parliament. We have heard a lot in recent weeks       about the rights of the majority and obstructionism. But the       Senate is not meant to be a place of pure majoritarianism.        Is majority rule what you really want? Do my Republican       colleagues really want majority rule in this Senate? Let me       remind you, 44 of us Democrats represent 161 million people.       One hundred sixty-one million Americans voted for these 44       Democrats. Do you know how many Americans voted for the 55 of       you? One hundred thirty-one million. If this were about pure       majorities, my party represents more people in America than       the Republican Party does. But that is not what it is about.       Wyoming, the home State of the Vice President, the President       of this body, gets one Senator for every 246,000 citizens;       California, gets one Senator for 17 million Americans. More       Americans voted for Vice President Gore than they did       Governor Bush. By majoritarian logic, Vice President Gore won       the election.        Republicans control the Senate, and they have decided they       are going to change the rule. At its core, the filibuster is       not about stopping a nominee or a bill, it is about       compromise and moderation. That is why the Founders put       unlimited debate in. When you have to--and I have never       conducted a filibuster--but if I did, the purpose would be       that you have to deal with me as one Senator. It does not       mean I get my way. It means you may have to compromise. You       may have to see my side of the argument. That is what it is       about, engendering compromise and moderation.        Ladies and gentlemen, the nuclear option extinguishes the       power of Independents and moderates in this Senate. That is       it. They are done. Moderates are important only if you need       to get 60 votes to satisfy cloture. They are much less       important if you need only 50 votes. I understand the       frustration of our Republican colleagues. I have been here 32       years, most of the time in the majority. Whenever you are in       the majority, it is frustrating to see the other side block a       bill or a nominee you support. I have walked in your shoes,       and I get it.        I get it so much that what brought me to the Senate was the       fight for civil rights. My State, to its great shame, was       segregated by law, was a slave State. I came here to fight       it. But even I understood, with all the passion I felt as a       29-year-old kid running for the Senate, the purpose--the       purpose--of extended debate. Getting rid of the filibuster       has long-term consequences. If there is one thing I have       learned in my years here, once you change the rules and       surrender the Senate's institutional power, you never get it       back. And we are about to break the rules to change the       rules.        I do not want to hear about ``fair play'' from my friends.       Under our rules, you are required to get \2/3\ of the votes       to change the rules. Watch what happens when the majority       leader stands up and says to the Vice President--if we go       forward with this--he calls the question. One of us, I expect       our leader, on the Democratic side will stand up and say:       Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. Is this parliamentarily       appropriate? In every other case since I have been here, for       32 years, the Presiding Officer leans down to the       Parliamentarian and says: What is the rule, Mr.       Parliamentarian? The Parliamentarian turns and tells them.        Hold your breath, Parliamentarian. He is not going to look       to you because he knows what you would say. He would say:       This is not parliamentarily appropriate. You cannot change       the Senate rules by a pure majority vote.        So if any of you think I am exaggerating, watch on       television, watch when this happens, and watch the Vice       President ignore--he is not required to look to an unelected       officer, but that has been the practice for 218 years. He       will not look down and say: What is the ruling? He will make       the ruling, which is a lie, a lie about the rule.        Isn't what is really going on here that the majority does       not want to hear what others have to say, even if it is the       truth? Senator Moynihan, my good friend who I served with for       years, said: You are entitled to your own opinion but not       your own facts.        The nuclear option abandons America's sense of fair play.       It is the one thing this country stands for: Not tilting the       playing field on the side of those who control and own the       field.        I say to my friends on the Republican side: You may own the       field right now, but you won't own it forever. I pray God       when the Democrats take back control, we don't make the kind       of naked power grab you are doing. But I am afraid you will       teach my new colleagues the wrong lessons.        We are the only Senate in the Senate as temporary       custodians of the Senate. The Senate will go on. Mark my       words, history will judge this Republican majority harshly,       if it makes this catastrophic move.
