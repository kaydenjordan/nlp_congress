 Mr. Speaker, today is a big day in the  Fifth Congressional District of Pennsylvania, specifically, in  Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, as our most famous resident had his day in  the sun, literally.   Early this morning, Punxsutawney Phil, our weather-expert groundhog  saw his shadow. For those of you who know the old German legend, this  means that we are in for six more weeks of winter.   Punxsy Phil has been forecasting the weather since the 1800s. He  drinks a magical punch annually on February 2, which is an elixir of  life that extends his life by 7 years.   Crowds gathered on Gobbler's Knob before sunrise today for the 131st  celebration. While there are many wannabes, accept no substitution for  the original prognosticator.   The crowd chanted Phil's name repeatedly to awaken him, and then  Phil, known in his hometown as the Seer of Seers, came to deliver the  news. Records going back to 1887 show that Phil has forecasted a longer  winter 103 times and an early spring just 18 times.   Today in Punxsutawney it was a balmy 30 degrees, so don't pack up  your winter gear just yet. Phil says we have six more weeks.   Happy Groundhog Day.                            ____________________
