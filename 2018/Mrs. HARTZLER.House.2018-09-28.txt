 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the House passage  of the FAA reauthorization bill, and I am delighted that the conference  agreement includes provisions from my bill, the Safeguarding America's  Skies Act. These provisions provide the Departments of Homeland  Security and Justice with the authority to use counterdrone technology  to detect, monitor, and interdict drones that pose a threat to the  safety and security of our country.   We must face the reality that drone technology is being exploited to  advance crime and threaten our national security. Drones are used to  smuggle illegal drugs across borders and contraband into prisons. On  the other side of the globe, terrorist groups are using drones to  target U.S. forces and coalition partners.   Unfortunately, under current law, most Federal agencies are  prohibited from engaging with drones due to various outdated laws. This  legislation will provide our Federal law enforcement agencies with the  tools necessary to protect U.S. citizens from criminal and nefarious  acts. Our skies will be safer and our families will be safer.                            ____________________
