 Mr. Speaker, for years we have been hearing what we are  hearing today: Look, we just want the same rights everybody else has.  But we also heard for years: We just want to live and let live.   I have got news for all of my friends across the aisle that don't  know. There is a right to the marriage you are claiming you need this  bill for that the Supreme Court has already said you have. It is there.   So what this bill, the so-called Equality Act, is really about, it is  not about giving rights. This is about taking away rights. You have the  rights. But this is saying that part of the First Amendment, ``Congress  shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or  prohibiting the free exercise thereof,'' that has to go.                                time  1415    And just like my friend read from page 25, the Religious Freedom  Restoration Act of 1993, that has got to go. You can no longer--after  this bill, you can no longer use that as a defense when we sue your  church, we sue your preacher. Male or female, it doesn't matter. We are  coming after you. If we sue a Rabbi, you can't hide behind the First  Amendment or this Religious Freedom Restoration Act.   It won't help you because we are saying you don't have those rights  the Constitution gave you. That is all RFRA was to begin with. It was  just codifying what was in the Constitution.   I thought so much about my dear friend, the late Bishop Harry  Jackson. He and I had stood inside this Capitol together for years  trying to protect Christian rights. I miss Harry and I think about him  a lot.   And let me say, not as articulately, but for heaven's sake, you have  got these rights. Allow people who believe what Moses said when he  said: A man shall leave his father and mother, a woman leave her home,  the two will become one flesh.   Let them be able to practice the teaching of Moses. When Jesus was  asked about marriage, he said--he quoted Moses verbatim. Please allow  Christians who believe what Jesus said to practice that.   Allow preachers who took oaths to practice it. Allow them to do that.  Don't take away the rights the Constitution gave, and don't take away  decades of rights that women have worked for and earned and just give  it away to men.    Mr. Speaker, this package is a massive land-removal  bill. It basically takes 2.7 million acres away from meaningful  production.   The one good thing I can say is, it is consistent with this majority  and this administration's actions that make us more reliant on China  and will enrich China. That is the one good thing; it is at least  consistent.   Now, the majority feels that people in this town know better than the  people who are losing this land for the different uses for which they  could have it. I know we are hearing today on the floor: Oh, we have  all these people who want this bill passed.   It should have gone through committee so we could do the motions, we  could have witnesses, and we could find out for ourselves. After 3  years of the Russia hoax, we really need to hear from the sources.
