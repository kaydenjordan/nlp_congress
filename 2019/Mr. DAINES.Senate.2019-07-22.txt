 Mr. President, today I wish to honor MG Barbara R.  Holcomb for her 32 years of service in our Armed Forces, most notably,  as the first female commanding general at the U.S. Army Medical  Research and Development Command at Fort Detrick and chief of the U.S.  Army Nurse Corps. Major General Holcomb grew up in the small town of  Miles City, MT, and joined the Army Reserve Officer Training Corp,  ROTC, following her first year of nursing school at Seattle University.  She completed her education as a distinguished military graduate with a  bachelor of science in nursing. She continued her exceptional career  with service to our country and continued Montana's proud heritage of  military service and firsts in female leadership.   Major General Holcomb goes above and beyond as a leader and, as such,  was chosen to speak at the 2018 Women in Leadership Summit at the  Aberdeen Proving Ground. She shared her experience in finding balance  as a leader and the importance of a leader getting to know themselves  and their peers. Even though she was not allowed to serve in a  battalion commander position as a cadet in ROTC, she became a commander  as a captain and commanded at every rank thereafter. It is this  commitment to strong leadership and personal growth that has led her to  a long and successful career in the Army and distinguishes her as an  exceptional Montanan.   It is not without good reason that Major General Holcomb has received  many awards, including a Distinguished Service Medal, Bronze Star, and  membership in the Order of Military Medical Merit. Between her focus on  the personal, human aspect of healthcare, her commitment to continued  education, and the selfless passion with which she serves her country,  Major General Holcomb embodies what it means to be an outstanding  leader and individual.   Upon her retirement, the U.S. Army will be losing one of their most  valuable assets; however, the example of leadership that she has set  for so many will leave a lasting impact on the quality of this nation's  Army Nurse Corps and, consequentlv, the quality of care that our  Nation's soldiers will receive. Montana is proud to call her one of our  own.   I would like to recognize Major General Barbara R. Holcomb, her  personal accomplishments, and contributions to this country.                            ____________________
