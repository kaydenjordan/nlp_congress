 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  California (Mr. Rouda), my colleague, for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 3329. This bill would  rename the post office in Montclair, California, as the Paul Eaton Post  Office Building.   The new name would be a tribute to Paul Eaton, who served as  Montclair's mayor for 23 years, making him the longest-serving mayor in  Montclair's history.   As a former mayor myself, I can tell you that that is dedication.  Being mayor means being on the hook for every pothole, every accident,  and every crisis that happens in your city. It is not easy work, but  Mayor Eaton made it look so easy.   He uplifted the lives of every single person that he encountered. He  was a fierce advocate for Montclair residents and a pillar of the  Inland Empire community.   His decades of public service earned him the love, respect, and  admiration of everyone.   Mayor Eaton began his career at Bethany Baptist Church and the  Ontario-Montclair School District. In 1970, he helped found Montclair's  Community Action Committee. There, he earned a reputation as a fierce  advocate for Montclair's residents.   Later, he was appointed to the Montclair Planning Commission, where  he would serve only until he eventually became a member of the  Montclair City Council in 1988. Following Mayor Larry Rhinehart's  sudden departure, Mayor Eaton was unanimously installed into the  position of mayor by his fellow city council members.   His many achievements include construction of a youth center and a  senior center, as well as a state-of-the-art police facility, widening  Central Avenue on the I-10 freeway, making critical improvements to the  Mission Boulevard and Holt corridors, and ensuring future service to  the Montclair Transit Center for the Gold Line light-rail service.   His record of service is truly an example for the next generation.  His family continues to carry on the legacy, as many of them also work  in public service.   Mayor Eaton passed away in July 2018.   He was survived by his wife, Ginger, who became mayor after the  passing of Mayor Eaton. He was also survived by four children, nine  grandchildren, and 14 great-grandchildren. He was loved by everyone.   Let us honor Mayor Eaton and his legacy by passing this bill and  renaming the Montclair Post Office.   California, Mr. Speaker, has 53 Members of Congress, and I am so  proud to have 52 of those members of the California congressional  delegation as cosponsors of this bill, including the distinguished  Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republican minority leader,  Kevin McCarthy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important  bill, and I thank the ranking member, Mr. Gosar, for his assistance in  moving this bill forward.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Newhouse  for organizing this Special Order and for his leadership. I sincerely  hope that this will serve as a call to action for all of us. Like the  gentleman, I was very disappointed that we could not get Savanna's Act  across the 115th Congress and signed into law.   Mr. Speaker, every single person in this country, no matter their  gender or background, deserves to live in safety, and every single  victim deserves justice. But for Native Americans, and especially  Native American women, that has not been the case. Far from it.   There is a long history of violence against Native Americans and  exploitation of Native American women. It is a history that we don't  talk about nearly enough. That is why, last week, I introduced a  bipartisan resolution to support the creation of a new Federal holiday,  Indigenous Peoples' Day, on the day that is now called Columbus Day.   Across the Americas, too many indigenous people are still living with  the legacy of colonialism and the violence that came with it. Taking  one day a year to acknowledge that history and to acknowledge the many  contributions of Native Americans to this great country, is the least  that we can do, but it isn't enough.   As William Faulkner famously said: ``The past is never dead. It's not  even past.''   And the reality is that today, Native American women are being killed  and going missing at an alarming rate. Native American women are 10  times more likely to be killed than the national average, and that is  shameful.   What is worse is that we do not even know how many Native American  women have gone missing. Criminals prey on Native American women  because they know that they can get away with this crime. So Congress  must take action to address this crisis and that is why we are here  today.   In April, the House passed the Violence Against Women Act, which  would give Native American Tribes jurisdiction over crimes of violence  against women. This is a significant step to solving the problem, but  the Senate must act now to pass this critical legislation.   In May, I introduced Savanna's Act to honor Savanna LaFontaine- Greywind, a 22-year old pregnant member of the Spirit Lake Tribe who  was tragically murdered in 2017.   I have worked with a group of Democrats and Republicans from both  Chambers of Congress to make sure that we incorporate input from a wide  range of stakeholders, including law enforcement.                                time  1630    This bipartisan bill would create a new set of guidelines for law  enforcement responding to cases of missing  [[Page H8180]]  and murdered indigenous women, and it would give incentives for law  enforcement to implement those guidelines. It would also improve  information-sharing and access to data so that we have a clearer  picture of the scale of these horrific crimes.   This important legislation builds on a previous version of Savanna's  Act, which already passed the Senate last year. It is awaiting action  in the House Judiciary Committee, and I am confident that it will move  forward soon.   Because of the efforts of Native American women across the country,  we are close to passing Savanna's Act into law, but we cannot afford to  continue waiting. More importantly, Native American women cannot afford  it.
