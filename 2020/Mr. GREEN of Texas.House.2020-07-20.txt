 Mr. Speaker, it is my preeminent privilege to  rise today to pay tribute to a great and noble American, a dear friend,  a Member of this House until his transition. Mr. Speaker, of course I  speak of none other than the Honorable   John Lewis.   I want to recognize and say words about him today, because he took to  heart the words of Gandhi that we should be the change that we seek. He  was the sermon that he preached. He did what he said he would do and  inspired others to do likewise.   It is said that a great person will always rise to the occasion, but  it is also said that the greater person makes the occasion.   Well, when it came to the Edmund Pettus Bridge, not only did he rise  to the occasion by marching across that bridge, he made the occasion by  helping to organize the march that left Brown Chapel and went to that  bridge. Knowing that they were facing the constabulary with clubs, they  marched on. Knowing that they were marching into brutality, they  marched on.   He was a person who understood that the cause of justice will  sometimes require some harm to be suffered, yet he marched on. And for  this reason, the world had an opportunity to see the horrors of  invidious discrimination, and in so seeing, a President, Lyndon  Johnson, was put in a position such that he could pass the Voting  Rights Act. And after the passage of that act, many of us who are in  Congress today are here because he marched across that bridge.   So I would say to you, Mr. Speaker, because of his courage, because  he walked the talk, because he was there for us at the Edmund Pettus  Bridge, and because the Voting Rights Act was passed as a result  thereof, it seems to me that it would be proper, appropriate, and  befitting of this body and all of Congress to now pass the reformation  of the Voting Rights Act so that we can show the world that voting is  still important to all people in this country.   The Honorable John Lewis was there on Bloody Sunday. Why not have the  irony of history allow him to be the spark that will ignite the passage  of this reformation of the Voting Rights Act in the Congress of the  United States of America.   And finally this: I had conversations with him, some of them in jail.  He got me in good trouble. We went to jail in 2006 protesting at the  Sudanese Embassy. We went to jail in 2013 protesting out in the streets  of Washington, D.C., for immigration reform. Yes, it was good trouble,  and I am proud to say I was there in good trouble.   But one of the things we discussed was Jimmie Lee Jackson. We ought  not forget Jimmie Lee Jackson. Jimmie Lee Jackson was the person who  had just lost his life prior to marching across the Edmund Pettus  Bridge. In fact, there are many who would contend that he was the spark  that ignited much of that movement.   So let us move forward together recognizing the Honorable   John  Lewis. But let us not forget C.T. Vivian; let us not forget Hosea  Williams; let us not forget the many nameless, faceless persons who  were there with him on Bloody Sunday.   Let us do this: Let us pass the Voting Rights Act, the reformation  thereof, in his honor.                            ____________________
