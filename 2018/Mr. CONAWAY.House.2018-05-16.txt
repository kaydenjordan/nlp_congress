 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 2.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2, the  Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, more commonly known as the farm  bill. I do so, proudly, because I still believe that rural America and  our farm and ranch familles are the backbone of this country.   Our farmers and ranchers ensure that Americans across this great  country pay the lowest grocery bills in the world. They also hand us a  rare trade surplus, while creating 21 million American jobs.   In the heartland, agriculture is the lifeblood of the economy. When  agriculture does well, Main Street does well; and when agriculture is  suffering, so is Main Street.   But beyond the economic contributions, rural America and our Nation's  farmers and ranchers are imbued with the values that I cherish deeply:  the values of faith, family, God, country, and duty; of neighbor  helping neighbor, hard work, and personal responsibility.   In short, Mr. Chairman, rural America and our Nation's farmers and  ranchers make America great. I expect that is why the President of the  United States strongly supports this farm bill and urges passage.   Times are not good right now in the heartland. Our Nation's farmers  and ranchers are struggling in the midst of a 5-year recession, with no  end in sight. Net farm income has been cut in half over this period of  time. As a result, rural America is not partaking in the economic  recovery that urban counterparts are experiencing.   There are many reasons behind the hard times in farm and ranch  country. I will briefly discuss two.   In my hometown of Midland, Texas, we have received 1 inch of rain  over the last 195 days. Drought is ravaging my State. Last year, we saw  record losses due to hurricanes and wildfires. And to the north, in the  ranking member's home State, farmers are struggling to get into the  fields to plant, although it is the middle of May. The fact is the men  and women who clothe and feed us in a manner that is absolutely  unrivaled in world history are the ones hit hardest and first by Mother  Nature.   A second reason for the current condition is another factor totally  beyond the control of our farm and ranch families: the predatory trade  practices of foreign countries. For the sake of brevity, I will offer  just one example.   In just 1 year, China oversubsidized just three crops by more than $1  billion. To put that in perspective, the entire safety net for all of  our farmers and ranchers under this farm bill is expected to cost just  64 percent of the amount China spent on illegal subsidies in just 1  year on just three crops.   Mr. Chairman, the global market is awash with high and rising foreign  subsidies, tariffs, and nontariff trade barriers, and these are hurting  American farmers and ranchers.   So what do we do about that? We heed the call of the President of the  United States and the Secretary of Agriculture to pass this farm bill.   No, this farm bill is not a cure for all that ails rural America and  our farmers and ranchers, but this farm bill does provide a safety net  to see them through the hard times.   For my colleagues interested in the budgetary impacts of this farm  bill, H.R. 2 keeps faith with taxpayers, with CBO now projecting more  than $112 billion in savings, nearly five times what was pledged back  in 2014.    There are many other aspects of this farm bill, but I will just  briefly touch on three.   First, Secretary Perdue has shown great leadership on two particular  issues that are extremely important to rural America: the opioid  epidemic that is ravaging rural America needs an aggressive, effective  response, and the lack of broadband in many parts of rural America puts  farmers and ranchers in rural communities at a terrible disadvantage.  The Secretary is determined to tackle these problems and has asked for  the tools he needs to make it happen. This farm bill provides those  tools.   Second, it is no secret that we do not have a bipartisan farm bill  process at this moment, and that I deeply regret. Ultimately, Democrats  and Republicans chose to agree to disagree on the question of whether  work-capable adults should work or get free job training for 20 hours  per week in order to be eligible for SNAP.   I respect my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, but I do want  to be clear about something: This farm bill in no way, shape, or form  disrespects Americans who depend on SNAP. To the contrary, the farm  bill keeps faith with SNAP beneficiaries, providing needed benefits and  something more--the dignity that comes with work and the promise of a  better life that a job brings. I want these Americans to realize the  American Dream.   Finally, in closing, I want to note that there is a cottage industry  in this town that is determined to defeat this farm bill. They want  this House to ignore the realities of Mother Nature and  [[Page H4047]]  the predatory trade practices of foreign countries and turn our back on  farm and ranch families struggling to hang on in the face of these hard  times.   Mr. Chairman, that should not happen on our watch. I urge my  colleagues to stand by the hardworking families that put food on our  tables and clothes on our backs and still live every day by the values  that made this country truly great. Let's stand up for rural America.  Let's pass this farm bill.   I reserve the balance of my time.

The Committee on Agriculture concurs in the mutual       understanding that by foregoing consideration of the bill at       this time, the Committee on Natural Resources does not waive       any jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in this       bill or similar legislation in the future.

Hon. K. Michael Conaway,      Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: I have received your letter regarding       H.R. 2, the Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018, which       contains provisions within the jurisdiction of the Committee       on Natural Resources.        In the interest of permitting you to proceed expeditiously       to floor consideration of this very important bill, I will       not seek a referral of H.R. 2. I do so with the understanding       that the Natural Resources Committee does not waive any       future jurisdictional claim over the subject matter contained       in the bill that fall within its Rule X jurisdiction.       Further, I appreciate the work between our committees on       forest management and look forward to working with you to       build upon the important provisions within Title VIII of the       bill as it moves through the legislative process. I also       appreciate your support to name members of the Natural       Resources Committee to any conference committee to consider       such provisions and for inserting our exchange of letters on       H.R. 2 into the Congressional Record during consideration of       the measure on the House floor.        Congratulations on marshalling this monumental achievement       through committee, and thank you again for the very       cooperative spirit in which you and your staff have worked       regarding this matter and many others between our respective       committees.

Michael Conaway,                                                          Chairman.                                time  1700     Mr. Chairman, I would simply say for the record that all  of the bill was negotiated--except for the SNAP title--in good faith  with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Not once did they  mention anything on many of these issues that were just brought up, but  we did have an agreement on those non-SNAP titles. It was a SNAP title,  quite frankly, that caused the rift.   Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr.  Thompson), my colleague, the chairman of the Nutrition Subcommittee.    Mr. Chair, I would like to recognize the fact that this  brand-spanking-new program that never had any funding is authorized in  the bill for discretionary spending to create the scholarship program  that has just been referenced. There was no money taken out of the  bill, because there was never any money in the program.   We simply recognized the need and we set that program up in place as  a direct result of the gentleman's passionate plea for a scholarship  program.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Bost).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer).    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman from North Carolina  an additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Yoho), who is a valued member of the committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman from Florida an  additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer).    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time remains  on each side.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Alabama (Mrs. Roby).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott), the chairman of the Subcommittee on  Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Crawford), the chairman of the General Farm Commodities  and Risk Management Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining on each side.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I would like to clarify the Record.   Of the 265,000 children that have been mentioned a couple of times,  95 percent of them would in fact maintain access to reduced lunch  prices because their families make too much money to qualify for the  free lunch, but 5 percent of that 265,000 would in fact maintain the  free lunch program as it currently exists.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr.  Rodney Davis), chairman of the Subcommittee on Biotechnology,  Horticulture, and Research.  [[Page H4054]]                                     time  1745     Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Iowa  (Mr. Young).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas), the former chairman of the committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I, too, am saddened by the loss of the bipartisan work  that we have typically done on this committee. I have bragged about  being one of the few bipartisan committees in Congress back home a lot,  and it is sad.   Just as the ranking member just said, that his side refused to  negotiate any changes to SNAP, I simply said: Work requirements-- strengthening the work requirements is going to have to be a part of  what we do. And that was where we are with respect to that.   What I heard over and over and over again on the other side is that  the non-SNAP portions of the farm bill, while maybe less than they  would like to have, are nevertheless essential and vital, and I am  looking forward to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle working  as diligently as they can to defeat all of those poison pill amendments  that will have to be offered over the next several days so that we can  maintain that safety net for production in agriculture that they need  and deserve without the legislative history of a loss on this floor  that is totally unnecessary. So I am hopeful that my colleagues over  there will be a part of that.   Mr. Chairman, the entire State of California is under a work waiver  so that no one in California has to work to be able to stay on food  stamps. That doesn't make any sense to me when you have got an  unemployment rate of 4 percent across this country. So something has to  change in that regard.   What I have heard over and over, not only today but throughout this  debate, is folks from the other side, they are full out, full throttle  in favor of work requirements, couldn't be more supportive of work  requirements--just not these.   Over and over and over, they are full out in favor. We have got a  legislative history of all of my colleagues on the other side talking  about how important it is for job training, for education, for getting  folks the skills and tools they need to be able to have meaningful  work--just not these. Got it.   My ranking member had a letter from his folks that said not to  negotiate on SNAP. I took him at his word on that in regard. It is  disappointing that we have reached this point.   But we are at that point. We now have a bill before us that does make  meaningful reforms to the work requirements under food stamps, that  does not touch the working poor. Folks who are willing to work 20 hours  a week, no matter how long they are in that circumstance, we are going  to be shoulder to shoulder with them to try to get the support they  need.   We are also trying to create a State-based State-run program in which  the Federal taxpayer pays for work that the States can do on job  training. There is no better spot to locate that than there because we  cannot create a one-size-fits-all training program here in the United  States House of Representatives. I trust our States to be able to do  that. Those States have the capacity. They have the bandwidth to make  that happen. Comments to the contrary are really misplaced.   So, as we move forward through the rest of the debate, I would  encourage my colleagues to join me in opposing all of those poison pill  amendments that have been presented that would harm the non-SNAP  portion of the farm bill and support the work that we have done so  that, as my good colleague from Oklahoma just said, we can continue to  move this process forward, understand what the Senate gets done, move  to conference, and move a bill to the President's desk by September 30  so that farmers and ranchers across this country, who we are the most  keen to support, have that certainty of what the next 5-year support  system looks like.  [[Page H4057]]    Right, wrong, or indifferent, they deserve that kind of assurance,  that kind of confidence that they will have the farm program to back  them up and their bankers are supported in that regard as well. So I am  asking my colleagues to support H.R. 2 and fend off those poison pill  amendments.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Collins of Georgia) having assumed the chair, Mr. Mitchell, Chair of  the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2)  to provide for the reform and continuation of agricultural and other  programs of the Department of Agriculture through fiscal year 2023, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I move that the House do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  LaMalfa) having assumed the chair, Mr. Lewis of Minnesota, Acting Chair  of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported  that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2)  to provide for the reform and continuation of agricultural and other  programs of the Department of Agriculture through fiscal year 2023, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
