 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to  improve research and public awareness of opioid use during pregnancy. I  introduced the POPPY Study Act earlier this year to address this issue,  and I am pleased that it is being considered here today in this form.   We all know the opioid epidemic has widespread and devastating  effects. Nearly all of us know someone who has been affected by the  crisis, and many of us have grieved through the heartbreak of losing  loved ones to addiction.   Sadly, the impact this has had on Utah has been overwhelming. In my  State, six Utahns die every week as a result of the opioid overdose,  and we rank among the highest in the Nation for drug overdose deaths.  Areas of my district have some of the highest rates of opioid  prescriptions dispensed nationwide.   Tragically, Utah also leads out in prescribing the most opioids to  pregnant women. Across the Nation, 1 in 5 women receive an opioid  prescription during pregnancy but, in Utah, that number is doubled.   Of course, opioid use during pregnancy can have dramatic consequences  for a mother and her unborn child. Neonatal abstinence syndrome  presents itself as babies go through withdrawal, constant screaming,  shaking, vomiting, and difficulty sleeping and eating.                                time  1100    This condition often requires long and expensive hospitalization. For  Medicaid-covered babies, this syndrome costs more than $460 million in  2014 alone.   Tragically, from 2004 to 2014, the rate of infants diagnosed with  opioid withdrawal symptoms increased more than 400 percent nationwide.   Across the Nation, women have been disproportionately impacted by the  opioid epidemic, and little is known about the effect this has had on  pregnant women.   Healthcare experts, providers, and patients agree there is simply too  much we don't know about why pregnant women are being prescribed  opioids and what possible alternatives might provide better healthcare  outcomes for mothers and their unborn children.   My amendment calls for increased research on current opioid  prescribing practices during pregnancy, more data on prescription  opioid misuse during pregnancy, and evaluates and encourages nonopioid  pain management therapies that are safe and effective during pregnancy.   I am proud of the work we have done here to curb the opioid epidemic,  and I applaud the chairman, ranking member, and members of the  committee for the work they have done to fight this crisis.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to support this vital amendment  as well as the underlying bill that will help us better serve our  suffering communities, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana and  the chairman for their speaking out in support of this important bill.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment is essential in helping us improve our  understanding of the impact of using opioid prescription during  pregnancy and, ultimately, preventing opioid use disorder entirely. It  is vital that we have sound and accurate research to guide us in the  best ways to help pregnant women suffering from addiction.   Mr. Chairman, this is a critical amendment. I urge my colleagues to  support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.
