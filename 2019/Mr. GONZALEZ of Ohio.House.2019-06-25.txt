 Mr. Speaker, I have been sitting here now for  about 10 minutes listening to my colleagues on the other side saying  this solves the problem, that this bill finally solves the problem.  Nothing could be further from the truth. This is the poorest faith  effort I have ever seen to solve the problem.   The Senate has a bipartisan bill. It is not perfect. I don't love  that bill. But it is a bipartisan bill that we could vote on tonight,  and we could actually solve something. We could actually get something  done.   What happened instead? Instead, we, as Republicans, were completely  shut out of the process, and they negotiated amongst themselves. That  solves absolutely nothing. Not to mention there  [[Page H5145]]  isn't a single person whom I have heard on the other side of the aisle  who has been serious and honest about what is actually causing this  problem, about solving the horrible incentives that we have in our  immigration system that incentivize the most dangerous journey up  through our southern border.   I am the son of Cuban immigrants. My family escaped from communist  Castro to come to this country and did it legally. I would love to see  a good faith effort. My door is wide open to anybody anywhere who wants  to have a serious conversation about how we reform our immigration  system.   I understand my colleagues on the other side of the aisle do not like  the President. I get that, okay? But that doesn't change the fact that  our immigration system has been broken for decades, and the only people  on planet Earth who can solve that problem are the ones in this body.   If my colleagues want to solve the problem, come find me. My door is  wide open.
