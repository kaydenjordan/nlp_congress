 Mr. Speaker, I am honored to commemorate the 60th  anniversary of one of our top educational institutions in south  Florida: Christopher Columbus High School.   Since its inception in 1958, Christopher Columbus has graduated  bright and talented young men who have made lasting contributions to  our community and our country. Through superior academics, dedicated  staff, and a strong commitment to its students, it is no surprise that  Christopher Columbus has been awarded numerous accolades, such as  ranking in the top 50 Catholic schools in the Nation.   As you might expect, an institution with a reputation like this one  is fortunate to have some world-class alumni. Christopher Columbus  graduates include: Mayor Carlos Gimenez of Miami-Dade County; members  of the Florida Supreme Court and State legislature; and even Pedro Jose  Greer, a recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom.   Mr. Speaker, it is institutions like Christopher Columbus High School  that define the pinnacle of education for young men in our country, and  I congratulate the school for this fantastic milestone. I thank  Christopher Columbus for all that it has done for our beloved south  Florida community, and here is to the next 60 years.   Go Explorers.                            ____________________
