 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.  [[Page S4067]]         Mr. President, the most important three words in our  Constitution are the first three--``We the People''--the mission  statement for our Nation, laid out in supersized font so that no one  would forget what this document, our Constitution, is all about. Our  Founders did not start out by writing ``We the privileged.'' They did  not call for a document or a form of government for ``We the  powerful.'' Indeed, they wanted to make clear that the structure of the  government they were founding would be very different from those in  Europe that functioned for the privileged and the powerful.   As President Lincoln summarized, we are a Nation of the people, by  the people, and for the people. That is the vision. That is the vision  that I have been coming to the floor and talking about for the last  year and a half--about the importance of a government that responds to  the issues that affect the citizens across this country, that listens  to the people of this Nation.   It was President Jefferson who said that the mother principle of the  United States is that we have a government within which each citizen  has an equal voice. Admittedly, we had some deep flaws that had to be  corrected in order to reach that objective, but that vision of each  citizen's having an equal voice was the only way that the government  would reflect the will of the people and make decisions that would  reflect the will of the people. Of course, it is hard to hold onto that  vision because the powerful and the privileged do not like that vision.  They want a government that is of, by, and for the powerful and the  privileged, not of, by, and for the people.   The history of the United States is one battle after another of  decisions that make a foundation for families to thrive in the United  States of America and decisions that raid the National Treasury for the  benefit of the rich. We see that battle time and time and time again,  and we have seen it very recently in this battle over healthcare.  Today, I come to the floor to say that the people of the United States  have had an incredible victory--a resounding victory--over those who  were championing government by and for the privileged and the powerful.   It is really all about this bill, this TrumpCare bill, which  originated in the House of Representatives. It proceeded to throw  millions off of insurance--more than 20 million people off of  insurance--in order to give tax breaks to the richest Americans. What  did the House's bill do? The House's bill said that we will give to the  400 richest Americans $33 billion--not $33,000, not $33 million--and  rip healthcare away from millions of Americans in order to pay for  those kinds of tax breaks for the richest. In fact, just those tax  breaks for the richest 400 Americans would have paid for 700,000  Americans to have had Medicaid, which is basic healthcare insurance.  That would have been enough to have covered the States of Arkansas,  West Virginia, Nevada, and Alaska all put together.   Then we saw the House's bill come over here to the Senate, and the  Senate set up a group of the secret 13. Is there anything more opposite  of ``we the people'' than the secret 13 Senators meeting in the halls  of this building and particularly choosing a room that the press would  not be allowed into? They did not want to be seen entering the room or  leaving the room. That is how secretive it was. That is how embarrassed  they were about the possibility of having the American people see what  they were crafting. Then they came forward with the Senate's version of  the bill.   Now, of the House's version, the President of the United States of  America called it mean, and he called it heartless, but the Senate's  version did not end up being much different than the House's version-- the Senate's version that would proceed to throw more than 20 million  people off of healthcare, as well, the Senate's version that, through,  maybe, the Congressional Budget Office's analysis, would throw off 1  million fewer over 10 years--22 million instead of 23 million--but 1  million more over the first year, that being 13 million rather than 12  million. It proceeded to constrain basic Medicare--Medicare as it  existed before ObamaCare--in such a fashion that, over time, it would  put a stranglehold onto Medicaid. Therefore, it was even meaner, if you  will. It was even more heartless than the Senate's bill.   Then the secret 13 and its leadership said: We do not want to have  the American people see this, so we are not going to give the time in  order to have committee hearings on it. We are going to keep it out of  the healthcare committee. We are going to keep it out of the Finance  Committee because the experts will come, and the American people will  see just how terrible, how mean, how heartless this bill is.   We had a zero, zero, zero process--zero days of committee  examination, compared to 8 years earlier with the longest committee  hearing and markup that lasted 5 weeks in the Health, Education, Labor,  and Pensions Committee. We had the second longest committee hearing and  markup in Finance 8 years earlier, which was the second longest in  history. Again, the Senate's leadership recently said: No exposure in  the Finance Committee--zero days in the Finance Committee--zero days in  the HELP Committee, and zero months for the Senators to go back and  talk to their citizens and talk to their healthcare stakeholders about  what this bill would mean.   You know that something is wrong when you have a process that has  diverged so dramatically from ``we the people.'' Instead, we had the  secret 13 and the zero days of committee examination and the zero days  in the Finance Committee and the zero months to be able to consult with  healthcare experts and stakeholders and, most importantly, zero months  to be able to hold a dialogue with the citizens back home.   Yet we did hear from the citizens back home. As great as the effort  was to hold them at bay--to give them the stiff arm and prevent them  from weighing in--they weighed in nonetheless. My office received well  over 8,000 phone calls. Of those, they ran 84 to 1, saying stop this  diabolical TrumpCare bill. I also received a whole lot of constituent  mail, with more than 25,000 people weighing in from Oregon, back home.  It ran 36 to 1.   With 84 to 1 and 36 to 1, when do you see such opposition?   Maybe we saw such opposition because the people of the United States  wanted to weigh in, knowing that only the powerful special interests  were meeting with the secret 13 to design this diabolical bill to rip  healthcare from millions of Americans. Maybe that is why so many  American citizens weighed in. Thank goodness they did weigh in. They  filled our email boxes, and they overflowed our phone systems. They  filled the streets often and went to our home States' offices to say  that this matters, and it certainly did matter.   Has there ever been a bill in the history of the United States that  did more damage to more people than the TrumpCare bill that was  proposed here in the U.S. Senate?   One of the things that the citizens of the United States did was to  weigh in with their stories with all of us--with all 100 Members of  this Chamber. They wanted to let us know how unexpectedly they had been  affected by their having a child who had a sudden and dramatic illness  or a car accident that had occurred or, suddenly, a family member who  had been afflicted with cancer or emphysema or leukemia or multiple  sclerosis. The list went on and on and on--real people, real lives,  real challenges, real ``we the people'' input.   I heard from Caroline in Portland, the mother of two young children  who wrote to me, sharing her story of raising a child with special  needs and the help that the Oregon Health Plan had been to her family-- the Oregon Health Plan, Oregon's version of Medicaid--and how terrified  she was about not being able to afford healthcare for her child under  TrumpCare.   I heard from Leslie, who contacted me about his 3\1/2\-year-old  daughter Gloria, who suffers from a rare genetic condition that has led  her to live with near constant seizures and cystic fibrosis. She needs  intensive, around-the-clock care, and she is able to get that care  because of a special Medicaid waiver that helps her parents afford it.  With TrumpCare, she would have lost that waiver.   I heard from Jay in Eugene, who reached out to share his story about  his battle with leukemia and stage IV  [[Page S4068]]  colon cancer. He was told he could only expect to live another 3  months, unless he received treatment. That was 2 years ago, and he is  alive because he was able to access treatment. He has been able to  fight the battle with cancer and fight the battle with leukemia, and he  was able to do so because of the insurance he had through ObamaCare-- through the Affordable Care Act.   Kerry from Corvallis wrote to me, terrified about all of the members  of her family who would be uninsurable if they passed TrumpCare: her  husband, because he had a blood clotting disease; her son, who suffers  from epilepsy; and her 78-year-old mother, who has Alzheimer's.   That fear of being unable to access healthcare because of a  preexisting condition ran through story after story after story, but  that is the system we had in the United States of America before we had  the Affordable Care Act.   Then, there was a woman from Ashland who asked me not to share her  name but wanted her story shared. I will call her Katie. Katie is a  single mother who is currently battling cancer--invasive breast cancer  and malignant melanoma. This is what she wrote to me:         In simple terms, I will die without treatment and the       ongoing care that I have received so far through Oregon       Health Plan. As a single parent, I could work 24/7 until my       last breath and still my income would not afford me basic       healthcare if it were not for the Affordable Care Act.    Katie continued:         With a pre-existing condition I would not be insurable,       left to suffer and even to succumb from my illness. Once,       this was only a nightmare, but now it is a horrifying       reality, too surreal to comprehend. I cannot explain the deep       heartache and frustration of the thought of orphaning my son,       all due to dying from an illness that could have been treated       if I had been insured.    Stories like Katie's and Caroline's and Gloria's keep coming in, day  after day, email after email, phone call after phone call--indeed, from  individuals at my townhalls. The weekend before last, I held a lot of  townhalls and a couple of special healthcare forums and a bunch of Main  Street walks in Oregon. Five of those townhalls were in counties that  are very red, very Republican, and I lost those counties in my  reelection by rates of probably 20 to 40 to 50 percent. But at those  townhalls, people came out and said: Please stop TrumpCare.   One out of three individuals in rural Oregon, in Republican Oregon,  are on the Oregon Health Plan. They remember that, not so long ago, all  they had for a healthcare plan was to say a prayer each night and hope  they didn't get sick the next day. They would say a prayer each night  and hope they would not be in an accident the next day. That is all the  healthcare they had.   Now they are able to get preventive care--preventive care for free.  Now they are able to take their children in and get them inoculated.  Now they know that, if a loved one in their family becomes ill or  injured, that loved one will get the care they need, and they won't go  bankrupt in the process.   That is peace of mind. Isn't that the kind of foundation we want, to  enable every family to thrive in America? Shouldn't we consider  healthcare to be a basic right, a basic service, that is provided with  a healthcare system in a ``we the people'' nation, not a ``we the  privileged'' nation, where healthcare is only available to those who  are rich enough to buy it? That is wealth care. That is not healthcare.  It is a healthcare system for ``we the powerful'' or for the powerful  who write the laws that benefit themselves but leave everyone else out  in the cold. No, a ``we the people'' nation has a healthcare system  suited to we the people, where we provide streets and we provide public  transportation and highways as part of the common infrastructure, where  we provide free public schools so that every child has a chance to  thrive, and where we provide public healthcare so that every citizen  can have the peace of mind that, if their loved one gets sick, they  will get the care they need.   But we saw the opposite this year. We saw the House bill that would  have thrown 12 million people off of healthcare within a year and 23  million within 10 years. As for the President, weeks after he  celebrated with his champagne glasses and his leaders from the House  and weeks after he celebrated passage, someone told him what was in the  bill, and the President said: Wow, that bill is mean and heartless.   Then we came to the Senate, and the secret 13 met, and what did they  craft? A bill that was even meaner and more heartless. Instead of  throwing 12 million people off of healthcare in a single year, it threw  13 million people off in a single year, and over 10 years, essentially  the same number as the House. It wrote a Medicaid provision that over  every subsequent year would have made Medicaid less and less accessible  to people who need it.   Well, that ran into a dead end. So the Senate said: Let's recraft  something that is better. And what did they do? They threw in the Cruz  amendment. What did the Cruz amendment do? It is fake insurance. It is  a fake insurance amendment.   Do you remember those days when you would get advertisements for  healthcare that said: Pay us $25 a month, pay us $50 a month, and we  will give you a healthcare policy. Millions of Americans bought those  policies, and they thought they had something valuable, until they  became sick and went to the doctor. Then they were told: This doesn't  cover your doctor's visit, and it doesn't cover your x-ray. It doesn't  cover your MRI--that is for sure. It doesn't cover the drugs you need  to treat this illness. It doesn't cover a specialist. It doesn't cover  hospital care. Oh, and you are pregnant? How wonderful that you are  going to have a child, but your healthcare policy--that fake insurance  policy that you bought--doesn't cover maternity care.   Fake insurance for the people of the United States of America is the  Cruz amendment that was added as a so-called improvement to the mean  and meaner bill already crafted by the secret 13--fake insurance. To  make it worse, the fake insurance system means that the healthcare  policies that cover essential benefits enter into a death spiral. They  become so expensive that people can't afford them. So they don't buy  them. As a result, only those who are already ill buy the policies, and  that makes the policies even more expensive, and so even fewer buy  them.   There it is--the Cruz amendment--fake insurance for the young and  healthy, and the destruction of insurance with essential benefits for  everyone else, pricing it out of reach. In other words, it is like a  bomb going off in the healthcare system to destroy healthcare both for  the young and healthy and for the older and the sick and those with  preexisting conditions.   So some experts weighed in on this and said how terrible that idea  is. This is how destructive this is to the healthcare of Americans.  Suddenly, there weren't the votes for the Cruz fake insurance  amendment, either.   So now what do we have before us? We have the repeal-and-run plan  coming to the floor of the Senate, repealing the exchanges; that is,  the healthcare marketplace, where people can use subsidies to be able  to buy insurance, enabling individuals who are struggling and working  families--working families assembling a number of part-time jobs, often  minimum-wage jobs with no benefits--to buy insurance on this  marketplace.   By the way, this was the Republican plan for healthcare: Let's bring  together a marketplace where people can compare policies and can get  subsidies to be able to afford those policies. This was the Republican  plan. It came from a far-right Republican think tank. It was championed  by a Republican Governor. It was test-run at a State level by a  Republican nominee who became the nominee of the Republican Party for  President of the United States of America. Call it RomneyCare. Call it  the exchange. It was the Republican plan.   But my colleagues now say they don't like their own plan, and they  don't like the expansion of Medicaid. They don't like the free  preventive conditions. They want to get rid of the possibility of your  children staying on your policy until age 26. They want to get rid of  the healthcare bill of rights that says that gender is no longer a  preexisting condition and you can't discriminate against women because  they happen to be women. They want to get rid of the protection you  have against policies that have an annual cap, which means, if you get  seriously hurt or seriously ill, you don't get covered. They want to  get rid of the protection you have that says there can't  [[Page S4069]]  be lifetime caps that destroy healthcare, so that if you are seriously  sick, then, you not only hit your annual limit, but you hit your  lifetime limit and no more care for you. Now you have a preexisting  condition, and you can't get a policy anywhere else.   As for that whole set of consumer protections--the healthcare bill of  rights--my Republican colleagues want to bring this bill to the floor  to destroy that entire set of rights. Then, they say: After we have  destroyed all of this--destroyed the expansion of Medicaid, destroyed  the funding for our healthcare clinics--somewhere down the road we  might figure out a new way to provide healthcare--even though they have  had year after year after year after year after year after year after  year. Let's count them all up, from the years when we crafted the ACA-- with an incredible amount of Republican input, by the way. There were  more than 100 Republican amendments that were adopted. All of those  years later, and now what we have is the majority party's Republican  plan to simply repeal all of these pieces that have given a healthcare  bill of rights to Americans, that have given struggling Americans  access to healthcare, and saying: We are just going to wipe it all away  and have people return to where we were before, where the only  healthcare insurance they had was to say a prayer each night.   That is not acceptable in a ``we the people'' republic. I know that  as citizens across the country weigh in, they are going to say, as they  again fill our inboxes and ring up our phones and visit our offices,  that this is not acceptable. It is not acceptable to make it impossible  for an entrepreneur to leave a big company and found their company  because they now have access to healthcare. That is a beautiful thing.  We have launched small businesses by the thousands and thousands and  thousands because people were able to get healthcare without being at a  large company--small businesses that used to have to just struggle to  get any sort of coverage.   There have been a lot of battles between we the people and we the  powerful over the history of the United States of America--this 241- year history. We have had those who wanted to suppress the ability of  workers to organize and ask for a fair share of the wealth they were  creating. They wanted to bust the union, but the union worked not only  to have better benefits for the workers at the mine or at the mill but  to have better work circumstances for all Americans--to have a 5-day  workweek, to have an 8-hour workday, to have overtime paid at time and  a half, to have safer working conditions, to end the exploitation of  children in child labor sweatshops, and to have employer-based health  coverage. Again and again, workers organizing in the workplace have  fought not only for benefits in that workplace but for benefits for all  working Americans.   That is a ``we the people'' battle against the powerful and  privileged who want to squeeze the working people until they have  nothing--nothing left.   We have had other ``we the people'' versus the powerful battles. We  had one back in the 1920s, where the powerful said: Let's deregulate  everything about the banking system. Let's turn it into a wild casino,  and everybody will make a lot of money.   There was massive speculation. The stock market ran up like this, and  then it crashed. When it crashed, it destroyed the finances of millions  of American working families. It left millions of regular families  homeless and destitute. My grandmother lived in a boxcar because of  this reckless pursuit of more wealth and deregulation by the powerful  and the privileged. Thousands of banks across the country closed. More  than 1 million families lost their farms in the first 4 years as loans  were called in. More than half of all Americans were impoverished.  Ninety percent of children in mining communities were malnourished. All  because ``we the privileged and powerful'' want to crush ``we the  people.''   But ``we the people'' surged back. They elected a government that  established protection for depositors of accounts in our banks,  protection through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. They  elected a government that said: Let's regulate and create honesty and  integrity in the stock market--the Securities and Exchange Commission-- so it is a safe place to invest. We can invest with confidence. They  created the Tennessee Valley Authority to provide electricity and  modernize the impoverished Tennessee Valley region. They forged Social  Security so that for the first time Americans could count on having  some income when they retire.   We had another ``we the people'' versus ``we the powerful'' battle:  the civil rights movement. There were those who wanted to suppress  opportunity on the basis of race and on the basis of ethnicity. But  ``we the people'' came together and said: Here in America, it is going  to be a land of opportunity for every single individual. No matter your  race, no matter your ethnicity, you get a chance to thrive here in the  United States of America. The doors cannot be slammed in your face.   That incredible 1964 Civil Rights Act, forged right here in this  Chamber where I am speaking at this very moment, was an incredible ``we  the people'' moment.   But it is not a battle we have completely won because still even  today in many States across our country doors are legally being slammed  in the face of our LGBTQ community. So shouldn't we come back together,  pass the Equality Act, and give every single American full opportunity  in our country?   Right now, as we come to the conclusion of the healthcare battle  between the privileged and the powerful and the people, we have a  chance to step out of the extraordinarily partisan role that the  majority in this Chamber has played, treasuring power over healthcare  in order to--well, in order to what? What purpose? To what purpose?  What mission is being fulfilled? Yes, more desks are on that side of  the aisle than this side of the aisle, but shouldn't we be here to  solve problems? Shouldn't we work together to make our healthcare  system better?   Buried deep within that mean and meaner bill are a couple provisions  that would make our healthcare system better. There is reinsurance,  which enables a company to go into a new healthcare marketplace and be  insured against having a disproportionate share of sick people. That  makes a marketplace function. Remember, this was the Republican  marketplace plan, and they have a provision deep in their bill that  would make that marketplace work better.   The marketplace requires healthcare companies to know how much they  are going to get paid. Right now, that is in limbo because President  Trump has held up the cost-sharing payments and won't commit to them,  so nobody knows how to price their policies. He is driving healthcare  companies out of one county after another after another. They are  saying: We don't know how to price our policies because we aren't told  how much we will be compensated. Well, there is a provision deep within  that Republican bill that says: We are going to nail down the cost  sharing.   There is another provision in that bill that says we should spend  more to take on the opioid epidemic. Let's pull that out.   Let's work together. Let's take the cost-sharing block down and the  reinsurance proposal and the funding to take on opiates and other drug  addiction across the country, combine them, and we will have something  we can do to make our current healthcare system better--and make it  better as we work en route to having a healthcare system where simply  by virtue of being born an American, you have basic, affordable,  quality healthcare. We are a ways from that, from a Medicare for all or  a Medicaid for all, but shouldn't we aspire to have that kind of peace  of mind rather than the complexity of the system we have now?   At this moment, we have the opportunity to set aside our partisanship  and make healthcare work better for our ``we the people'' Nation, and  we should seize that moment.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, our Nation's courts are supposed to be  bastions of justice. They are intended to be run by men and women of  sober contemplation and scholarly reflection, with the temperament to  put aside their own personal feelings and biases and consider the facts  of the case before them in order to make the best judgments possible;  men and women committed to a full and fair judiciary--a judiciary that  respects our constitutional rights.   I am sorry to say that the nominee for the Sixth Circuit Court of  Appeals does not meet those standards. This man is unfit to serve on  the bench. As revealed by his own words in a series of blog posts  written under a pseudonym, John Bush does not have the temperament or  the impartiality to sit on a court where jurists such as William Howard  Taft and many eminent others have sat.   Mr. Bush himself acknowledged during his confirmation hearing that  ``many of the blog posts used flippant or intemperate language''-- something I believe is unbecoming of an individual nominated to sit on  the Federal bench. But it wasn't just flippant language. It wasn't just  intemperate language. He wrote in an extreme rightwing, partisan  fashion. His confirmation would threaten women's rights and the rights  of LGBTQ Americans. It would threaten Americans' voting rights. It  would threaten issue after issue, topic after topic, of the rights  embedded in our Constitution.   Let's take a few moments to look at his words and his record. Let's  look first at women's rights and the extreme views he has held on this  issue.   In 1993, he filed an amicus brief in a Supreme Court appeal defending  the Virginia Military Institute's policy of not admitting women,  stating that the military-style atmosphere of the institute ``does not  appear to be compatible with the somewhat different developmental needs  of most young women.'' He was basically indicating that young women  cannot handle the same rigors as men or serve in the same capacities as  men--certainly a myth that has been shattered time and time again. He  is locked into an 1800s view of the world. I know that my daughter, I  know that her friends, I know that my colleagues who serve in the  Chamber certainly don't believe that a woman is incapable of serving in  the same roles in which a man can serve.   There was a 2008 blog post Mr. Bush wrote conflating a woman's legal,  constitutional right to choose with slavery. He wrote:         Slavery and abortion rely on similar reasoning and activist       justices at the U.S. Supreme Court . . . . first in the Dred       Scott decision, and later in Roe.    It is hard to imagine how an individual takes the extraordinary human  condition of slavery and the lack of freedom involved in that and  compares it to a woman making decisions, with the advice of her own  doctor, about her own body. One is slavery, and one is freedom--clearly  not the same thing. How could any woman walking into his courtroom  believe she would get a fair hearing with his extreme anti-women views?   For that matter, Mr. Bush's words and actions call into question  whether he would abide by and uphold precedent that is far more recent;  that is, the rights of the LGBTQ community in America. The Supreme  Court declared in Obergefell v. Hodges that same-sex couples enjoy the  fundamental right to marry, just like any other couple. Yet Mr. Bush  has repeatedly demonstrated insensitivity and contempt for the rights  of the LGBTQ community.    In 2005, he gave a speech to a private club in Louisville. He  apparently wanted to bond with his audience by saying something about  the town of Louisville--something he found positive. So he chose to use  a quote related to Hunter Thompson, who described Louisville in a quote  that uses a derogatory term for gay men. In the piece, Thompson recites  the words of a man named Jimbo, who said to him over a glass of double  Old Fitz: ``I come here every year, and let me tell you one thing I've  learned--this is no town to give people the impression you are some  kind of. . . .'' Fill in the derogatory word--the pejorative for gay  men. Of all the possible quotes this individual could choose to create  a bond between himself and his audience in Louisville, he chooses to  attack the LGBTQ community.   Now, he could have chosen any of a number of quotes. A member of my  team did a very quick look. In moments, they found a quote from the  great frontiersman Daniel Boone, saying: ``Soon after, I returned home  to my family, with the determination to bring them as soon as possible  to live in Kentucky, which I esteemed a second paradise.'' That would  be a nice thing to describe about Kentucky--about connecting to your  audience in Louisville rather than describing the characteristics of  hatred and discrimination.   That is where this nominee comes from--full of his vile opinions  about women and about a great spectrum of people in our Nation. So much  for opportunity for all in the United States of America.   The following year, he coauthored a paper criticizing the Kentucky  Supreme Court decision regarding the right to privacy, specifically  focusing on LGBTQ communities.   Then, a couple of years later, with the State Department updating the  passport applications, he ridiculed the effort to accommodate LGBTQ in  one of his posts. At a time when we should be continuing to push our  country forward toward ensuring that the community enjoys the full  measure of equality they are entitled to in our Constitution and under  the 1964 Civil Rights Act, confirming John Bush to be a Federal judge  would certainly walk back many of the gains so many have made.  [[Page S4077]]    Then there is his opinion of money in politics. Our Constitution  starts with those beautiful three words, ``We the People,'' not ``We  the powerful who can spend billions of dollars in third-party campaigns  to have a megaphone the size of a stadium sound system.'' No. Jefferson  said, for us to really secure the will of the people, the individuals  have to have essentially an equal voice.   This individual who is before us today doesn't like that whole  concept of equal voice. He doesn't like the mission statement of the  Constitution of the United States of America. He wants government by  and for the powerful and the privileged and nothing less. Therefore, he  should go and serve in some foreign country that doesn't have a vision  of government of, by, and for the people. He certainly doesn't belong  in our court system in the United States of America.   There is so much more that people have described, including his  writing in support of the ``lock her up'' chants at last summer's  Republican convention, his trafficking in birtherism, and more and  more.   I will be vehemently opposing this confirmation. I urge my colleagues  to do the same. Let's fight for the vision. Let's fight for the ``We  the People'' mission on which our Constitution was founded and that we  have the responsibility to uphold.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my intern,  Janine Kritschgau, be granted privileges of the floor for the remainder  of the day.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
