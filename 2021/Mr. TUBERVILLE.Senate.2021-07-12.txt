 Madam President, last week, when we were all back  home, we all got to celebrate the Fourth of July. Cooking out, spending  time with our family and friends, watching fireworks is always special.   Sitting there with my family, I thought about how blessed we are to  live in the United States of America. We get to live in the most free  and prosperous country in the history of the world. We owe that freedom  and prosperity to the people who declared their independence on July 4,  245 years ago.   They fought and won their freedom for an idea called America. That  American idea lives on two-and-a-half centuries later, thanks to the  generations of men and women who, like many before them, put on the  uniform to defend this great country. Many gave their lives, the  ultimate sacrifice, to defend the United States. But many more are  still with us, and future generations will continue to volunteer to  protect the freedoms and liberties this country affords us every day.   Today we have got almost 20 million veterans in the United States,  and 400,000 of them call Alabama home. I have had the honor and  pleasure to meet many Alabama veterans the past few years. I am always  heartened to talk with them about their service to our great country,  but what I hear over and over again is that there is more we can do for  all of our veterans: better access to care, better opportunities to  reenter civilian life.   Taking care of our veterans is personal for me. My dad served in  World War II and died on Active Duty after the war. But he taught me so  many valuable lessons, like work ethic, perseverance, and love of  country. When I meet with veterans, I see the same patriotism my dad  lived out every day of his life.   You know, I never served myself. The Vietnam war was over before I  got out of college, but many guys I knew from back home served in  Vietnam. I saw how badly they were treated by the media, by Hollywood,  and even by their fellow Americans. They were just trying to serve  their country. They watched their friends die, and when they got home,  they weren't treated very well.   I thank God we treat our veterans today better than we did when I was  growing up. And veterans from the Vietnam era are still the largest of  the veteran group in this United States that we live in today. More  than 100,000 Vietnam vets live in Alabama.   But there is still more we can do to give them the care and resources  that they need and deserve. I am honored to be a member of the Senate's  Veterans' Affairs Committee, where we can hear about the problems  facing our veterans firsthand and work together on commonsense  solutions.   The biggest challenge our veterans face is the access to quality  care. We have all seen it in the news. We have heard about it  firsthand. Far too often, veterans can't get the care they need in a  timely manner. One veteran who doesn't have access to care is one too  many.   My main priority is to get veterans the care they need and they well  deserve by whatever means at our disposal, period. A solution to help  address that problem is the GHAPS Act, Guaranteeing Healthcare Access  to Personnel Who Served, introduced by my friend and committee ranking  member Senator Moran from Kansas.   The GHAPS Act would identify persistent gaps that veterans face and  would help craft innovative solutions to make certain all veterans  receive quality and timely care, especially our veterans living in  rural areas. The bill would also direct the VA to create a telehealth  strategic plan so that we can use modern methods to improve access to  care.   I am proud to cosponsor that legislation and will be working with  Ranking Member Moran to get this bill passed.   We also need to do more to address the scourge of veteran suicide. It  is absolutely tragic that more than 18 veterans take their own life  every day. I have partnered with groups like America's Warrior  Partnership, who are gathering data on veteran suicide across the  country to determine how we can combat this terrible epidemic,  leveraging both the VA and community resources.  [[Page S4816]]    At the same time, we must do more to make additional treatments  available to veterans who haven't had success treating their traumatic  brain injuries or post-traumatic stress disorder. One step we can take  is to pass my bill, the HBOT Access Act. HBOT stands for hyperbaric  oxygen therapy.   My bill would permit HBOT as a treatment option for those veterans  who have tried other evidence-based treatment options for TBI or PTSD  but have not seen substantial improvement. I have heard from veterans  and veterans service organizations that point to HBOT as a treatment  that has produced positive results for individuals suffering from  severe head and brain injuries. Many former football players, including  ones who played for me, found success with HBOT in treating their head  injuries after suffering from concussions.    HBOT is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a  treatment option for more than a dozen different conditions, including  severe burns, infections, and decompression sickness. But the FDA does  not recognize HBOT as an approved treatment option for TBI or PTSD,  meaning veterans can't receive this care at the VA facilities or  elsewhere and must pay for it out of their own pocket if they do use  it. My bill would change that.   If veterans are saying they have improved after using HBOT and if  veterans service organizations have seen similar success, I say we  listen to them. We should not leave quality options on the table while  the veteran suicide crisis worsens.   I want to thank my colleagues Senators Hoeven and Cramer as well as  the American Legion and the Patriot Angels for supporting this  important legislation. I hope my fellow colleagues will join me in  passing this commonsense bill.   Finally, we need to improve resources for veterans to find jobs after  their service in the military. Too many face unnecessary hurdles in  rejoining civilian life. They have some of the best skills you can ask  for. Yet sometimes our veterans, like so many others, can fall prey to  addiction, homelessness, or just be flat out down on their luck.   Thankfully, we have got quality organizations that are doing good  work helping veterans in need. One of these organizations is Three Hots  and a Cot, based in Clay, AL. Three Hots is a small nonprofit  organization founded by veterans for veterans. They get funding mostly  through donations but also through a Veterans Affairs supportive  housing grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban  Development.   Three Hots offers temporary assisted housing to 18 veterans at a  time. They will drive the veterans to healthcare appointments at the  VA, to grocery stores, to job interviews, and to church until they can  get back on their feet. And the job doesn't stop once the veterans are  settled in an apartment on their own. Three Hots will help with the  transition by doing tasks like stocking their pantry, getting them  furniture, and checking on them regularly.   In their 10 years of operation, Three Hots has helped more than 1,600  veterans and family members with an 83-percent success rate. This is  the holistic type of approach to a tough issue that we need more of.  They meet veterans where they are at in the community and help them  find the resources available.   There are more great organizations across the country offering to  help veterans in need, but oftentimes our veterans don't know these  resources are available. I will be working closely with my colleagues  to better connect veterans with the resources that are out there so  they can be equipped with the skills they need to succeed at home.   Folks, simply, without the brave men and women who wear the uniform,  we wouldn't have the freedoms we enjoy and sometimes take for granted  every day. Our service men and women risked everything by joining the  military. The least we can do is to repay their service and sacrifice  by taking care of them when they return home to the country they gave  so much to defend. That is what I will be doing on the Senate Veterans'  Affairs Committee and throughout my time here in the Senate                            ____________________     Madam President, in that spirit, I want to call up my  bipartisan Senate resolution honoring the ``greatest generation,'' S.  Res. 238.   As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration and  the Senate now proceed to S. Res. 238.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed  to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    I yield the floor.
