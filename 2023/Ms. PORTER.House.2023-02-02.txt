 Mr. Speaker, for roughly two decades, Western States have  endured extreme drought conditions. This hurts our economy, endangers  life, and increases costs for Californians.   To avoid importing costly water from distant watersheds, we have to  continue to make bold investments to make California more drought  resilient.   Last year, I brought Secretary Deb Haaland to Orange County to  announce a $12.2 million grant for the Irvine Ranch Water District's  Syphon Reservoir Project. This will expand recycled water storage  capacity by 1.6 billion gallons.   The recent storms proved just how effective these reservoirs are.  Irvine Lake has collected over a billion gallons of water so far in  January; enough water to serve 11,000 households for a year.   I applaud these investments that make full use of water supplies, and  I will continue pushing to increase our resiliency and lower costs for  families.                            ____________________
