 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, next to our people, the Great Lakes are  unquestionably Michigan's greatest resource. They are more than an  economic engine. They are more than a source of drinking water for 40  million people. They are more than a destination for tourists, boaters,  and anglers from across the globe. While the Great Lakes are certainly  all of those things, in Michigan, they are also a way of life. They  are, quite simply, home. You cannot sit on the edge of one of our  massive inland seas without feeling a sense of awe and gratitude.   Next to me is a photo of the Straits of Mackinac, a 5-mile stretch of  water where Lake Michigan meets Lake Huron and where Michigan's Upper  and Lower Peninsulas are connected by the Mackinac Bridge.   Unfortunately, today I cannot look out at these straits without  feeling a grave concern. The Straits of Mackinac are home to powerful  currents. Water, at times, flows through at a volume greater than 10  times that of Niagara Falls. The currents are also unpredictable, as  they can flow in any direction and can change not only by the season or  even by the day, but they can actually change by the hour.   The straits are also home to twin underwater oil pipelines that are  operated by Enbridge, known as Line 5, that are now 64 years old and  getting older by the day. A recent study by the University of Michigan  found that the Straits of Mackinac are the absolute worst possible  place for an oilspill anywhere in the entire Great Lakes Basin.   Without question, there is no way that this pipeline would have been  built today, but it is there, and we need the toughest protections and  strictest accountability possible. To put these in place, I worked to  pass bipartisan legislation to designate the Great Lakes as an  unusually sensitive area, which requires the highest possible operating  standards under Federal law.   Rigorous Federal oversight is critical, but pipeline owners and  operators must do their part as well by being transparent and  forthcoming.   While Enbridge assured us repeatedly that Line 5 is ``as good as  new,'' we found out in August that there are bandaid-sized gaps where  protective coatings had worn completely away and exposed the bare metal  underneath to the harsh underwater environment in the straits. Last  month, we learned of six additional locations with damage to the  protective coatings, leaving areas as big as 1 square foot of exposed  bare metal at each location. Then, on October 27, 2017, just 2 weeks  ago, Enbridge disclosed that its pipeline integrity department knew of  the damage that it had caused to the pipeline while conducting  maintenance in 2014--3 years ago.   I share the concerns that have been expressed by thousands of  Michiganders who dread the worst case oilspill scenario, and I share  their frustration and their anger at being misled. It is unacceptable  that damage to a pipeline running through the Great Lakes could go  unreported for 3 weeks, let alone 3 years.   Simply put, Enbridge does not deserve our trust, and we deserve some  answers. This is why, earlier this week, I called on the Pipeline and  Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to exercise its oversight  role and conduct a thorough investigation--examine any potential safety  or reporting violations--and assure all Michiganders of the safety and  integrity of Line 5, if at all possible. I also joined Senator Stabenow  in demanding answers from Enbridge's CEO to three very critical  questions:   One, what are you doing to fix your broken reporting procedures?   Two, is there any other unreported damage to Line 5?   Three, how can we be certain that regulators are being fully informed  by your company?   We need these answers, and we must get them.   I will never stop fighting to hold pipeline operators accountable and  to keep our Great Lakes safe and clean. The Great Lakes are home, and I  will do everything that I can to protect them for generations to come.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that privileges of  the floor be granted to the following member of my staff, Sarah  Anderson, for today's session.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________
