 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday, President Trump's nominee to  the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, was introduced in the Judiciary  Committee for opening statements. We all look forward to today's round  of questioning, during which I hope the nominee will be more  forthcoming than he was with me. I am very sympathetic to the fact that  judges should not offer opinions on cases that could come before the  Court lest they bias themselves. Every Senator is aware of that. We  know to ask general questions or questions about cases previously  decided to get a sense of a judge's philosophy.   In our meeting, Judge Gorsuch refused to even answer those questions.  For instance, I asked him a very simple question. I said forget about  the case that was then pending in the Ninth Circuit on the Executive  order. I said: Let's say Congress passed a law: No Muslim could enter  the United States. Would that be unconstitutional?   He even refused to answer that question. So I hope he will be more  willing to answer questions in the Judiciary Committee today,  particularly about his views of important Supreme Court cases of the  past and his own ideology. This idea that judges judge regardless of  ideology is totally belied by the fact that there is a coalition right  now--four judges on one side, four judges on the other. Four appointed  by Democratic Presidents who generally rule one way, four appointed by  Republican Presidents who generally rule the other.   If it was just interpreting the law without any input from a person's  life and thoughts and ideology, we would not have that stark breakdown,  but we do. In my view, the hard right, in trying to populate the bench  with people way over, has adopted this philosophy, starting with Miguel  Estrada: Don't answer the questions because if the American people knew  how you really felt, they would not want you on the bench.   Let's take the case of President Trump. Of course President Trump  considered ideology when he selected Judge Gorsuch off a list culled by  the far-right Heritage Foundation and Federalist Society. He did not  pick the judges himself. He went to these extreme groups and said: You  make a list. I promise I will pick people from that list.   Do you think organizations--these organizations--dedicated to a  certain ideological viewpoint, did not consider ideology when building  their list of possible Supreme Court picks? Of course they did.   President Trump said himself, he wanted to appoint a Justice who  would overturn Roe v. Wade. The idea that he selected a judicious,  neutral judge is belied by the selection process, totally and  amazingly. That is how the President considered these judges. So it is  not unreasonable for Senators to consider and question the ideology of  a nominee in committee. President Trump sure did when he came up with a  list. The only way for the Judiciary Committee to do that is if the  nominee is willing to answer specific questions. If he is not willing  to answer specific questions, what is the purpose of even holding a 4- day hearing?   Before I move on to another topic, I would like to point out that it  is the height of irony that Republicans held this Supreme Court seat  open for nearly a calendar year while President Obama was in office but  are now rushing to fill the seat for a President whose campaign is  under investigation by the FBI.   Even Representative Nunes, the Republican chairman of the House  Intelligence Committee, said the investigation, confirmed yesterday by  FBI Director Comey, puts a ``big gray cloud'' over this administration.  You can bet if the shoe were on the other foot and a Democratic  President was under investigation by the FBI, the Republicans would be  howling at the Moon about filling a Supreme Court seat in such  circumstances.   After all, they stopped the President who was not under investigation  from filling a seat with nearly a year left in his Presidency. It is  unseemly to be moving forward so fast on confirming a Supreme Court  Justice with a lifetime appointment while this ``big gray cloud'' of an  FBI investigation hangs over the Presidency.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the Republicans plan to repeal and  replace the Affordable Care Act. Their bill is such a mess and is  proving so deeply unpopular that Republicans are playing a game of hot  potato with it. Speaker Ryan does not want to call it RyanCare. The  administration does not want to call it TrumpCare. They are pointing at  each other and hoping the other one takes responsibility and blame.   President Trump, who has tried to put his name on nearly everything  in his career--ties, steaks, water--does not want his name on this  bill. Well, the President himself is here on the Hill today to sell the  bill to House Republicans. Make no mistake, this is TrumpCare, the  President's bill. Every American should know that if Republicans  ultimately pass this bill, President Trump is behind it, and  Republicans will have helped him every step of the way.   So voters, particularly Trump supporters, who would be hurt most by  this TrumpCare should remember that when your premiums start going up,  President Trump did that. When your insurance does not cover all the  things it used to, President Trump did that. If you are older and  insurance companies are now charging you exorbitant premiums, several  times what you used to pay, President Trump did that. When 24 million  fewer Americans have health insurance while the wealthiest Americans  get a huge tax break, you can be sure President Trump did that too.   Even now, the changes House Republicans are making to buy off  different factions of their caucus are making the bill more harsh. Some  of these changes will further weaken Medicaid and result in even fewer  Americans with healthcare coverage. Though Republicans claim they are  fixing the bill's unfair tax on older Americans, they are not. The  truth is, the Republican age tax is still in the bill. People in their  fifties and sixties still stand to lose big time.   The larger truth is, Republicans are not trying to make this bill  better. They are just trying to make it pass with all their various  factions pulling them in different directions. There is no better  evidence of that than the new ``Senate slush fund,'' a $75 billion  earmark the House is giving the Senate to buy off Republican Senators  who don't want to vote for this bill.   What happened to our fiscal conservative friends in the House--no  unnecessary expenditures. A $75 billion slush fund. It doesn't even say  what it does. Wow. Unbelievable. Many Republican Senators don't want to  vote on the House bill because it is going to crush older Americans  with a new age tax, but make no mistake about it, the Senate slush fund  is not going to fix that problem at all.   Here is the biggest problem. The consequences of TrumpCare are so bad  for working Americans and older Americans that my friend the majority  leader may rush it through the Chamber after we get it from the House.  He has already said TrumpCare is going to bypass committees and go  right to the floor. There is even talk that Republican Senators, under  his leadership, are negotiating a substitute bill behind closed doors  that would take its place and also go straight to the floor.   That is not how we should do business here on something as important  as healthcare. That is not just my view, that is the majority leader's  view. Listen to what the distinguished majority leader--then-minority  leader--said  [[Page S1860]]  about healthcare reform in 2009, when the Affordable Care Act was being  debated. He said--these are Mitch McConnell's words:         We shouldn't try to do it in the dark. And whatever final       bill is produced should be available to the American public       and to Members of the Senate for enough time to come to grips       with it. There should be and must be a CBO score.    Let me repeat that. ``There should be and must be a CBO score.'' I  would ask our leader, are we going to have one before he rushes this  bill to the floor? I hope so. ``We are going to insist,'' he said,  ``that it be done in a transparent and fair and open way.''   Well, the majority leader delights in pointing out instances when  Democrats seemed to go back on something they said. So I certainly hope  he follows his own advice from 2009 now that he is majority leader. We  hope to see a published bill, with Senators given time to review, and a  CBO score before anything moves forward--a fair, open, and transparent  process, as he said.   I know why he wants to move so quickly. The majority leader knows how  bad the bill actually is. In fact, the consequences of TrumpCare are so  bad that Republicans are talking about other phases of the plan,  promising a second and third prong that will somehow make this bill  better for American people down the road. They say to their colleagues:  Well, this bill is bad, but we will change it in the second and third  prongs.    Well, that is a diversion. If Republicans can't live with this bill,  they should shelve it because those other prongs are either not going  to happen or will make it worse.   I can speak with some authority on the third prong. It is going to  require 60 votes. That is what will be needed for the Republican  legislation to make more changes to our healthcare system--60 votes,  which means at least 8 Democratic votes.   I warn my Republican colleagues: Once you repeal ACA in this  fashion--just ripping it out, having nothing good to put in its place-- our healthcare system is going to be too messed up to resuscitate it  with piecemeal legislation down the road. Even my Republican friends,  Senators on the other side of the aisle, said as much. My friend, the  junior Senator from Texas, Senator Cruz, said: ``Anything placed in so- called bucket three won't pass.'' You are right, Ted. If we want to  pass real reforms, we have to do it now and on budget reconciliation.  Senator Cruz is right again.   My friend, the junior Senator from Arkansas, Senator Cotton, freely  admits that ``there is no three-phase process. There is no three-phase  plan. That is just political talk. It's just politicians engaging in  spin.'' Senator Cotton, I couldn't have said it better myself.   All Republicans in the House and Senate should hear this: Democrats  will not help Republicans repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act-- in one phase, two phases, or three phases. This TrumpCare bill would  cause such immense damage to our country, its citizens, average working  families who are going to be paying more and getting less, we are not  going to be complicit. But we will work with our Republican colleagues  to improve the existing law.   If the President and the majority leader say ``All right, we are not  going to repeal; let's work on some changes,'' we will do it with them.  Of course we will listen. But they have to drop repeal first.   Again, I urge my friends on the other side of the aisle to drop their  repeal efforts, drop TrumpCare--non-negotiated, not a drop of  bipartisanship in it--and come negotiate with Democrats on improvements  to the Affordable Care Act. Turn back before it is too late--too late  for the American people who will be hurt and too late for all of you  who will also be hurt as you try to defend TrumpCare in the next few  years.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
