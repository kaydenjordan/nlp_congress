 Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's leadership.   The Trump administration is set to announce proposed regulations  regarding the title X family planning funding stream, very similar to  Reagan-era rules, to clearly separate family planning from abortion  services. This is good news and something I have been strongly urging  President Trump and Secretary Azar to do.   I think it is important to remind ourselves of something very basic:  Family planning should determine when to begin new lives. Abortion ends  lives. Abortion should never be considered an ethical method of family  planning.   Under the new proposed rule, counseling or referral for abortion  would no longer be required for family planning grantees, and  colocation with abortion providers would no longer be allowed.   The Trump administration is doing the right thing, as President  Reagan did, to ensure that taxpayer money goes to family planning  centers that are not in the abortion business. For too long, Planned  Parenthood has used title X as their personal slush fund.   I will continue to work to find legislative solutions to end taxpayer  funding of Planned Parenthood, but until we are able to get legislation  through the Senate--and we have gotten it through the House--this will  be a significant step forward.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud the Trump administration.
