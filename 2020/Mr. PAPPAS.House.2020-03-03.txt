 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address three issues of  critical importance to my constituents.   The first is the urgent need to prepare for the coronavirus.   Mr. Speaker, public health officials are now reporting the first  presumed positive test in my home State of New Hampshire.   As Members of Congress, our foremost responsibility is to keep our  communities safe. That is why, yesterday, I joined Governor Sununu and  my colleagues in the New Hampshire congressional delegation to receive  an update from public health officials on our State's ongoing efforts  to combat this epidemic.   The State of New Hampshire is currently ramping up testing  capabilities, investigating potential cases, communicating with Federal  partners, and working with individual communities on containment and  mitigation.   Here in Washington, we must ensure that the emergency coronavirus  spending package is responsive to the urgent needs of State and local  public health officials who are on the front lines of this situation.   We can only succeed in containing the virus if States like New  Hampshire can depend on the full support of the Federal Government for  costs associated with the response effort.   Mr. Speaker, if there were ever a moment for a renewed spirit of  bipartisanship in Congress, this is it, as our country focuses on the  deadly virus outbreak.   We must communicate health information clearly. We must develop  effective and affordable vaccines that are made available to all who  need them. And we must ensure that State and local governments, as well  as medical facilities, can sustain the arduous task of containing this  outbreak in the weeks and months ahead.   The American people are looking to us for levelheaded leadership that  rises above politics, and we can't let them down.   Let's pass a robust coronavirus package as soon as possible.   Mr. Speaker, I continue to encourage all of my constituents to follow  the CDC safety guidelines and to visit the New Hampshire Department of  Health and Human Services website for updated health information.                     Progress Needed on Care for Veterans     Mr. Speaker, I also rise today in support of veterans who  are seeking services in the community and the providers who care for  them.   For too long, hospitals and providers in New Hampshire have been owed  millions of dollars in unpaid claims for the care they provide to  veterans.   The community care providers impacted include large hospital  networks,  [[Page H1444]]  home healthcare providers, massage therapists, and acupuncturists.   I have personally met with these local providers to hear their  stories, and I have convened meetings of affected stakeholders in New  Hampshire and here in Washington.   Here is the bottom line: Without real progress, the MISSION Act will  never fulfill its promise, and care for our veterans will be  compromised.   Last week, at a hearing of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I  received a promise from Secretary Wilkie that the VA will take  immediate action to fix these persistent payment issues for community  providers in New Hampshire and across the country. We have to hold the  VA to this commitment.   My office is bringing VA leaders, veterans, providers, and third- party administrators to the table to solve these problems once and for  all.   When our veterans return home, they shouldn't have to fight to  receive the care that they have earned, and local providers shouldn't  have to fight a stubborn bureaucracy just to get their bills paid, to  keep their doors open, and to continue treating our veterans.   We can and must do better on this front.                     Empowering Parents in New Hampshire     Finally, Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about  empowering parents in New Hampshire to develop the skills they need to  pursue the American Dream.   No parent should have to choose between caring for a child and  providing a better life for their families.   That is why I am introducing the American Job Centers Family  Accessibility Act, which will create a competitive grant program for  job centers to provide access to childcare for individuals receiving  services at their centers.   In 2018, more than 5.4 million unemployed workers, including more  than 500,000 veterans, took advantage of career services at job centers  in their communities. But despite clear evidence that job centers are  effective, barriers to access for jobseekers still remain.   In New Hampshire, State officials tell me that the number one  obstacle to job training is access to childcare. No one who works hard  and wants to develop new skills should be denied that opportunity  simply because they can't find quality, affordable childcare for their  kids.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the American Job Centers  Family Accessibility Act so that working mothers and fathers aren't  unfairly denied the chance to earn a better job and a better life for  their families.                            ____________________
