 Mr. President, anyone who has read the news lately  will have come across some pretty remarkable headlines about the state  of the U.S. economy.   On Tuesday, Gallup announced that at the close of 2017, Americans'  optimism about the job market set a new record. The same day, the S&P  500 hit an all-time high. Last week, the New York Times ran a story  about ``a wave of optimism [that] has swept over American business  leaders.'' This optimism, the reporters continued, ``is beginning to  translate into the sort of investments in new plants, equipment and  factory upgrades that bolsters economic growth, spurs job creation--and  may finally raise wages significantly''--raise wages significantly.   Markets are optimistic, manufacturers are optimistic, and workers are  optimistic. Investment is ramping up, wages are growing, and  unemployment is low. By all accounts, 2018 is off to a very bright  start.   Of course, Washington is not the source of all this. The engine of  American free enterprise is not here in the Nation's Capital, it is in  the ingenuity, talent, and work ethic of workers and entrepreneurs all  across our country.   Government does not create prosperity, the American people do, but  the Federal Government can certainly get in the way. Draconian tax  policy and runaway regulation make it more difficult for American  workers to find jobs and get pay raises. It becomes harder to start new  businesses, harder to expand and invest in existing businesses, and  more tempting to send money and jobs overseas.   During the Obama years, that is precisely what happened. For 8 years,  his administration seized every single opportunity it could find to  increase taxes, pile on more regulations, and literally micromanage the  lives of the American people. Many middle-class families, like the ones  I represent in Kentucky, were drowning in all this.   Now all of that is changing. In 2017, a Republican President,  Republican House, and Republican Senate brought back bedrock, free  market principles: tax less, regulate less, micromanage less, and  empower the American people to work hard and keep more of what they  earn. And we are already seeing results.   The most significant accomplishment was the historic tax reform law  the President signed into law just over 3 weeks ago. It hadn't been  done in 30 years, but in 2017 Congress and the White House worked  together to overhaul the Tax Code. We cut rates for families and  businesses, expanded key deductions, closed wasteful loopholes, and  repealed ObamaCare's individual mandate tax. We took a lot of money out  of Washington's pocket and put it back in the pockets of middle-class  families, who, after all, earned it in the first place.   Earlier in the year, we made major progress in rolling back the  tangled web of Obama-era redtape using the Congressional Review Act.  Congress repealed 15 major Federal regulations that were literally  stifling American enterprise. This alone is expected to save employers  up to $36 billion in compliance costs. This was in addition to the 860  obsolete rules the Trump administration revisited in 2017.   Small businesses and large companies are all benefitting from these  victories, and so are their workers. Boeing has announced plans to  invest $100 million in developing its workforce and another $100  million to enhance its facilities and its infrastructure. AT&T intends  to invest a billion dollars in capital upgrades. Just this morning,  Walmart announced it would raise starting wages for hourly associates,  along with bonuses and an expansion of paid family leave. That is great  news for more than 1 million people, including the nearly 30,000 people  working at more than 100 Walmart stores across my home State of  Kentucky. This is in addition to all of the other employers across the  State who have already begun passing tax reform savings along to their  employees.   What is true for nationwide employers is proving to be true on Main  Streets across the country as well. In  [[Page S144]]  New Jersey a family-owned car dealership is giving each of its full- time employees a $500 bonus and looking to create more jobs. In  Florida, a family-owned cookie bakery is planning to immediately  expense new equipment purchases, enabling them to develop specialized  products and boost wages for their team. All told, more than 100  companies have announced intentions to deliver special bonuses, pay  increases, or other benefits to employees as a result of tax reform.  This in addition to the direct savings from tax cuts. Thanks to lower  rates and bigger deductions, American workers will get to keep more of  their paychecks.   These are just a few of the ways a growing economy can make life  better for the American people. This is what happens when a Republican  President and Republican majorities in Congress work to get Washington  out of the way.   It is a shame that none of our Democratic colleagues in the House or  the Senate--not one, not a single one--voted for tax reform--not a one.  If they had their way, American businesses would not have had a 21st  century tax code giving them a fairer fight with overseas competitors,  American workers wouldn't have these bonuses and special benefits, and  a typical family of four earning just over $70,000 wouldn't be on track  to keep $2,000 more of their own money this year.   Fortunately, Republican majorities passed the bill anyway, and the  American people are sure glad that we did.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I understand the Senate has received a  message from the House to accompany S. 139.    I move that the Chair lay before the Senate the  message to accompany S. 139 and ask for the yeas and nays on my motion.    Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment  to S. 139.                                Cloture Motion    I send a cloture motion to the desk on the motion to concur.    Mr. President, I move to concur in the House amendment  to S. 139, with a further amendment.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to concur  with amendment.    Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment at the  desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    I move to refer the House message on S. 139 to the  Committee on the Judiciary with instructions to report back forthwith  with an amendment numbered 1872.    I ask for the yeas and nays on my motion.    I have an amendment to the instructions.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.    I have a second-degree amendment at the desk.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Earl Bush,  the judge-executive in Bracken County, KY, who will retire at the end  of his current term. In my home State, a judge-executive is the highest  elected county official, and since 2011, Earl has earned a reputation  for accomplishment on behalf of the people of Bracken County.   After graduating from Western Kentucky University, Earl served our  Nation in the U.S. Air Force, earning the rank of captain. For the next  three decades, Earl worked at Dayton Power and Light in various  construction management positions.   In 2010, Earl decided to put his efforts to work for his neighbors  because, like so many of us in public life, he wanted to make a  difference. Along with his team, Earl has spent his time in office  working to help the men and women of Bracken County. As a former county  judge-executive myself, I know firsthand about Earl's wide-ranging  responsibilities. Looking at his results, Earl seems to have found  success.   In addition to equipment upgrades and road improvements, Earl has  also championed the addition of recreational trails and a fishing lake  at a local industrial park. Working with other officials, Earl also  lowered taxes and helped the county's largest employer bring new jobs  to Bracken County. By nearly any standard, that is an impressive record  of accomplishment for a public official.   I have enjoyed every opportunity I have had to work with Earl.  Throughout his time in office, he has been a strong partner as we serve  the people of Kentucky. In retirement, Earl looks forward to spending  more time with his wife and grandchildren. He also plans to work with  his brother to restore classic cars. Along with many in Bracken County,  I wish him a relaxing next chapter, and I am confident that my Senate  colleagues will join me.                            ____________________
