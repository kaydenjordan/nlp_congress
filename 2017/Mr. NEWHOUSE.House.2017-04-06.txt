 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the Perry  Technical Institute, a technical school serving the students of the  Yakima Valley in Washington's Fourth Congressional District.   Since its founding, Perry Tech has focused on educating and preparing  students for real-world employment in fields such as welding,  instrumentation, carpentry, machining, and manufacturing. These  programs provide students practical experience as well as skills in  time management, goal setting, and financial literacy.   A recent study of economic mobility conducted of nearly 700 technical  schools from around the Nation ranked Perry Tech number one for having  graduates move from low income into the top 20 percent of earners. With  an astoundingly high job placement rate of 93 percent, it is clear that  Perry Technical Institute is providing its students with the skills  they need to excel in the workplace.   Please join me in celebrating Perry Technical Institute's success.                            ____________________
