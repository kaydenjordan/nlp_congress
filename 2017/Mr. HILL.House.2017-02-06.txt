 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the achievement of a  true Arkansas leader, my colleague and friend, Representative Steve  Womack.   Early this year, Steve was awarded the Department of the Army's  Decoration for Distinguished Civilian Service, which is the highest  award the Secretary of the Army may bestow upon a civilian.   Before being elected Representative for Arkansas' Third Congressional  District, Steve dedicated most of his adult life to the Arkansas Army  National Guard where he retired as a colonel after 30 years of service.  [[Page H980]]    He has been awarded the Meritorious Service Medal, the Army  Commendation Medal, and the Legion of Merit. His example is one all  Americans and Arkansans can admire, and I treasure our work together  here in the 115th Congress representing our State of Arkansas.                            ____________________
