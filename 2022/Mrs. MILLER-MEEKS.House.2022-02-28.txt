 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  accomplishments of seven young men from Iowa's Second Congressional  District.   Timothy Koester of Bettendorf, Marcel Lopez of New London, Hunter  Garvin of Iowa City West, Eric Kinkaid of Camanche, Blaine Frazier and  C.J. Walrath of Burlington Notre Dame, and Ben Kueter of Iowa City  earned the title of State champion at the Iowa State wrestling  championships earlier this month.   Wrestling holds a special place in the homes of many across Iowa, and  these young men should be incredibly proud of their achievements.  Through hard work and dedication, these student-athletes were able to  dominate their competition and bring home victory to their school,  family, and community.   These young men proved that the possibilities are endless if you work  hard enough. Congratulations to all of our State champions.                            ____________________
