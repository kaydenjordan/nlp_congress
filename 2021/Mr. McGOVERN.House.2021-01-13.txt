 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 41 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                 H. Res. 41         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order without intervention of any point of order to       consider in the House the resolution (H. Res. 24) impeaching       Donald John Trump, President of the United States, for high       crimes and misdemeanors. The previous question shall be       considered as ordered on the resolution and on any amendment       thereto to adoption without intervening motion or demand for       division of the question except two hours of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary or their respective       designees.        Sec. 2.  Until completion of proceedings enabled by the       first section of this resolution--        (a) the Chair may decline to entertain any intervening       motion, resolution, question, or notice; and        (b) the Chair may decline to entertain the question of       consideration.        Sec. 3.  Upon adoption of House Resolution 24--        (a) House Resolution 40 is hereby adopted; and        (b) no other resolution incidental to impeachment relating       to House Resolution 24  [[Page H152]]       shall be privileged during the remainder of the One Hundred       Seventeenth Congress.        Sec. 4.  Section 5 of House Resolution 8, agreed to January       4, 2021, is amended by striking ``January 28'' each place       that it appears and inserting ``February 11''.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Oklahoma  (Mr. Cole), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a closed rule, House Resolution 41, providing for  consideration of H. Res. 24, impeaching Donald John Trump, President of  the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors.   The rule provides 2 hours of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking member of the Committee on the Judiciary. The  rule also provides that upon adoption of H. Res. 24, H. Res. 40 is  hereby adopted.   Finally, the rule extends recess instructions, suspension authority,  and same-day authority through February 11, 2021.   Mr. Speaker, we are debating this historic measure at an actual crime  scene, and we wouldn't be here if it weren't for the President of the  United States.   On Wednesday, January 6, Congress gathered here to fulfill our  constitutional duty, tallying the electoral college victory of  President-elect Biden and Vice-President-elect Harris after a free and  fair election.   This is largely a ceremonial role for the Congress, one that sends  the message to the world that democracy in the United States persists.  But at a rally just a mile and a half down Pennsylvania Avenue, Donald  Trump and his allies were stoking the anger of a violent mob.   A Member of this very body proclaimed on that stage: ``Today is the  day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.''   Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, called for a ``trial by  combat.''   Then Donald Trump told the crowd: ``We are going to have to fight  much harder . . . you will never take back our country with weakness.''   Even though, according to his own administration that this election  was the most secure in our history, Donald Trump repeated his big lie  that this election was an egregious assault on democracy.   He said Vice President Pence ``was going to have to come through for  us.''   Trump then told this mob to ``walk down to the Capitol.''   The signal was unmistakable: These thugs should stage a coup so  Donald Trump can hang on to power. The people's will be damned.   This beacon of democracy became the site of a vicious attack. Rioters  chanted, ``Hang Mike Pence,'' as noose and gallows were built a stone's  throw from the Capitol steps. Capitol police officers were beaten and  sprayed with pepper spray. Attackers hunted down lawmakers to hold them  hostage or worse. Staff barricaded doors. People sent text messages to  their families to tell them they loved them. They thought they were  saying good-bye, Mr. Speaker.   This was not a protest. This was an insurrection. This was a well- organized attack on our country that was incited by Donald Trump.   Domestic terrorists broke into the United States Capitol that day and  it is a miracle more people didn't die. As my colleagues and I were  being evacuated to safety, I never ever will forget what I saw when I  looked into the eyes of those attackers right in the Speaker's lobby  there. I saw evil, Mr. Speaker. Our country came under attack not from  a foreign nation, but from within.   These were not protesters. These were not patriots. These were  traitors. These were domestic terrorists, Mr. Speaker, and they were  acting under the orders of Donald Trump.   Some of my colleagues on the other side have suggested that we just  move on from this horror. But to gloss over it would be an abdication  of our duty. Others on the Republican side have talked about unity. But  we can't have unity without truth and without accountability. And I am  not about to be lectured by people who just voted to overturn the  results of a free and fair election.   America was attacked and we must respond, even when the cause of this  violence resides at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.   Each of us took an oath last week. It wasn't to a party and it wasn't  to a person. We vowed to defend the Constitution. The actions of Donald  Trump have called each of us to fulfill that oath today. I pray that we  rise to this responsibility because every moment Donald Trump is in the  White House, our Nation and our freedom is in danger. He must be held  to account for the attack on our Capitol that he organized and he  incited.   I solemnly urge my colleagues to support this rule and the underlying  article. The damage this building sustained can be repaired, Mr.  Speaker; but if we don't hold Donald Trump accountable, the damage done  to our Nation could be irreversible.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the powerful statement by  Congresswoman Liz Cheney, who is the chair of the House Republican  Conference, titled ``I will vote to impeach the President.''                Cheney: I Will Vote To Impeach the President                                                   January 12, 2021.        Washington--Wyoming Congresswoman and House Republican       Conference Chair Liz Cheney (R-WY) released the following       statement ahead of votes in the House this week:        ``On January 6, 2021 a violent mob attacked the United       States Capitol to obstruct the process of our democracy and       stop the counting of presidential electoral votes. This       insurrection caused injury, death and destruction in the most       sacred space in our Republic.        ``Much more will become clear in coming days and weeks, but       what we know now is enough. The President of the United       States summoned this mob, assembled the mob, and lit the       flame of this attack. Everything that followed was his doing.       None of this would have happened without the President. The       President could have immediately and forcefully intervened to       stop the violence. He did not. There has never been a greater       betrayal by a President of the United States of his office       and his oath to the Constitution.        ``I will vote to impeach the President.''     Mr. Speaker, I want to be clear about just one thing:  If we vote to impeach the President today and we send it over to the  Senate, there is nothing to prevent the Senate from taking it up  immediately if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell decides that he  wants to proceed, number one.   Number two, we all want to talk about unity. I can't think of  anything  [[Page H154]]  that would unify this country more than if there was a big bipartisan  vote in favor of impeachment. Every second that this President remains  in office is a danger to this country and to the world. We have no idea  what he is capable of doing, whether he will pardon these terrorists or  whether he will go to war.   So I urge all my colleagues on both sides to support this rule and  the impeachment resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Chu).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Green), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Texas.    Mr. Speaker, let me remind all of my colleagues that  what happened on Wednesday would not have happened if it weren't for  the occupant in the White House. If we want to put the people first, we  all ought to vote to impeach him and remove him from office as soon as  possible.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Ms.  Brownley).    Mr. Speaker, I am happy to yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch).    Mr. Speaker, some of us objected 4 years ago as a  protest vote to raise concerns about what all of our intelligence  agencies had stated clearly, which was that Russia had interfered in  our election.   What the gentleman fails to acknowledge is that we all acknowledged  that Donald Trump was the President the day after the election. Hillary  Clinton conceded the day after the election.   And none of us push conspiracy theories like some of my friends on  the other side of the aisle have been doing, and this President, that  somehow the President won in a landslide. Give me a break.   Yesterday, in the Rules Committee, I asked the gentleman from Ohio if  he would just say five simple words. Mr. Speaker, I will tell you that  he was talking about healing. The five simple words that one could say  that would help heal this Nation are that: ``The election was not  stolen.'' That is it, five simple words. He refused. He said he never  said the election was stolen. Well, the evidence shows otherwise. Let  me reference this Dana Milbank piece titled ``Five pesky little words  keep stumping Jim Jordan.''   Mr. Speaker, the bottom line is this. This Capitol was stormed.  People died because of the big lies that were being told by this  President and by too many people on the other side of the aisle.   Enough. People should be outraged as to what happened. It was  unforgivable, unconscionable. Coming up on this floor and talking about  whataboutism and trying to make these false equivalencies, give me a  break.   The President of the United States instigated an attempted coup in  this country. People died. Everybody should be outraged, whether you  are a Democrat or a Republican. If this is not an impeachable offense,  I don't know what the hell is.   This President is not fit to remain in office.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr.  DeFazio).    Mr. Speaker, when my friends talk about the President  being committed to a peaceful transition, I just point to what happened  on Wednesday when his words launched a violent attack against this  Capitol where five people lost their lives and many more were injured.  So give me a break.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Castor).    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Omar).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a New York Times  article published January 9 titled `` `Our President Wants Us Here':  The Mob That Stormed the Capitol.'' It is another example of why our  country cannot risk even one more day of Donald Trump.                  [From the New York Times, Jan. 9, 2021]       Our President Wants Us Here: The Mob That Stormed the Capitol            (By Dan Barry, Mike McIntire and Matthew Rosenberg)         It was the table setter for what would come, with nearly       2,000 people gathering in Washington on Tuesday evening for a       ``Rally to Save America.'' Speaker after angry speaker stoked       stolen-election conspiracy theories and name-checked sworn       enemies: Democrats and weak Republicans, Communists and       Satanists.        Still, the crowd seemed a bit giddy at the prospect of       helping President Trump reverse the result of the election--      though at times the language evoked a call to arms. ``It is       time for war,'' one speaker declared.        As the audience thinned, groups of young men emerged in       Kevlar vests and helmets, a number of them holding clubs and       knives. Some were aligned with the neofascist Proud Boys;       others with the Three Percenters, a far-right militia group.        ``We're not backing down anymore,'' said a man with fresh       stitches on his head. ``This is our country.''        That night reflected a disconcerting mix of free speech and       certain menace; of everyday Americans supporting their       president and extremists prepared to commit violence for him.       All had assembled in answer to Mr. Trump's repeated appeals       to attend a march to the Capitol the next day that he       promised would be ``wild.''        It was. By Wednesday afternoon, a narrow group of Trump       supporters--some exuberant, some hellbent--had been storm-      tossed together into infamy. A mob overran the nation's       Capitol, as lawmakers hid in fear. Wholesale vandalism. Tear       gas. Gunfire. A woman dead; an officer dead; many injured.       Chants of ``U.S.A.! U.S.A.!''        But the insurrection failed.        It had been the culmination of a sustained assault by the       president and his enablers on fact-based reality, one that       began long before the November election but took on a fevered       urgency as the certainty of Mr. Trump's defeat solidified.       For years, he had demonized political opponents and the media       and egged on thuggish behavior at his rallies.        Since losing to Joseph R. Biden Jr., he had mounted a       campaign of lies that the presidency was being stolen from       him, and that marching on the Capitol was the last chance to       stop it. To many Americans, it looked like one more feel-good       rally to salve Mr. Trump's wounded ego, but some of his       supporters heard something altogether different--a battle       cry.        Now, dozens of them have been arrested--including an armed       Alabama man who had Molotov cocktails in his car and a West       Virginia lawmaker charged with illegally entering the       Capitol--and the Federal Bureau of Investigation is asking       for help in identifying those who ``actively instigated       violence.'' Many participants in the march are frantically       working to erase digital evidence of their presence for fear       of losing a job or being harassed online.        Mr. Trump, meanwhile, has been broadly condemned and cut       off from his social media megaphones, as a new administration       prepares to take power.        Kevin Haag, 67, a retired landscaper from North Carolina       who ascended the Capitol steps as the crowd surged forward,       said he did not go inside and disapproved of those who did.       Even so, he said he would never forget the sense of       empowerment as he looked down over thousands of protesters.       It felt so good, he said, to show people: ``We are here. See       us! Notice us! Pay attention!''        Now, back home after several days of reflection, Mr. Haag,       an evangelical Christian, wonders whether he went too far.       ``Should I get down on my knees and ask for forgiveness?'' he       said in an interview. ``I am asking myself that question.''        But the experience seemed to have only hardened the resolve       of others. Couy Griffin, 47, a Republican county commissioner       from New Mexico, spoke of organizing another Capitol rally       soon--one that could result in ``blood running out of that       building''--in a video he later posted to the Facebook page       of his group, Cowboys for Trump.        Couy Griffin, a Republican county commissioner from New       Mexico and organizer of the group Cowboys for Trump, said a       future Capitol rally could have ``blood running out of that       building.'' ``You want to say that that was a mob? You want       to say that was a violence? No, sir, no, ma'am, no. We could       have a Second Amendment rally on those same steps that we had       that rally yesterday. You know, and if we do, then it's going       to be a sad day, because there's going to be blood running       out of that building. But at the end of the day, you mark my       word, we will plant our flag on the desk of Nancy Pelosi and       Chuck Schumer and Donald J. Trump, if it boils down to it.''        Couy Griffin, a Republican county commissioner from New       Mexico and organizer of the group Cowboys for Trump, said a       future Capitol rally could have ``blood running out of that       building.'' CreditCredit . . . Cowboys for Trump via YouTube.       ``At the end of the day, you mark my word, we will plant our       flag on the desk of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer,'' he       said. He paused before adding, ``And Donald J. Trump if it       boils down to it.''        Plans take shape online: `Pack a crowbar'. The advance       publicity for the ``March for America'' had been robust.       Beyond the repeated promotions in tweets by the president and       his allies, the upcoming event was cheered on social media,       including Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.        But woven through many of the messages to stand up for Mr.       Trump--and, if possible, block the congressional       certification of the election he claimed he had won--was       language that flirted with aggression, even violence.        For example, the term ``Storm the Capitol'' was mentioned       100,000 times in the 30 days preceding Jan. 6, according to       Zignal Labs, a media insights company. Many of these mentions       appeared in viral tweet threads that discussed the possible       storming of the Capitol and included details on how to enter       the building.        To followers of QAnon, the convoluted collection of       conspiracy theories that falsely claims the country is       dominated by deep-state bureaucrats and Democrats who worship       Satan, the word ``storm'' had particular resonance. Adherents       have often referred to a coming storm, after which Mr. Trump       would preside over a new government order.        In online discussions, some QAnon followers and militia       groups explored which weapons and tools to bring. ``Pack a       crowbar,'' read one message posted on Gab, a social media       refuge for the far right. In another discussion, someone       asked, ``Does anyone know if the windows on the second floor       are reinforced?''        Still, the many waves of communication did not appear to       result in a broadly organized plan to take action. It is also       unclear if any big money or coordinated fund-raising was       behind the mobilization, though some Trump supporters appear       to have found funds through opaque online networks to help       pay for transportation to the rally.        ``Patriots, if you need financial help getting to DC to       support President Trump on January 6th, please go to my       website,'' a QAnon adherent who identified himself as Thad       Williams, of Tampa, Fla., posted on Twitter three days before       the event. He said he had raised more than $27,000. (After       the Capitol assault, the money transfer companies PayPal and       Stripe shut down his accounts. Mr. Williams did not return a       phone message, but the website for his organization, Joy In       Liberty, said it had given out $30,000 to fund transportation       for ``deserving patriots.'')        Other rally goers set up fund-raising accounts through the       online service GoFundMe; Buzzfeed News cited at least a       dozen, and GoFundMe has since closed them.        One of the most conspicuous figures in the Capitol       assault--a bare-chested man with a painted face, flag-draped       spear and fur hat with horns--was linked to the online fund-      raising. A familiar presence at pro-Trump rallies in Phoenix,       Jacob Anthony Chansley, a 33-year-old voiceover actor, is       known as the Q Shaman. He started a GoFundMe account in       December to help pay for transportation to another Trump       demonstration in Washington, but the effort reportedly netted       him just $10. Mr. Chansley retweeted Mr. Williams's funding       offer on Jan. 3, but it is unclear whether he benefited from       it.        On Tuesday, the eve of the march, a couple thousand people       gathered at Freedom Plaza in Washington for ``The Rally to       Save America'' event, permitted as ``The Rally to Revival.''       The disparate interests of those attending were reflected by       the speakers: well-known evangelists, alt-right celebrities       (Alex Jones of Infowars) and Trump loyalists, including his       former national security  [[Page H162]]       adviser Michael Flynn and the self-described Republican dirty       trickster Roger Stone, both of whom he had pardoned.        The speakers repeatedly encouraged the attendees to see       themselves as foot soldiers fighting to save the country.       Americans, Mr. Flynn said, were ready to ``bleed'' for       freedom.        ``The members of the House of Representatives, the members       of the United States Senate, those of you who are feeling       weak tonight, those of you that don't have the moral fiber in       your body, get some tonight,'' he said. ``Because tomorrow,       we the people are going to be here and we want you to know we       will not stand for a lie.''        Inside the Capitol descends into chaos. It was President       Trump's turn. At about noon on Wednesday, he emerged from a       viewing party in a tent, strode onto a stage set up in a park       just south of the White House and, for more than an hour,       delivered a stream of inflammatory words.        He exhorted the crowd of more than 8,000 to march to the       Capitol to pressure lawmakers: ``Because you'll never take       back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and       you have to be strong.''        Even before he had finished speaking, people started moving       east toward the Capitol. The crowd included supporters who       had come by caravan from across the country, Trump flags       rippling in the wind, as well as people so moved by the       president's appeal for support that they had jumped into       their cars and driven for hours.        They traveled from various corners of resentment in 21st-      century America. Whether motivated by a sense of economic       disenfranchisement or distrust of government, by bigotry, or       conspiracy or a belief that Mr. Trump is God's way of       preparing for the Rapture, they shared a fealty to the       president.        Now the moment had come, a moment that twinned the       thrilling with the ominous.        ``I'm happy, sad, afraid, excited,'' said Scott       Cyganiewicz, 56, a floor installer from Gardner, Mass., as he       watched the throngs of Trump loyalists streaming through the       streets. ``It's an emotional roller coaster.''        American flags and Trump paraphernalia mingled in the       crowd. Credit . . . Pete Marovich for The New York Times. Mr.       Cyganiewicz said he was on his way out of town. He did not       want to be around if violence broke out. Only a portion of       the broader crowd continued onto the Capitol grounds.        Soon word spread that Vice President Mike Pence--who would       oversee the pro forma count by Congress of the electoral       votes for certification--had announced he would not be       complicit in the president's efforts to overturn the       election.        ``You can imagine the emotion that ran through people when       we get that word,'' said Mr. Griffin, the county commissioner       from New Mexico, in a video he posted on social media. ``And       then we get down to the Capitol and they have all the       inauguration set up for Joe Biden.''        He added, ``What do you think was going to happen?''        Many in the crowd spoke portentously of violence--or even       of another Civil War. A man named Jeff, who said he was an       off-duty police officer from York County, Pa., said he didn't       know what would happen after he and his wife Amy reached the       Capitol. But he felt ready to participate if something were       to erupt.        ``There's a lot of people here willing to take orders,'' he       said. ``If the orders are given, the people will rise up.''        By the time the bulk of the crowd reached the building, its       leading edge had metastasized into an angry mob. A man barked       into a megaphone: ``Keep moving forward! Fight for Trump,       fight for Trump!''        ``Military Tribunals! Hang them!'' shouted someone wearing       a cowboy hat.        Arrest Congress!'' screamed a woman in a flag scarf.        People surged past a few Capitol Police officers to bang on       the windows and doors. Many eyewitness accounts and videos       have since emerged that convey the pandemonium as hundreds of       people overwhelmed the inadequate law-enforcement presence.       In several instances of role reversal, for example, rioters       are seen firing what appeared to be pepper spray at police       officers trying to prevent mobs from getting closer to the       Capitol Building.        After a few minutes, the crowd broke through and began       streaming into an empty office. Glass shards crunched under       people's feet, as the scene descended into chaos.        Some stood in awe, while others took action. As one group       prepared to break through an entryway, a Trump supporter       raised a wine bottle and shouted, ``Whose way?'' To which the       crowd responded, ``Our way!''        Confusion reigned. ``Hey what's the Senate side?'' said a       tall man in camouflage and sunglasses.        ``Where's the Senate? Can somebody Google it?''        All the while, members of The Oath Keepers, a self-      proclaimed citizens' militia, seemed to be standing guard--or       the transgressors. They wore olive-drab shirts, helmets and       patches on their upper-left sleeves that said, ``Guardians of       the Republic'' and ``Not on Our Watch.''        American flags flapped beside ``Trump 2020'' flags, and       people wearing ``Make America Great Again'' regalia moved       beside people wearing anti-Semitic slogans. Chants of ``Hell       No, Never Joe'' and ``Stop the Steal'' broke out, as did       strains of ``God Bless America'' and ``The Star-Spangled       Banner.''        Derrick Evans of West Virginia, who just two months before       had been elected as a Republican state delegate, wandered the       halls of the Capitol Building, filming himself and joining in       the occasional chant. At one point he shouted, ``Derrick       Evans is in the Capitol!''        Outside the building, Mr. Griffin, who was once       photographed wearing a 10-gallon hat and sitting across from       President Trump in the Oval Office, was now gleefully       addressing the camera from atop one of the crowded terraces,       declaring it ``a great day for America.'' Asserting that ``we       came peacefully,'' he was interrupted by a man wearing a       jacket with a hand-grenade logo, who said, ``Believe me, we       are well armed if we need to be.''        Amid the cheers and whoops of excitement were questions of       what to do next. Some can be heard hunting for specific       members of congress, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi,       whose office was broken into by several people. She and other       lawmakers were hiding for fear of their safety.        One image showed a trim man moving through the Senate       chamber in full paramilitary regalia: camouflage uniform,       Kevlar vest, a mask and baseball cap obscuring his face. He       carried a stack of flex cuff--the plastic restraints used by       police. The image raised a question yet to be answered: Why       carry restraints if not to use them?        Several rioters wielded fire extinguishers. One stood on a       balcony on the Capitol building's west side, spraying down on       police officers trying to fend off the crowd. Others carried       them into the building itself, one into Statuary Hall and       another onto the steps outside the Senate Chamber, spraying       in the direction of journalists and police officers.        Our president wants us here,'' a man can be heard saying       during a livestream video that showed him standing within the       Capitol building. ``We wait and take orders from our       president.''        Despite his followers' hopes and expectations, President       Trump was missing in action as rioters rampaged through the       halls of Congress. It would be hours before he eventually       surfaced in a somewhat subdued videotaped appeal for them to       leave.        ``We have to have peace,'' he said. ``So go home, we love       you, you're very special.''        Some of Mr. Trump's supporters expressed frustration, even       disbelief, that the president seemed to have given up after       they had put themselves on the line for him.        Mr. Haag, the retired landscaper, was among the       disappointed. Still, he said, the movement will continue even       without Mr. Trump.        We are representing the 74 million people who got       disenfranchised,'' he said. ``We are still out here. We are a       force to be reckoned with. We are not going away.''        One man wandered away from the Capitol in the evening       gloom, yelling angrily through a megaphone that Mr. Pence was       a coward and, now, Mr. Trump had told everyone ``to just go       home.''        Well, he can go home to his Mar-a-Lago estate,'' the man       shouted, adding, ``We gotta go back to our businesses that       are closed!''        As some rioters face fallout, others mull a repeat. In the       aftermath of what Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority       leader, called a ``failed insurrection,'' scores of those who       responded to the incendiary words of the president now face a       reckoning.        A chief target of investigators will be whoever struck       Brian Sicknick of the Capitol Police with a fire       extinguisher; the 42-year-old officer died Thursday after       being injured in the riot. At the same time, authorities are       investigating the fatal police shooting of Ashli Babbitt, 35,       an Air Force veteran who had joined those breaching the       Capitol.        Among those charged so far with federal crimes are Mr.       Chansley, the so-called Q Shaman; Mr. Evans, the West       Virginia lawmaker--who resigned on Saturday; and Richard       Barnett, an Arkansas man who was depicted in a widely       circulated photograph sitting with his foot on a desk in Ms.       Pelosi's office.        Meanwhile, Mr. Griffin, the commissioner from New Mexico       who runs Cowboys for Trump, saw his group's Twitter account       suspended and calls for his resignation.        The anger, resentment and conspiracy-laced distrust that       led to Wednesday's mayhem did not dissipate with Thursday's       dawn. Along with the smashed furniture in the Capitol       Building, there were smashed expectations of a continued       Trump presidency, of lawmakers held to account, of holy       prophecies fulfilled.        Signs of potential violence have already surfaced. Twitter,       which terminated Mr. Trump's account on Friday, noted that       ``plans for future armed protests have already begun       proliferating'' online, including ``a proposed secondary       attack on the U.S. Capitol and state capitol buildings on       January 17.''        The urge for more civil unrest is being discussed in the       usual squalid corners of the internet. Private chat groups on       Gab and Parler are peppered with talk of a possible ``Million       Militia March'' on Jan. 20 that would disrupt the       presidential inauguration of Mr. Biden.        There is chatter about ride shares, where to find lodging       in the Washington area--and what to bring. Baseball bats,       perhaps, or assault rifles.        ``We took the building once,'' one commenter posted, ``we       can take it again.''     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Correa).    Mr. Speaker, may I ask the gentleman how many more  speakers he may have?    We have exhausted all of our speakers.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I thank my friend, the ranking member of the Rules Committee, Mr.  Cole, for his friendship and for the way he conducts himself in this  Chamber. I know he has great respect for this institution.   Mr. Speaker, it is impossible for me to fully capture the reverence  that I have for the United States Capitol. I worked on these grounds  starting back when I was a college intern working for Senator George  McGovern back in 1977. No relation. Great last name.   Since that time, I have done everything from working as a staffer for  Congressman Joe Moakley of Massachusetts to being elected to the United  States House of Representatives myself.   But that internship will always be a high point of my life: Coming  here for the first time, walking these hallowed Halls, and seeing the  glory of American democracy up close.   The idea that someone would incite an out-of-control mob of homegrown  fascists and domestic terrorists to desecrate the people's House fills  me with a deep sadness for our country. The contempt that these people  had for our democracy and our freedom fills me with horror.   What Donald Trump did, encouraging them, fills me with rage not just  on behalf of all of those serving here, but all of those who work in  these Halls. And I am talking about the reporters, the cafeteria  workers, the custodians, the Clerks, the Parliamentarians--I can go on  and on and on--and the staff, the Democratic staff, the Republican  staff, the nonpartisan support staff, who were terrorized, some hiding  under their desks and barricading in their offices.   I was in the Speaker's chair the day this unfolded, and many of the  people who are sitting up there now were present at that time. What a  horrifying thing for anybody to have to experience.   Now, some of my Republican friends have been trying to lecture us  about unity here today after they voted to overturn a free and fair  election of the United States of America, but also preaching unity and  not acknowledging that, for 4 years, many of them gave oxygen to Donald  Trump's conspiracy theories, to the big lies. They have turned the  other way in the face of racism and bigotry and how he embraced some of  the most intolerant voices in this country. They just let it go.   I will remind everybody here that words have consequences, and  ignoring words that are wrong also have consequences. What happened  would never have happened if everybody stood up in unity and called out  the President when he was not telling the American people the truth,  when he was pushing a big lie. We will never have unity without truth  and also without accountability.   This week in Congress, we saw the best of us and the worst of us.  Some of my colleagues have shown that they will defend this President  no matter what he does. There is nothing that he could do that would  dissuade them from all-out support. But some are standing up and doing  the right thing under tremendous pressure, and I am proud of that and I  honor them for their courage.   This impeachment resolution outlines the truth of what Trump did. It  is time that this Congress now holds him accountable for his words and  for their devastating impact.   Last week, we took an oath to protect this Nation. As history calls  on us today, I pray that we all have the moral clarity to uphold it  here today.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Cole is as follows:                      Amendment to House Resolution 41         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 275) to establish the National Commission on the       Domestic Terrorist Attack Upon the United States Capitol. All       points of order against consideration of the bill are waived.       The bill shall be considered as read. All points of order       against provisions in the bill are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on       any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Homeland Security; and (2) one motion to       recommit.        Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 275.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
