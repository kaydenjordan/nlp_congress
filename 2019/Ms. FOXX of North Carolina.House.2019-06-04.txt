 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize U.S.  Marine Corps Sergeant Gerald Gwaltney.   An Alexander County native, Sergeant Gwaltney was sent on four major  landings in the Pacific during World War II, including Iwo Jima, where  he witnessed the iconic American flag raising there.   In the line of duty, Sergeant Gwaltney sacrificed himself for his  men, costing him the use of his right hand. Even after brushing with  death and experiencing the horrors of combat, this selfless patriot  said he would do it all over again.   This year, President Trump signed a law directing the Secretary of  Defense to conduct a commemorative program for the 75th anniversary of  World War II. It is important to take such opportunities like this  week's commemoration of the 75th anniversary of D-day to highlight  heroes like Sergeant Gwaltney and remember the brave Americans who  fought and died for our country in World War II to preserve our  freedom.                            ____________________
