 Mr. Speaker, with more than 4,500 people confirmed  infected in China, and over 100 deaths, the coronavirus certainly has  my attention. But as the outbreak of the coronavirus strain originating  in China continues, I want to remind Kansans that U.S. health officials  remain on high alert and are fully prepared for any situation.   The Centers for Disease Control currently has teams on the ground,  both domestically and internationally. Domestically, the CDC is working  closely with local public health departments to identify potential  cases early and make sure patients get the best and most appropriate  care. To control the spread of the outbreak, the CDC has preventive  screening measures in major U.S. airports.   Last year, President Trump signed into law the reauthorization of the  Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Innovation Act. This bill has  been critical for improving preparedness and response, and bolstering  the emergency response workforce, as well as increasing communication  and efforts in medical countermeasures.   The administration has also consistently prioritized funding to build  on investments to protect the civilian population in the event of  public health emergencies related to infectious disease outbreaks.   As a physician, I understand the uncertainty and fear infectious  disease outbreaks can have. But first, I want to encourage Kansans to  follow recommendations from your own doctor. And if you have any  concern about the situation, you should call your doctor's  [[Page H575]]  nurse and talk to them about the situation and your concerns.   But all that being said, I might offer these tips: First of all, make  sure you have gotten your flu shot. Now, the flu shot won't protect you  from a coronavirus, but it is a much bigger threat to you right now  than the coronavirus is.   Children, pregnant women, and our senior citizens, who are most  susceptible to viruses should avoid public places where exposure risk  is high.   Thorough handwashing is a great best practice as we continue to work  through the flu and cold season.   And, finally, follow the CDC and State Department's recommendations  regarding travel to China.   If you are at all concerned about any symptoms you are experiencing,  especially if you are having new onset of wheezing or shortness of  breath, you should contact your primary care doctor.   Now, thus far, only 5 cases have been confirmed in the United States,  and all cases include recent travel to China. While testing can now  only be done at the CDC, we hope that a commercially-available test  will soon be available in February, which will help us contain and  monitor this virus.   These global outbreaks impact us here at home, and that is why we  respond to infectious disease outbreaks with urgency and as a global  community. Efforts by President Trump and this administration have  ensured our health agencies have the funding and resources necessary to  combat outbreaks and protect Kansans.   I am confident in the measures being taken by our national healthcare  officials and agencies, as well as by our local health departments, our  local doctors, nurses, and our local hospitals.                 New Navigable Waters Protection Regulations     Mr. Speaker, last Friday, I was honored to join EPA  Region 7 Administrator Jim Gulliford at the Kansas Commodity Classic in  Manhattan, Kansas, to announce the EPA's new Navigable Waters  Protection Rule. The rule provides a clear definition of Waters of the  United States, otherwise known as WOTUS, delivering on President  Trump's promise to cut burdensome regulations and slash bureaucratic  red tape to empower farmers, ranchers, builders, small businesses, and  other landowners.    Kansas farmers and ranchers are the original and best  conservationists in the world, and I have heard from them about this  issue since I came into office. This new rule will tremendously reduce  the burden on Kansans who work in dairy, cattle, and crop operations,  and allow them to implement conservation methods without Federal  overreach.   The EPA's new Navigable Waters Protection Rule will continue to  protect our environment without stifling economic growth and rebalance  the relationship between the Federal Government and States in managing  our land and water resources.   The Navigable Waters Protection Rule ends decades of uncertainty over  where Federal jurisdiction begins and ends. It also ensures that  America's water protections, among the best in the world, remain  strong, while giving our States and Tribes more flexibility in  determining how best to manage their land and water resources to  protect the environment and local economies.   Go Chiefs.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to amend the  rule to make in order the Cole-McCarthy amendment that would ensure the  President can protect the United States and her ally, Israel.
