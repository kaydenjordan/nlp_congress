 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 6138) to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to provide  for ambulatory surgical center representation during the review of  hospital outpatient payment rates under part B of the Medicare program,  and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 6138         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Ambulatory Surgical Center       Payment Transparency Act of 2018'' or the ``ASC Payment       Transparency Act of 2018''.       SEC. 2. ADVISORY PANEL ON HOSPITAL OUTPATIENT PAYMENT                     REPRESENTATION.         (a) ASC Representative.--The second sentence of section       1833(t)(9)(A) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.       1395l(t)(9)(A)) is amended by inserting ``and at least one       ambulatory surgical center representative'' after ``an       appropriate selection of representatives of providers''.  [[Page H7117]]         (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a)       shall apply with respect to advisory panels consulted on or       after the date that is 1 year after the date of enactment of       this Act.       SEC. 3. REASONS FOR EXCLUDING ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES FROM ASC                     APPROVED LIST.         Section 1833(i)(1) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C.       1395l(i)(1)) is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``In updating such lists for application in years beginning       with the second year beginning after the date of the       enactment of this sentence, for each procedure that was not       proposed to be included in such lists in the proposed rule       with respect to such lists and that was subsequently       requested to be included in such lists during the public       comment period with respect to such proposed rule and that is       not included in the final rule updating such lists, the       Secretary shall cite in such final rule the specific criteria       in paragraph (b) or (c) of section 416.166 of title 42, Code       of Federal Regulations (or any successor regulation), based       on which the procedure was excluded. If paragraph (b) of such       section is cited for exclusion of a procedure, the Secretary       shall identify the peer reviewed research, if any, or the       evidence upon which such determination is based.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 6138, currently under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, ambulatory surgery centers provide patients with high- quality, same-day surgical and preventive care. H.R. 6138, the  Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment Transparency Act of 2018, makes two  simple and straightforward ASC reforms.   The bill adds an ASC representative to the advisory panel on hospital  outpatient payment, which will allow ASCs proper representation and a  seat at the table for future CMS payment policy changes. This bill also  requires the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to disclose  their criteria for inclusion or exclusion of procedures on the ASC  approved list.   Currently, CMS does not fully provide explanations for their  decisions, leading to a lack of transparency in the process. These  simple changes will continue to protect patient access to cost- effective and high-quality services performed in the ASC setting.   I hope that this legislation marks the first of many steps in further  bolstering ASC and patient access to these high-quality facilities.   I thank Chairman Brady, Ranking Member Neal, and the Ways and Means  staff for working to provide transparency in this space. I also thank  Mr. Larson for his work and partnership on this important bill.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support this legislation, and  I reserve the balance of my time.                                        Committee on Ways and Means,                                        House of Representatives,                                      Washington, DC, July 13, 2018.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden: I write to you regarding H.R. 6138,       the ``Ambulatory Surgical Center (ACS) Payment Transparency       Act of 2018'' the Committee on Ways and Means ordered       favorably reported which was also referred to the Committee       on Energy and Commerce.        I ask that the Committee on Energy and Commerce waive       formal consideration of the bill so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House Floor.        I acknowledge that by waiving formal consideration of the       bill, the Committee on Energy and Commerce is in no way       waiving its jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in       those provisions of the bills that fall within your Rule X       jurisdiction. I would support your effort to seek appointment       of an appropriate number of conferees on any House-Senate       conference involving this legislation.        I will include a copy of our letters in the Congressional       Record during consideration of this legislation on the House       floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                      Washington, DC, July 16, 2018.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: Thank you for your letters regarding       H.R. 4952, the ``Improving Seniors Access to Quality Benefits       Act,'' H.R. 6138, the ``Ambulatory Surgical Center (ACS)       Payment Transparency Act of 2018,'' and H.R. 6311, the ``To       amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and the Patient       Protection and Affordable Care Act to modify the definition       of qualified health plan for purposes of the health insurance       premium tax credit and to allow individuals purchasing health       insurance in the individual market to purchase a lower       premium copper plan.''        The Committee on Energy and Commerce will forgo       consideration of both bills so that they may proceed       expeditiously to the House Floor.        I appreciate your assurance that by forgoing action on       these bills, the Committee is in no way waiving its       jurisdiction over the subject matter contained in the bills.       I also appreciate your offer of support for the appointment       of conferees from the Committee to any House-Senate       conference involving this legislation.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I want to reiterate the small but important step we are taking here  today in passing this legislation. Ambulatory surgical centers provide  excellent care at lower cost to patients and taxpayers.   While there is a much longer conversation that needs to happen  regarding parity in reimbursement in outpatient settings, what we are  doing here is simple. ASCs are an integral part of the healthcare  system, and we are saying that, as stakeholders, they deserve a seat at  the table when changes to payment policies are being debated and when  decisions are being made by CMS on the services they are able to  provide patients. We believe they should get a transparent explanation  as to why those decisions were made.   Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense bill. I urge all my colleagues to  support it, and I yield back the balance of my time.
