 Mr. Chair, clearly, my colleague from Arizona was not  paying attention. The last oil spill was in 2014.   Again, I will state that what we need to be doing is weaning  ourselves off fossil fuels and investing in renewable energy like most  progressive countries are doing.   The West Coast, California, and the coast of the 24th Congressional  District cannot tolerate another oil spill. The benefits of oil  exploration and development off our coasts do not outweigh the risks.  We need to keep that in mind. For a Representative from the State of  Arizona, which is landlocked, which hasn't experienced the perils of  such oil spills to their economy, their workers, or their jobs, keep  that in mind.
