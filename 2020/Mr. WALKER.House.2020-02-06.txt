 Mr. Chair, I thank Ranking Member Foxx for yielding me  the time.   Mr. Chair, today, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2474, the PRO  Act. In fact, the more you learn about this legislation, the more the  name fits. It is prounion boss. It is proshadiness. It is  prounemployment. It is prohibitive. You know what it is not? It is not  proworker.   By repealing right-to-work laws, this legislation fails to protect  workers from being forced into paying hefty union dues. With  unemployment hitting record lows and wages hitting record highs, our  workers should be able to keep their paychecks, not hand them over to  corrupt union bosses.   By changing the classification of the majority of independent  contractors to employees--that is important--this legislation will  restrict workers, create confusion, reduce opportunity, and then  increase costs. It also dramatically expands the joint employer  standard, trying to force businesses to restructure their entire  business models.   What might seem like an insignificant or a small change would  actually result in the labor union mafia taking our booming economy in  a one-way ride. In fact, this legislation is estimated to cost  employers and workers more than $47 billion--with a B--$47 billion  annually.   For a party that likes to talk about the right to choose when it  comes to our most essential rights, why are House Democrats trying to  restrict the power of choice for an entire industry of workers, and in  doing so, forcing middle-income workers to hand over their earnings?   I urge my colleagues to oppose this blatant effort to reinstate a mob  boss rule and vote against H.R. 2474.
