 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  child tax credit's checks arriving to families in my district and  across the country.   It has been 200 days of this Congress and 200 days of House Democrats  delivering for the people.   Last week, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, child tax credit  monthly payments began arriving to roughly 39 million households and  covering almost 90 percent of children nationwide.   In my district the child tax credit will benefit almost 95 percent of  our children.   In Texas, the families of nearly six million children got their  checks totaling $1.5 billion in aid.   Unfortunately, about 46,600 children in the Houston area still have  not received a check.   The good news is this: Nonfilers can still apply on the IRS portal.  Caregivers just need their Social Security number or their ITIN number.  And it is very important to remember that these benefits will not  affect SNAP, Medicaid, SSI, or any other public assistance program.   Madam Speaker, I am hopeful and sincerely believe that we can build  back better, and our children's future can be assured.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  3985, the ALLIES Act of 2021.   First, I thank the chairman for bringing this bill forward, and I  thank my friend, Mr. Crow, for sponsoring this bill.   Recently, I met with Combined Arms, a local organization that works  with veterans and SIV recipients in Houston. They shared their  harrowing stories of the sacrifices they and their families have made  and of their fear that they have of being put to death.   They also shared with me the times that they have been waiting to  receive their SIVs. In some cases, they have waited for 10 years. This  is unacceptable.   I call on my colleagues to support this legislation so we can protect  our allies and reform the system, but also to support the immediate  evacuation of our allies in Afghanistan to U.S. soil, where we can  ensure their safety.   We can't wait any longer. We need to act now. We need to evacuate all  18,000 allies with pending SIV applications and their immediate  families who are in danger.   Mr. Speaker, I met with a young man who is now safely in Houston, but  sadly, his father has already been murdered by the Taliban. At least  300, I am told, have already been murdered, just like his father, by  the Taliban. The more we delay, the more we put families at risk.   Mr. Speaker, we need to support this bill. We need to support an  immediate evacuation. And we need to make sure that our friends who  stood with us, that we now stand with them.                                time  0945
