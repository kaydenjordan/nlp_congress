 Mr. Speaker, I rise today, once again, and again, and  again, and again, because our children are being murdered in their  classrooms. This is outrageous, and it is unconscionable.   Why have we not made good on our promise to our Nation, our promise  that our kids can laugh and learn and play in their schools without the  fear of a shootout?   We should not need sandbags in our schools to protect our children.  They should not be forced to live in a war zone where bullets may  murder a classmate at a moment's notice.   What will it take? How much blood must be spilled? How many kids must  be killed until we do the right thing?   We are here to protect our communities, and Congress has lost its  way. We have lost our soul, and we must do better than this.   Weapons of war don't belong in our streets or our classrooms. How  many children must die before we learn that?                            ____________________
