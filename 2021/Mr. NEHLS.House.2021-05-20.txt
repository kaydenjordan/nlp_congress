 Mr. Speaker, it has been 57 days since Vice President  Kamala Harris was named the point person on the border. She still has  not visited.   The entire Biden administration continues to distract from, deny, and  downplay this public health, humanitarian, and national security  crisis.   Apprehensions in the month of April are up more than 100,000, higher  than they were in January of this year. This has been ongoing for  months, and the administration still has no plan.   The Biden border crisis is costing American lives and billions in  taxpayer dollars and is once again placing the responsibility of the  Federal Government on individual States.   When is enough enough? When will the Biden administration stop  allowing criminal cartels to reap billions in profits from their  inaction? When will the Biden administration stop failing to fulfill  their constitutional mandate to keep the American people safe? It is  anyone's best guess.   But with Democrats controlling the House, the Senate, and the White  House, the Biden border crisis has no end in sight.                            ____________________
