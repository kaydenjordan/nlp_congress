 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize an Idaho  small business that has helped spread knowledge and information across  the great State of Idaho and the entire western United States. As  chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship, it is my honor to recognize Caxton Printers as the  Small Business of the Month for November 2018. Founded over 100 years  ago, Caxton Printers provides high-quality printing and publication  services to the greater Boise, ID, community.   Caxton Printers' roots can be traced back to 1895 when Albert E.  Gipson moved his family from Colorado to Caldwell, ID, to establish a  publishing house. In 1903, Gipson's publishing company, the Gemstate  Rural Publishing Company, began printing a horticultural magazine for  Idaho farmers named the Gemstate Rural. Following the success of the  Gemstate Rural, Gipson reorganized the company and expanded his  commercial printing business. As part of this reorganization, Gipson  named the company Caxton, after the famous English printer, William  Caxton.   In 1907, Albert Gipson's son, James Herrick Gipson, took the reins of  the company from his father and continued the family business. Under  J.H. Gipson's leadership, the company grew significantly and began  printing school textbooks. The State of Idaho named Caxton the official  Idaho State Textbook Depository in 1927. To this day, it continues to  serve as a State distribution center for textbooks, technology, and  education supplies for Idaho's public schools.   In addition to printing and school services, Caxton Printers is also  known for publishing original materials. The company established its  publishing division in 1925 with the publication of Fred E. Lukens'  Idaho Citizen, which later became a textbook in Idaho's State education  curriculum. By 1936, Caxton had published over 100 books of both  fiction and nonfiction. Several of the authors published by Caxton went  on to become known nationally and internationally for their work,  including novelists Vardis Fisher and Ayn Rand. Caxton remains active  in the publishing field today and continues to support the dreams of  hopeful authors.   As Caxton has grown and prospered it has remained a family-owned and  -operated business throughout its history. J.H. Gipson's two sons, Jim  Jr. and Gordon, grew up working in the factory alongside their father.  When J.H. Gipson passed away in 1965, Jim, Jr., became company  president while his brother, Gordon, became vice president. In 1991,  Gordon was named president and Jim, Jr.'s son David became vice  president. Currently, the company is led by the fifth generation of  Gipsons, with Jim, Jr.'s grandson Scott Gipson running day-to-day  operations.   Caxton continues to focus on the core services on which the company  has built its reputation. The company offers custom printing solutions  for a variety of needs for each client. Printing services include  promotional materials, brochures, calendars, booklets,  [[Page S7237]]  and newsletters, as well as more niche options for customers' specific  requests. Caxton believes that printing is only one part of a finished  product and works with customers throughout the process to deliver the  highest quality product possible.   Caxton Printers is also known for its generous support of several  Idaho charities and nonprofits, such as the Caldwell Foundation for  Educational Opportunity, Buy Idaho, and the University of Idaho Vandal  Scholarship Fund. Several of Caxton's employees also serve on the  boards of various charitable organizations including the Caldwell  Chamber of Commerce, the Caldwell Economic Development Council, and the  College of Idaho. Caxton Printers' rich history, commitment to  education and literature, and support for local philanthropic causes  exemplify our Idahoan values. I would like to extend my sincere  congratulations to the Gipson family and all Caxton employees for being  named the Small Business of the Month for November 2018. I wish you the  best of luck, and I look forward to watching your continued growth and  success.                            ____________________
