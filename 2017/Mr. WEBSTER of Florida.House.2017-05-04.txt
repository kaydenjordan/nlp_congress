 I thank the chairman for yielding.   I have heard from my Governor, State officials, and providers about  the challenges on the ground in Florida and what they are facing. The  demographic issues in Florida raise significant challenges for the  State of Florida, and it is the Medicaid program.   Particularly, the State Medicaid program and providers face  challenges relating to the costs of caring for the most disadvantaged  and the elderly in Florida's nursing home program, as well as the  rising costs associated with Florida's aging population.   As the process moves forward, Florida's unique challenges must be  recognized and accounted for as we reallocate dollars for this  important safety net program.
