 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained. Had I  been present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall No. 91.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate this opportunity to  share and reflect, just briefly, on Reverend Billy Graham. What a  tremendous legacy he leaves in so many forms, and I think of how his  humility has had such an impact on so many.   I was one of the thousands in a stadium at a crusade in California  back, I believe, in 1985, and to personally witness the impact that  that meeting had was a great opportunity. But I also realized how one  person can really impact the world and how his efforts have led to  humanitarian efforts, whether it is his family members or others,  really stepping out and ministering to others all around the world.   So I am very grateful to honor Reverend Billy Graham for certainly  his stewardship of religious freedom. I hope that we can all reflect on  our country and religious freedom and how important it is and hopefully  follow in the footsteps of someone who, I think, as the list of most  admired Americans would reflect, with Reverend Graham being on that  list for 60 years--that someone like that can have such a great impact.  So I appreciate this opportunity.
