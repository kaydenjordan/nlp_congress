 Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer my strong  support for H.J. Res. 17, a resolution removing the time limit for  ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment.   Women in the United States make extraordinary contributions to our  workforce and communities--and even more so in the face of the COVID-19  pandemic. Yet, unfortunately, we remain unprotected under the law from  discrimination. This long-overdue legislation will enshrine in our  Constitution the principle of women's equality and explicitly prohibit  discrimination based on sex.   The Equal Rights Amendment states simply: ``equality of rights under  the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any  State on account of sex.'' And in this simple text is guaranteed the  following:   Avenues of legal recourse for people who face sex-based  discrimination,   Prompting of Supreme Court to consider cases of sex discrimination  with rigorous standards, and   The power for Congress to enact laws that ensure sex equality in all  aspects of life.   It is for these reasons, and many others not listed, that we must act  to remove the arbitrary time limit for ratification and codify this  Amendment.   As a member of the Democratic Women's Caucus, I am steadfast in my  commitment to advancing women's rights both in my district and across  the nation. My tenure in Congress has been in part defined by my  advocacy on behalf of women and their successes--but I stand on the  shoulders of generations of heroines fighting for equality. It is in  their honor that I support this legislation today.   I urge my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 17.
