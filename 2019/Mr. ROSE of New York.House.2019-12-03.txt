 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my dear  friends, Mendy Mirocznik and Scott Maurer, and the Staten Island  Council of Jewish Organizations.   Every year, COJO puts on incredible events that celebrate Jewish  tradition and bring together the Jewish community with other  communities of faith from across Staten Island. Now, more than ever,  this work is essential to maintaining and building upon the fabric of  our great borough.   All too often, though, external forces work to separate communities  and isolate them, which leads to polarization, misunderstanding, and  fear.   Not with COJO, though. COJO works to build bridges between  communities so that we can come together. Most importantly, COJO  ensures the security of the Jewish community on Staten Island, which,  unfortunately, feels more and more at risk due to recent events.   Across the country and around the world, we see a rising tide of  anti-Semitism, from hate speech and graffiti in my district to terror  attacks at synagogues across the country.   Now, more than ever, COJO's work is necessary, and I am proud to work  with them each and every day to build a safer Staten Island for all.                            ____________________
