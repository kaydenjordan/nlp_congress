 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, it was about 2 weeks ago that I had the  opportunity to tour a steel plant in Redding, PA. The plant is owned by  Carpenter Technology. It is a company that was founded in 1889. It is  quite extraordinary. It is a vast complex in Redding, PA. They have  2,000 employees in Berks County, which is where Redding is located, and  they have an additional 1,200 or so folks throughout other parts of  Pennsylvania.   Carpenter Technology is a leading producer and distributor of  specialty metals, including what they call soft magnetics. As I  understand it, soft magnetics increase the efficiency and the power and  the battery life of electric motors. That is one of the main  applications of these soft magnetics. It is a feature in steel and  other metals that allows the magnetic properties to be turned on and  off very rapidly. It is an amazing technology. It is an absolutely  essential component for all kinds of products, including aircrafts,  electric cars, even medical devices. It is quite a range of products.  One of the things I learned, of the many things I learned while I was  at Carpenter Technology, is that tax reform is working for Carpenter  Technology.   While I was there, the CEO announced a $100 million investment, right  there in Redding, Berks County, PA, to upgrade their capabilities and  their capacity to produce these soft magnetics. To be more precise,  they are buying an entire new hot rolling steel mill in Redding, PA. It  is a $100 million investment in a new mill that will allow them to  expand their output and meet increasing demand for this really  fascinating product that they make.   One of the things the leadership of Carpenter Technology made  abundantly clear in their press release and in their public statements  was that they were able to purchase this mill and make this $100  million investment in their company now because of the tax reform we  passed. This is exactly the type of capital investment we envisioned  when we passed the tax reform bill. It was exactly for this kind of  economic activity and expansion that we wanted to lower the cost of  deploying this capital and expanding business and generate the economic  growth and prosperity that comes with this.   By the way, Carpenter Technology is not an outlier. This kind of  investment is consistent with the sentiment we are seeing all across  the country.   Just at the end of the first quarter--the quarter that just ended-- there was a large survey of American chief financial officers--CFOs-- across the country. It was carried out by Deloitte LLP. It was  exploring the question of growth expectations for capital expenditure.  The fact is, their conclusion is that these CFOs anticipate greater  growth and more hiring. In fact, the sentiment is at a multiyear high.  Why is that? Here is what Deloitte had to say about it:         Clearly, there's a high desire for investment in the U.S.,       and that is coming from just the structure of tax reform.       [CFOs] are expecting higher domestic wages, almost 40 percent       are anticipating and planning for higher and front-loaded       capital investments, and about a third higher research and       development. What they've said is because of tax reform       they're going to take those actions.    It is very straightforward. It is very clear.   So here we are, just 3\1/2\ months since passage, and the tax bill  has already and continues to benefit workers and businesses, and, boy,  these are not the crumbs some of our friends on the other side of the  aisle have tried to suggest they are. There are over 500 businesses  that we know of--businesses that are sufficiently high profile that we  have read about and we can track their announcements. These 500-plus  businesses employ over 4 million workers. Over 4 million workers across  America have already received bonuses, wage increases, enhanced  benefits, and increased contributions to their pension plans. It has  already happened, and it is attributable entirely to the tax reform. So  the benefits from this tax reform are clearly already flowing to the  very workers we intended to benefit from it.   So my friends on the other side have had some struggles in thinking  about how they can disparage this tax reform. They have come to realize  that calling $1,000 bonuses and multi-thousand-dollar pay raises crumbs  is probably not such a good idea. So they have shifted the argument to  be a kind of class warfare argument.   I hear two varieties of this most frequently. One is this idea that,  well, the benefits all flow to the rich. The second is this idea that,  well, these are greedy corporations that get this tax savings, and they  just use the money to buy stock back.   Let's unpack this a little bit. What about this argument that it all  flows to the rich? Well, there is one problem with that argument. That  problem is it is not true; it is not true at all because when we did  this tax reform, we did it in a way that makes the Tax Code more  progressive. What does that mean? That means that upper income  Americans--the wealthiest Americans--have an increased percentage of  the total tax burden. So while everybody gets a savings in percentage  terms, the savings disproportionately go to lower and middle-income  workers and a disproportionately small amount of the savings go to  upper income workers. So when the dust clears, the net effect is  wealthier people are paying a larger percentage of the total tax bill  than they paid beforehand.   So, clearly, the benefits of this tax reform are flowing to everyone  and disproportionately to low- and middle-income people.   What about this idea that stock buybacks are such a terrible thing?  There have been some stock buybacks. What does that mean? That means  companies have taken the additional pretax cash flow they have, and  they have decided in some cases that they will take a portion of it and  return it to the owners of the company.   It just so happens that about 40 percent of the owners of the public  companies in America are the people who have saved in their retirement  plans--401(k) plans, IRA savings accounts, 529 plans, defined benefit  pension plans. These are middle-income Americans whose savings are  invested in the stocks of companies.   In some cases, yes, there have been stock buybacks. That means these  savers have had cash introduced into their accounts, which then can be  deployed by the managers of these accounts into new investments, which  is what happens for anyone who is selling their stock in response to a  buyback. They get cash.   What do they do with that cash? They get the chance to reassess where  they invest their money, making new  [[Page S2064]]  investments, making different investments, reallocating capital, and  shifting capital to where there is the greatest demand for it. This is  exactly the way a free enterprise system should work. This is exactly  the mechanism that allows capital to flow to its highest use and helps  to encourage still more economic growth.   Better still, this is just the beginning. We are only 3\1/2\ months  into this. We haven't yet even begun to reap the benefits--as a  country, as a society--of this reformed Tax Code. Businesses are  already responding to the incentives, and with the lower after-tax cost  of capital we have created, we are seeing increased investment. Whether  it is a tractor or a new factory or a piece of machinery or a steel  mill in Redding, PA, that investment invariably requires workers to  produce that investment, so there is greater job security and more  opportunities for those workers. But then the company that actually  deploys that investment, such as Carpenter Technology in the case I  just mentioned--their workers become more productive; their workers  have new tools that allow them to command higher wages and a better  standard of living. That is what is happening, and that is going to  continue to develop as companies are just now beginning to have the  opportunity to deploy that capital only 3\1/2\ months into this new tax  regime.   I am just delighted that every week that goes by, I learn about more  Pennsylvania workers and more American workers who are working for  businesses that are benefiting and enhancing their investments. It is a  really good-news story.   Now I will shift a little bit to the CBO report that came out earlier  this week, which said a few things worth noting. One should be on all  of our radars, and that is the fiscal challenge we face. We have too  much debt, and that number is growing too rapidly.   This fiscal year, the gross amount of Federal debt is $21 trillion.  By the end of this 10-year window, CBO contemplates that number will go  up to $33 trillion. This is a huge problem. But I think it is important  that we stress where this problem comes from. This is a spending  problem; this is not a revenue problem, and we can see this in CBO  numbers.   In June of last year, almost a year ago, CBO projected that over the  10-year window they were considering at the time, we would have $43  trillion of tax revenues flowing into the Federal Government, with $53  trillion of spending--a net deficit over that period of $10 trillion.   One year later, CBO has updated its projections, and now it is  calling for $44 trillion in revenue over the current 10-year window. So  there will be $1 trillion more in revenue, but $56 trillion in  spending--$3 trillion more in spending. So we go from a 10-year window  that looks as though the CBO is projecting a $10 trillion deficit to a  $12 trillion deficit. Clearly the deficit is growing, and clearly it is  driven by the increase in spending.   The bottom line is, whether it is $10 trillion or $12 trillion, this  deficit is way too big. But tax reform is going to enhance the revenue  collected by the Federal Government by helping us create a larger  economy to tax. The spending is our fault. That is something we have to  get under control.   CBO has observed a couple of other things. They talk about our tax  reform, and they talk about terrific things. They say in the report  that the tax reform results in ``higher levels of investment,  employment, and GDP.'' We can see dramatically different projections of  economic growth post-tax reform, according to the CBO, than we had pre- tax reform, according to the CBO.   In January of 2017, they projected that this year the economy would  grow 2 percent. But after tax reform passed, they reassessed this year.  They took the projection of 2 percent for this year, and they said that  now it will grow 3 percent based on tax reform. That is a 50-percent  increase in the growth of our economy. That is huge.   For next year, 2019, they were projecting 1.7 percent growth. Now,  post-tax reform, they are estimating 2.9 percent growth--1.2 percentage  points--again, an almost 50-percent increase. These are huge increases,  and they explain it. They say: ``The largest effects on GDP over the  decade stem from the tax act . . . boost[ing] the level of real GDP by  an average of 0.7 percent . . . over the 2018-2028 period.''   The fact is, this tax bill is already working. It is making the  structural changes in the Tax Code that create a greater incentive for  businesses to invest. It is making American companies and American  workers more competitive than we have been in a very, very long time.  It is going to increase the capital stock, the invested assets in our  businesses that allow our workers to become more productive, and it is  going to continue to allow those more productive workers to earn higher  wages.   Let's be honest. No one can prove with certainty what the future  holds, so it is worth looking at what is happening in the present. As a  result of our tax reform, what is happening today, what is happening in  the present is this: Millions of Americans have been receiving bonuses;  millions of Americans have been receiving pay raises; millions of  Americans have seen increases in their pension contributions; millions  of Americans have seen an increase in the value of their pensions; and  millions of Americans--like the workers at Carpenter Technology--have  seen greater job security and greater opportunity as their employers  are investing in their companies, and that is already beneficial for  all of us.   I yield the floor.
