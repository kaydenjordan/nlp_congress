 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the War  Powers Resolution to limit the President's military actions regarding  Iran.   As a Member of Congress, one of our most sacred votes is our vote to  declare war. We, therefore, have an obligation to study the evidence  and share concerns about the administration's decision to engage in  hostilities against Iran. We have a duty to question its strategy, or  lack of strategy, moving forward.   My expertise, Madam Speaker, is not foreign policy, but I know Iran.  I lived there. I worked there as a Peace Corps volunteer many years  ago. I have been a student of Iranian history and politics for more  than 3 decades.   There is no question about Iran's role in sponsoring terrorism.  Soleimani himself was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of  Americans and thousands around the world. He actively worked to foment  instability across the Middle East on behalf of the government of Iran.   Nevertheless, the President of the United States, in his response to  Iran, announced that he would commit a war crime by targeting Iran's  extraordinary cultural sites. War crimes. No matter who is President of  the United States, when he or she indicates that they are prepared to  commit a war crime, then Congress better step up and reassert its  authority under the Constitution.   We must demand that the President justify any act, and that is what  this resolution does. That is why I support it.
