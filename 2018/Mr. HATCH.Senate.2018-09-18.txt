 Mr. President, for more than four decades, I have had the  distinct privilege of serving in the U.S. Senate, what some have called  the world's greatest deliberative body. Speaking on the Senate floor,  debating legislation in committee, corralling the support of my  colleagues on compromise legislation--these are the moments I will  miss. These are the memories I will cherish forever.   To address this body is to experience a singular feeling, a sense  that you are a part of something bigger than yourself, a minor  character in the grand narrative that is America.   No matter how often I come to speak at this lectern, I experience  that feeling, again and again, but today, if I am being honest, I also  feel sadness. Indeed, my heart is heavy. It aches for the times when we  actually lived up to our reputation as the world's greatest  deliberative body. It longs for the days in which Democrats and  Republicans would meet on middle ground rather than retreat to their  partisan trenches.   Now, some may say I am waxing nostalgic, yearning--as old men often  do--for some golden age that never existed. They would be wrong.   The Senate I have described is not some fairytale but the reality we  once knew. Having served as a Senator for nearly 42 years, I can tell  you this: Things weren't always as they are now.   I was here when this body was at its best. I was here when regular  order was the norm, when legislation was debated in committee, and when  members worked constructively with one another for the good of the  country. I was here when we could say, without any hint of irony, that  we were Members of the world's greatest deliberative body.   Times have certainly changed.   Over the last several years, I have witnessed the subversion of  Senate rules, the abandonment of regular order, and the full-scale  deterioration of the judicial confirmation process. Polarization has  ossified. Gridlock is the new norm. Like the humidity here,  partisanship permeates everything we do.   On both the left and the right, the bar of decency has been set so  low that jumping over it is no longer the objective. Limbo is the new  name of the game. How low can you go? The answer, it seems, is always  lower.   All the evidence points to an unsettling truth: The Senate, as an  institution, is in crisis. The committee process lies in shambles.  Regular order is a relic of the past. Compromise--once the guiding  credo of this great institution--is now synonymous with surrender.   Since I first came to the Senate in 1978, the culture of this place  has shifted fundamentally and not for the better. Here, there used to  be a level of congeniality and kinship among colleagues that was hard  to find anywhere else. In those days, I counted Democrats among my very  best friends. One moment, we would be locking horns on the Senate  floor; the next, we would be breaking bread together over family  dinner.   My unlikely friendship with the late Senator Kennedy embodied the  spirit of goodwill and collegiality that used to thrive here. Teddy and  I were a case study in contradictions. He was a dyed-in-the-wool  Democrat; I was a resolute Republican. But by choosing friendship over  party loyalty, we were able to pass some of the most significant  bipartisan achievements of modern times, from the Americans with  Disabilities Act and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act to the Ryan  White bill and the State Children's Health Insurance Program.   Nine years after Teddy's passing, it is worth asking: Could a  relationship like this even exist in today's Senate? Could two people  with polar opposite beliefs and from vastly different walks of life  come together as often as Teddy and I did for the good of the country?  Or are we too busy vilifying each other to even consider friendship  with the other side?   Many factors contribute to the current dysfunction, but if I were to  identify the root of our crisis, it would be this: the loss of comity  and genuine good feeling among Senate colleagues.   Comity is the cartilage of the Senate, the soft connective tissue  that cushions impact between opposing joints, but in recent years, that  cartilage has been ground to a nub. All movement has become bone on  bone. Our ideas grate against each other with increasing frequency and  with nothing to absorb the friction. We hobble to get any bipartisan  legislation to the Senate floor, much less to the President's desk. The  pain is excruciating, and it is felt by the entire Nation.   We must remember that our dysfunction is not confined to the Capitol.  It ripples far beyond these walls, to every State, to every town, and  to every street corner in America.   The Senate sets the tone of American civic life. We don't mirror the  political culture as much as we make it. It is incumbent on us, then,  to move the culture in a positive direction, keeping in mind that  everything we do here has a trickle-down effect. If we are divided,  then the Nation is divided. If we abandon civility, then our  constituents will follow.   To mend the Nation, we must first mend the Senate. We must restore  the culture of comity, compromise, and mutual respect that used to  exist here. Both in our personal and public conduct, we must be the  very change we want to see in the country. We must not be enemies but  friends.   ``Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of  affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched,  as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature.''   These are not my words but the words of President Abraham Lincoln.  They come from a heartfelt plea he made to the American people long ago  on the eve of the Civil War. Lincoln's admonition is just as timely  today as  [[Page S6218]]  it was then. If ever there were a time in our history to heed the  better angels of our nature, it is now.   How can we answer Lincoln's call to our better angels? Over the last  several months, I have devoted significant time and resources to  answering this question. In a series of essays and floor speeches, I  have sought to put flesh on the bones of Lincoln's appeal. These  writings provide a blueprint for fixing our broken politics. They  include: an essay on civility--the indispensable political norm--and  how to restore it to the public discourse; a speech entitled ``A Tale  of Two Cities,'' which draws from the tragedies of Charlottesville and  Houston in the summer of 2017 to issue a call for unity and strength; a  well-reasoned critique of identity politics, specifically, the threat  it poses to the American experiment and how we can heal age-old  divisions by embracing the politics of ideas, not identity; a discourse  on the invaluable worth of the individual and how affirming this worth  can help us curb the suicide epidemic among LGBTQ youth and create a  stronger, more civil society; a proposal to establish Geneva  Conventions for the culture wars, a new set of norms that can ease  partisan tensions and help us contain the worst excesses of political  warfare; and finally, an op-ed on pluralism and how embracing this  forgotten virtue can help us overcome tribal tolerance and effect  meaningful change.   These writings appeal to the humanity, grace, and inherent goodness  in each of us. The purpose of this project is to remind readers of the  singularity of the American experiment and how we can preserve this  great Nation only by heeding the higher virtues within us.   As a parting gift, I plan to share a copy of this compilation with  each of my Senate colleagues, as well as our friends in the House and  leaders in the executive branch. I sincerely ask that each of you take  the time to study these writings. Please, ponder their words and ask  yourself how we can apply these ideas to restore our Nation's civic  health.   When we heed our better angels--when we hearken to the voices of  civility and reason native to our very nature--we can transcend our  tribal instincts and preserve our democracy for future generations.  That we may do so is my humble prayer.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed  to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 300, H.R. 1551.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my substitute  amendment at the desk be considered; that the Alexander amendment to it  be agreed to; that my substitute amendment, as amended, be agreed to;  and that the bill, as amended, be considered read a third time.    Mr. President, I know of no further debate on the bill.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I thank Senators Alexander, Whitehouse,  Grassley, Feinstein, Coons, and Kennedy for all of their hard work on  this important bill. I am touched by this gesture. I also thank all of  the staffs involved, including those in the cloakroom, and the  legislative counsel for their assistance. I feel like we have been  really blessed to be able to get this bill through.    Mr. President, I want to thank my dear colleague from  Nashville--really, from Tennessee--for his very kind remarks. He  covered this really well.   I have had this experience of writing pretty nice songs, mainly  because of my cowriters. I have to say that I was shocked that even  though hundreds of thousands--even millions--of records have been sold  on some of these songs, the songwriters are paid little and in many  cases, not paid at all. This will enhance songwriting in America and  give songwriters a chance to be able to hopefully make a living,  especially the good ones, even some who are not necessarily in  Nashville or Hollywood or New York or in any number of other places.   I want to say that we all are very lucky to have Senator Lamar  Alexander, who is one of our chief advocates in this area. He  understands these problems. He has lived with these problems. He has  anguished over them, and he has played a tremendous role in finally  getting us to this passed bill.   This is a very important bill. People don't realize it, but they will  once this bill is really utilized the way it is allowed.   I can't say that I am a great songwriter, although I do have one  platinum and one gold record and some others that will probably go gold  and platinum. But I can say this: It has been one of the most  enjoyable, productive, and interesting experiences to write songs--for  me and for those who write with me.   All I can say is that I feel really, really indebted to everyone in  the Senate and the House for doing this to help spur on the music  industry in this country and to get people treated properly from a  remunerative standpoint.   I am grateful for Lamar Alexander and for the leadership that he has  provided. We couldn't have done this without him.   Frankly, it is always a pleasure to work with him. He has such a  great sense of humor. He is a tremendous musician himself. He plays the  piano as well as anybody I know and, frankly, has done so for a lot of  us around here. He has uplifted us with his talents. He is a good guy.  I think in Tennessee, and especially in Nashville, they are very lucky  to have him as a U.S. Senator.   I am grateful to the Senate for allowing us to get this done. I am  grateful for my friends on the Democratic side for opening the door  here, and I am grateful for my friends on the Republican side, all of  whom realize how important this bill is and how much good it is going  to do for America and for the music industry--to enlighten us all, to  lift us all during times of difficulty and grief and so forth, and to  provide the incentives to do even better in the future than we have  done in the past. This is an important bill. I am pleased that I have  had a role in helping to pass it.   I am very grateful to Senator Alexander. He is one of my favorite  people here. I used to chair the Labor and Human Resources Committee  that he now chairs. I understand how difficult that committee has been.  This is great and thoughtful legislation, and he has done a tremendous  job on that committee. He is one of the great Senators, and I am not  just saying that because he has helped me on this particular bill. I  just have to say that I am very grateful to him, grateful for his  leadership in the Senate, and grateful for my friendship with him and  his friendship with me. He is a really wonderful man, and he makes a  real difference in this body.   I want to thank everybody in the Senate for allowing this to happen.  I am just very, very appreciative and would feel badly if I did not at  least make that very clear here today.   I yield the floor.
