 Mr. Speaker, as we as a nation reflect on 13 more killed  in action, 13 more Gold Star families, I think it is worth noting that  they did their mission. They did their jobs.   Their operation, their mission, was to secure Kabul International  Airport, to evacuate our Embassy, to evacuate those who had worked with  us, to evacuate the remaining military assets. And they did their job.  They secured Kabul International Airport. But they went above and  beyond.   After pulling grueling, long shifts in the August heat in  Afghanistan--and everybody who has served there knows how difficult  that could be--they went on their own time and were working with  grassroots veterans organizations who sprung up, who stepped up to do,  frankly, what should have already been done and to help those who had  stood with us and stood for that flag for 20 years.   They, on their own time, at great risk, were getting people out. They  knew the dangers. Everybody who had served there knew that it was only  a matter of time till they were going to be hit. They knew that it was  only a matter of time. Yet, they did it anyway.    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this legislation for the  Congressional Gold Medal, but we owe them answers. We owe their  families answers. We owe this country answers.   Why were they defending an airport in the middle of a city of 4  million people? Why were the military assets pulled before--before--all  of our civilians and our government employees were out?   Why? Why? Why? So many questions. So many answers.   I can tell you, and I could tell these families, I tell this body, I  will not rest, I will never forget, and we will get those answers that  those 13 Gold Star families deserve. And there will be accountability  for why we now have 13 more dead Americans.
