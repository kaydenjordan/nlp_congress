 BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, I rise in  opposition.    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Madam Speaker, tonight, we will  not be picking the President, for the people did that on November 3.  Rather, tonight, in this House, we will decide whether American  democracy survives. Let us be under no illusion. These are the stakes.  If this objection succeeds and the will of 7 million Pennsylvania  voters is cast aside, it will be the end of our representative  democracy.   Now, there is no reasonable debate about what happened in this  election in Pennsylvania. Seven million Pennsylvanians voted. Joe Biden  won by over 81,000 votes. This was certified in 67 counties by  bipartisan local-elected officials, including Republicans. And every  single court, whether the judge is a Democrat or a Republican, has  reaffirmed this outcome.   The objectors, however, claim we do not know the will of the people  because the election in Pennsylvania was somehow conducted corruptly.  Much of their objection centers around the State law passed in 2019  known as Act 77 that gives voters the option of expanded mail-in  voting. Objectors are alleging that this law was somehow a brilliant  plot by Democrats to disadvantage Republicans and rig elections. This  is laughable.   Here are the facts. Act 77 was a Republican-led effort in a  Republican-controlled legislature. Literally, every single Republican  in the Pennsylvania Senate voted for it. And in the statehouse, the  vote among Republicans was 105-2.   Here is what the Republican speaker of the Pennsylvania House had to  say about Act 77: This bill does not benefit one party or the other or  any one candidate or single election. It serves to preserve the  integrity of every election and lift the voice of every voter in the  Commonwealth.   So there is no question as to the facts surrounding this election.  They are as clear as they are overwhelming. The only question that  remains is this: Will this House reaffirm our fidelity to our  democracy, or will we end it?   I must concede, Madam Speaker, I have been naive about one subject. I  always just assumed our democracy would naturally endure, almost as if  it was predestined, I never even questioned it until the last several  years.   Two centuries ago, one of our Founding Fathers cautioned against this  notion. John Adams wrote, ``Remember, democracy never lasts long. It  soon wastes, exhausts, and murders itself. There was never a democracy  yet that did not commit suicide.''   I now realize the wisdom of his words. Never again will I take for  granted our democracy. It must be jealously defended by every  generation. Always.   But, Madam Speaker, despite the alarm, I feel that our democracy has  been brought to this breaking point, as we have seen today.  Nonetheless, I still maintain hope.   Growing up in Philadelphia, raised in an immigrant family, I was  often brought down to visit the historic sights. Every summer, without  fail, we would spend a day seeing Independence Hall, Congress Hall, the  Liberty Bell.   It was at Independence Hall where our Nation was declared free and  our Constitution born. At the Constitutional Convention, the oldest and  most widely accomplished delegate was Benjamin Franklin, one of our  greatest Founding Fathers and my city's greatest citizen.   On the final day, as the last delegates were signing the  Constitution, Franklin pointed to the painted Sun on the back of the  Convention chair. Observing the painters had found it difficult to  distinguish a rising Sun from a setting Sun, Franklin went on to say:         I have often, during the course of this session, looked at       that Sun without being able to tell whether it was rising or       setting. But now, at length, I have the happiness to know it       is a rising Sun.    Madam Speaker, on a day like today, when a mob has stormed the  Capitol, and some Members are threatening the core of our democracy, it  can be hard to tell whether for American democracy the Sun is rising or  setting. But I maintain my faith that tonight, by an overwhelming  bipartisan majority in Congress, we will uphold the will of ``We the  People,'' and our democracy will live.
