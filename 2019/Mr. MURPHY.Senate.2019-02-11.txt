 Mr. President, I wish to engage in a colloquy with the  chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator  Murkowski, regarding S. 47, the Natural Resources Management Act, often  referred to as the lands package, of which Chairman Murkowski is the  sponsor and which is currently under consideration by the full Senate.  In particular, I am interested in clarifying the intent of title IV,  regarding ``Sportsmen's Access and Related Matters.''   This title of the legislation deals with--among other issues--the  amount of Federal lands open to hunting, fishing, and recreational  shooting. If I understand the bill correctly, nothing in S. 47 opens  existing Federal lands to hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting  that are not currently open to those activities. Moreover, under this  bill, those lands may be closed for reasons, including public safety  and environmental protection, among other reasons.   Is that a correct reading of the bill?    Thank you. It is also my understanding that S. 47 makes  uniform the process by which Federal lands may be closed to hunting,  fishing, and recreational shooting Moreover, it is my understanding  that S. 47 does nothing to change the standards that the Federal  Government uses to determine whether to close Federal lands to hunting,  fishing, and recreational shooting or to otherwise limit those  activities.   Is that a correct reading of the bill?    Thank you.                            ____________________
