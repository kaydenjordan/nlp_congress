 Mr. President, I am pleased to urge all of my  colleagues to give a strong bipartisan voice vote in support of the  amendment by the Senator from Georgia. The current budget process does  not produce a meaningful budget, does not control the debt or the  deficit, and does not contribute to bipartisanship or compromise. What  it does produce is a meaningless, partisan vote-arama. If you believe  we can do better than a vote-arama, if you believe we can have an  improved and meaningful budget process, voice vote aye.
