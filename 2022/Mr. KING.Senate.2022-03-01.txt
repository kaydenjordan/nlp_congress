 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Judge D.  Brock Hornby of Cape Elizabeth, ME. Last week, after more than 40 years  of service on both Maine's State and Federal courts, Judge Hornby  presided over his final proceeding at the U.S. District Court in  Portland. I want to honor Judge Hornby's incredible career, thank him  for his service, and wish him well in this next chapter.   Judge Hornby is a native of Manitoba, Canada, and earned his  bachelor's degree in English and history in Canada before coming to the  United States to attend Harvard Law School. The year after graduating  from Harvard, Judge Hornby began teaching at my alma mater, the  University of Virginia Law School--where I am certain he obtained the  wit and polish he would carry throughout his career. He moved to Maine  in 1974, became a citizen, and began to practice law in Portland at  Perkins, Thompson, Hinckley, and Keddy.   In 1982, Judge Hornby became a U.S. magistrate judge, serving in  Portland and Bangor until 1988. He then served on the Maine Supreme  Judicial Court for 2 years. In 1990, President George H.W. Bush  nominated him to the U.S. District Court, and the Senate confirmed him  to this position by unanimous consent. At the district court, he served  as chief judge from 1996 to 2003.   During his distinguished career, Judge Hornby has presided over  thousands of criminal and civil cases. Some have grabbed headlines,  others may only impact those involved, but in all his cases, his  colleagues say that he brought a sense of fairness to the bench. Judge  Hornby played a critical role in changing strict Federal sentencing  guidelines, allowing judges to use their discretion in sentencing the  defendants before them.   Through his career, Judge Hornby has been a fair and neutral arbiter  of the law, offering respect to all who entered his courtroom. While we  will miss his insight, intellect, and experience on the bench, he has  earned this retirement. I extend my best wishes to Judge Hornby and  thank him again for his unwavering service--the State of Maine is lucky  to call him one of our own.                            ____________________
