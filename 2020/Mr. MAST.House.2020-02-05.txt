 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support as well of H.R. 4044, the Protect and  Restore American's Estuary Act.   I also want to thank my colleague from New Jersey (Mr. Malinowski)  for introducing this legislation; our chairwoman, Mrs. Napolitano, Mr.  Graves, and everybody who has worked on this outstanding bill that we  want to see move forward here that has moved forward so many other  times.   H.R. 4044, reauthorizes the National Estuary Program which focuses on  estuaries of national significance across the Nation, including one in  my own backyard, very literally, the Indian River Lagoon, the heart and  soul of my district.   Estuaries are not just critical natural habitats that provide  enormous economic benefits, but they are a part of our way of life for  those of us who live anywhere near them or around them. They are where  we go fishing, where we see our children recreate and wade in the  waters. It is where we see dolphin and manatee. That is where we see  people spend their summers, travel to come see the blue waters and the  fish and everything else that thrives in those ecosystems.   The National Estuary Program is pivotal to the preservation of these  very unique ecosystems, and it provides an enormous return on the  taxpayer's investment. On average, the estuary program raises $19 for  every $1 provided by the Environmental Protection Agency.   It is because of this and many other reasons that I see on a day-to- day basis with the estuaries in my backyard that I want to urge support  of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1300     Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon).   Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman  Mast for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4044, the Protect and Restore  America's Estuaries Act, of which I am a proud cosponsor.   The National Estuary Program is an initiative committed to protecting  and restoring the water quality and ecological integrity of 28  estuaries across the country, including the San Juan Bay Estuary  Program in my congressional district.   This estuary is the only tropical estuary in the program and the only  one outside the continental U.S. It also provides habitat to 160  species of birds, 200 species of wetland plants, 124 species of fish,  and 20 species of amphibians and reptiles, including endangered animals  such as the Antillean manatee and the hawksbill and leatherback  turtles.   The San Juan Bay annually receives 80 percent of imports for Puerto  Rico through docks and ports throughout the system, playing a crucial  role for the island's economy. Last year alone, the estuary received  9.5 million visitors, numbers only expected to increase as the island  recovers from past hurricanes. The estuary aids in flood  [[Page H782]]  prevention for the island's metropolitan area, which is located within  the boundaries of the estuary.   I thank the chairman and the ranking member for bringing this bill  forward. Of course, I am going to be for it, and I think it is a great  initiative not just to protect but also care for all our wetlands in  the Nation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  close.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4044 will have a profound impact on districts  across America. That is a fact. It is why I am here to support it  today. It includes my own district, by increasing public education and  awareness around the health conditions of estuaries.   The Indian River Lagoon I spoke about is one of the most biologically  diverse estuaries in all of North America and a major economic driver  for the five counties that it borders. The lagoon faces enormous  challenges year after year and summer after summer, but through the  National Estuary Program, there has been a pilot-scale demonstration of  seagrass restoration, which is one of the biggest challenges that we  face. The destruction of our seagrass each year is like a forest fire  underneath the waters of our estuary.   Storm water quality improvement projects, septic-to-sewer projects,  and many other projects and initiatives that are vital to our estuary  are all implemented here.   With the Protect and Restore America's Estuaries Act, we will build  on the enormous success of the National Estuary Program. It is why I  couldn't be more proud to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support and adoption of this bipartisan piece of  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I also rise in support of H.R. 1132. It represents good  governance by codifying the EPA's existing work in the San Francisco  Bay Area. The bay area watershed provides a primary source of drinking  water for over  [[Page H788]]  25 million people and irrigation for 7,000 square miles of agriculture.  It includes important economic resources, such as water supply  infrastructure, ports, deepwater shipping channels, major highway and  railway corridors, and energy lines.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this important legislation, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2247.   H.R. 2247 represents good governance by codifying the Environmental  Protection Agency's restoration activities in the Puget Sound. The  Puget Sound is the Nation's second largest estuary, supporting more  than 4.5 million people, more than $365 million in gross domestic  product, and a wide variety of species.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse).    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may consume to the  gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. Rodgers).    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close. I urge support of this  important legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
