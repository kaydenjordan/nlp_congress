 Mr. President, I am pleased the U.S. Senate voted  favorably to add Montenegro as a permanent member to the North Atlantic  Treaty Organization, NATO, sending a strong signal of transatlantic  unity. NATO plays a vital role in maintaining security and stability  throughout Europe, and including Montenegro in this strategic alliance  will strengthen NATO and encourage stability within the region.   Montenegro is a growing democracy that has repeatedly proven itself  to be a valuable ally since joining NATO's Partnership for Peace  Program in 2006. They are partnered with our Maine National Guard, and  have been a strong ally in the fight in Afghanistan since 2010. Having  visited Montenegro, I can say, without a doubt, that it has  demonstrated a commitment to NATO, the United States, and regional  stability. This vote sends clear message of support to our friends in  Montenegro. It also sends a strong message to NATO and gives notice  that the United States will stand up for Western democracies, despite  continued pressure from the Kremlin. We must deter Russia's  destabilizing actions in the region, including Moscow's annexation of  Crimea in 2014 and its continued support for rebels in eastern Ukraine.  Putin is learning lessons from these examples and will continue his  quest to expand his influence as far as the world community will allow.  This aggression by the Russian Federation undermines peace and  stability not only in the Balkan region, but also in all of Europe,  which constitutes a direct threat to U.S. security interests.   Montenegro's accession to NATO is in the best interest of the United  States, NATO, and peace and stability in Europe. This vote by the U.S.  Senate sends a clear message of our commitment to NATO, to the people  of Montenegro, and to improving stability in the Balkan region. I look  forward to Montenegro joining NATO as a full member.                            ____________________     Mr. President, when we lost the Honorable Justice Antonin  Scalia, we were all saddened, as he was such a legend on the Court, and  I am very proud that President Trump nominated a successor who is  worthy of fulfilling his shoes.   Judge Gorsuch has garnered respect and approval from people across  the legal community, and he has unrivaled bipartisan support. It is  unfortunate that the Democrats have tried to block his nomination. It  is not going to work, but they have tried.   Recently, I had the honor of meeting Judge Gorsuch. It is kind of  interesting because I was not on his list to visit. In fact, I had even  said: Don't waste your time on me, as I know your credentials and I am  going to support you anyway, and I am not on the appropriate committees  that would pass judgment. Yet he did call, and we met. I will tell you  that you have to meet and talk to the guy in person to know what kind  of an individual he really is.   Of course, being from Oklahoma, I am sensitive to the fact that he is  the son of the West. In fact, none of our Justices up there, with the  exception of California, are from what we would call the Western United  States--the area where people need to be properly represented.   As a judge on the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, he has heard from  Utah, Wyoming, Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, and my State of Oklahoma.  He knows the issues of the Western States and what we are facing, and  he has expertise to deal with them. He has handled with a lot of care  and fairness the issues that have come before him. Of course, we know  this because Oklahoma is in the Tenth Circuit.   His reputation is such that, regardless of party affiliation,  countless groups, organizations, and individuals have come out in  support of Judge Gorsuch, including Neal Katyal. Neal Katyal was the  Acting Solicitor General in President Obama's Cabinet, so he was a  Cabinet member of President Obama's. He testified before the Senate  Judiciary Committee and wrote an op-ed piece in the New York Times.  Keep in mind, when you listen to this--this is a quote from an op-ed  piece in the New York Times, and one of the individuals from the  administration of President Obama said this: ``His years on the bench  reveal a commitment to judicial independence--a record that should give  the American people confidence that he will not compromise principle to  favor the President who appointed him.''    That comes from an Obama appointee.   Not only is he well liked, but he also has an impressive resume,  serving as law clerk to two different Supreme Court Justices. He  attended Columbia, Harvard, Oxford, and it doesn't get any better than  that. It is clear he has the qualifications, and as recently as the  last administration, that was really all you needed to be confirmed to  be on the U.S. Supreme Court.   What the Democrats have done to block his nomination has never been  done before. This is significant. People don't realize--people who are  maybe critical of some of the procedures that were taking place, they  forget the fact that there has never been, in the history of America, a  successful partisan filibuster of a Supreme Court nomination--there has  never been. This will be the first time this happened.   I support the majority leader in changing the rules in the face of  this unprecedented action by a minority party. There is really no  reason for their filibuster of this highly qualified individual, other  than partisanship and catering to their liberal base. Changing the  rules for Supreme Court nominations had to be done, and if the  situation were reversed, the Democrats would have done the same thing  in a heartbeat, as we saw in 2013 when they did the same thing.   Judge Gorsuch deserves to be on the Supreme Court. He does not  deserve to be blocked because people are upset that we observed the  Biden rule; that is, not providing for any action on a nominee for a  Supreme Court vacancy once the election season is underway--and they  lost the election.   Now, that is Joe Biden, not Jim Inhofe.  [[Page S2404]]    In addition to his impeccable job and experience and educational  background, he is perhaps best known for his defense of religious  liberty, including a role in the dispute during the Obama  administration that required employers to provide abortion-inducing  drugs to their employees as part of their health insurance. One of  these employers was Hobby Lobby.   Everyone knows who Hobby Lobby is, but not everyone knew them back  when I knew them. I knew them back in the 1970s, when the Green family,  who started Hobby Lobby, were actually operating out of their garage,  making picture frames, and look at them today. I have known them for a  long time. They started out their whole business with a $600 loan. Now  they have over 700 stores across the United States and are the largest  privately owned arts and crafts store in the world.   Judge Gorsuch and the Supreme Court agreed with Hobby Lobby and  upheld their religious liberty rights. I am going to read to my  colleagues his concurring opinion. It is very profound. Judge Gorsuch  wrote, after they made the determination that Hobby Lobby did not have  to give these drugs to their employees:         It is not for secular courts to rewrite the religious       complaint of a faithful adherent, or to decide whether a       religious teaching about complicity imposes ``too much''       moral disapproval on those only ``indirectly'' assisting       wrongful conduct. Whether an act of complicity is or isn't       ``too attenuated'' from the underlying wrong is sometimes       itself a matter of faith we must respect the faith.    Now, that is what he wrote in Hobby Lobby.   In a very similar situation around the same timeframe, there was a  case that is known now to be the Little Sisters of the Poor. He joined  in an opinion defending the rights of nuns not to be forced to pay for  abortion-inducing drugs in their healthcare plans. This is another  profound statement he made. He said: ``When a law demands that a person  do something the person considers sinful, and the penalty for refusal  is a large financial penalty, then the law imposes a substantial burden  on that person's free exercise of religion.''   It is not just petitioners of the Christian faith whom Judge Gorsuch  has sided with. He upheld the religious beliefs of a Native American  prisoner and of a Muslim prisoner who found their ability to practice  their faith restricted in one manner or another.   He comes to his decision not because he is seeking some predetermined  outcome; he comes to his decisions because that is where the facts of  the law and the Constitution lead him.   For example, in the Lynch case--another Oklahoma case--Gorsuch  referred to Chevron deference as ``a judge-made doctrine for the  abdication of the judicial duty.''   Chevron deference is the judicial rule that requires judges to defer  to an agency's interpretation--we are talking about a bureaucracy--an  agency's interpretation of the law if the law is considered ambiguous  or unclear and if the agency's interpretation is reasonable. This  defense to the agency gives them a lot of authority, a lot of power.  Moreover, it can provide a lot of uncertainty to the regulated  community.   As Judge Gorsuch wrote, Chevron deference allows agencies to  ``reverse its current view 180 degrees any time based merely on the  shift of political winds and still prevail [in court].''   I know a little bit about this. I spent a lot of years being the  chairman of a committee called the Environment and Public Works  Committee. During the Obama years, we had a bureaucracy that was trying  to change the law instead of following the law. It was exactly what  Judge Gorsuch was talking about in this case when he talked about the  Chevron deference, giving deference to a bureaucracy. You can imagine  being in business, especially a heavily regulated one, that has to  worry that every 4 to 8 years the rules might change then and how do  you plan to make your plans.   I think Gorsuch's opinion on Chevron deference is an important debate  to have. Do we, as a coequal branch of government, continue to give up  our powers to the administrative state or do we take our power back and  write laws as they should be implemented? Furthermore, does the  judicial branch, as a coequal branch of government, continue to give up  their power of interpretation to the administrative state?   These are important, fundamental questions that should be addressed,  and I am glad the Gorsuch nomination has brought these cases to light.   Although Judge Gorsuch was nominated by a Republican President, this  doesn't mean my colleagues on the other side of the aisle should have  any concern about Judge Gorsuch's decisionmaking ability. This is  important to point out because being a judge is not about making  decisions that are in the best interests of any political party but  really about making decisions based on facts and the law and the  Constitution without bias.   During his confirmation, Judge Gorsuch stated his judicial  philosophy, saying:         I decide cases . . . I listen to the arguments made. I read       the briefs that are put to me. I listen to my colleagues       carefully and I listen to the lawyers in the well . . .       keeping an open mind through the entire process as best I       humanly can and I leave all the other stuff at home. And I       make a decision based on the facts and the law.    Who can argue with that? He has proven over a period of time that he  will do that.   Through the whole debate, it has become evident that the Democrats  were asking him to rule in favor of causes and not to follow the law,  which is what a judge does and should do.   Regarding the roles and balance of our government, Gorsuch is what a  judge should be. He believes Congress should write the laws, the  executive branch is to carry them out, and the judicial branch is to  interpret the laws. The confirmation of Judge Gorsuch will shape our  Nation for generations to come, and all of us will be able to benefit  from his wise decisions.   I am looking forward to confirming Judge Neil Gorsuch. It is going to  happen tomorrow, and then all of this will be over. I am proud to give  him my vote. Justice will be well served as such.   With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
