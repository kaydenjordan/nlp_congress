 Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  resolution.   Madam Speaker, from the very start of this inquiry, the White House  has obstructed the House of Representatives. The White House has  ignored duly authorized subpoenas and has tried to prevent witnesses  from testifying.   The White House has also directed other agencies to do the same. The  Department of State, the Department of Energy, the Department of  Defense, and the Office of Management and Budget all have refused to  produce a single document in response to valid subpoenas.   This is an unprecedented cover-up. The White House and its defenders  in Congress have tried to justify it with baseless procedural claims  that contradict the Constitution and historical precedent.   History will judge us all.   After today, there are no more excuses for those who want to focus on  process instead of substance. After today, there are no more excuses  for those who want to ignore the facts instead of defending the  Constitution. And there are no more excuses for those who turn a blind  eye while the President pressures foreign actors to interfere with our  democracy.
