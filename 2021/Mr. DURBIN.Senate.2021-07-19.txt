 Madam President, in response to the minority leader's  statement about the changes in voting laws across America, the record  speaks for itself. I believe the number is 17--17 States which have set  out to specifically limit previous opportunities under law to vote.   Is it a coincidence that 17 States would do these things? I don't  think so. I think it is by design. That is why the Senate Rules  Committee was in Georgia today, to talk specifically about the measures  that they took after the last election.   Remember, this is all being done in the context of a former  President, the sorest loser in the history of the United States, and  his Big Lie about what was wrong with the last election. Well, I can  tell you what was not wrong with the last election. In many States, the  turnout broke records. More Americans eligible to vote turned up to  vote, and that is a good thing in a democracy.   When it comes to allegations of fraud, all of the money that has been  spent on lawsuits, all of the allegations of voter fraud that have been  investigated, it turns out to be a handful of cases, maybe a dozen out  of millions of votes cast in the United States. So there is no argument  for changing election voting laws based on fraud. There certainly is no  argument when it comes to the outcome of the election. That was clear,  and it has been to everyone except one former President for a long  time. Yet the Republicans, when in control of State legislatures, are  by design trying to make it more difficult for some people to vote.  Why? The answer is very simple: The demographics of America are not on  the side of the Republican Party.   The new voters in this country are moving away from them, away from  Donald Trump, away from their party creed that they preach. Instead,  they are moving to be Independents or even vote on the other side. To  argue and fight against that, the Republicans in legislative settings  are reducing and restricting the opportunity to vote. That is what it  is all about.   The Senator from Kentucky attributes it to hysteria. It is not. It is  a genuine concern over whether in this country, where democracy is our  creed and our goal in every election, we have the most participation,  fair participation, by eligible voters that we have ever had, and we  continue to build on that.                            ____________________     Madam President, on a separate issue, I cannot imagine  what life would be like if I were a kid growing up in America, always  wondering if something I said, something I did, some action that was  taken by some member of my family would result in a knock on the door  and my family being torn apart, my father or mother being deported to  another country. But for hundreds of thousands of young people living  in America, that has been the reality of their childhood.   Most of them, brought to this country at a very early age--infants  and toddlers and young people--had nothing to say about the choice of  America as home, but they always assumed it was their home. They grew  up in this country, went to the schools, got up every morning in the  classroom and pledged allegiance to the flag, believing they were truly  Americans. It wasn't, for many of them, until their teenage years that  their parents sat down with them very quietly and solemnly told them:  You have a challenge in your life you didn't even realize. You are  undocumented. You were brought to this country by us as a little kid,  and you don't have any papers. If you are challenged, if you are  arrested, you could be deported. And the same thing might just happen  to your mother or your father.   I can't imagine, with all of the stress of childhood and adolescence,  having that worry as well. Yet, for hundreds of thousands of young  people, through no fault of their own, that was part of their lives.   That came to my attention 20 years ago, a case in Chicago, which I  have spoken about on the floor many times, where a young girl finally  realized at the end of high school the really stark choices she had in  her life, and she reached out to my office. We looked into the  situation. She was brought here to the United States, born in Brazil to  Korean parents, had no legal status in the United States and grew up  here. She wanted to know what to do with her life, what was next for  her.   The law was very harsh, but it was clear as well. At the age of 18,  our law said to Tereza Lee, a young Korean girl in Chicago, you have to  leave the United States for 10 years and petition to return. It didn't  seem right or fair or just to her, and so I introduced the DREAM Act.  That is when I came to realize Tereza's story was not unique. There  were thousands just like her. Over the last 20 years, I have met a lot  of them, an amazing group of young men and women who have done  remarkable things with their lives with limited resources and always  under the shadow of deportation.   The DREAM Act has been brought to the floor of the Senate five  different times and failed--not because it didn't win a majority but  because of the filibuster. So we have tried in those 20 years to get  something done, and we have had our really troublesome moments. I think  back to one of the worst.   Under the previous President, Donald Trump, DACA, a program created  by President Obama for these Dreamers, was really an issue from the  start that we begged President Trump to consider. President Obama, a  friend of mine and former colleague from Illinois, told me that he  spent an extra  [[Page S4939]]  hour in transition with President Trump in the White House, while Obama  was still President. It was supposed to last an hour; it lasted 2  hours. He said to me: I spent that last hour talking about DACA and  Dreamers, telling him how important it was to get this right, that  these young people deserved a chance, and he listened very intently.  President Obama said: ``I hope that he will help you when it comes to  these Dreamers.''   The first time I ever met Donald Trump was on his Inauguration Day as  President, not too far from here at a luncheon, and the first thing I  said to him was, I hope you will give those Dreamers a chance to become  part of America.    He said: Senator Durbin, don't worry. I am going to take care of  those Dreamers.   In the first year of his Presidency, he tried to abolish the DACA  Program and subject these Dreamers to deportation. It was a very dark  period. For many of them, they were despondent. Several of them said  they couldn't take it anymore, the pressure they were under to create a  life in America under the shadow of deportation and now have a  President who was really determined to make them leave America.   Well, the courts took a look at what President Trump had to do, all  the way up to the Supreme Court across the street. It was Chief Justice  Roberts who wrote the decision, which said the method that Donald  Trump's administration used to eliminate DACA was stricken as  ``arbitrary and capricious.''   So there was a new lease on life and a new opportunity for them,  until Friday--when the Federal judge in Texas made the most recent  ruling. On Friday night, a Federal judge in Texas issued a ruling  declaring that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, was  unlawful, and the judge blocked the Biden administration from approving  new DACA applications, a new setback for the Dreamers.   This decision was made in response to a lawsuit filed by Republican  State attorneys general. It was the culmination of a long campaign,  which included the action of President Trump, by Republicans to deport  the Dreamers. What is it about these young people that infuriates the  Republicans so much? Well, I will tell you what I found as I have come  to know them. They are some of the most amazing stories you could  imagine. Not just the threat that I mentioned earlier, the shadow of  deportation over their lives, but what they have done anyway--becoming  doctors and nurses and teachers and engineers, serving in our Army,  working for America in essential jobs in the midst of a pandemic. It is  an amazing group of people. It is just the kind of people we want and  need for the future of this country.   But let me state this unequivocally: The cruel and misguided decision  of this court will not stand. DACA is a lawful exercise of executive  prosecutorial discretion by the Department of Homeland Security. More  than 800,000 young people in our country have received DACA protection,  and they help save lives every day as nurses and doctors and first  responders. They contribute to our economy and our future as business  owners, engineers, and teachers. They are a vital part of our  communities as friends, family members, and loved ones. America is the  only home these Dreamers have ever known, and Congress has waited long  enough--in fact, it has waited too long to allow them to finally become  American citizens.   Friday's ruling is yet another reminder of the hell that these young  people have put up with over the past two decades. Under the Trump  administration, Dreamers endured one attack after another.   When former President Trump attempted to repeal DACA, it put hundreds  of thousands of young people at risk of being deported to countries  they didn't even remember.   When the Supreme Court ruled that the former President's repeal of  DACA was unlawful, he simply defied the Court's decision and stopped  DACA applicants from being approved. For months, President Trump  refused to reopen the program for new applicants despite the clear  direction of the U.S. Supreme Court. Approximately 300,000 of these  young people were unable to receive the protections they deserved  because of President Trump's unilateral, hateful action.   In response to a court order, DACA was finally reopened for the new  applicants in December, but now, just as the Biden administration is  processing these applications, the door was shut again in the Federal  court in Texas on Friday.   In the words of one Dreamer, Adonias Arevalo, ``It's such an  uncertainty, not to be able to plan my life.''   Thankfully, President Biden has vowed to appeal this decision, but we  need to prevent conservative judicial activists on the bench,  politicians in black robes, from striking down the President's lawful  efforts to protect Dreamers. Congress cannot wait any longer. America  cannot wait any longer. Senate Democrats need to provide a permanent  legislative solution for the Dreamers. We need to act swiftly.   I hope that my Republican colleagues with conscience will think long  and hard about whether they are going to stand in the way of the  Dreamers at this moment in history. We need their help, and not just  some halfhearted symbolic attempt but genuinely to give these young  people a fighting chance to make America a better nation.   To all the Dreamers out there, I promise you, we will work as hard as  necessary to get this job done as quickly as possible.                            ____________________     Madam President, on Saturday night, baseball fans at  Nationals Park here in Washington, DC, not far from where we stand,  were sent into a panic by a sound that has become all too familiar in  American cities: the sound of gunfire.   In the middle of the sixth inning, the teams left the field when it  was reported that three people were shot outside the stadium on South  Capitol Street. That burst of gunfire reverberated throughout the  stadium. It could be heard on television and radio broadcasts of the  game. It was bad; it could have been worse. Thankfully, nobody inside  the stadium was harmed, and many thanks to the first responders for  keeping the attendees safe.   But the photos and videos from Saturday night tell a clear story. We  are a nation that has become traumatized by gun violence.   The Fourth of July weekend, the city of Chicago, a city I dearly love  and am honored to represent, there were 104 gunshot victims that  weekend, 19 deaths.   We have come to accept, sadly, mass shooting as a possibility  anywhere in America, at a baseball park, in a movie theater, in houses  of worship, even in our schools.   Mass shootings happen on the streets of Chicago almost every weekend.  Just this last weekend, more than 50 were shot in our city, including 7  children and teenagers. The sad reality is gun violence has become as  American as baseball.   The question before this Senate again and again and again is, Will we  do anything about it? Will we take minimum steps to reduce gun violence  in America, steps like making it more difficult for convicted felons  and unstable people to buy firearms?   Nearly every American supports that, and yet the gaps in the Federal  gun laws continue. Right now, it is simply too easy for a convicted  felon or person with a history of serious mental illness to buy a gun  from an unlicensed dealer. A person--no questions asked--can easily buy  a gun from an unlicensed seller just minutes away from the city of  Chicago, in the State of Indiana, and that gun will be sold and resold  many times over in our city of Chicago--many times the same day.   In March, the House passed H.R. 8, a bipartisan measure to close the  gaps in our background checks system. Senator Chris Murphy of  Connecticut and Senator Manchin of West Virginia have been leading  negotiations to get bipartisan support for that bill in the Senate. I  am waiting for their signal, and I hope to receive it--that we are  ready to move on that legislation.   I hope Senate Republicans will join us in supporting this and other  commonsense measures, like confirming a Director for the Agency that  enforces the gun laws on the book--ATF--for the first time since 2015.  Too many lives have been lost to gun violence in  [[Page S4940]]  this country. It is time for us to come together and put an end to the  senseless violence.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  and the Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kelly) are necessarily absent.
