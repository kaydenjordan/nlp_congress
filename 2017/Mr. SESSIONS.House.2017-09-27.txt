 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 538 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 538         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House, without intervention of       any question of consideration, the bill (H.R. 3823) to amend       title 49, United States Code, to extend authorizations for       the airport improvement program, to amend the Internal       Revenue Code of 1986 to extend the funding and expenditure       authority of the Airport and Airway Trust Fund, to provide       disaster tax relief, and for other purposes. All points of       order against consideration of the bill are waived. The       amendment printed in the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution shall be considered as adopted.       The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All points       of order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are       waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill, as amended, and on any further amendment       thereto, to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate, with 40 minutes equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Ways and Means and 20 minutes equally divided       and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of       the Committee on Financial Services; and (2) one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  It shall be in order at any time on the       legislative day of September 28, 2017, for the Speaker to       entertain motions that the House suspend the rules as though       under clause 1 of rule XV. The Speaker or his designee shall       consult with the Minority Leader or her designee on the       designation of any matter for consideration pursuant to this       section.    Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms.  Slaughter), the ranking member, pending which I yield myself such time  as I may consume. During consideration of this resolution, all time  yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this rule and  the underlying legislation. The rule provides for consideration of H.R.  3823, the Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of  2017.   Mr. Speaker, the whole world is aware of a series of storms that have  hit not only America's shores but those shores of so many of our  territories, including the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico.                                time  1530    A series of these hurricanes over the past few weeks has caused great  devastation in Texas, Florida, Georgia, Puerto Rico, and, of course,  again, the U.S. Virgin Islands. These are people who are American  citizens, and they are in these territories, and they are suffering  from loss and devastation, and we have never seen an occurrence like  this with two storms in succession.   While there remains much to be done and evaluated, this legislation  takes important steps, I believe, that are necessary to begin providing  relief to those individuals. We have had a lot of debate not only on  this floor and not only at the Rules Committee, but certainly in the  U.S. House of Representatives and the public media about what steps  need to be taken, who needs to be there first, what FEMA's  responsibility is, what the responsibility is for HUD, what the  responsibility is for States, and what the responsibility is for  citizens and their local communities. But the bottom line is that much  of the evaluation, the undertaking of saving of lives, trying to work  to save more property and to be there in support of people, is an  ongoing project that will take a long period of time.   Specifically, this underlying legislation helps to address five  targeted and meaningful tax provisions that provide relief and make it  easier for people to recover and to return to their homes and to make  long-term decisions from a money and tax perspective.   It will allow hurricane victims to keep more of their paychecks,  deduct more of the cost of their expensive property damage, and provide  more affordable and immediate access to retirement savings should  people decide that they would choose to go that direction at this  difficult time in their life.   This legislation also encourages more Americans--Americans who see  what is happening--and companies to be able to donate, to donate to  those who are in need by temporarily suspending limitations on the  deductions for charitable contributions for hurricane relief efforts  this year. This is an important step, and it removes obstacles that  might be in the way for the public to get involved and to help their  fellow citizens.   Taken together, these five tax provisions go a long way, we believe,  in helping these people recover from these storms.   The rule also makes clarifications to ensure Puerto Rico and the U.S.  Virgin Islands are treated equitably in all tax sections of this bill.   I spent time this week speaking with the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico  (Miss Gonzalez-Colon) and the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms.  Plaskett) in talking about not only their immediate needs, but also the  long-term needs. Both were vigorous in not only their request for help,  but also, equally, I think, balanced in their request for the  legislation that would take place today.   They represent so many hardworking people, people who are proud  people in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and they are looking for  a way to work through not only where they are, but, in looking forward  over the long term, about how they are going to put their islands back  together.   I have had many phone conversations with both of them over the last  48 hours. They have asked for our prayers, they have asked for our  help, and I have pledged to do both. But I told them that I believe  this House of Representatives would very carefully understand their  special request at this time because the islands are under increased  pressure simply to get planes that would land to allow not only the  bringing in of emergency supplies, but also taking out people who would  need to come ashore, for those that might be children, elderly people,  or the sick.   In addition to the tax provisions of H.R. 3823, which addresses some  of the frailties of the Flood Insurance Program, we have included  important reform pieces that are pro-consumer and increase competition  at a very difficult time now that these hurricanes have landed on our  shores. This provides options for all Americans.   The language that passed out of the Financial Services Committee 58-0  and on the floor of the House last year 419-0 has now been placed in  this bill, also. We believe it is another example of bipartisan  support, not only by the gentleman from the Financial Services  Committee, Jeb Hensarling, but also his ranking member, Maxine Waters,  who very carefully, last year, in preparation probably for what would  lie ahead in the future, to provide a free market opportunity for more  people to receive flood insurance. It is part of this package. It  passed here last year 419-0. It is an integral part of what might be an  answer maybe only for a few people, but it is an option and an  opportunity, and I appreciate Chairman Hensarling and Maxine Waters for  being a part of passing that last year out of the Financial Services  Committee 58-0.   This bill also reauthorizes the FAA, the Federal Aviation  Administration, for 6 months, their funding levels, which would, I  believe, be most important to all areas of the country. This is a  bipartisan bill.   This is an opportunity for people who live in rural areas and people  who live in urban areas to note that the FAA, day in and day out, 24  hours a day, is a vital part of the important transportation component  of landing planes, bringing people to and from work and back safely. It  also is a part of our families who travel the system, and the Federal  Aviation Administration, the FAA, needs this money and needs the  operational capacity to move forward.   It also comes at a critical time when the radar system that is in  Puerto Rico has failed, and it is necessary that we continue to fund  the programs at the FAA so that they can get these systems back up and  online to increase traffic to meet the needs of the islands and to make  sure that this is done safely.   Now is not a time to play games with an essential program, and I  believe that this is very important for each of the Members to  understand. This is a vital part of this package.   Finally, the underlying legislation extends several expiring health  programs that would be finishing at the end of the year, including the  Teaching Health Center Graduate Medical Education program and the  Special Diabetes Program for Native Americans.    I do want to note that this package is focused on health programs  that are expiring, and Chairman Greg Walden from Hood River, Oregon,  who is the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, has every  intent to make sure that he will move legislation extending funding for  CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance Program, because we know that it  expires soon. The chairman has looked into this and certified back to  me that the money that is necessary to keep this program going is not  in jeopardy and that he looks forward to a time when he can move CHIP  not only to where it is considered on the floor, but to the Rules  Committee, where it can be equally and fairly debated.   Before concluding my opening statements, I just want to affirm to the  people in my home State of Texas and other areas affected by these  disasters that this is the second of a series of responses to these  natural disasters. On September 8, this body, the United States House  of Representatives, passed initial emergency response legislation,  providing $15.3 billion in aid.   To provide some historical context, in 2005, Hurricane Katrina hit  the United States in August, followed by Hurricanes Rita and Wilma in  September and October. The House responded by passing an initial  response in September to provide immediate emergency relief; then,  after some evaluation, determined the actual needs on the ground, that  is, by an analysis that took place, and that is when the House passed a  more comprehensive package that included many of the provisions that  are in here that we are doing, but they did that in December.   There was some debate yesterday at the Rules Committee about the  timing,  [[Page H7542]]  about delay, and I assured the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings),  who is a distinguished member of our committee, that, while I did not  know the exact timing or delay, what might be a delay in that timing,  that I believe that that is forthcoming; that, as there is a broader  evaluation, as time moves on, as we go from saving people, trying to do  recovery, to where we then move to the next phases of this opportunity,  we will then know more specifically the needs of programs, the work  that needs to be done by this Congress, and the help that we can  provide to these areas.   I want to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings) not only  for his vigorous, what I believe, support of making sure that people-- albeit they might be in Florida, but where they were a part of these  storms, I felt Mr. Hastings' care and concern for them, to make sure  that what the House of Representatives did was well managed, and I  appreciate his feedback.   This body has every intention of providing further relief to our  fellow Americans. We also understand that the Federal Government, while  it has responsibilities, it does so by working with the States. It is  done through FEMA.   I have been personally very pleased not only with the actions of  President Trump and this administration, but I want to add that I am  proud of the House of Representatives. I believe the leadership that  Paul Ryan has provided not only by being on the ground and looking at  these areas, but also staying up to date on a day-to-day basis means  that the House is nimble and able to move forward as we need to.   What we are talking about today is targeted tax relief for those in  need, ensuring the FAA can continue its functions allowing planes to  land in Puerto Rico, and continuing our emergency responses.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the honorable and  distinguished gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would advise the gentlewoman, my  colleague, that I have one more speaker left, so she may run down the  time as she chooses.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate the distinguished gentlewoman bringing this up. Perhaps,  Mr. Speaker, she was not in the body on the floor earlier when I  brought up  [[Page H7544]]  what I believe is an answer to this CHIP--Children's Health Insurance  Program--reauthorization.   I talked specifically with the chairman of the Energy and Commerce  Committee, Greg Walden, who is very excited about the opportunity to  move the CHIP bill. The opportunity to do this is not dire or urgent.  As a matter of fact, there is money in the bucket right now to fund, as  it has been, the program to continue.   Chairman Walden indicated that, while he does understand that the  program is scheduled to run through September 30, that the analysis  from the nonpartisan Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission  shows that States have enough funds remaining in their accounts through  the end of this year.                                time  1600    Chairman Walden is interested in looking at it again and gaining  information about it to see what sorts of changes, additions, or  updates that we choose to do. He intends to do that in and through the  committee providing information on a bipartisan basis. I trust not only  what Greg Walden said, but I also know of his desire to deal  effectively in this manner.   I want to thank the gentlewoman from Illinois for bringing up this  important question, and I want to provide a timely answer to her, and I  appreciate her very much.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Mr. Speaker, responding to the gentlewoman, I do not,  but I will talk to Chairman Walden immediately, and I will come and  find you during the vote, or as we end here, and I will let you know.   I appreciate, once again, Mr. Speaker, that the gentlewoman is very  concerned, as is her committee, about children's programs, women's  programs, and she would expect me to respond accordingly, and I will  talk to Chairman Walden and get back to her with an answer.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   A good bit of the dialogue that is occurring today has been an active  discussion for a long period of time in the Financial Services  Committee--Jeb Hensarling from Dallas, Texas, the chairman of that  committee.   One of our bright young stars is from Tampa, Florida, and his name is  Dennis Ross. And Mr. Ross has heard the debate going on and came down  here. He has been an active part of not only understanding the needs of  communities, but, more importantly, how we are going to have a fix and  answer in a long-term way to look at this flooding problem and the  Federal flood program.  [[Page H7545]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Ross).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this discussion that we are having here on point that we  have now had two speakers from my side, Mr. Ross and Mr. Graves, who  have come down to talk about the debate that has been well alive across  the country, about how we deal with emergencies, how we deal with  flooding, how we deal with the opportunity for States, and communities,  and citizens, the free enterprise system, and what I would say FEMA, or  the Federal Government, to get closer in understanding the needs of  communities, and the answers to long-term decisions that take place.   What you heard Mr. Ross talk about was a bill that he worked on with  the gentlewoman, a Democratic colleague from Tampa, and they worked on  this piece of legislation, got it passed 58-0 out of the Financial  Services Committee, 419-0 on this vote. We need to pass--we need to  include this. We need to put this as part of the options, an option  that would be available for people back home, no matter where that is,  to have a chance to have more control of their own lives, to work in  their own communities.                                time  1615    I really appreciate the gentleman, Mr. Ross, coming to talk to us  today. The hard work that he and Kathy Castor, the gentlewoman from  Tampa, did on a bipartisan basis comes to play. Even though they did it  a year ago, it would be in play today, and it will be in play 1 year  from now, when storms come back, as an option and opportunity. Instead  of us searching for answers, it would be one of the answers available.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   They say that success has many fathers, and you could say many  mothers. Success is, many times, in the eye of the beholder. But when  lots of people see it, they can get better prepared, and then people  see that as a model.   I would like to take just a minute, if I can, and talk about a model  of success that I use. Back home, I have an opportunity to meet with a  number of subject matter experts on issues and ideas. One of them is a  man named Bill Dewey. Bill Dewey is an air traffic controller at DFW  Airport in Dallas, Texas. Mr. Dewey and I take time to sit down and  understand the intricacies of his job, the FAA air traffic controller-- safety, planes.   DFW is home to American Airlines. Mr. Dewey handles traffic that goes  to Dallas Love Field, home for Southwest Airlines.   What Mr. Dewey has done with me is given me, from a working  professional relationship that he has as not only a former member of  the United States military as an air traffic controller but real live  in the tower at DFW Airport, day after day, seeing how important the  FAA is.   We should remember, Mr. Speaker, that it is not just money and time  that we are doing here. We are patting the employees of these agencies.  The FAA has so many dedicated employees--just like Bill Dewey, my dear  friend, who is at DFW Airport. This also is a support for those  employees to let them know that we are going to fund their programs and  we are going to take care of them. So we should, at the same time we do  that, say ``thank you'' to the men and women who are there 24 hours  around the clock to provide safety.   We have now been a number of years where we have not had a plane  crash with a fatality, and we are lucky. Part of it goes to the safety  of the system at the FAA.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, what a shock it is to see the President  attacked when he is the one who is going to make sure, by challenging  Congress, that we get this issue done.   Mr. Speaker, there was a question the gentlewoman, my dear colleague,  Ms. Slaughter, asked. The question is timely and important, and I would  like to respond back to her. She asked about the health center program,  and the answer I have gotten back from the chairman of the Energy and  Commerce Committee, Mr. Walden, the gentleman from Hood River, Oregon,  who is a phenomenal leader to this conference, is that it will not have  to access mandatory appropriations until early December, and that  Chairman Walden understands and appreciates that the gentlewoman, the  ranking member of the Rules Committee, Ms. Slaughter, has asked a  question, and he thanks you for asking that. He understands that we do  have a timing issue and is preparing quickly to address this issue. He  wanted me to thank the gentlewoman for bringing that up at this time.   I want to thank Chairman Walden for that message.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   I want to thank my colleague not only for this long week that we have  had at the Rules Committee, but I also want to thank her other members,  the gentleman from Worcester, Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), and the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings), for not only their vigorous  debate and conversations that we have had, but actually trying to  prepare us at the Rules Committee for that which we believe would lie  ahead.   Today, you heard the gentlewoman ask about several important issues.  Part of our job is to kind of pitch and catch, and that is to catch the  things that come our way. But she is using her vision to look ahead,  and I admire that. I do owe her answers, and her background and  experience would tell her, let's get moving on these things if we are  going to get them done. I hope that I have provided her with feedback  from the gentleman, Mr. Walden, saying exactly that.   Mr. Speaker, as the hurricane was still over Houston, Texas, dumping  50 inches of rain, I received a conference call from a number of people  in Houston as they were preparing to reestablish not only their own  communities within Houston, but also the livelihood of the business  community, and to be prepared.   I got a conference call from a group of gentlemen, Mr. Tom  Singletary, Mr. Kevin Hedges, Mr. Steve Kessling, Mr. Wallace B.  Livesay, and Mr. Steve Raben from Houston. They called me and said: We  need, as quickly as we can, to get information about taxes, about  people pulling money out of their IRAs, and what the rules and  regulations would be for that.   Mr. Speaker, part of my job is to respond to people, to listen to  them, and to listen to their needs. I will tell you that the Houston  delegation, on a bipartisan basis, up and down the coast, going down to  Blake Farenthold in Corpus Christi, all the way up to Garret Graves who  is in Louisiana, felt the fury of Mother Nature. But it didn't mean  that it had to divide us or to defeat us.   I have seen nothing but resolve that has come from not only those in  Texas but also those in Florida, our two colleagues, Jenniffer Gonzalez  who is located in Puerto Rico, and Stacey Plaskett who is a fine young  Delegate out of the Virgin Islands. They have asked for help. They have  asked for the things that would be necessary.   But our ability to effectively listen and turn around in the form of  legislation, our ability to be able to schedule meetings and, on a  bipartisan basis, be able to talk and sometimes agree and sometimes  disagree but to get our work done is an amazing part of this experiment  that we are engaged in.  [[Page H7547]]    I, myself, Mr. Speaker, want to thank you for not only your hard work  of being here today but being a part of this process. As all of us work  together, we can make this process work and give confidence to the  American people. That confidence is expressed with what we do today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this rule and the  underlying bill.   The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:            An Amendment to H. Res. 538 Offered by Ms. Slaughter         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the       Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       3440) to authorize the cancellation of removal and adjustment       of status of certain individuals who are long-term United       States residents and who entered the United States as       children and for other purposes. The first reading of the       bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in       the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been       adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and       reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then       on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately       after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of       rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further       consideration of the bill.        Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 3440.                                   ____           The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no       substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.''       But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the       Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in       the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition,       page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous       question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally       not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member       controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the       motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the       time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering       the previous question. That Member, because he then controls       the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for       the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''        Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
