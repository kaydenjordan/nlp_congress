 Mr. President, I was necessarily absent for  vote No. 120 on the motion to proceed to H.R. 5515, the National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019. On vote No. 120, had I  been present, I would have voted yea on the motion to proceed to H.R.  5515.                            ____________________
