 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  permitted to speak for 5 minutes, as well as Senator Hirono and Senator  Cotton for 5 minutes each, prior to the order for 11:30 a.m.    Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of Senate  amendment No. 1445 that Senator Hirono and I have introduced.   I want to begin by thanking my colleague from Hawaii for working with  me on this amendment and acknowledging her leadership. I also want to  thank Senators Grassley, Blumenthal, Moran, and Warnock for their  contributions as well.   Crimes motivated by bias against race, national origin, or other  characteristics simply cannot be tolerated. Our amendment both  denounces these acts and marshals additional resources toward  addressing and stopping these despicable crimes.   The amendment that the Senator from Hawaii and I are offering today  will improve the underlying bill in a number of key ways, while it will  affirm our steadfast commitment to stand with the Asian-American,  Pacific Islander community against all forms of violence and  harassment.   First, our amendment strongly condemns the hate crimes targeting the  AAPI community. In the past year, Stop AAPI Hate reported nearly 3,800  cases of anti-Asian discrimination. The Center for the Study of Hate  and Extremism found that the reporting of anti-Asian hate crimes  increased by 145 percent in 16 major cities even though hate crimes  declined in those cities overall.   Racially motivated discrimination and violence should never be  tolerated.   I want to thank Senator Grassley and Senator Warnock for their  contributions to this section of our amendment.   Second, the Hirono-Collins amendment directs the Attorney General to  assign a point person at the Department of Justice to expedite the  review of these hate crimes and requires the Attorney General to issue  guidance to State, local, and Tribal law enforcement partners about how  to address them. Our amendment would also improve data collection and  expand public awareness about hate crimes and ways to support victims.  With better information, we can help prevent these crimes before they  occur and assist law enforcement in bringing the perpetrators to  justice.   Third, our amendment incorporates the Jabara-Heyer NO HATE Act,  authored by Senators Blumenthal and Moran. This bipartisan bill, which  I have cosponsored, provides State and local governments and law  enforcement agencies with additional tools and resources to understand,  identify, and report hate crimes. It provides grants to State and local  governments for training and for using the FBI's national hate crimes  database to create reporting hotlines and to support community  engagement around prevention and services for victims. This is  important because far too many hate crimes go unreported, and without  data, it is difficult to investigate and prosecute them.   Again, let me thank the Senator from Hawaii for her leadership on  this amendment. I enjoyed working with her to strengthen and improve  the bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it. In doing so, we can  send an unmistakably strong signal that crimes targeting Asian  Americans and Pacific Islanders in our country will not be tolerated.    Mr. President, the Senate's passage of this legislation  affirms our commitment to stand with the Asian-American and Pacific  Islander community against hate crimes. I urge a ``yes'' vote   I thank my colleague from Hawaii for working with me to improve the  Asian-Americans Hate Crimes Act. Crimes motivated by bias against race,  national origin, and other characteristics cannot be tolerated.   The Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism found that reporting of  anti-Asian hate crimes increased by 145 percent in 16 major cities,  even though hate crimes declined in those cities overall.   The amendment we adopted today and the bill we are about to pass  denounces those acts and marshals additional resources toward stopping  these despicable crimes. The bill directs the Department of Justice to  expedite its review of hate crimes and to issue guidance that will both  help prevent them from occurring and improve their reporting.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleagues  Senator Cardin, Senator Marshall, and Senator Shaheen, to introduce the  Home Health Emergency Access to Telehealth (HEAT) Act. This bipartisan  bill would help ensure that seniors who rely on home health care have  the choice to receive these critical services through telehealth during  the COVID-19 pandemic and future public health emergencies.   COVID-19 is the greatest public health challenge since the flu  pandemic of 1918 and has claimed the lives of more than 565,000  Americans. This public health emergency has underscored the need for  older adults and other at-risk populations to have access to health  care in the home setting. Home-based care is crucial to ensuring that  this pandemic does not create devastating long-term health consequences  due to delayed care. The highly skilled and compassionate care that  home health agencies provide is an important component of this in-home  care.   I have been a strong supporter of home care since my very first home  visit, which took place in my hometown in Aroostook County early in my  Senate service. This experience gave me the opportunity to meet and  visit with home health patients, where I saw first-hand what a  difference highly skilled and caring visiting nurses and other health  care professionals make to the lives of patients and their families. I  have been a passionate advocate for home care ever since.   Last year, my bipartisan home health legislation, the Home Health  Care Planning Improvement Act, became law as part of the Coronavirus  Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. This law, which I  championed for 13 years, will improve the access Medicare beneficiaries  have to home health care by allowing physician assistants, nurse  practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and certified nurse midwives  to order home health services. Far too often seniors experience  unnecessary delays in accessing home health care. To avoid these  needless delays, it is common sense that other medical professionals  who are familiar with a patient's case should be able to order these  services.   Home health professionals have continued to provide face-to-face  services during the COVID-19 public health emergency, but this crisis  has created additional challenges, including the need to maintain an  adequate supply of personal protective equipment to protect themselves,  their patients, and their patients' families. The use of telehealth and  virtual visits can help address these challenges. Unlike other Medicare  providers, however, home health agencies are not eligible to receive  Medicare reimbursement for telehealth services during the COVID-19  emergency.   Last May, I chaired Congress' first hearing examining COVID-19's  devastating impact on seniors. During the hearing, Dr. Steven Landers,  President and CEO of the Visiting Nurse Association Health Group,  testified that, despite this lack of Medicare reimbursement, his  organization has found telehealth to be an essential part of providing  high quality home health care during the COVID-19 public health  emergency. He urged action to ensure that home health providers can  continue offering these critical services remotely.   Maine home health care providers have also shared their stories about  how telehealth is helping them to continue caring for their patients  during COVID-19. Through a combination of video visits and care calls,  one provider has been able to care for a woman with severe heart and  lung disease and keep this patient out of the hospital. The nurse would  speak with the woman by phone a couple of times per week to assess any  symptoms that needed follow up. If the nurse identified an issue during  the call, she would schedule a video visit and also work with the  patient's physician to modify medications as needed.   The bill we are introducing today would authorize Medicare  reimbursement for home health services provided through telehealth  during an emergency period. The services would not be reimbursed unless  the beneficiary consents to receiving the services via telehealth. To  ensure that the Medicare home health benefit does not become a  telehealth-only benefit, Medicare reimbursement would only be provided  if the telehealth services constitute no more than half of the billable  visits made during the 30-day payment period. The Secretary of Health  and Human Services would be required to issue guidance on the  authorization of and payment for home health services provided via  telehealth.   Home health serves a vital role in helping our Nation's seniors avoid  more costly hospital visits and nursing home stays. The COVID-19  emergencyhas further underscored the critical importance of home health  services and highlighted how these agencies are able to use telehealth  to provide skilled care to their patients. The Home Health Emergency  Access to Telehealth (HEAT) Act would ensure that seniors in Maine and  across the country retain access to remote home health services during  the COVID-19 emergency and future public health emergencies.   Thank you, Mr. President.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Wyden, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Brown,          Mr. Reed, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Markey, and Ms.          Hirono):   S. 1314. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide  tax rate parity among all tobacco products, and for other purposes; to  the Committee on Finance.    Mr. President, today is Earth Day, and there are many  issues, environmental challenges, that each of us could be discussing  here on the Senate floor.   I have chosen to speak on a bill that I am introducing today that is  called the Comprehensive National Mercury Monitoring Act. I am pleased  to be partnering, once again, with my colleague from Delaware, Senator  Carper, who serves as the chairman of the Senate Environment and Public  Works Committee. Our bipartisan bill would help ensure that we have  accurate information about the extent of mercury pollution in our  country.   Mercury is a potent neurotoxin. It poses significant ecological and  public health concerns, especially for children and pregnant women.  Mercury exposure has gone down as U.S. mercury emissions have declined.  However, the levels remain unacceptably high.   It is estimated that nearly 200,000 children born in the United  States have been exposed to levels of mercury in the womb that are high  enough to impair their neurological development. This exposure can  impose a lifelong disability.   In addition, the societal costs of neurocognitive deficits associated  with mercury exposure are estimated to be approximately $4.8 billion  per year.   In Maine, some of our lands and bodies of water face higher mercury  pollution compared to the national average. Maine has been called the  tailpipe of the Nation, as the winds carrying pollution, including  mercury, from the West drift into the State of Maine   A system for collecting information, such as we have for acid rain  and other forms of pollution, does not currently exist for mercury,  which, ironically, is a more toxic pollutant. A comprehensive mercury  monitoring network is needed to protect human health, safeguard our  fisheries, and track the effect of emission reductions. This monitoring  network would also help policymakers, scientists, and the public better  understand the sources, consequences, and trends of mercury pollution  in our country.   Specifically, our legislation would do the following:   First, it would direct the EPA, in conjunction with the Fish and  Wildlife Service, the U.S. Geological Survey, the National Park  Service, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and other  Federal Agencies, to  [[Page S2173]]  establish a national mercury monitoring program to measure and monitor  mercury levels in the air and watersheds, water and soil chemistry, and  in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial organisms at multiple sites  across the Nation.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S2172, April 22, 2021, bottom of the third column, the  following appears: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Association      The online Record has been corrected to read: the National  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration    ========================= END NOTE =========================      Second, it would establish a scientific advisory committee to advise  on the establishment, site selection, measurement, recording protocols,  and operations of this monitoring program.   Third, our bill would establish a centralized database for existing  and newly collected environmental mercury data that can be freely  accessed on the internet and that is compatible with similar  international efforts.   Fourth, our bill would require a report to Congress every 2 years on  the program, including trend data, and an assessment every 4 years of  the reduction in mercury deposition rates that needs to be achieved in  order to prevent adverse human and ecological effects on our  environment.   Fifth, our bill would authorize $95 million over 3 years for these  purposes.   We must establish a comprehensive, robust national mercury monitoring  network. Otherwise, we will lack the data we need to help make informed  decisions that can help protect the people of Maine and the Nation,  particularly our children and pregnant women.   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bipartisan bill,  the Comprehensive National Mercury Monitoring Act.   Thank you                                  ______                                         By Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Ms. Sinema):   S. 1358. A bill to establish regional processing centers, to improve  the asylum and credible fear processes to promote fairness and  efficiency, to require immigration court docketing priorities during  irregular migration influx events, and to improve the capability of the  Department of Homeland Security to manage migration flows, and for  other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.
