 Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairwoman Black for yielding.   Imagine what our opinion would be of a movie review where the  reviewer simply looked at a movie poster and then  [[Page H7785]]  wrote the review and came to a conclusion that they didn't like the  movie. They didn't listen to the music. They didn't see the direction.  They didn't see the pacing. They didn't see the acting. They didn't see  the script. They didn't see the cinematography. They saw nothing other  than a movie poster and they came to a conclusion.   We would dismiss that and we would say: How ridiculous. How absurd.   Mr. Chairman, that is exactly what the Tax Policy Center did this  past week. They wrote a review of a proposal as it relates to tax  reform, and they didn't have the details.   Why didn't they have the details?   Because many of these details don't exist.                                time  1515    Specifically, they wrote a review which was very pejorative, which  the Wall Street Journal completely trashed. They made this finding, and  they had no notion of what the income brackets are like in our proposed  tax reform plan. They had no notion about the anti-abuse rules that the  Ways and Means Committee is working through to make sure there is not  an abusive situation as it relates to pass-through entities. They had  no notion about some of the offshore protections that are being  contemplated.   Let's avoid the hyperbole. Let's avoid the hackneyed, old, tired, and  faded bumper sticker that says that any kind of pro-growth tax reform  is a sop to the rich. It is complete nonsense.   I think the proof will be in a tax reform proposal that this House  hopefully will be considering in the coming weeks and months that will  bring buoyancy, optimism, and a real opportunity for us to take  advantage of a once-in-a-generation opportunity for a Tax Code that  nobody can defend and nobody likes. But let's get real and evaluate  real numbers and not just look at posters and bumper stickers.
