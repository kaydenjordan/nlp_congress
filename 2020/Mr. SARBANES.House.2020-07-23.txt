 Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember John Lewis, our  colleague, our friend, our inspiration.   In life, you are blessed if the chance comes to cross paths with  those history has anointed to be great difference-makers in the journey  towards a more compassionate and just world. I will forever be grateful  for the last 14 years. I had the opportunity to serve with this  extraordinary man, to witness his commitment to improving the lives of  every American.   Mr. Speaker, I had the privilege to work closely with John in our  efforts to clear a path to the ballot box, to insist on accountability  and transparency in government, and to push back on the influence of  money and special interests in our politics.   Whatever the issue, whatever the struggle, John Lewis' exhortation to  us was consistent: ``Keep your eyes on the prize.'' ``Never give up''  and ``never give in.''   We carry his legacy forward--his struggle for voting rights, civil  rights, and human rights, for the voiceless, for a democracy that  respects the people and lifts our Nation.   His struggle is our struggle, and we will keep marching, knowing that  he is at our side.   May his memory be eternal.                            ____________________
