 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1595.   Before I go into the contents of my argument against this  legislation, I want to start by commending the bill's sponsor, Mr.  Perlmutter from Colorado, for his tireless advocacy, his reasonableness  in his approach, and his willingness, even in the midst of the toughest  negotiations around the subject matter, to keep his cool, to think  through the import of the bill, and to seek compromise where he could.   It is quite a legislative endeavor that he has taken upon for  himself, for this institution, for his State, and for States around the  country. He has been a fantastic advocate.   And I would say that, standing in opposition to this bill, it is not  because of his lack of good will. It is not for lack of his willingness  to engage, but for a fundamental disagreement in the approach. We have  been able to have real discussions around this that I think would make  the American people more proud or more confident in this institution  and our body politic, more broadly speaking.   I also want to thank my friend and colleague on the committee, Mr.  Stivers from Ohio, for his work on the issue. Together, they have  conducted themselves with wonderful integrity and respect for their  colleagues and their colleagues' views and ideas, especially on an  issue like this where it can create an enormous amount of controversy.   Twenty-one States have legalized medicinal marijuana, and 10 States  have legalized the recreational use of the drug. However, cannabis  remains completely illegal in 19 States. Federal law defines this as a  drug that has ``a high potential for abuse; no currently accepted  medical use in treatment in the United States; and a lack of accepted  safety for use of the drug . . . under medical supervision.'' That is  the current Federal law.   This bill does not change the fact that cannabis remains a prohibited  schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act.   To that end, if we seek to give financial institutions certainty, we  should deal with the listing of cannabis as a schedule I substance, not  debating a partial solution for financial institutions to what is a  much larger problem and a larger societal issue that we must wrestle  with.   Should States be allowed to continue to violate Federal law? Does  Federal law need to be changed when it comes to the scheduling of  cannabis?   We have an FDA that regulates cigarettes and e-cigarettes, which, as  we know, there is the recent announcement that they will seek a ban on  flavored e-cigarettes. But the FDA has no regulatory authority to  regulate cannabis.   The bill we are considering today is one of the biggest changes to  U.S. drug policy in my lifetime, yet it was done with little debate.  While our committee has jurisdiction over financial institutions--in  the nature of our debate, it is usually about the nature of regulation  for the capital markets and for banks--we heard little from the  committees of jurisdiction over the Controlled Substances Act or the  Criminal Code. In fact, the Financial Services Committee is the only  one that has held a hearing on the issue of cannabis this Congress.   Now, I would say that is due to the leadership of Mr. Perlmutter and  his tireless advocacy for this, but we only had one panel of witnesses.  I voiced my concerns in our jurisdiction to Chairwoman Waters and to  Congressman Perlmutter about my concerns for this.   In March of this year, I wrote Chairwoman Waters to express my belief  that we need to have a better comprehension of the nature of this  substance and address the supervisory and regulatory issues that would  result from enactment of H.R. 1595. I include in the Record a copy of  that letter.                                           House of Representatives,                                 Committee on Financial Services,                                     Washington, DC, March 21, 2019.      The Hon. Maxine Waters,      Chairwoman, Committee on Financial Services,      Washington, DC.      The Hon. Gregory W. Meeks,      Chairman, Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Financial           Institutions, Washington DC.        Dear Chairwoman Waters and Chairman Meeks: We write today       to seek your agreement to delay consideration of H.R. 1595,       the SAFE Act, currently scheduled to be marked up on March       26, 2019, until the Committee has a better understanding of       the full range of consequences that enacting such legislation       may trigger. As you know, marijuana is a schedule I       controlled substance as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. The impact       that many state laws, which have legalized marijuana, have on       the federal laws governing the manufacturing, use, and sale       of marijuana, including proceeds, raise many questions and       concerns. Any change to these statutes, or those that impact       them, has the potential to divide the Congress and the       country. We must ensure that Congress has done its due       diligence, including conducting thorough oversight and       review, before moving such legislation.        The hearing at the Committee on Financial Services on       February 13, 2019, made clear that we need to better       comprehend and address the supervisory and regulatory issues       that would result from enactment of H.R. 1595. Many       outstanding questions remain, which include but are not       limited to the following:        1. What changes to our banking laws are necessary to       implement the SAFE Banking Act or other legislation creating       a safe harbor for cannabis-related businesses?        2. How would individual agencies enforce Bank Secrecy Act       (BSA) requirements following enactment of the SAFE Banking       Act? What changes would be required of BSA requirements?        3. How would individual agencies enforce anti-money       laundering (AML) regulations following enactment of the SAFE       Banking Act? Would AML reforms be necessary?        4. How would individual agencies enforce Know Your Customer       (KYC) rules following enactment of the SAFE Banking Act? What       changes would be required of KYC rules?        5. How would individual agencies enforce Suspicious       Activity Report (SAR) filing requirements and guidelines       following passage  [[Page H7966]]       of the SAFE Banking Act? What changes would be required of       SAR filing requirements and guidelines to ensure illicit       financial activities were not being financed?        6. How would individual agencies enforce Currency       Transaction Report (CTR) filing requirements and guidelines       following enactment of the SAFE Banking Act? What changes       would be required of CTR filing requirements and guidelines?        7. In what ways are agencies working with state       counterparts, including state banking and securities       supervisors, under the existing regime? How would those       cooperative relationships change with enactment of H.R. 1595?        8. Would H.R. 1595 require conforming changes to any of the       statues, rules, and requirements previously listed to ensure       there are no unintended consequences, such as cartels and       other bad actors gaining access to our financial system?        9. Would the safe harbor require any changes to the rules       or processes governing federal deposit insurance systems?        10. What are the implications of H.R. 1595 on nonbank       financial firms, including insurers and investment companies?        11. What are the implications of H.R 1595 on third parties,       including payment processors?        12. What are the implications of H.R. 1595 on individual       and institutional investors of cannabis-related businesses?        13. What are the implications of RR.1595 on federal, state,       and local law enforcement, including the Department of       Justice and the Drug Enforcement Agency?        14. How are proceeds from state licensed growers and       distributers taxed under federal law? Relatedly, what       conforming changes to our tax code are necessary?        15. What are the implications of H.R. 1595 on other       products and services offered by financial institutions,       including but not limited to mortgage products, deposit       advance products or general commercial lending?        As Members of Congress, and the Committee of primary       jurisdiction, we owe it to our constituents and to the public       to fully understand the implications of any legislation       before supporting or opposing it. We urge you to hold H.R.       1595 and any related legislation until we have a full       understanding of the consequences of this bill.            Sincerely,      Patrick McHenry,        Ranking Member.      Blaine Luetkemeyer,        Ranking Member.     Mr. Speaker, in that letter, I listed a number of  questions that have yet to be answered, including:   What steps will Federal financial regulators have to take to  harmonize standards and protect against illicit activity, including  institutions' obligations with respect to the Bank Secrecy Act, anti- money laundering requirements, suspicious activity reports, and  currency transaction reports?   What are the implications of this bill on nonbank financial firms,  including investment companies?   I know there have been additions, since we have come to the floor, to  include insurance companies, and I think that is a positive step. But  these are some of the basic questions that still need to be resolved.   It is also important that we understand whether this legislation  could lead to bad actors, like drug cartels, that could more easily  access our banking system in the United States. These concerns have  been echoed by several former Directors of the Office of National Drug  Control Policy and former Administrators of the Drug Enforcement  Administration.   In a July letter from this year, former law enforcement officials  serving from 1981 to 2014 have voiced concerns that the SAFE Banking  Act could be exploited to provide easier, more cost-effective ways for  nefarious groups to launder money. I include in the Record a copy of  that letter.       Hon. Mike Crapo,      Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, & Urban           Affairs, Washington, DC.      Hon. Sherrod Brown,      Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, &           Urban Affairs, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Crapo and Ranking Member Brown: We write as       former Directors of the Office of National Drug Control       Policy and former Administrators of the Drug Enforcement       Administration to warn about the unintended consequences of       the SAFE Banking Act to legalize the banking of federally       illegal proceeds from the sale of marijuana.        Some Members of your Committee may be familiar with the       Black Market Peso Exchange that has been in operation for       several decades. This scheme has enabled international drug       cartels to launder billions of U.S. dollars through       international monetary exchanges and has ensnared many banks       and mainstream U.S. companies.        The lesson that the Black Market Peso Exchange teaches us       is that cartels will go to enormous lengths and use       sophisticated and complex methods to move cash into banks-      since laundering money is the life-blood of criminal       organizations. It is therefore a virtual certainty that       cartels will seek to exploit the SAFE Banking act if it       provides them with an easier and more cost-effective means to       launder their money.        Because cash made from the sale of marijuana looks the same       regardless of what it was used to pay for, it will be       extremely difficult for banks to know whether large bundles       of cash presented for deposit were made from the sale of       marijuana rather than from the sale of heroin, fentanyl, or       methamphetamine.        In short, the SAFE Banking Act could inadvertently allow       cartels to bring into banks duffel bags of cash made from the       sale of those illicit drugs that are killing tens of       thousands of Americans every year.        Consider the current landscape of offering banking services       to cash-intensive marijuana businesses. Even if customers are       offered the opportunity to pay in credit, many customers will       choose to pay cash to avoid being tracked within, the state       seed-to-sale tracking system.        While banks know how much cash to expect from other cash-      intensive businesses like dry cleaners or convenience stores,       it will be very difficult to figure out when a marijuana       dispensary is participating in a money laundering scheme. The       scale of the marijuana industry is already such that there       are huge opportunities for these dispensaries to be the       destination for cartel cash. Indeed, we have already seen       many cases of cartels using the cover of legalization to       operate illicit marijuana grows and black market activity.       Two recent examples within the past year involved organized       efforts to expel Mexican drug cartels growing marijuana in       Northern California--including a request to use the       California National Guard, and the May 2019 bust of the       largest international drug trafficking organization in       Colorado law enforcement history, with over 80,000 plants in       over 250 locations and 4.5 tons of finished marijuana       products.        We urge the Senate Banking Committee to reject the SAFE       Banking Act and other legislation that would give these       cartels more cover and more access to the U.S. financial       system.            Sincerely,           Mr. Speaker, drug cartels are a significant problem in  cannabis-legal States like California, Washington, and Colorado. As  reported in a May article by NBC News, the cartels have found that it  is easier to grow and process marijuana in legal States like Colorado  and ship it throughout the United States than it is to bring it from  Mexico or Cuba.   I include in the Record a copy of this article, as well.                      [From nbcnews.com, May 29, 2018]      Foreign Cartels Embrace Home-Grown Marijuana in Pot-Legal States     Foreign gangs are finding that black-market marijuana is profitable                even in states that have legalized cannabis  (By Dennis Romero, Gabe Gutierrez, Andrew Blankstein and Robert Powell)         Los Angeles.--Attorney General Jeff Sessions called it       ``one of the largest residential forfeiture actions in       American History.''        In early April, local and federal authorities descended       upon 74 marijuana grow houses in the Sacramento area they say       were underwritten by Chinese organized crime. They filed       court paperwork to seize the properties, worth millions of       dollars.        Federal officials allege that legal recreational marijuana       states like California, Colorado and Washington, where       enforcement of growing regulations is hit-or-miss, have been       providing cover for transnational criminal organizations       willing to invest big money to buy or rent property to       achieve even bigger returns.        Chinese, Cuban and Mexican drug rings have purchased or       rented hundreds of homes and use human trafficking to bring       inexperienced growers to the United States to tend them,       federal and local officials say.        The suspects are targeting states that have already       legalized marijuana ``in an attempt  [[Page H7967]]       to shroud their operations in our legal environment here and       then take the marijuana outside of the state,'' said Mike       Hartman, executive director of the Colorado Department of       Revenue, which regulates and licenses the cannabis industry.       Authorities say they've seen an increase in these ``home       grows'' since the launch of recreational pot sales in       Colorado.        While California and Washington have mainly seen organized       criminals from China buying homes and converting them into       grow houses, Colorado has largely been grappling with Cuban       and Mexican-led cartels, said Sheriff Bill Elder of the El       Paso County Sheriff's Office in Colorado.        ``They have found that it's easier to grow and process       marijuana in Colorado, ship it throughout the United States,       than it is to bring it from Mexico or Cuba,'' Elder said.        In El Paso County, NBC News witnessed firsthand the damage       a commercial-scale cannabis grow can do to a home otherwise       built for an average American family. Growers pose as       legitimate renters, and by the time authorities disrupt their       operation, homes have been gutted and trashed.        ``We've fallen through floors,'' U.S. Drug Enforcement       Agency Special Agent Randy Ladd said. ``The electrical       damage, they draw so much current that you'll see, in some       places, the wires are fused inside of the electrical box.       And--a lot of people--they don't wanna pay the high electric       bills. So what they do is they take jackhammers and pickaxes       and they cut through the foundation of the house, so that       they could steal the power.''        One of the biggest busts so far came last June, when the       Colorado attorney general's office announced that ``a massive       illegal interstate marijuana distribution and cultivation       network stretching from Colorado to Texas'' had been       dismantled. It was allegedly Chinese-connected, Ladd said.        Authorities said the network was responsible for securities       fraud, millions of dollars of laundered cash, 2,600       ``illegally cultivated'' marijuana plants and 4,000 pounds of       harvested cannabis, according to the Colorado attorney       general's statement.        The operation took place in 18 warehouses and storage units       and 33 homes, mostly in the Denver area, authorities said.       ``These seizures are believed to only scratch the surface,''       the office said.        Ladd alleged that some Chinese crews cover immigrants'       costs of traveling to America in exchange for work in the       grow houses. ``It's like indentured servitude,'' he said.       ``It is a form of human trafficking.''        The workers often fly from China to Belgium, and from       Belgium to Mexico, before making asylum claims at the border       and then disappearing by the time they're scheduled to tell       their stories in court, Ladd said. Often when grow houses are       raided, immigration fugitives are discovered, he said.        The grow homes are usually purchased by shell property       management companies, Ladd said. ``These growers can hide in       plain sight,'' he said.        The Sacramento-area raids, which also struck Calaveras,       Placer, San Joaquin, El Dorado, Yuba and Amador counties,       shed some light on how many of the foreign rings operate.        Northern California-based DEA Special Agent Casey Rettig       said suspects send cash to the United States in $9,999       increments, just below the mandated reporting threshold, and       receive funds from China that fly under that nation's $50,000       foreign spending limit. They then purchase homes with the       help of cash lenders instead of traditional mortgage firms.        Last fall, a scenario fitting that pattern unfolded in       Grays Harbor County, Washington, southwest of Seattle, as a       drug task force busted an alleged cultivation ring funded by       organized crime in China.        More than 40 suspects were arrested and $80 million worth       of cannabis was seized, the Grays Harbor County Sheriff's       Office said. ``The majority of these homes were purchased       with cash, and information was developed that these purchases       were conducted by Chinese nationals involved in organized       crime,'' according to a statement from the Sheriff's Office.        And just this month, search warrants were served at 19       locations in the Puget Sound area of Washington state, a       federal official who did not want her name used said. The       ring was allegedly run by three Chinese nationals who       produced thousands of pounds of cannabis destined for greater       New York, the U.S. attorney's office in Seattle alleges.        The suspects, who face drug conspiracy charges, purchased       homes with the help of multiple wire transfers from China       that included dollar figures--$2,000 to $5,900--they believed       would fly under the radar, according to a federal complaint.        Ultimately it was the houses' exorbitant electricity use--      up to 38,477 kilowatt hours in one day versus the American       average of just 30--that made them targets of a federal       investigation, according to the filing.        Even a single grow house can contain a large marijuana       operation. In April, police in Pomona, California, an exurb       in Los Angeles County, announced they discovered a 23-room       grow house allegedly run by Chinese nationals. Fifty-five-      hundred marijuana products, including 2,900 plants and nearly       21 pounds of cannabis, were seized, police said.        ``The grow operation used advanced systems of lighting, air       conditioning, fans, exhaust blowers and air-filtering systems       to control the climate inside the buildings and the odor of       marijuana,'' according to a Pomona police statement.        Pomona police spokeswoman Aly Mejia said a gun and $6,900       in cash were also found.        The DEA's Rettig, speaking from her base in San Francisco,       said the Chinese operations are ``illegal under state law.''       In California, marijuana growers, producers and retailers       need state and local licenses. Cities can opt out and ban       such businesses altogether.        Rettig said even with the Golden State's sky-high housing       market--the median price of a home is $535,100, according       listings site Zillow--overseas criminals know that       ``marijuana can fetch three times as much out of state.''        ``There's a great profit motive in it,'' the DEA's Ladd       said. ``In Colorado, marijuana legalization has magnified the       black market. The standard price per pound here is $2,000,       but they can get $3,500 to $4,500 by shipping it back East.       The profits are great there.''     Mr. Speaker, beyond the regulatory issues, Congress has  yet to examine these potential societal harms and implications for  human health.   In a January article regarding research on the health effects of  marijuana, author Malcolm Gladwell wrote: ``Before any drug gets  permitted to go on the market, basic questions have to be answered  about its safety and efficacy. We don't know relatively basic questions  about marijuana.''   I include this piece from The New Yorker in the Record.                    [From the New Yorker, Jan. 7, 2019]                     Is Marijuana as Safe as We Think?                           (By Malcolm Gladwell)         A few years ago, the National Academy of Medicine convened       a panel of sixteen leading medical experts to analyze the       scientific literature on cannabis. The report they prepared,       which came out in January of 2017, runs to four hundred and       sixty-eight pages. It contains no bombshells or surprises,       which perhaps explains why it went largely unnoticed. It       simply stated, over and over again, that a drug North       Americans have become enthusiastic about remains a mystery.        For example, smoking pot is widely supposed to diminish the       nausea associated with chemotherapy. But, the panel pointed       out, ``there are no good-quality randomized trials       investigating this option.''We have evidence for marijuana as       a treatment for pain, but ``very little is known about the       efficacy, dose, routes of administration, or side effects of       commonly used and commercially available cannabis products in       the United States.'' The caveats continue. Is it good for       epilepsy? ``Insufficient evidence.''Tourette's syndrome?       Limited evidence. A.L.S., Huntington's, and Parkinson's?       Insufficient evidence. Irritable-bowel syndrome? Insufficient       evidence. Dementia and glaucoma? Probably not. Anxiety?       Maybe. Depression? Probably not.        Then come Chapters 5 through 13, the heart of the report,       which concern marijuana's potential risks. The haze of       uncertainty continues. Does the use of cannabis increase the       likelihood of fatal car accidents? Yes. By how much? Unclear.       Does it affect motivation and cognition? Hard to say, but       probably. Does it affect employment prospects? Probably. Will       it impair academic achievement? Limited evidence. This goes       on for pages.        We need proper studies, the panel concluded, on the health       effects of cannabis on children and teen-agers and pregnant       women and breast-feeding mothers and ``older populations''       and ``heavy cannabis users''; in other words, on everyone       except the college student who smokes a joint once a month.       The panel also called for investigation into ``the       pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of cannabis,       modes of delivery, different concentrations, in various       populations, including the dose-response relationships of       cannabis and THC or other cannabinoids.''        Figuring out the ``dose-response relationship'' of a new       compound is something a pharmaceutical company does from the       start of trials in human subjects, as it prepares a new drug       application for the E.D.A. Too little of a powerful drug       means that it won't work. Too much means that it might do       more harm than good. The amount of active ingredient in a       pill and the metabolic path that the ingredient takes after       it enters your body--these are things that drugmakers will       have painstakingly mapped out before the product comes on the       market, with a tractor-trailer full of supporting       documentation.        With marijuana, apparently, we're still waiting for this       information. It's hard to study a substance that until very       recently has been almost universally illegal. And the few       studies we do have were done mostly in the nineteen-eighties       and nineties, when cannabis was not nearly as potent as it is       now. Because of recent developments in plant breeding and       growing techniques, the typical concentration of THC, the       psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, has gone from the low       single digits to more than twenty per cent--from a swig of       near-beer to a tequila shot.        Are users smoking less, to compensate for the drug's new       potency? Or simply getting more stoned, more quickly? Is       high-potency cannabis more of a problem for younger users or       for older ones? For some drugs, the dose-response curve is       linear: twice the dose creates twice the effect. For other       drugs, it's nonlinear: twice the dose can increase the effect       tenfold, or hardly at all. Which is true  [[Page H7968]]       for cannabis? It also matters, of course, how cannabis is       consumed. It can be smoked, vaped, eaten, or applied to the       skin. How are absorption patterns affected?        Last May, not long before Canada legalized the recreational       use of marijuana, Beau Kilmer, a drug-policy expert with the       RAND Corporation, testified before the Canadian Parliament.       He warned that the fastest-growing segment of the legal       market in Washington State was extracts for inhalation, and       that the mean THC concentration for those products was more       than sixty-five per cent. ``We know little about the health       consequences-risks and benefits-of many of the cannabis       products likely to be sold in nonmedical markets,'' he said.       Nor did we know how higher-potency products would affect THC       consumption.        When it comes to cannabis, the best-case scenario is that       we will muddle through, learning more about its true effects       as we go along and adapting as needed-the way, say, the once       extraordinarily lethal innovation of the automobile has been       gradually tamed in the course of its history. For those       curious about the worst-case scenario, Alex Berenson has       written a short manifesto, ``Tell Your Children: The Truth       About Marijuana, Mental Illness, and Violence.''        Berenson begins his book with an account of a conversation       he had with his wife, a psychiatrist who specializes in       treating mentally ill criminals. They were discussing one of       the many grim cases that cross her desk--``the usual horror       story, somebody who'd cut up his grandmother or set fire to       his apartment.'' Then his wife said something like ``Of       course, he was high, been smoking pot his whole life.''        Of course? I said.        Yeah, they all smoke.        Well . . . other things too, right?        Berenson used to be an investigative reporter for the       Times, where he covered, among other things, health care and       the pharmaceutical industry. Then he left the paper to write       a popular series of thrillers. At the time of his       conversation with his wife, he had the typical layman's view       of cannabis, which is that it is largely benign. His wife's       remark alarmed him, and he set out to educate himself.       Berenson is constrained by the same problem the National       Academy of Medicine faced--that, when it comes to marijuana,       we really don't know very much. But he has a reporter's       tenacity, a novelist's imagination, and an outsider's knack       for asking intemperate questions. The result is disturbing.        The first of Berenson's questions concerns what has long       been the most worrisome point about cannabis: its association       with mental illness. Many people with serious psychiatric       illness smoke lots of pot. The marijuana lobby typically       responds to this fact by saying that pot-smoking is a       response to mental illness, not the cause of it--that people       with psychiatric issues use marijuana to self-medicate. That       is only partly true. In some cases, heavy cannabis use does       seem to cause mental illness. As the National Academy panel       declared, in one of its few unequivocal conclusions,       ``Cannabis use is likely to increase the risk of developing       schizophrenia and other psychoses; the higher the use, the       greater the risk.''        Berenson thinks that we are far too sanguine about this       link. He wonders how large the risk is, and what might be       behind it. In one of the most fascinating sections of ``Tell       Your Children,'' he sits down with Erik Messamore, a       psychiatrist who specializes in neuropharmacology and in the       treatment of schizophrenia. Messamore reports that, following       the recent rise in marijuana use in the U.S. (it has almost       doubled in the past two decades, not necessarily as the       result of legal reforms), he has begun to see a new kind of       patient: older, and not from the marginalized communities       that his patients usually come from. These are otherwise       stable middle-class professionals. Berenson writes, ``A       surprising number of them seemed to have used only cannabis       and no other drugs before their breaks. The disease they'd       developed looked like schizophrenia, but it had developed       later-and their prognosis seemed to be worse. Their delusions       and paranoia hardly responded to antipsychotics.''        Messamore theorizes that THC may interfere with the brain's       anti-inflammatory mechanisms, resulting in damage to nerve       cells and blood vessels. Is this the reason, Berenson       wonders, for the rising incidence of schizophrenia in the       developed world, where cannabis use has also increased? In       the northern parts of Finland, incidence of the disease has       nearly doubled since 1993. In Denmark, cases have risen       twenty-five per cent since 2000. In the United States,       hospital emergency rooms have seen a fifty per-cent increase       in schizophrenia admissions since 2006. If you include cases       where schizophrenia was a secondary diagnosis, annual       admissions in the past decade have increased from 1.26       million to 2.1 million.        Berenson's second question derives from the first. The       delusions and paranoia that often accompany psychoses can       sometimes trigger violent behavior. If cannabis is implicated       in a rise in psychoses, should we expect the increased use of       marijuana to be accompanied by a rise in violent crime, as       Berenson's wife suggested? Once again, there is no definitive       answer, so Berenson has collected bits and pieces of       evidence. For example, in a 2013 paper in the Journal of       Interpersonal Violence, researchers looked at the results of       a survey of more than twelve thousand American high-school       students. The authors assumed that alcohol use among students       would be a predictor of violent behavior, and that marijuana       use would predict the opposite. In fact, those who used only       marijuana were three times more likely to be physically       aggressive than abstainers were; those who used only alcohol       were 2.7 times more likely to be aggressive.        Observational studies like these don't establish causation.       But they invite the sort of research that could.        Berenson looks, too, at the early results from the state of       Washington, which, in 2014, became the first U.S.       jurisdiction to legalize recreational marijuana. Between 2013       and 2017, the state's aggravated-assault rate rose seventeen       per cent, which was nearly twice the increase seen       nationwide, and the murder rate rose forty-four per cent,       which was more than twice the increase nationwide. We don't       know that an increase in cannabis use was responsible for       that surge in violence. Berenson, though, finds it strange       that, at a time when Washington may have exposed its       population to higher levels of what is widely assumed to be a       calming substance, its citizens began turning on one another       with increased aggression.        His third question is whether cannabis serves as a gateway       drug. There are two possibilities. The first is that       marijuana activates certain behavioral and neurological       pathways that ease the onset of more serious addictions. The       second possibility is that marijuana offers a safer       alternative to other drugs: that if you start smoking pot to       deal with chronic pain you never graduate to opioids.        Which is it? This is a very hard question to answer. We're       only a decade or so into the widespread recreational use of       high-potency marijuana. Maybe cannabis opens the door to       other drugs, but only after prolonged use. Or maybe the low-      potency marijuana of years past wasn't a gateway, but today's       high-potency marijuana is. Methodologically, Berenson points       out, the issue is complicated by the fact that the first wave       of marijuana legalization took place on the West Coast, while       the first serious wave of opioid addiction took place in the       middle of the country. So, if all you do is eyeball the       numbers, it looks as if opioid overdoses are lowest in       cannabis states and highest in non-cannabis states.        Not surprisingly, the data we have are messy. Berenson, in       his role as devil's advocate, emphasizes the research that       sees cannabis as opening the door to opioid use. For example,       two studies of identical twins--in the Netherlands and in       Australia--show that, in cases where one twin used cannabis       before the age of seventeen and the other didn't, the       cannabis user was several times more likely to develop an       addiction to opioids. Berenson also enlists a statistician at       N.Y.U. to help him sort through state-level overdose data,       and what he finds is not encouraging: ``States where more       people used cannabis tended to have more overdoses.''        The National Academy panel is more judicious. Its       conclusion is that we simply don't know enough, because there       haven't been any ``systematic'' studies. But the panel's       uncertainty is scarcely more reassuring than Berenson's       alarmism. Seventy-two thousand Americans died in 2017 of drug       overdoses. Should you embark on a procannabis crusade without       knowing whether it will add to or subtract from that number?        Drug policy is always clearest at the fringes. Illegal       opioids are at one end. They are dangerous. Manufacturers and       distributors belong in prison, and users belong in drug-      treatment programs. The cannabis industry would have us       believe that its product, like coffee, belongs at the other       end of the continuum. ``Flow Kana partners with independent       multi-generational farmers who cultivate under full sun,       sustainably, and in small batches,'' the promotional       literature for one California cannabis brand reads. ``Using       only organic methods, these stewards of the land have spent       their lives balancing a unique and harmonious relationship       between the farm, the genetics and the terroir.'' But       cannabis is not coffee. It's somewhere in the middle. The       experience of most users is relatively benign and       predictable; the experience of a few, at the margins, is not.       Products or behaviors that have that kind of muddled risk       profile are confusing, because it is very difficult for those       in the benign middle to appreciate the experiences of those       at the statistical tails. Low-frequency risks also take       longer and are far harder to quantify, and the lesson of       ``Tell Your Children'' and the National Academy report is       that we aren't yet in a position to do so. For the moment,       cannabis probably belongs in the category of substances that       society permits but simultaneously discourages. Cigarettes       are heavily taxed, and smoking is prohibited in most       workplaces and public spaces. Alcohol can't be sold without a       license and is kept out of the hands of children.       Prescription drugs have rules about dosages, labels that       describe their risks, and policies that govern their       availability. The advice that seasoned potheads sometimes       give new users--``start low and go slow''--is probably good       advice for society as a whole, at least until we better       understand what we are dealing with.        Late last year, the commissioner of the Food and Drug       Administration, Scott Gottlieb, announced a federal crackdown       on e-cigarettes. He had seen the data on soaring use among       teen-agers, and, he said, ``it shocked my conscience.'' He       announced that the F.D.A. would ban many kinds of flavored e-      cigarettes, which are especially popular  [[Page H7969]]       with teens, and would restrict the retail outlets where e-      cigarettes were available.        In the dozen years since e-cigarettes were introduced into       the marketplace, they have attracted an enormous amount of       attention. There are scores of studies and papers on the       subject in the medical and legal literature, grappling with       the questions raised by the new technology. Vaping is clearly       popular among kids. Is it a gateway to traditional tobacco       use? Some public-health experts worry that we're grooming a       younger generation for a lifetime of dangerous addiction. Yet       other people see e-cigarettes as a much safer alternative for       adult smokers looking to satisfy their nicotine addiction.       That's the British perspective. Last year, a Parliamentary       committee recommended cutting taxes on e-cigarettes and       allowing vaping in areas where it had previously been banned.       Since e-cigarettes are as much as ninety-five per cent less       harmful than regular cigarettes, the committee argued, why       not promote them? Gottlieb said that he was splitting the       difference between the two positions--giving adults       ``opportunities to transition to non-combustible products,''       while upholding the F.D.A.'s ``solemn mandate to make       nicotine products less accessible and less appealing to       children.'' He was immediately criticized.``Somehow, we have       completely lost all sense of public-health perspective,''       Michael Siegel, a public-health researcher at Boston       University, wrote after the F.D.A. announcement:        Every argument that the F.D.A. is making in justifying a       ban on the sale of electronic cigarettes in convenience       stores and gas stations applies even more strongly for real       tobacco cigarettes: you know, the ones that kill hundreds of       thousands of Americans each year. Something is terribly wrong       with our sense of perspective when we take the e-cigarettes       off the shelf but allow the old-fashioned ones to remain.        Among members of the public-health community, it is       impossible to spend five minutes on the e-cigarette question       without getting into an argument. And this is nicotine they       are arguing about, a drug that has been exhaustively studied       by generations of scientists. We don't worry that e-      cigarettes increase the number of fatal car accidents,       diminish motivation and cognition, or impair academic       achievement. The drugs through the gateway that we worry       about with e-cigarettes are Marlboros, not opioids. There are       no enormous scientific question marks over nicotine's dosing       and bio-availability. Yet we still proceed cautiously and       carefully with nicotine, because it is a powerful drug, and       when powerful drugs are consumed by lots of people in new and       untested ways we have an obligation to try to figure out what       will happen.        A week after Gottlieb announced his crackdown on e-      cigarettes, on the ground that they are too enticing to       children, Siegel visited the first recreational-marijuana       facility in Massachusetts. Here is what he found on the menu,       each offering laced with large amounts of a drug, THC, that       no one knows much about:        Strawberry-flavored chewy bites        Large, citrus gummy bears        Delectable Belgian dark chocolate bars        Assorted fruit-flavored chews        Assorted fruit-flavored cubes        Raspberry flavored confection        Raspberry flavored lozenges        Chewy, cocoa caramel bite-sized treats        Raspberry & watermelon flavored lozenges        Chocolate-chip brownies. He concludes, ``This is public       health in 2018?''     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Colorado's  willingness to work with several of my colleagues on this side of the  aisle. I want to commend him and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers),  once again, for their commitment to this effort.   This version of the legislation before us right now is dramatically  improved and includes a number of Republican priorities, such as  language on Operation Choke Point, and a solution that will help  industrial hemp farmers across the country, but most especially in  Kentucky.   Yet, Mr. Speaker, there are many questions left to be answered. We do  not fully understand the sweeping implications of this legislation. We  do not yet know what the resulting regulatory regime will look like,  nor do we have any assurance that it will not expose the current  financial system to illicit activity. In particular, as it is currently  drafted, H.R. 1595 offers insufficient safeguards against drug cartels  accessing the banking system.   What this legislation does is provide a half answer to a much larger  problem than just banking. We owe it to our constituents and to the  public to have a serious debate on the underlying issue, and that is  the issue of whether or not cannabis should be considered a schedule I  substance under the Controlled Substances Act. I know Mr. Perlmutter  and I share that same sentiment that we should have that larger debate.   In the meantime, Congress is working in a bipartisan way to come up  with at least a measure of a solution, but I am hopeful that we can get  the medical research necessary and the FDA processes necessary for us  to have that larger debate as well. I would welcome that debate, as I  know the American people would as well.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), the ranking member of the Investor  Protection, Entrepreneurship, and Capital Markets Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Michigan an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, how much time remains?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Germantown, Tennessee (Mr. Kustoff).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Columbus, Ohio (Mr. Stivers), who is the ranking member of the National  Security, International Development and Monetary Policy Subcommittee of  the Financial Services Committee. He is a great advocate for the bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Kentucky (Mr. Barr), chair of the Subcommittee on Oversight and  Investigations of the Committee on Financial Services.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Davidson), a great member of the Committee on Financial  Services.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Gaetz).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield  myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, let me begin as I did with my opening statement. I  commend the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter) for how he has  managed this bill and brought it to the floor.   What we have here on the House floor, and we are debating now, is a  much broader bill and, therefore, will have a much broader vote than  what we had in committee, however limited we were in committee  jurisdiction.   Madam Speaker, I know if the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter)  were on the Appropriations Committee, he would have worked for medical  research funding. I know that if he were on the Energy and Commerce  Committee, he would have worked for an FDA process on cannabis. And if  he were on the Committee on the Judiciary, he would have worked to  deschedule the drug.   However, we find ourselves on the Financial Services Committee, and  this is not a normal conversation that we have on the committee. But  this is addressing a key issue that many States are facing, and many  financial institutions, credit unions, and banks are facing, which is  how to bank people with a lot of cash, with a product that is legal at  the State level but defined at the Federal level as an illicit  substance that is harmful for human consumption.   While Congress is taking this half-measure, it doesn't resolve the  issue. It does not resolve the issue of medical research or  understanding the brain science and how cannabis affects the adolescent  brain. There are enormous questions there. There are enormous questions  about the Federal Criminal Code. But these are things that we should be  debating rather than this half-measure on banking.    While this is an important step on the question of the overall  legalization of this drug, it still doesn't resolve the issue fully.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues for a ``no'' vote, but I expect  this vote will pass on the suspension calendar today. I thank my  colleague for his handling of this important issue and the wise nature  of how he has approached the amendment process to address many  different equities across the country. I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 321,  nays 103, not voting 9, as follows:                               [Roll No. 544]                                 YEAS--321       Adams      Aguilar      Allred      Amash      Amodei      Armstrong      Axne      Bacon      Baird      Balderson      Banks      Barr      Barragan      Bass      Beatty      Bera      Beyer      Bishop (GA)      Bishop (UT)      Blumenauer      Blunt Rochester      Bonamici      Bost      Boyle, Brendan F.
