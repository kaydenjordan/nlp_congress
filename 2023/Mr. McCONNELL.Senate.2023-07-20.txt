 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, yesterday, communities across my home  State endured another spate of heavy rains. Flash flooding was  especially severe in Western Kentucky, where residents are still  rebuilding after tornadoes pummeled the region just 19 months ago.   First responders have been moving quickly to rescue and evacuate  those impacted, and I understand that so far, there are no reported  injuries or deaths. I am thankful for the heroic work to keep  Kentuckians safe.   My team is in touch with State and local officials to help however we  can, and later today, I will speak with the mayor of Mayfield to get an  update on the situation in her community.   Elaine and I continue to pray for the safety of West Kentuckians as  they recover and rebuild in this time of need.
