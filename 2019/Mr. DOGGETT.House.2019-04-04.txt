 Madam Speaker, the blood of innocents stains this Trump  administration. And while the Trump family pals around with Saudi  murderers, that blood continues to flow in the world's worst  humanitarian disaster. Only last week, four years after the first Saudi  assault on Yemen, they killed another group of children at a hospital,  apparently with American bombs.   Just as the Trump administration has aided and abetted war crimes in  Yemen, this Congress has aided and abetted the Trump administration in  avoiding any accountability.   Last year, Republicans blocked any consideration of a bipartisan  Senate resolution to stop U.S. involvement in this war. Most recently,  these folks used a devious motion to recommit, whose real purpose was  not the very worthy goal of condemning anti-Semitism, but the sole  purpose was to obstruct this resolution and ensure it never became  adopted by Congress.   Today, we must reject any such motion--no matter how worthy it may  be, it can be dealt with in other legislation--in order to halt all  American involvement in this travesty.   We are talking about our relations with the Saudis. You know those  folks, Madam Speaker. They are the ones with the leader with the bone  saw to dismember an opponent and who tortures women for asserting their  rights.   Hearts do break for those who are lost and tortured, but until we  break with the Saudis in Yemen, the bombing, the starvation, the  disease, and the slaughter will continue.   Months, years, hundreds of small graves ago, this Congress should  have done its job. Today is a moment of moral clarity, a moment for  this Chamber to act as the Constitution requires: to weigh war and  peace and, for once, to extract ourselves from a war we did not start  and to find a way to make peace the victor.   We can finally place a clean War Powers Act resolution directly on  President Trump's desk, and do so today. Let us do what is right, and  let us do so before more young lives are destroyed.
