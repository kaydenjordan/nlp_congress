 Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate a budget  scorekeeping report. The report, which covers fiscal year 2022, was  prepared by the Congressional Budget Office pursuant to section 308(b)  and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as  amended. This information allows the Senate Budget Committee to  determine if budgetary  [[Page S2214]]  points of order lie against pending legislation.   The report shows the effect on spending and revenues of congressional  action through April 25, 2022, as compared to the levels the Senate  agreed to in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2022, S. Con. Res  14. I have revised the levels in the budget resolution five times for  legislation, as authorized by the resolution. The report shows the  effects of the 11 laws signed by the President since the passage of the  budget resolution with significant effects on budget authority,  outlays, or revenues.   Tables 1 and 2 show that for fiscal year 2022, current law budget  authority is $27 billion below the maximum allowed in the revised  budget resolution, outlays are $18 billion below the allowed maximum,  and revenues are $0.1 billion above the allowed minimum. They also show  there has been no net change for Social Security.   The third table shows the Senate pay-as-you-go scorecard tallying  enacted legislation with significant effects on mandatory spending and  revenues. The scorecard shows a savings of $7.8 billion in 2022, $74.8  billion over the 2022-2026 period, and $139.9 billion over the 2022- 2031 period. When compared to the allowable amounts on the PAYGO  scorecard last adjusted on March 2, there is a deficit of $668 million  on the scorecard for 2022, a deficit of $687 million over the 2022-2026  period, and a surplus of $1.09 billion over the 2022-2031 period.   I ask unanimous consent that the letter and accompanying tables from  CBO be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Congress,                                     Congressional Budget Office,                                     Washington, DC, April 27, 2022.      Hon. Bernie Sanders,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of       Congressional action on the fiscal year 2022 budget and is       current through April 25, 2022. This report is submitted       under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the       Congressional Budget Act, as amended.        The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues       are consistent with the allocations, aggregates, and other       budgetary levels printed in the Congressional Record on       September 23, 2021, pursuant to section 4006 of S. Con. Res.       14, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year       2022.        Since the adoption of S. Con. Res. 14 the Congress has       cleared and the President has signed the following       legislation that has significant effects on budget authority,       outlays, or revenues in fiscal year 2022:        Emergency Repatriation Assistance for Returning Americans       Act (Public Law 117-39);        Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency       Assistance Act (Public Law 117-43);        Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (Public Law 117-58);        Protecting America's First Responders Act (Public Law 117-      61);        Further Extending Government Funding Act (Public Law 117-      70);        Protecting Medicare and American Farmers from Sequester       Cuts Act (Public Law 117-71);        REMOTE Act (Public Law 117-76);        Further Additional Extending Government Funding Act (Public       Law 117-86);        Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2022 (Public Law 117-103);        Postal Service Reform Act of 2022 (Public Law 117-108); and        Suspending Normal Trade Relations with Russia and Belarus       Act (Public Law 117-110).        This is the first current level letter for 2022.            Sincerely,                                                 Phillip L.
