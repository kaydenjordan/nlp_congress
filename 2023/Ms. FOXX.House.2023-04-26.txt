 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Texas for yielding  and for his wonderful work on this package.   Mr. Speaker, America's position as the most trusted line of credit in  the world is at stake. In other words, our reputation is at stake.  Republicans' commonsense proposal, the Limit, Save, Grow Act,  recognizes the twin interests of avoiding defaulting on our debt while  reining in future inflationary spending.   Yet, the President has signaled that he will stall, he will risk, and  he will forbid paying our debt obligations if he doesn't get his way.  He refuses to compromise.                                time  1445    One such compromise, which falls within the jurisdiction of the  Committee on Education and the Workforce, includes blocking the  President from spending half a trillion dollars to provide backdoor  free college.   The Limit, Save, Grow Act would nullify the President's plan to  transfer up to $20,000 per borrower onto the backs of blue-collar  Americans, as well as his radical income-driven repayment plan, which  would turn student loans into untargeted grants and cost more than any  other regulation in our Nation's history.   If the President's student loan scheme is enacted, taxpayers could  end up spending almost $1 trillion since the beginning of the pandemic.   Our solution preserves the fiscal integrity of our Nation for  Americans today and the generation tomorrow. It offers a promise to the  American public that we will not pursue trillion-dollar policies that  risk our financial future.   Mr. Speaker, we ask the President to come to the negotiating table  and quit pursuing brinkmanship over partisanship.
