 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me, as I  know the Senator from Michigan, the Presiding Officer, does, in  standing in solidarity with thousands of UAW workers in Ohio and  Michigan and around the country who demand that automakers--a simple  demand really--respect the work they do to make these companies  successful. There is still time, the rest of the day and, really,  beyond this, for the Big Three to avert a strike, which we know is  always a last resort for workers.   My wife is the daughter of a utility worker in Ashtabula, in the far  northeast corner of the State. She, first of all, credits her dad's  union card with saving her life. She was 16 years old and had an asthma  attack, I believe at school, and was picked up in an ambulance and  taken to the Cleveland Clinic and spent more than a week there-- something she could not afford without her dad's union card and her  dad's healthcare benefits from the utility workers union and from that  company.   She also said that, twice during her growing up, the union struck  because their backs were against the wall; they thought they had no  choice. She acknowledges that the workers never really recover the lost  wages from a strike.   These UAW members in Michigan and Ohio, in Toledo, in Cincinnati, in  Dayton, and all over our State and in other States, they want to be on  the job. They don't want to strike. They don't want to be on the picket  line. But when companies refuse to recognize the work they do, workers  are backed into a corner.   It is why union cards matter. A union card means workers can stand  together for fair pay and benefits, for better working conditions, for  safer workplaces, for control over their schedules, for a voice in  their company, and a voice in their community--because, to be clear,  autoworkers surely are the engines behind these companies' success. GM,  Ford, and Stellantis--people around the country know Stellantis as the  old Chrysler--the Big Three wouldn't be making a dime, of course, in  profits without the workers who actually make their cars and trucks.   Remember, autoworkers--this is the most important thing. Autoworkers  stood up and made sacrifices a decade ago, especially at GM and  Chrysler--Stellantis--because those companies were in trouble. And  taxpayers stood up, and government stood, finally, on the side of those  companies, and the workers made sacrifices to help the American auto  industry when times were tough.   Who remembers the depths of the recession? UAW workers stood behind  the Big Three when a whole lot of politicians in this town wanted to  abandon these companies. Now that times are good, all that workers are  asking for is their fair share.   Let's be clear, times now are very, very good for these companies and  very, very, very good for these CEOs. We know auto executives--I don't  know how many. But I know auto executives in all three companies--many,  many of them--make more than a million dollars a year. Some of them  make tens of millions of dollars a year.   Together GM, Ford, and Stellantis brought in $21 billion--that is  with a ``b,'' a thousand million--$21 billion in profits the first half  of the year alone.   Think about that. These companies were struggling a decade ago. They  were in real trouble. They were losing money. They were in trouble  during the recession. Workers gave them major kinds of givebacks, gave  them major kinds of concessions. They took less money for themselves  and set up a three-tiered rate structure that hurt workers, but they  had to do it to save these companies. They agreed to do that.   But, now, times are really, really good for these companies. Again,  GM, Ford, and Stellantis together brought in $21 billion of profits  just in the first half of 2023, but they don't want to share those  profits with these workers.   And who makes these profits possible? Again, the history: These  companies were in trouble. The government helped them. Workers gave up  a lot. Workers sacrificed. Workers gave back money they shouldn't have  had to give back because they wanted to save the companies. Now, the  companies are doing well. Now, the executives are doing very, very well  with $21 billion in profits, and the company is not willing to  appreciably share in those profits.   The CEO of GM makes 362 times what its median worker makes. With  Ford, it is only a modest 281 times that. Think of that. The GM CEO--a  company that, when struggling, was saved because of worker  concessions--is making 362 times what the median--not the lowest paid  worker but the median--worker of that company makes. So, frankly, I  hesitate to call names, and I am really not. I don't want to hear  whining from companies that they can't afford to pay workers what they  are worth. And that goes for all workers, all autoworkers making all  kinds of vehicles--cars and trucks and SUVs.   I know what the future is. I know these companies. These companies  plan to be overwhelmingly making batteries, making electric vehicles.  That is their decision, to be sure. But I don't want those--because  some politicians whine about, ``Well, we don't want electric  vehicles''--these are the companies' decisions, the companies' plans,  the companies' futures. But I don't want those jobs--those politicians  that whine, if they get their way, they are going to see these electric  vehicles made in Japan and China and Taiwan and overseas.   We went through that already. We know what my hometown of Mansfield,  OH, looked like. I know what Dayton, OH, looked like. I know what  Hamtramck and cities in the Presiding Officer's State looked like. I  know what happens to those counties, those workers. And do you know  what? I know what happens to those cities, those communities.   I grew up in Mansfield, OH, a town of 50,000. I went to Johnny  Appleseed Junior High School. That was really its name--Johnny  Appleseed Pioneers. And I went to school with sons and daughters of  autoworkers at GM, rubberworkers at Mansfield Tire, electrical IUE  members at Westinghouse--there were several thousand at one  [[Page S4511]]  point--machinists at Tappan Stove, and the sons of daughters of  pipefitters and plumbers and electricians and bricklayers, millwrights,  insulators, and laborers and--I am forgetting others--and operating  engineers.   And do you know what? Within 10 or 20 years, most of those jobs were  gone. They were gone because companies, always looking for lower wages,  wanted to go to non-union States.   First, they went to Alabama. That wasn't good enough. So then they  jammed, and I mean ``jammed''--sorry to say it this way--by buying off  a whole lot of politicians--they jammed these trade agreements, like  NAFTA, through the Congress, and then it got worse.   It wasn't just the companies going to Alabama, Mississippi,  Louisiana, Georgia, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Then they weren't  greedy enough; they wanted even cheaper labor. Then they went to China  and Mexico. That means that in my community of 50,000, where I grew up,  you just don't see the prosperity there that you did when I went to  school with those kids.   So, as I said, we have heard a lot of politicians blaming electrical  vehicles for the dispute, as if, somehow, corporations wanting to  squeeze their workers was a new development.   I will make it clear. I don't care what kind of car Americans drive.  My wife and I drove Chevy Cruzes for a while, and they were made in  Lordstown, OH, by GM, about an hour and a half from our home. Now, we  each drive a Jeep Cherokee, made about 2 hours from our home, in the  other direction, in Toledo. So people can drive what they are going to  drive. I always hope, and I know the Presiding Officer thinks the same  way, that people buy union-made cars made in the United States. But I  see what happens when both parties--both parties--frankly,  unfortunately, it wasn't a partisan thing. My party was almost as  guilty as Republicans on this--the push for NAFTA--which sent thousands  of jobs overseas.   We fought them. When politicians said, ``Let these companies die;  they are not worth saving; foreign automakers can do this better,'' we  fought them every step of the way.   Now, today, for anyone who doubts that autoworkers in Ohio are the  future of this industry, for anyone who wants to give up on these  plants or force workers to settle for less, we will fight the way I  fought NAFTA my first year in Congress, the way I fought permanent  normal trade relations, the giveaway to the Chinese--not Chinese  workers, but giveaway to Chinese Communist Party officials and corrupt  leaders--a different kind of corruption from American leaders who sold  them short, but nonetheless.   We know this industry is changing. Forty years ago, when Jeep rolled  out the Jeep Cherokee--Chrysler now--most people had never heard of an  SUV. Now they dominate the market. Twenty-three years ago, hybrids came  along. Whatever the auto industry looks like in 20 years, in 50 years,  in 100 years--I am not an auto expert. I don't know what they are going  to look like 20 or 50 or 100 years from now, but I do know this: Ohio  autoworkers, American innovation will be leading it, if we let them, if  we reward these workers and don't let companies searching for cheap  labor and going to anti-union States, moving overseas--as long as we  don't let them run the show.    I was in Lordstown a couple of weeks ago. That is where the Chevy  Cruze plant was, near Youngstown. I was at UAW Local 1112. I have been  to that union, I don't know, 50 times in my life, with my friend Dave  Green, a UAW superstar who came up through that plant. There were two  locals at that plant. I don't remember if he came from 1112 or the  other one. These are the workers now at the new Ultium cell battery  plant. Many of them worked for the Cruze plant before GM closed it.  There are reminders everywhere of what bad trade deals did to the  Mahoning Valley.   But, do you know what? GM was paying. This was a joint venture. This  was GM and a Korean company called LG. This was a joint venture, 50-50.  Those workers at this Ultium plant were making $16 an hour. And I said  to GM: Well, how can you do this?   They voted for a union, by the way, the UAW there, just recently, by  a 90-plus percent vote.   I said to GM: How can you pay them $16 an hour when you have the  national UAW contract? It is much more generous than that and  negotiated, earned together.   They said: Well, we can't do anything because this is a jointly owned  plant, and we are just half of it.   Well, they are General Motors. Of course, they can do something about  it, and, of course, they need to do something about it.   Well, we were able--I hate to say it. We were able--partly by shining  a light on General Motors and what they had done and what their history  is--we were able to get a $4- to $5-an-hour raise working with Dave  Green of UAW Local 1112 and getting thousands of dollars in stock  buybacks for those workers that had been there a year or more.   These workers are, again, at the forefront of their industry, and  they are not getting paid like it. America should continue to lead the  global auto industry, but the Big Three can't do it without their  workers. There is still time for this to happen, for these autoworkers  and auto companies to agree to a fair contract. There is still time for  these great American companies to do the right thing.   It means something we probably don't do enough of here. It means  listening to their workers. It means foregoing strike-busting tactics,  like we saw the last time, when UAW workers were forced to picket. In  2019, GM cut off striking workers' health insurance, a bad-faith tactic  that not only hurts their most vulnerable asset, their workers, but it  hurts their families and really hurts their communities.   I was at Local 14 in Toledo, talking to one worker. Here is what  happens when an auto company uses its prowess and its power and its  anti-union fervor, when they do that and take away healthcare. There  was one worker whose healthcare was cut off at the Local 14 in Toledo,  at the Chrysler plant. His 4-year-old daughter Chesney needed surgery,  but she couldn't get it because GM canceled the family's health  insurance.   They are workers who had a contract. They paid in. They were  picketing because they didn't think over these 10 years GM and Chrysler  and Ford lived up to their side of the bargain.   I have a bill with Senator Casey, who sits next to me, to make sure  it doesn't happen again, the Striking Workers Healthcare Protection  Act. We shouldn't need that. We shouldn't need for companies to be  strong-armed or forced by government to honor the dignity of work. That  shouldn't be necessary when these iconic companies have done so well,  paid good dividends, and rewarded their executives with compensation  nobody would have dreamed up a generation ago. We shouldn't have to do  that. But until these companies understand, ``You should respect the  dignity of work,'' if they don't, then maybe it is time that government  says: OK, we are going to have a Striking Workers Healthcare Protection  Act. It is time to do the right thing, to bargain in good faith, and to  agree to a contract that indeed honors the dignity of work.   I yield the floor.                       Confirmation of Michael C.
