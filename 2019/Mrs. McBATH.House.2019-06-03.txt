 Madam Speaker, I rise on this first legislative day of  June to commemorate Gun Violence Awareness Month and to remember the 12  lives that were tragically cut short in Friday's mass shooting in  Virginia Beach.   This month, we will be taking action and bringing attention to  commonsense solutions to save the nearly 100 lives taken every day by  tragic acts of gun violence.   At this time, I ask my colleagues to please join me in this moment of  silence for all those who have been lost.                            ____________________
