 Madam Speaker, I rise to celebrate House  Democrats' efforts to lower costs for working families. Democrats fight  for families over politics.   As we know, Putin's cruel war on Ukraine has caused the price of  goods to increase. Instead of playing politics and pointing fingers as  extreme MAGA Republicans have done, House Democrats have delivered  results for the American people.   Democrats simply passed the Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act, the  Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act, and the Affordable Insulin  Now Act to lower the costs of goods, gas, and insulin for all  Americans.   On top of that, yesterday, the House passed the CHIPS and Science  Act, a strong bill that will invest in lowering costs for hardworking  American families and end our country's dependence on foreign  producers.   You see, Madam Speaker, Democrats are here to deliver for the  American people. We are putting people over politics.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of reinstating  the assault weapons ban.   This bill would put military-grade assault weapons out of circulation  for civilians. For me, the choice between banning assault weapons and  protecting young, innocent children is a no-brainer. I put children  above guns.   It pains me deeply that the children in our communities live in fear  of suddenly losing their lives or the lives of loved ones on a daily  basis.   I am a gun owner myself, Mr. Speaker. I was raised on a farm in south  Texas, and I know how to use a gun, especially for hunting. But assault  weapons are not for hunting. They are used to kill people quickly,  efficiently, and as fast as they can. That type of weapon is used  solely for that, for killing people, and it has no place in our  communities.   One child's life is worth more than all the assault weapons in the  world.
