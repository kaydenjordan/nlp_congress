 Mr. Speaker, this last Sunday, I had the opportunity to  go to Port Arthur and the El Vista neighborhood. Pictured here is the  Channel family flanked by the amazing Jefferson County Sheriff Zena  Stephens and County Commissioner Sinegal. You have Tomeka, McKenzie,  and their father, Quincy, who are trying to find something to save out  of a house that was all but destroyed. Ms. Tomeka showed me these  pictures of McKenzie who is now a college student at TSU. His first  grade picture and his kindergarten picture were just about all that  they could save from their house.   But I will tell you, the Channel family, like Texas, was undefeated  and promised me that they were going to build their house back bigger  and better than ever. That is the spirit of our State. It is the spirit  of the people in southeast Texas in communities like Port Arthur,  Orange, Beaumont, Houston, Port Lavaca, Victoria, Rockport, and so many  others.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you and the other Members of this body  for voting to support our State and other areas hit by recent storms to  the tune of $15 billion. It is going to help us build back bigger and  better than ever.                            ____________________
