 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and the  underlying bill, H.R. 7, a dangerous attack on the right of women to  make their own decisions about their health and their bodies.   On Saturday, I, too, joined the peaceful march in our Nation's  Capital with hundreds of thousands of women and men. Millions more  marched in Oregon, across the country, and around the world to demand  that our voices be heard.   This legislation, one of the majority's first priorities under the  Trump administration, won't create jobs. It will create barriers to  reproductive health care for countless women. It will  disproportionately affect low-income women, young women, women of  color, women in rural communities, and immigrant women. This bill turns  back the clock. It puts women's lives at risk.   Restricting abortion does not make it go away. It makes it unsafe.  This bill will drive women back to back alleys.   I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule and on H.R. 7.
