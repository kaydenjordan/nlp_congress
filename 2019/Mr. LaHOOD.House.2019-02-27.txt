 Madam Speaker, I rise to congratulate the Eureka College  men's basketball team, which last weekend clinched their first ever  Division III NCAA tournament bid.   On Saturday night, the Red Devils knocked off top-seeded Webster 70- 69 on the road to secure their conference championship, assuring their  spot in the Division III tournament.   With just a few weeks remaining in the regular season, the Red Devils  needed to win out their remaining four games to enter the conference  tournament, and they did just that.   The never-give-up spirit embodied by the team is a testament to the  great work done by Coach Chip Wilde, and I have no doubt it will carry  them through the NCAA tournament.   Our community in central Illinois is immensely proud of the historic  accomplishments of this year's Eureka men's basketball team, and we  will be cheering them on as they take on the number-one-seeded Nebraska  Wesleyan this weekend.   Congratulations, and go Red Devils.                            ____________________
