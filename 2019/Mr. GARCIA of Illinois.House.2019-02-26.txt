 Mr. Speaker, my colleagues make some very  good points. They make convincing arguments about executive overreach  and the misuse of Federal funds. I thank them for those statements, and  I would like to ask a more personal question.   Since when do we call human beings in need a national emergency? Have  all of President Trump's other arguments failed? Is he running out of  insults for people like me, people who came from Mexico to have a  better life in this country?   He used to call people like me bad hombres. When that failed, he  turned to other insults. And after they lose their shock value, he  calls us rapists, then murderers. At that point, he ran out of insults  for people like me, so he referred to us as coyotes.   Now, when all other labels have failed to achieve his central  campaign promise to build a medieval border wall, he calls people like  me a national emergency?   We must reject this premise as the presence of people like me in this  country, of people like my constituents in my district, a national  emergency.
