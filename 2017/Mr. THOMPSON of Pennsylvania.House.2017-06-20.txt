 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  the professional accomplishments of Paul Lyskava, who has served  diligently as the executive director of the Pennsylvania Forest  Products Association since 2002.   Paul has been instrumental in working closely with members of the  forest products industry. Even through a recession, Paul worked to put  the Commonwealth in a good position. Today, Pennsylvania is the leading  hardwood lumber producing State in the Nation.   In 2015, Paul was the recipient of the Joseph T. Rothrock  Conservationist of the Year Award, which recognizes actions and service  that contribute to the continued conservation of Pennsylvania's forest  resources in the spirit of Pennsylvania Forestry Association founder,  Joseph T. Rothrock.   Never before has the award been presented to an individual that  served in a capacity at all similar to Paul's. For the 4 years before  he took the helm at the Pennsylvania Forest Products Association, Paul  served as the executive director of the Pennsylvania Hardwoods  Development Council.   On behalf of the people of Pennsylvania, I want to recognize Paul for  all he has done for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   We are deeply grateful for your dedication and knowledge, Paul. Thank  you, my friend.                            ____________________
