 Mr. Speaker, a few weeks ago, the House Agriculture  Subcommittee on Nutrition, Oversight, and Department Operations hosted  a hearing that discussed the devastating impacts of President Trump's  proposed cuts to broad-based categorical eligibility.   Today, I would like to share the stories of a few of my constituents  who have benefited from the streamlined process that broad-based  categorical eligibility provides hungry families in accessing food  benefits.   In my hometown of Worcester, Massachusetts, a single mother who is a  domestic violence survivor raising one child works as a certified  nursing assistant and makes $1,819 per month before taxes or payroll  deductions.   While this may sound like enough to get by, her current income is  barely over 130 percent of the Federal poverty level.   Even with an income this low, her family only receives a $15 monthly  SNAP benefit. But because of broad-based categorical eligibility, her  child is also able to receive free school meals, and it helps her stay  afloat as a working mom.                                time  1030    Then there is another Worcester-area family of four, former refugees,  with two high school aged children. The mother and father, who both  work in shipping and packaging, make $15.35 an hour. While both parents  work as many hours as they can, their income fluctuates depending on  how many shifts they are assigned each week.   Many months they make under 130 percent of the Federal poverty level.  But during other months, when they get extra shifts, it puts them  slightly higher, over 130 percent. This month they received $110 in  SNAP; but if it were up to the Trump administration, just one more  shift could threaten the entire family's access to SNAP and their  children's access to free school meals.   Mr. Speaker, broad-based categorical eligibility is not a black-and- white issue. President Trump shouldn't be cutting off people's benefits  just as they are getting on their feet.   Last year, we worked hard to come up with a bipartisan farm bill and,  despite some discussions on this issue, Congress agreed then, and in  2014, to allow States to maintain their flexibility in accommodating  low-income households. In my home State of Massachusetts, where the  cost of living is relatively high, compared to the rest of the country,  that flexibility is crucial.   I would like to take a moment now to highlight a forward-thinking  partnership to address hunger among college students in Gardner,  Massachusetts. I find the work of organizations that address food  insecurity to be especially important during times like these.   I have mentioned before that the average SNAP benefit is around $1.40  per person per meal. You can't even buy a cup of coffee for that, much  less feed an entire family. For those experiencing hunger, food  pantries often serve as the safety net when SNAP just isn't enough.   In my district, for example, Worcester County Food Bank provides  donated food to a network of 118 partner agencies, including food  pantries, community meal programs, and shelters. Its mission is to  engage, educate, and lead Worcester County in creating a hunger-free  community. Last year, they served 81,000 neighbors.   Recently, I visited one of the food bank's partners, the Mount  Wachusett Community College's Food for Thought Campus Pantry, one of  the first college food pantries to partner with the Worcester County  Food Bank in addressing food insecurity on local college campuses.   Research shows that community college students experience higher food  insecurity than the rest of the population. A recent study found that  two out of three community college students are food insecure.   The Food for Thought Campus Pantry was created in October of 2017 for  students and by students in response to food insecurity among community  college students, which is becoming an increasing threat to student  success.   Since the Food for Thought Pantry opened its doors in October 2017,  210 students have registered for food assistance, and 7,238 pounds of  food, and 15,807 total items were distributed.   Without organizations like the Worcester County Food Bank and Mount  Wachusett's Food for Thought Food Pantry, students and families would  not have consistent access to the food that they need. These programs  and organizations are an irreplaceable key to solving our Nation's  hunger crisis, but they can't bear all of the  [[Page H5919]]  weight if the Trump administration has its way and cuts millions off of  SNAP.   That is why I encourage my colleagues in the House and Senate to join  me and fight every single attempt this administration makes to wage war  on people who are hungry. Working together is the only way we are going  to be able to end hunger now.                            ____________________
