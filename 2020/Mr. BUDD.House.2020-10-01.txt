 Madam Speaker, over 15,000 American children are diagnosed  with cancer every year. Having the most innocent among us receive such  a gut-wrenching diagnosis is devastating.   Thankfully, incredible progress has been made in treating cancer  among children. As more kids become survivors, we need to make a  concerted effort to improve their lives and to strive to develop  treatments that do not carry permanent side effects.   For example, I have constituents whose children have experienced  permanent hearing loss, which can occur when young patients undergo  chemotherapy. That is why I recently sent a letter to the Agency for  Healthcare Research and Quality asking them to identify any research  efforts to reverse this loss of hearing.   We owe it to our young survivors to help them thrive and maintain a  high quality of life. I encourage Federal researchers to keep producing  the medical miracles that will help our kids prevail in the fight  against cancer.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to call up H.R. 8265  to extend the Paycheck Protection Program to keep millions of employees  on the payroll of America's small businesses.
