 Mr. Speaker, as a Member of Congress, I would like the  very first part of my service to be to introduce my wife of 35 years,  Sue Curtis.   Sue has some political blood in her. You may be interested to know  that her great-grandmother was the first woman legislator in the State  of Utah. It gets better. She won that office by defeating her husband.   Sue and I are pleased to have six beautiful children, who are all  here with us this evening. We are grateful for our six children and  their spouses. Three of our 5\1/2\ grandchildren are here. My siblings  and many good friends are here. I thank them for being here tonight  with me.   The second thing I would like to do is pause and thank the residents  of Utah's Third Congressional District for trusting me and sending me  here to be with you. I am honored and humbled.   Like your constituents, these good people love America. They have  very high expectations of me and of us. I want to repledge my  willingness and desire to serve them with all of my heart.   I am excited to get to know each and every one of you, and I am  looking forward to working with you. My brief introductions to some of  you have been so positive. Everyone has been so extremely helpful.   Thank you, and I look forward to working with each and every one of  you.                            ____________________
