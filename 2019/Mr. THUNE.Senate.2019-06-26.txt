 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, there is no more important congressional  responsibility than providing for our Nation's defense. There will  always be those who wish our Nation harm, and our Nation must always be  prepared to defend itself. More than that, our Nation needs to be ready  to defend itself because being prepared for war is a strong deterrent  to conflict in the first place.   As I have said before in this Chamber, it is not our strength that  tempts our adversaries but our weakness. Maintaining our strength will  ensure that bad actors, whether they are terrorist groups or major  powers, think twice before attacking our Nation. In the words of Ronald  Reagan, ``well, to those who think strength provokes conflict, Will  Rogers had his own answer.'' He said of the world heavyweight champion  of his day: ``I've never seen anyone insult Jack Dempsey.''   This week we are considering the National Defense Authorization Act,  the annual legislation to authorize funding for our military and our  Nation's defense. Like last year's NDAA, this bill focuses on  rebuilding our military and ensuring we are prepared to meet 21st  century threats.   While many take it for granted that we have the strongest military in  the world, the truth is that in recent years our military advantage has  eroded. Budgetary impasses combined with increased operational demands  left our military undermanned, underequipped, and ill-prepared for the  conflicts of the 21st century. Meanwhile, other major powers have made  investing in their militaries a priority, set on diminishing U.S.  influence.   In November 2018, the bipartisan National Defense Strategy Commission  released a report warning that our readiness had eroded to the point  where we might struggle to win a war against a major power like Russia  or China. The Commission noted that we would be especially vulnerable  if we were ever called on to fight a war on two fronts. That is not a  good position to be in, and restoring our readiness has to be our top  priority.   We are once again in an era of great power competition, while at the  same time we continue to face threats from terrorists and rogue  nations. We have to be able to credibly deter--and, if necessary,  counter--any threat.   This year's National Defense Authorization Act continues the  reinvestment that we have made in our military. It invests in the  planes, the combat vehicles, and ships of the future, including the  Joint Strike Fighter and the future B-21 bomber, which will be based at  Ellsworth Air Force Base in my home State of North Dakota. It  authorizes funding for research and development and advanced  technology. It authorizes funds to modernize our nuclear arsenal to  maximize our deterrence capabilities. It also focuses on ensuring that  we are equipped to meet new threats on new fronts, including in space  and cyber domains.   It is important that we invest in these new areas of the battlefield  to ensure that we are prepared to meet and defeat threats. And, of  course, this legislation invests in our troops, the men and women who  keep our Nation safe and free.   This year's National Defense Authorization Act will provide our  troops with a well-deserved 3.1-percent pay increase, which is the  largest increase in a decade. It also focuses on addressing the recent  significant health and safety issues with private on-base housing. It  contains measures to support military spouses seeking employment and  increases access to childcare on military installations. It also allows  parental leave to be taken in multiple increments, which is often a  better fit for our military men and women.   I am pleased that once again the Senate has taken up the National  Defense Authorization Act in a timely and bipartisan fashion. There are  few bills more important than this one. I look forward to passing the  National Defense Authorization Act later this week and ensuring that  our military men and women have the tools they need to defend our  country.
