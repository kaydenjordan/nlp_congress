 Mr. President, I was asked recently what I think is the  No. 1 issue facing America. It is a tough question, and I have had a  lot of issues race through my mind: inflation, the debt, workforce  issues, the crisis at our southern border, the explosion of COVID  cases, the deadly opioid epidemic, a warming planet, Russia and China  flexing their muscles and creating more volatility around the world. We  have got plenty of challenges, don't we? But do you know what I landed  on, what I think is our biggest problem? It is the increasing  division--even polarization--of our politics and our country. It is  what makes it so hard to address all of those other issues that I named  that are so important to the families whom we represent.   Last week, on the Senate floor, my Democratic colleague from Arizona,  Senator Sinema, called it a disease of division. Well put. When we are  together, this country can achieve great things and has over the years.  It can provide a beacon of hope to a troubled world, but as Lincoln  warned, ``a house divided against itself cannot stand.'' In this body,  we should be figuring out how to come together to help America stand-- and stand strong--to address our many challenges.   That is why I am so discouraged about what I see playing out on the  U.S. Senate floor again this week. I have seen an attempt by Democratic  leadership to fan the flames of distrust. I see an attempt to further  divide an already splintered country, both by exaggerated arguments  being made to advance controversial legislation opposed by every single  Republican regarding the tough issue of voting and then to try to  achieve this purely partisan objective by changing a foundation of the  Senate to dismantle the one Senate rule--the legislative filibuster-- that works to bring us together rather than pull us apart.   Equally troubling to me is that this seems to be a purely political  exercise now in that the conclusion seems predetermined. Apparently,  the Senate is being dragged through this divisive and ugly partisan  debate, knowing that it will not achieve a legislative result but only  a deepening and hardening of the political lines in each camp.   Here in the Senate, most Republicans and most Democrats say they want  to bring the country together. I think they are sincere about that.  This message was an explicit part of President Biden's campaign for  President. Yet there is nothing about the harsh, partisan rhetoric from  the President's speech on this topic in Atlanta last week or from much  of the floor debate this week and last week that does anything but push  our country further apart.   First is the substance of the legislative fight. Democrats have been  highly critical of those Republicans who refuse to accept the results  of the 2020 election, pointing out accurately that dozens of lawsuits  failed to show adequate fraud to change the result. They have attacked  some Republicans because they have said that the election was rigged  and for questioning the State-by-State certification process that has  led to deeper rifts in our Nation and a significant number of  Republican voters questioning the legitimacy of the election. I get  that.   So why now are Democratic leaders and President Biden using the exact  same language, literally saying the elections are rigged--literally  saying that? Why are they perpetrating their own election narrative  that does not fit the facts but serves to push both sides deeper into  their own camps and, in particular, now leads Democrats to think that  elections are illegitimate?   Majority Leader Schumer claims ``Republicans are pushing voter  suppression and election nullification laws.''   President Biden has compared State efforts to tighten up election  administration to Jim Crow laws. He has compared Republicans to  notorious racists in our history. These attacks are overwrought,  exaggerated, and deeply divisive.   Here is what the nonpartisan and respected group called No Labels has  said about the Democratic attacks:         If you dig into these [state legislative] proposals you       find most entail tightening up procedures pertaining to       registration, mail-in absentee voting and Voter ID [laws]       that were loosened in 2020 in the name of making it safer for       people to vote amid the COVID pandemic. Many leading       Democrats and liberal commentators have taken to describing       these measures as Jim Crow 2.0, which is to say they are       somehow worse than the original Jim Crow era, which entailed       poll taxes and literacy tests, violent intimidation of Black       voters by the KKK, and even outright prohibition on Black       voters participating in party primaries in southern States.       To suggest that any voting measures being debated today in       America are somehow worse than this is simply irresponsible       demagoguery.    That comes from No Labels, which is a nonpartisan group, Democrats  and Republicans, trying to find that middle ground.   Now, to be fair, this group has been critical of Republican claims of  widespread election fraud that cannot be backed up. So what are the  actual facts?   First, the Constitution guarantees all citizens 18 years of age or  older the  [[Page S252]]  right to vote in elections regardless of race or gender--period.   The Federal Voting Rights Act reaffirms that right and makes it  enforceable in Federal court. In 2006, Congress voted in a bipartisan  way to reauthorize this important law for 25 years, through 2031. I  voted for and strongly support the Voting Rights Act and have long  supported other commonsense efforts to increase voter confidence in our  elections.   In fact, there is a bipartisan effort underway right now to deal with  a real problem: to ensure that after the fact, certified elections are  respected. This will require making overdue reforms to the Electoral  Count Act and some other reasonable updates to Federal election  procedures. I am happy to be working with a small group of Senate  Democrats and Senate Republicans on those efforts. That is how the  system should work. We are not going to agree on everything, but we can  sit down and talk and find common ground to address problems.   What Republicans and most Americans don't support is an unprecedented  Federal takeover of our election system, which is what the overly broad  party-line bills proposed this week by the Democrats will do.   Let me be clear. Despite what Democratic leaders are saying to jam  these bills through Congress, our democracy is not, as they say, in  crisis because it is too hard to vote. We just had a national election  in 2020 with the highest voter turnout in 120 years. Ninety-four  percent of voters said it was easy for them to vote. This is according  to the Pew Research Center--94 percent. That is good.   Some have said drastic changes are needed at the Federal level  because the States are now enacting voter restrictions. Some point to  the liberal Brennan Center, which reports that 19 States have enacted  laws which it characterizes as restricting the right to vote. As noted  above--again, by the nonpartisan No Labels group--when you really look  at these laws, the truth is that they largely make modest changes in  election law administration, such as the date that voters may apply for  mail-in ballots or ensuring voters are who they say they are through  voter ID and other signature requirements--something, by the way, the  vast majority of Americans support.   Some of the laws return to State practices closer to the status quo  before the pandemic. As an example, some laws reduced the number of  ballot drop boxes in cases where there were no ballot drop boxes before  COVID. And many of the States the Democrats criticize for improving  their elections process are enacting laws similar to those that have  long been in place in States represented by Democrats, so-called blue  States.   For example, under its new law, Georgia has a limit of 17 days of in- person early voting, 17 days. New Jersey and New York have 9 days of  in-person voting. Connecticut doesn't have any early voting. Georgia  has also added one extra Saturday of early voting. Georgia's new  requirement that voters provide their driver's license or State ID  numbers when applying for mail-in ballots, which Democrats have  criticized, is the same as laws in Maryland and Pennsylvania. Rhode  Island enacted a voter ID law a decade ago. And with regard to  President Biden's home State, The Atlantic has noted that ``few states  have more limited voting options than Delaware.''   I, frankly, have not heard Democratic leadership calling out any of  these Democrat-majority States for pushing what they deem to be voter  suppression.   I don't know anyone who doesn't believe it should be easy to vote and  hard to cheat. Every State has to find that balance, but they have to  find it while not violating the Voting Rights Act.    I don't agree with every policy every State has in place. I find some  too restrictive. As an example, I support no-fault absentee voting, as  we do in Ohio. It works well. You don't have to have a reason; you can  vote absentee. I would like to see every mailbox, in a sense, be a  ballot box, in essence. I find that some of the laws in some of the  States lack adequate security, on the other hand. For example, I think  some form of ID is smart, as do the vast majority of Americans.   But in our Federal system, within the guardrails of the Voting Rights  Act and consistent with the Constitution, that decision is left up to  State legislators, closer to the people and accountable to the voters.  That is just a fundamental philosophical difference we have here on the  Senate floor. We see it play out on lots of issues and now on this one.   I am very proud of the job that my State of Ohio and our bipartisan  election officials in every county do in our elections. In the last  election, we had a record 5.97 million Ohioans cast a vote--more voters  than ever. It represented 74 percent of eligible voters in our State,  the second highest percentage in the history of Ohio. Despite the  challenges of running the highest turnout election in our State's  history, during an unprecedented pandemic, it was widely regarded as  the most secure and most successful Ohio election ever.   Now is not the time to take the responsibility away from Ohio State  and local officials. Article I, section 4 of the Constitution clearly  assigns that authority over elections to the States. Alexander Hamilton  acknowledged in Federalist 59 that only in extraordinary circumstances  should the Federal Government become involved in election law,  explaining that allowing the Federal Government to run elections would  have been a ``premeditated engine for the destruction of State  governments.''   We are not in extraordinary circumstances right now. In general, it  has become easier and easier to vote in America, and that is a good  thing. And it has become easier to vote in America than many other  democracies around the world, and that is good too--easy to vote, hard  to cheat.   Despite all the fiery speeches on the floor stating the contrary over  the past week, according to a recent survey from Morning Consult, only  33 percent of American adults think it is too hard for eligible voters  to vote. A larger share--44 percent--actually think current rules  aren't strict enough. Having heard the debate, this is what voters  think.   Not only are Democrats attempting a Federal takeover of our election  system, but because they have chosen to change the constitutionally  based election system in a purely partisan way, they don't have the 60  votes necessary to get something passed here in the U.S. Senate. That  is why instead of reaching out to find a bipartisan way forward, they  are also proposing to fundamentally change the longstanding rules of  the Senate. Specifically, they are proposing to do away with what is  called the legislative filibuster in order to advance their Federal  election takeover bills by a simple majority instead of the normal 60  votes.   This 60-vote margin, the legislative filibuster, is the one tool left  to encourage bipartisanship not just here in the Senate but in our  system, in the House and at the White House. Yes, it provides important  minority rights in the Senate that protect the country from legislation  that is too far out of the mainstream, and it helps pass good  legislation, like Medicare or Social Security with big votes, big  margins, that mean those programs can be sustained, and they can be  relied upon. That is good for our country.   Most importantly to me, the legislative filibuster is the one thing  that encourages us to work in a bipartisan way. The successful passage  of the bipartisan infrastructure law last year is a good example. I was  in the middle of those negotiations. We knew we had to achieve 60 votes  in a 50-50 Senate. What did that mean? That meant that we had to find  common ground. We had to make concessions on both sides in order to get  to 60 votes. As a result, we got well over 60--into the seventies--and  a good piece of legislation was able to pass the House and be signed  into law and is now in place, again, as sustainable, reliable  legislation.   Did I agree with everything in it? No, nor did anybody else. But to  get to those 60 votes, we all had to make certain concessions.   Although it is a Senate rule, the legislative filibuster also  requires Members of the House of Representatives to come up with more  bipartisan solutions because they know their legislation has to pass  the Senate if they want it to become law. Just as I have been a  committed, bipartisan legislator here in the Senate for the past 11  years, the same was true in the House  [[Page S253]]  for 12 years, where I regularly used the fact that we needed 60 votes  in the Senate to force colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come  together and find a way to pass legislation in a bipartisan manner.  When I was in the executive branch in two Cabinet-level jobs in the  Bush 43 administration and as Director of the Office of Legislative  Affairs for Bush 41, that 60-vote necessity in the Senate calmed the  passions within the administration and forced us to find common ground  to work in a more bipartisan manner, resulting in more effective  results that last the test of time. I know the benefits to our country  of requiring more than a bare Senate majority that shifts back and  forth because I have lived it in the House, in the Senate, and in the  White House.    And it is not just me or other Republicans now saying that the  legislative filibuster is good for our Federal system. Less than 5  years ago, 32 Senate Democrats, including then-Senator and now-Vice  President Kamala Harris, joined with me and other Republicans in  signing an open letter insisting the legislative filibuster should not  change. This was at a time when there was a Democrat in the White  House, but Republicans controlled the Senate. It appears that those 32  Democrats were happy to defend the filibuster as good for the country  when they were in the minority but not now when the country is even  further divided, and they have a majority. All but a couple of those  Members have shifted their views.   I would encourage my Democratic colleagues to reread their own  letter, which makes such a compelling case that this is about the  country, not about one political party or another.   Back in 2005, Senator Schumer called abolishing the filibuster ``a  temper tantrum by those on the hard, hard right'' who ``want . . .  their way every single time.'' That was in 2005. Now he is majority  leader, and he has changed his tune.   This seems shortsighted to me, since the history of the Senate is to  change the majority regularly. We don't know who is going to be in the  majority in the next Senate.   Could the Senate rules be improved to allow more debate and more  progress on legislation? Absolutely. There is bipartisan interest in  this, and we should turn it to something constructive. After this  political exercise we are going through right now, we should turn to  the issue of reforming the rules around here. Let's have each leader  choose a few interested Members. Let's hammer out a bipartisan proposal  that allows more amendments and makes it easier to get legislation  passed. It is not that hard. But eliminating the one tool that forces  us to come together makes it harder to address those many challenges we  face. It makes it harder to pass legislation, broadly supported and  sustainable, to actually help the people we represent. That is what we  were elected to do. That is our job--not inflame the passions of our  most committed and hard-line supporters but achieve results. And as I  said at the outset, between inflation, and COVID, our southern border,  and more, we have got plenty to do.   I urge my Democratic colleagues to step back from the brink, to think  twice before trying to destroy what has made the U.S. Senate such a  unique and valuable part of the world's longest lasting and most  successful democracy. And I urge my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to support sensible rules changes and recommit to use the 60-vote  margin responsibly to generate consensus and find that elusive common  ground that will best serve those we represent and that will keep our  great Republic the envy of the world.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
