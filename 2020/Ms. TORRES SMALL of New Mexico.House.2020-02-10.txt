Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.  [[Page H982]]     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 1494, the  Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) Homeland Security  Partnerships Act.   Mr. Speaker, historically Black colleges and universities, HBCUs, and  minority-serving institutions, MSIs, play a pivotal role in American  society. HBCUs, which make up only 3 percent of the United States'  institutions of higher education, produce nearly 30 percent of all  bachelor's degrees earned by African Americans in science, technology,  engineering, and mathematics, or STEM fields.   My State, New Mexico, is home to 18 Hispanic-serving institutions,  which, like HBCUs, produce a large percentage of underrepresented  minorities who study and work in STEM. Nationwide, Hispanic-serving  institutions account for 66 percent of the more than 3.5 million  undergraduate Hispanics enrolled in higher education.   The contributions of HBCUs, HSIs, and other minority-serving  institutions prove that, when these institutions have equitable  opportunities, it drives our economy and improves outcomes within  minority communities.   It is also true of these institutions' ability to do work for the  Federal Government. The Department of Homeland Security, DHS,  specifically has always understood the value of working with such  institutions. However, the partnership is nowhere near its full  potential. DHS has even acknowledged that its existing programs for  engaging with HBCUs are being underutilized.   H.R. 1494 would require DHS to issue a strategy with yearly goals to  enhance these partnerships. This strategy will include specific  measurable goals to ensure the Department's progress in working with  HBCUs and HSIs.   Mr. Speaker, Federal investment in and partnership with HBCUs and  MSIs is vital for the strength of our economy and the advancement of  our society. I urge my colleagues to support this bill to ensure  effective partnership between DHS and HBCUs and MSIs.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Small Business,                                   Washington, DC, January 30, 2020.      Hon.

The Committee on       Small Business takes this action with our mutual       understanding that we do not waive any jurisdiction over the       subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and       the Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as       the bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may       address any remaining issues that fall within our       jurisdiction. Further, I request your support for the       appointment of an appropriate number of conferees from the       Committee on Small Business during any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation.        Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter       confirming our understanding regarding H.R. 1494 and would       ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be       included in the Congressional Record during floor       consideration of the measure. Thank you for the cooperative       spirit in which you have worked regarding this matter and       others between our respective committees.            Sincerely,                                                Nydia M. Velazquez,      Chairwoman.                                   ____                                     Committee on Homeland Security,                                        House of Representatives,                                   Washington, DC, January 30, 2020.      Hon. Nydia Velazquez,      Chairwoman, Committee on Small Business,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Velazquez: Thank you for your letter       regarding H.R. 1494, the ``Historically Black Colleges and       Universities Homeland Security Partnerships Act.'' I       recognize that the Committee on Small Business has a       jurisdictional interest in H.R. 1494, and appreciate your       effort to allow this bill to be considered on the House       floor.        I concur with you that forgoing action on the bill does not       in any way prejudice the Committee on Small Business with       respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives on this bill or       similar legislation in the future, and I would support your       effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees to any House--Senate conference involving this       legislation.        I will include our letters on H.R. 1494 in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of this bill.       I look forward to working with you on this legislation and       other matters of great importance to this nation.            Sincerely,                                                Bennie G. Thompson,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1494 seeks to  facilitate dialogue between the Department of Homeland Security and  HBCUs and MSIs on how to find areas of opportunity to build more  productive partnerships. Collaborating with these diverse institutions  is not only economically and culturally beneficial, it is  [[Page H983]]  necessary to effectively respond to current, emerging, and consistent  homeland security threats.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support this bipartisan  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (S. 2107) to increase the number of CBP  Agriculture Specialists and support staff in the Office of Field  Operations of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and for other  purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  S. 2107         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of Senator Peters' bill, the  Protecting America's Food and Agriculture Act of 2019.   This bill comes at a time of crisis for America's agricultural  industry. Threats from illnesses abroad endanger the domestic pork  industry, while trade tensions have strained relationships with the  international consumers our Nation's farmers supply.   The African swine flu, ASF, is a particular threat. A devastating  illness that is still being studied, this flu has not made its way to  the United States, and steps are being taken to ensure that it does  not.                                time  1545    Agricultural inspectors within U.S. Customs and Border Protection are  crucial in protecting our livestock and agricultural products from  potential disease outbreaks. They are charged with scanning all  incoming agricultural cargo and passengers to ensure that products are  not coming into the United States that are diseased or contain pests.   S. 2107 provides for the hiring of additional inspectors to augment  the workforce that is in place at our ports of entry. I commend Senator  Gary Peters for introducing this timely measure and also acknowledge my  [[Page H984]]  House colleague, Representative Filemon Vela, who introduced companion  legislation.   The need for greater agricultural inspection resources at the border  is critical. That is why stakeholders and leaders from across the  Nation have spoken out in support of S. 2107. The message from over 150  organizations that either produce pork or are involved in the industry  and the Governors from Utah, North Dakota, Ohio, Arkansas, Tennessee,  Idaho, South Carolina, South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, and Oklahoma is  loud and clear: Get this bill to the President so it can be enacted  into law.   This level of support demonstrates the vital need to pass this  legislation with all possible haste. We must provide CBP with the  resources needed to ensure a continued vitality of the American  agricultural industry.   Today, we are protecting American pork. Tomorrow, it may be New  Mexican chiles. That is why this is so important.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                          House of Representatives,                                        Committee on Agriculture,                                   Washington, DC, February 3, 2020.      Hon.

Our committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of       an appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate       conference involving this or similar legislation and ask that       you support any such request.        We would appreciate a response to this letter confirming       this understanding with respect to S. 2107, and request that       a copy of our letters on this matter be published in the       Congressional Record during Floor consideration.

Thompson,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Vela).  [[Page H985]]         Mr. Speaker, agricultural inspectors  at our ports of entry play a vital role in protecting one of the most  important things there is: the food we eat.   This bill will help protect every American as they sit down at the  dinner table. I commend my colleagues, Congressman Vela and Senator  Peters, for their work on this important bipartisan legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5273) to require the Secretary of  Homeland Security to develop a plan to increase to 100  [[Page H987]]  percent the rates of scanning of commercial and passenger vehicles  entering the United States at land ports of entry along the border  using large-scale non-intrusive inspection systems to enhance border  security, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5273         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

(8) Any challenges to implementing the plan or meeting the       benchmarks, and plans to mitigate any such challenges.        (f) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Large-scale non-intrusive inspection system.--The term       ``large-scale non-intrusive inspection system'' means a       technology, including x-ray and gamma-ray imaging systems,       capable of producing an image of the contents of a commercial       or passenger vehicle in one pass of such vehicle.        (2) Scanning.--The term ``scanning'' means utilizing       technology to produce an image of the contents of a       commercial or passenger vehicle without engaging in a       physical inspection of such vehicle.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5273 aims to improve border security by increasing  the inspection rate of vehicles entering the United States with  nonintrusive inspection systems or similar technology.                                time  1600    For years, Customs and Border Protection has used NII systems to  ``see'' inside vehicles for potential contraband, such as drugs,  without physically opening or unloading them.   This is critical since the majority of highly addictive and lethal  drugs being smuggled into our country are being smuggled through our  ports of entry, not between them.   According to the 2019 National Drug Threat Assessment released by the  Drug Enforcement Administration, passenger vehicles and commercial  trucks continue to be the primary method used by Mexican transnational  criminal organizations to traffic drugs such as cocaine, heroin, and  fentanyl into the United States.   However, CBP currently only scans about 15 percent of commercial  trucks and just 1 percent of passenger vehicles with NII systems.   In fiscal year 2019, Congress provided $570 million to CBP to install  additional systems on the southwest border.   CBP has indicated that these additional systems will primarily be  installed at large ports of entry.  [[Page H988]]    CBP expects these additional systems to increase NII scanning rates  of commercial trucks to 72 percent and passenger vehicles to 40 percent  by fiscal year 2024.   While this will undoubtedly improve security, it will also increase  the risk that transnational criminal organizations will shift their  smuggling efforts to smaller ports of entry that lack NII equipment,  such as those in my district.   This is a concern that I raised with CBP and port officials during a  field hearing I held with my colleague, Congressman Crenshaw, in my  district in Santa Teresa, New Mexico, last December.   My legislation aims to ensure that all land ports of entry are  appropriately equipped to combat smuggling.   Specifically, H.R. 5273 requires the Secretary of Homeland Security  to develop a plan to expeditiously scan 100 percent of vehicles with  NII systems or other similar technology at each port of entry.   It will also require the Secretary to report annually on the  Department's progress implementing the plan until 100 percent of  commercial and passenger vehicles are scanned.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the bipartisan work that went into  developing this legislation. Specifically, I want to thank my  colleague, Mr. Crenshaw, for his support on the bill.   H.R. 5273, if enacted, will help keep our communities more secure by  ensuring that CBP has the tools in place to do a more effective job at  interdicting dangerous narcotics and dangerous materials.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers  and am prepared to close after the gentleman from Texas closes.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, again, it is vital that  all vehicles entering the United States are scanned with NII systems or  similar technology to combat the smuggling of drugs and other  contraband into the country.   My legislation would help do just that by requiring the Secretary of  Homeland Security to develop a plan to achieve 100 percent scanning  rate of vehicles at each port of entry and reporting on progress  annually until that goal is achieved.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Committee of Homeland  Security for their unanimous support to favorably report my bill to the  floor.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge all of my colleagues to support H.R.  5273, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 504) to  amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to require the Department of  Homeland Security to develop an engagement strategy with fusion  centers, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:   Senate amendment:         Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``DHS Field Engagement       Accountability Act''.       SEC. 2. ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY WITH FUSION CENTERS.         Section 210A of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C.       124h) is amended by--        (1) redesignating subsections (j) and (k) as subsections       (k) and (l), respectively; and        (2) inserting after subsection (i) the following:        ``(j) Fusion Center Information Sharing Strategy.--Not       later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of the DHS       Field Engagement Accountability Act, and not less frequently       than once every 5 years thereafter, the Secretary shall       develop or update a strategy for Department engagement with       fusion centers. Such strategy shall be developed and updated       in consultation with the heads of intelligence components of       the Department, the Chief Privacy Officer, the Officer for       Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, officials of fusion       centers, officers designated as Homeland Security Advisors,       and the heads of other relevant agencies, as appropriate.       Such strategy shall include the following:        ``(1) Specific goals and objectives for sharing information       and engaging with fusion centers--        ``(A) through the direct deployment of personnel from       intelligence components of the Department;        ``(B) through the use of Department unclassified and       classified information sharing systems, including the       Homeland Security Information Network and the Homeland Secure       Data Network, or any successor systems; and        ``(C) through any additional means.        ``(2) The performance metrics to be used to measure success       in achieving the goals and objectives referred to in       paragraph (1).        ``(3) A 5-year plan for continued engagement with fusion       centers.''.       SEC. 3. OFFICE OF INTELLIGENCE AND ANALYSIS FIELD PERSONNEL                     SUPPORT TO FUSION CENTERS.         (a) Performance Metrics.--Not later than 180 days after the       date of the enactment of this Act, the Under Secretary for       Intelligence and Analysis shall--        (1) consider the effectiveness of existing processes to       identify and prepare field personnel for deployment to       support fusion centers and internal mechanisms to ensure       oversight and accountability of such field personnel,       including field personnel assigned to one center and field       personnel assigned to multiple centers; and        (2) publish and disseminate performance metrics, taking       into account, as appropriate, regional and threat diversity,       for--        (A) field personnel from the Office of Intelligence and       Analysis assigned to an individual fusion center;        (B) field personnel from the Office of Intelligence and       Analysis assigned to multiple fusion centers; and        (C) Regional Directors of the Office of Intelligence and       Analysis to ensure accountability for monitoring all field       personnel under the supervision of such Regional Directors.        (b) Training.--In consultation with the Chief Information       Officer, the Under Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis       shall develop and implement a formalized training module for       fusion center personnel regarding the classified Homeland       Secure Data Network, or any successor system.        (c) Fusion Center Defined.--In this section, the term       ``fusion center'' has the meaning given such term in section       210A(k) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, as so       redesignated by section 2.       SEC. 4. DHS COMPONENT USAGE OF THE HOMELAND SECURITY                     INFORMATION NETWORK.         (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of       the enactment of this Act, the  [[Page H989]]       Chief Information Officer, in consultation with the Under       Secretary for Intelligence and Analysis, and in accordance       with the functions and responsibilities assigned to the Under       Secretary under title II of the Homeland Security Act of 2002       (6 U.S.C. 121 et seq.), shall--        (1) develop policies and metrics to ensure effective use by       components of the Department of the unclassified Homeland       Security Information Network (referred to in this section as       ``HSIN''), or any successor system; and        (2) develop policies for posting unclassified products on       HSIN, or any successor system.        (b) Technical Enhancements.--The Chief Information Officer,       in consultation with the Chief Intelligence Officer, shall       assess and implement, as appropriate, technical enhancements       to HSIN to improve usability, including search functionality,       data analysis, and collaboration capabilities.       SEC. 5. REPORT.         Not later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of       this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall submit a       report to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental       Affairs of the Senate, the Select Committee on Intelligence       of the Senate, the Committee on Homeland Security of the       House of Representatives, and the Permanent Select Committee       on Intelligence of the House of Representatives that       describes the implementation of--        (1) the fusion center information sharing strategy required       under section 210A(j) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002,       as added by section 2, based on performance metrics developed       pursuant to such strategy;        (2) the deployment of field personnel to fusion centers (as       such term is defined in section 210A of the Homeland Security       Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 124h)), in accordance with section 3,       based on performance metrics developed pursuant to such       section; and        (3) policies that seek to ensure the effective use of the       Homeland Security Information Network, in accordance with       section 4, based on the metrics developed pursuant to such       section.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague on the other side of the aisle, Mr.  Bacon, for his leadership on the DHS Field Engagement Accountability  Act.   This bill was passed by the House of Representatives last January on  a voice vote. It was also passed unanimously by the Senate in July  after technical edits to the bill text.   The bill returns to the House floor today for us to consider the  bill, as amended by the Senate, and send it to the President.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, once again.   In the face of an evolving and increasingly complex threat landscape,  it is critically important to ensure that there is collaboration and  information sharing.   The Department of Homeland Security's 79 fusion centers, located  across the country, help to connect the dots about possible terrorist  plots, including domestic terrorist plots.   A 2016 review found that DHS does not have a strategic engagement  plan for these 79 fusion centers.   H.R. 504 will help address this gap by requiring DHS to develop a  Department-wide strategy for engaging with fusion centers. This  includes the development of metrics that will help hold fusion center  staff accountable for their performance.   This legislation also requires DHS to improve the classified and  unclassified information-sharing systems that are used by fusion  centers to ensure that information is shared properly and in accordance  with Department standards.   In part, H.R. 504 would require that all information-sharing policies  are developed and maintained by the Department's privacy, civil rights,  and civil liberties officers.   Over the past year, as communities across the country suffered from  acts of targeted violence and terrorism, we have been reminded of the  importance of information sharing.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers  and am prepared to close after the gentleman from Texas closes.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 504 passed the  House on voice vote last Friday and passed the Senate on voice vote in  July after technical edits were incorporated into the text.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill again so that  it can be sent to the White House for the President's signature.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1615     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2932) to amend the Homeland Security Act  of 2002 to ensure that the needs of children are considered in homeland  security planning, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 2932         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Homeland Security for       Children Act''.       SEC. 2. RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE UNDER SECRETARY FOR STRATEGY,                     POLICY, AND PLANS.         Paragraph (6) of section 709(c) of the Homeland Security       Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 349(c)) is amended by inserting ``,       including feedback from organizations representing the needs       of children,'' after ``stakeholder feedback''.       SEC. 3. TECHNICAL EXPERT AUTHORIZED.         Paragraph (2) of section 503(b) of the Homeland Security       Act (6 U.S.C. 313(b)) is amended--        (1) in subparagraph (G), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (2) in subparagraph (H), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``; and''; and        (3) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:        ``(I) identify and integrate the needs of children into       activities to prepare for, protect against, respond to,       recover from, and mitigate against the risk of natural       disasters, acts of terrorism, and other manmade disasters,       including catastrophic incidents, including by appointing a       technical expert, who may consult with relevant outside       organizations and experts, as necessary, to coordinate such       integration, as necessary.''.       SEC. 4. REPORT.         Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of       this Act and annually thereafter for five years, the Under       Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans of the Department       of Homeland Security shall submit to the Committee on       Homeland Security and the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of       the Senate a report describing the efforts the Department has       undertaken to review and incorporate feedback from       organizations representing the needs of children into       Department policy in accordance with paragraph (6) of section       709(c) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (as amended by       section 2 of this Act), including information on the       following:        (1) The designation of any individual responsible for       carrying out such paragraph (6).        (2) Any review, formal or informal, of Department policies,       programs, or activities to assess the suitability of such       policies, programs, or activities for children and where       feedback from organizations representing the needs of       children should be reviewed and incorporated.        (3) Any review, change, modification, or promulgation of       Department policies, programs, or activities to ensure that       such policies, programs, or activities are appropriate for       children.        (4) Coordination with organizations or experts outside the       Department pursuant to such paragraph (6) conducted to inform       any such review, change, modification, or promulgation of       such policies, programs, or activities.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 2932, the Homeland Security for  Children Act.   Mr. Speaker, when it comes to the Department of Homeland Security's  policies and programs, it is important the children, the most  vulnerable among us, are taken into consideration.   H.R. 2932, introduced by my fellow Subcommittee Chairman   Donald  Payne, would, for the first time, authorize the children's technical  expert position within FEMA to ensure the needs of children are  incorporated in all disaster-related activities.   Importantly, the bill recognizes that, when it comes to DHS, the  impacts of policies and programs go well beyond disaster response and  recovery. It recognizes that, from screening protocols at TSA  checkpoints to short-term detention standards to active-shooter  training, DHS policy must incorporate the needs of children.   To that end, H.R. 2932 would direct the Department of Homeland  Security's Under Secretary for Strategy, Policy, and Plans to  incorporate the needs of children in all departmental policies,  programs, and activities. A similar measure passed by voice vote in the  full House passed last Congress.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.           Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, U.S.             House of Representatives,                                   Washington, DC, January 7, 2020.      Hon. Bennie G. Thompson,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thompson: I write concerning H.R. 2932, the       Homeland Security for Children Act. There are certain       provisions in this legislation that fall within the Rule X       jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure.        In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 2932, the       Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure agrees to       forgo action on the bill. However, this is conditional on our  [[Page H991]]       mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill       would not prejudice the Committee with respect to the       appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional       claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or       similar legislation that fall within the Committee's Rule X       jurisdiction. I also request that you urge the Speaker to       name members of this Committee to any conference committee       which is named to consider such provisions.        Please place a copy of this letter and your response       acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the committee       report on H.R. 2932 and into the Congressional Record during       consideration of the measure on the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                  Peter A. DeFazio,      Chair.                                   ____                                     Committee on Homeland Security,                                        House of Representatives,                                    Washington, DC, January 7, 2020.      Hon. Peter DeFazio,      Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman DeFazio: Thank you for your letter regarding       H.R. 2932, the ``Homeland Security for Children Act.'' The       Committee on Homeland Security recognizes that the Committee       on Transportation Infrastructure has a jurisdictional       interest in H.R. 2932, and I appreciate your effort to allow       this bill to be considered on the House floor.        I concur with you that forgoing action on the bill does not       in any way prejudice the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure with respect to its jurisdictional       prerogatives this bill or similar legislation in the future,       and I would support your effort to seek appointment of an       appropriate number of conferees to any House--Senate       conference involving this legislation.        I will include our letters on H.R. 2932 in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of this bill.       I look forward to working with you on this legislation and       other matters of great importance to this nation.            Sincerely,                                                Bennie G. Thompson,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, children make up nearly 23 percent of the Nation's  population, and as the threats to our homeland continue to evolve, it  is important that we be prepared to adequately assist every child at  every age.   H.R. 2932 directs the Department of Homeland Security to include the  needs of children, the most vulnerable among us, in all departmental  activities.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of support signed by  several organizations representing the needs of children, including  Save the Children, the Child Welfare League of America, Share Our  Strength, and Zero to Three.                                               National Coalition on                                          Children and Disasters,                                       Arlington, VA, July 12, 2019.      Hon. Donald M. Payne, Jr.,      House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Payne: As members of the National       Coalition on Children and Disasters, which includes       organizations that advocate for the well-being of children       and their families in the preparation for, response to, and       recovery from natural or man-made disasters, we endorse H.R.       2932, the ``Homeland Security for Children Act of 2019.''        In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the nation learned       how unprepared we were at the federal, state, and local       levels of government in addressing and responding to the       needs of children. As a result, in 2007, Congress established       the National Commission on Children and Disasters, which       produced a comprehensive book of recommendations in 2010.       They included improved mental health services, pediatric and       child welfare needs, and disaster management planning,       response, and reunification for child care settings. Most       importantly, the Commission strongly recommended that       improved coordination of the needs of children among federal       agencies was needed.        The Homeland Security for Children Act would help improve       the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) and the U.S.       Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) response to the needs       of children during disasters. Your bill would also increase       accountability across government agencies in times of       emergency and incorporate feedback from youth-serving       organizations to prioritize and represent the needs of       children into department-wide policies. In addition, it would       mandate that DHS provide routine updates to Congress       summarizing efforts undertaken to incorporate the needs of       children in Department-wide policies, programs, and       activities.        With natural disasters on the rise, the time is now for       Congress to ensure that the necessary supports are in place       to address needs of children and families following       disasters. Children are not little adults. They have       specialized needs that must be considered when planning for,       responding to, and recovering from a disaster.        Thank you for your sponsorship of this critical       legislation, as well as your ongoing leadership on behalf of       children and families. If we can be of any assistance on       advancing this bill, please do not hesitate to contact us.            Sincerely,          National Coalition on Children and Disasters Members             include: Child Care Aware of America; Child             Welfare League of America; Early Care and Education             Consortium; First Focus Campaign for Children;             Institute for Child Success; National Center for             Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University; 1,000             Days; Partnership for Inclusive Disaster Strategies;             Public Advocacy for Kids; Save the Children; Share Our             Strength; Young Center for Immigrant Children's Rights;             Zero to Three.     Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to  support H.R. 2932, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4737) to amend the Homeland Security Act  of 2002 to require the Under Secretary for Science and Technology of  the Department of Homeland Security to research and evaluate existing  Federal research regarding approaches to mitigate climate change on  homeland security to identify areas for further research within the  Department, research and develop approaches to mitigate the  consequences of climate change on homeland security, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4737         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Homeland       Security Climate Change Research Act''.       SEC. 2. CLIMATE CHANGE PLANNING, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,                     AND PROTECTION AND PREPAREDNESS.         (a) In General.--Title III of the Homeland Security Act of       2002 is amended by adding at the end the following new       section:       ``SEC. 321. CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.         ``(a) In General.--The Under Secretary for Science and       Technology--        ``(1) shall evaluate existing Federal research regarding       approaches to mitigate the consequence of climate change on       homeland security to identify areas for additional research       and development pursuant to paragraph (2) with respect to--        ``(A) any connection between climate change and homeland       security, including  [[Page H992]]       how the resulting competition for resources, economic       distress, and social discontent has contributed to, among       other outcomes, acts of terrorism;        ``(B) the degree to which climate change is reflected in       terrorism preparedness and emergency planning and policies,       including with respect to preparedness, response to, and       recovery from natural disasters; and        ``(C) the degree to which the Federal funding structure to       respond to major disaster declarations and emergency       declarations is adequately structured to meet the demands of       responding to and recovering from acts of terrorism and       natural disasters that are aggravated by climate change; and        ``(2) shall, to the extent practicable, conduct research       and development on approaches to mitigate the consequences of       climate change on homeland security in response to finding       pursuant to paragraph (1).        ``(b) Scope.--The scope of the research and development       under subsection (a)(2) shall include the following:        ``(1) Any connection between climate change and homeland       security, including how the resulting competition for       resources, economic distress, and social discontent can       contribute to, among other outcomes, acts of terrorism.        ``(2) The degree to which climate change is reflected in       terrorism preparedness and emergency planning and policies,       including with respect to preparedness, response to, and       recovery from natural disasters.        ``(3) The degree to which the Federal funding structure to       respond to major disaster declarations and emergency       declarations is adequately structured to meet the demands of       responding to and recovering from acts of terrorism and       natural disasters that are aggravated by climate change.        ``(c) Consultation.--In carrying out this section, the       Under Secretary for Science and Technology shall consult with       the heads of other relevant agencies and departments of the       Federal Government, first responders, and relevant owners and       operators of critical infrastructure.        ``(d) Climate Change Defined.--The term `climate change'       refers to detectable changes in one or more climate system       components that is directly or indirectly attributed to--        ``(1) human activity; and        ``(2) altering the composition of the global atmosphere.''.        (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents in section       1(b) of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 is amended by       inserting after the item relating to section 320 the       following new item:  ``Sec. 321. Climate change research and development.''.       SEC. 3. REPORT TO CONGRESS.         Not later than one year after the date of the enactment of       this Act and annually thereafter for three years, the Under       Secretary for Science and Technology of the Department of       Homeland Security shall submit to the Committee on Homeland       Security and the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology       of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland       Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate a report on       any research and development activities carried out pursuant       to section 321 of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, as added       by this Act.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4737, the Department of  Homeland Security Climate Change Research Act.   Mr. Speaker, we know that climate change is happening, and it is  affecting every country around the globe. Moreover, we know that  climate change is leading to increased instability in developing  countries.   Not only has the Department of Defense written about it, Congress  acknowledged this in the fiscal year 2018 National Defense  Authorization Act, which included in its finding that ``as global  temperatures rise, droughts and famines can lead to more failed states,  which are breeding grounds of extremist and terrorist organizations.''   While DOD has researched the implications of climate change on  national security, DHS is best positioned to research and respond  climate change on homeland security. There are already reports of  extremist groups overseas using extreme weather events as a recruitment  tool, targeting farmers whose crops were lost to drought or other  weather events.   As these groups recruit more members, gaining strength, the threat  they pose to homeland security increases. DHS must be proactive, not  simply reactive in this threat.   H.R. 4737 will ensure that DHS is using its resources efficiently,  evaluating what we already know about climate change's effects on  homeland security, and, where practical, developing tactics to mitigate  those effects critical to the Department's mission. With this  knowledge, the good people at DHS will be able to better perform their  job and keep our country safe.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.           House of Representatives, Committe on Science, Space, and             Technology,                                   Washington, DC, January 9, 2020.      Chairman Bennie G. Thompson,      Committee on Homeland Security, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Thompson, I am writing to you concerning H.R.       4737, the ``Department of Homeland Security Climate Change       Research Act,'' which was referred to the Committee on       Homeland Security on October 18, 2019.        I agree to work cooperatively on H.R. 4737 and in order to       expedite consideration of the bill the Committee on Science,       Space, and Technology (``Science Committee'') will waive       formal consideration of the bill. This is, however, not a       waiver of future jurisdictional claims by the Science       Committee over the subject matter contained in H.R. 4737 or       similar legislation.        Thank you for agreeing to support the appointment of       Science Committee conferees during any House--Senate       conference convened on this legislation. Additionally, thank       you for your assurances to include our exchange of letters in       the Congressional Record during floor consideration of the       bill.            Sincerely,                                             Eddie Bernice Johnson,      Chairwoman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Homeland Security,                                    Washington, DC, January 8, 2020.      Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson,      Chairwoman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology,           House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairwoman Johnson: Thank you for your letter       regarding H.R. 4737, the ``Department of Homeland Security       Climate Change Research Act.'' I recognize that the Committee       on Science, Space and Technology has a jurisdictional       interest in H.R. 4737, and appreciate your effort to allow       this bill to be considered on the House floor.        I concur with you that forgoing action on the bill does not       in any way prejudice the Committee on Science, Space and       Technology with respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives on       this bill or similar legislation in the future, and I would       support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate       number of conferees to any House--Senate conference involving       this legislation.        I will include our letters on H.R. 4737 in the       Congressional Record during floor consideration of this bill.       I look forward to working with you on this legislation and       other matters of great importance to this nation.            Sincerely,                                                Bennie G. Thompson,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, effectively combating terrorism is a bipartisan issue,  and we have a duty to our constituents to support smart legislative  proposals.   Passage of the DHS Climate Change Research Act would ensure that the  Department of Homeland Security is proactively addressing and  attempting to mitigate the risks that climate change poses to our  homeland security.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for my colleagues to support H.R. 4737, and I  yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H993]]     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4432) to require the Department of  Homeland Security to prepare a terrorism threat assessment relating to  unmanned aircraft systems, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4432         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Critical       Infrastructure Against Drones and Emerging Threats Act''.       SEC. 2. DRONE AND EMERGING THREAT ASSESSMENT.         (a) In General.--Not later than 120 days after the date of       enactment of this Act, the Under Secretary for Intelligence       and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security shall--        (1) in consultation with other relevant officials of the       Department, request additional information from other       agencies of the Federal Government, State and local       government agencies, and the private sector relating to       threats of unmanned aircraft systems and other emerging       threats associated with such new technologies;        (2) in consultation with relevant officials of the       Department and other appropriate agencies of the Federal       Government, develop and disseminate a security threat       assessment regarding unmanned aircraft systems and other       emerging threats associated with such new technologies; and        (3) establish and utilize, in conjunction with the Chief       Information Officer of the Department and other relevant       entities, a secure communications and information technology       infrastructure, including data-mining and other advanced       analytical tools, in order to access, receive, and analyze       data and information in furtherance of the responsibilities       under this section, including by establishing a voluntary       mechanism whereby critical infrastructure owners and       operators may report information on emerging threats, such as       the threat posed by unmanned aircraft systems.        (b) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the       enactment of this Act, the Under Secretary for Intelligence       and Analysis of the Department of Homeland Security shall       prepare a threat assessment and report to the Committee on       Homeland Security of the House of Representatives and the       Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of       the Senate on the threat posed by unmanned aircraft systems,       including information collected from critical infrastructure       owners and operators and Federal, State, and local government       agencies. Such assessment and report shall also include a       classified plan to mitigate such threat, as appropriate.        (c) Definitions.--        (1) Critical infrastructure.--The term ``critical       infrastructure'' has the meaning given such term in section       1016(e) of Public Law 107-56 (42 U.S.C. 5195c(e)).        (2) Unmanned aircraft system.--The term ``unmanned aircraft       system'' has the meaning given such term in section 331 of       the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (49 U.S.C. 40101       note; Public Law 112-95).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4432, would require the Department of Homeland  Security to take action and address an emerging threat to our Nation's  security, the threat posed by unmanned aerial systems, or drones, to  critical infrastructure.   Drone technology is far from new. However, as technology evolves, so  do the capabilities of bad actors who may want to cause harm to the  people of this country. We know the drones can be weaponized and used  to carry out terrorist attacks, particularly on vulnerable, critical  infrastructure. Earlier this fall, drones struck Saudi Arabian crude  oil infrastructure, disrupting the production of 5.7 million barrels of  oil per day and causing a spike in oil prices around the world.   In an evolving threat environment, understanding the threats that  drones present to critical infrastructure here in the United States is  critical to mitigating those threats.   Critical infrastructure owners and operators recognize the benefits  of drone technology; many even put them to good use in their own  businesses. Nevertheless, they do have concerns about the threats that  unauthorized drones may pose to their facilities.   Currently, when a drone is detected in a facility's airspace, there  is no DHS official agency to call. At the very least, owners and  operators should be able to report unauthorized drone activity when  they detect it.   H.R. 4432 would allow for information sharing between critical  infrastructure owners and operators and DHS in several ways:   First, it would require DHS to establish a channel for the voluntary  reporting information on drones, as well as other emerging threats,  over a secure communications infrastructure developed in conjunction  with the Department's Chief Information Officer.   Additionally, H.R. 4432, would mandate that the DHS' Under Secretary  for Intelligence and Analysis develop and disseminate a threat  assessment on unmanned aerial systems and other emerging threats  associated with drone technology. This assessment would consider threat  intelligence from Federal, State, local, and private-sector partners  and would be prepared in consultation with other DHS components, like  the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, that have  relevant expertise.   Finally, H.R. 4432 would require DHS to report its findings to  Congress within 1 year.   Collectively, this bill would require DHS to take the lead on  understanding the threat that drones present to this Nation's critical  infrastructure, while also creating an enduring mechanism for DHS to  gather information on emerging threats, as they arise, from the owners  and operators who stand on the front line of our defense.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, this is an important  bill that will position DHS to address the threat that drones pose to  critical infrastructure. This measure was previously introduced by my  colleague  [[Page H994]]  from Louisiana (Mr. Richmond) in the 115th Congress and passed the  House by a voice vote.   Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleagues will do the same today, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4753) to prohibit the Secretary of  Homeland Security from operating or procuring foreign-made unmanned  aircraft systems, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4753         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Drone Origin Security       Enhancement Act''.       SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON OPERATION OR PROCUREMENT OF FOREIGN-                    MADE UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS.         (a) Prohibition on Agency Operation or Procurement.--The       Secretary of Homeland Security may not operate, provide       financial assistance for, or enter into or renew a contract       for the procurement of--        (1) an unmanned aircraft system (UAS) that--        (A) is manufactured in a covered foreign country or by a       corporation domiciled in a covered foreign country;        (B) uses flight controllers, radios, data transmission       devices, cameras, or gimbals manufactured in a covered       foreign country or by a corporation domiciled in a covered       foreign country;        (C) uses a ground control system or operating software       developed in a covered foreign country or by a corporation       domiciled in a covered foreign country; or        (D) uses network connectivity or data storage located in or       administered by a corporation domiciled in a covered foreign       country; or        (2) a system manufactured in a covered foreign country or       by a corporation domiciled in a covered foreign country for       the detection or identification of covered unmanned aircraft       systems.        (b) Waiver.--The Secretary of Homeland Security may waive       the prohibition under subsection (a) on a case by case basis       by certifying in writing to the Committee on Homeland       Security of the House of Representatives and the Committee on       Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate that       the operation or procurement that is the subject of such a       waiver is required--        (1) in the national interest of the United States;        (2) for counter-UAS surrogate testing and training; or        (3) for intelligence, electronic warfare, or information       warfare operations, testing, analysis, and or training.        (c) Definitions.--In this section:        (1) Covered foreign country.--The term ``covered foreign       country'' means a country labeled as a strategic competitor       in the ``Summary of the 2018 National Defense Strategy of the       United States of America: Sharpening the American Military's       Competitive Edge'' issued by the Department of Defense       pursuant to section 113 of title 10, United States Code.        (2) Covered unmanned aircraft system.--The term ``unmanned       aircraft system'' has the meaning given such term in section       331 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (Public       Law 112-95; 49 U.S.C. 44802 note).     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank my colleague, Congressman  Crenshaw, for introducing this important legislation.   To help carry out its many missions, the Department of Homeland  Security, DHS, relies on drones to improve situational awareness.  Drones can be used to survey damage from natural disasters or monitor  remote locations along the border, including in my district. If data  collected by a DHS drone was to be stolen by a foreign government, it  could jeopardize the national or homeland security.   Recent reports suggest that Chinese-manufactured drones, otherwise  known as unmanned aircraft systems, in the American market might be  compromised and used to send sensitive information to the Chinese  Government. In response to these cybersecurity concerns, the Department  of the Interior recently grounded all of its foreign-made drones. The  DOD similarly banned the purchase and use of all commercial off-the- shelf drones, except under limited circumstances.   It is time for the DHS to take similar protective measures. H.R. 4753  would prohibit DHS from purchasing or using drone technology  manufactured in certain foreign countries designated as strategic  competitors by the National Defense Strategy. The legislation permits  the use of such drone technology only when DHS notifies Congress that  the technology is being used in a limited manner, such as counter-drone  testing and training.   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bipartisan bill,  grateful to have joined Congressman Crenshaw on this initiative, and  pleased that it was reported out of committee by unanimous consent.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my House colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4753 takes the  much-needed step of protecting the Department of Homeland Security from  cybersecurity threats associated with certain foreign-made drones.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3413) to amend the Homeland Security Act  of 2002 to provide for certain acquisition authorities for the Under  Secretary of Management of the Department of Homeland Security, and for  other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3413         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``DHS Acquisition Reform Act       of 2019''.       SEC. 1.

Acquisition authorities for Program Accountability and Risk                Management.''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that all Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their  remarks and to include extraneous material on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, invests  billions of dollars in major acquisition programs annually to execute  its critical missions. These programs acquire systems vital to homeland  security, including ships for the U.S. Coast Guard and baggage  screening systems for the Transportation Security Administration.   However, the Government Accountability Office and the DHS Office of  Inspector General have reported on the longstanding challenges DHS  faces in managing its major acquisitions program. Although DHS has  taken steps to improve acquisition management, DHS struggles to ensure  that major acquisition programs cost what was originally estimated, are  delivered on schedule, and provide the capabilities originally  intended.   H.R. 3413 clarifies responsibilities for acquisition management  activities within DHS to ensure that major acquisition programs have  the appropriate support and oversight needed to succeed. It will also  improve accountability when major acquisition programs do not perform  as well as intended.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Crenshaw for yet another  important DHS bill. I urge my House colleagues to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3413 is necessary  to provide robust oversight of major acquisition programs to help  ensure that these programs meet cost, schedule, and performance goals,  and that taxpayer money is not wasted.   A previous version of this bill passed the House in the 115th  Congress by a vote of 407-1.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to, once again, pass this important  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the  yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
