 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to  join me in supporting H.R. 5247, the Right to Try Act, and I thank Dr.  Burgess and the Energy and Commerce Committee for bringing this  important legislation to the floor of this House.   In certain States across our Nation, patients who are diagnosed as  terminally ill are being told by doctors that all of the treatment  options have been exhausted because they do not have access to  experimental drugs. This type of overregulation by the Federal  Government is creating hopeless situations for thousands of Americans  whom we hold dearest to our hearts.   This right-to-try legislation allows terminal patients to have a  choice on whether or not an experimental approach is the path for them,  as sometimes, and many times, this is their only option.   Should this bill become Federal law, our terminally ill patients will  have increased access, nationwide, to unapproved drugs, leading to more  scientific breakthroughs that will benefit all Americans and, in lots  of cases, will save a life.   Now is the time for Congress to take action and give terminally ill  patients a fighting chance for their God-given right to life. How in  God's name can this Congress deny an American the right to life?   Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to join me today in supporting  this bill on this floor.
