 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I, too, rise in support of H.R. 1623, the Help America Run Act, a  bill drafted by my colleague across the aisle, newly-elected  Congresswoman from the great State of California, Ms. Katie Porter.   I want to commend Ms. Porter for this important legislation that I  believe will allow, as Chairperson Lofgren said, more people of all  socioeconomic strata, to be able to run for office.   Strong candidates should not be limited by their circumstances to the  point that it prevents them from representing their communities in  Congress. Representatives of this body should and do come from all  backgrounds to allow for equal representation of all who make up this  institution and this great Nation.   I believe this bill will make that happen by allowing the candidate  who is not currently a Member of Congress to pay for specific necessary  services like childcare and dependent care, that will enable a  congressional candidate to participate in all campaign-connected  activities.   This is a decision between the candidates and the donors that give to  their campaign. All we are asking to do with this piece of legislation  is to allow candidates to publicly disclose childcare expenses on their  FEC reports. Everyone is going to know what they paid. Everyone is  going to know what it went for, and that is an issue  [[Page H8578]]  they can discuss with the people who are funding their campaigns.    What this bill does not do--let me repeat, Mr. Speaker. What this  bill does not do is put more money in the pockets of current Members of  Congress. Instead, it allows for an equal opportunity for new  representation, providing more Americans who aspire to represent their  communities in Congress the chance to do just that.   This is not a radical idea. We should absolutely want to give  everyone an equal opportunity to run, to be able to serve, if elected,  in this great institution; including single parents who want to run for  Federal office but cannot afford the necessary childcare for the  grueling campaign schedules that everyone in this institution knows  exists.   Again, I want to thank Congresswoman Porter for her hard work on this  legislation. I look forward to seeing it implemented, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   What an impassioned speech by our colleague.   This isn't just a problem for one gender running for Congress. It is  a problem for all families. It is a problem that I faced when my kids  were younger when I first ran for office a little over 6\1/2\ years  ago. It is what to do with young children who can't go anywhere on  their own at that time.   With twin boys aged 12, I don't necessarily know that I trusted them  going somewhere on their own. I don't know if I trusted them at home  alone, at the same time. It is, what do you do to make sure your family  gets the supervision and the supervisory opportunities that you need?   This is an opportunity for us to show anybody who wants to follow in  what our forefathers of this great Nation put forth in our Constitution  creating the House of Representatives to be able to be a House for the  people and by the people to represent this great United States. This is  going to be an opportunity for anyone, no matter what their path is in  life, if they have children at home, if they are a single mom, if they  are a single dad, if they are a family with kids, if they are wondering  how they take on this challenge, how they get a chance to serve this  great country, how they get a chance to join us, this is going to be  their opportunity to say: I am going to go out and spend a lot of time  raising money because many of these campaigns--I can tell you how much  mine cost. It cost millions upon millions of dollars and a lot of time.  When you are gone, you are raising more money to run because campaigns  are too expensive. We understand that. We get that. We agree on that.   This is a chance to say: I am going to get out there and get on the  dance floor and take that chance. Too many people who may want to run  for office won't do it because they are afraid to lose. I think  everyone has to have the chance to take away any excuse to be able to  step out and put their name on the ballot to have a chance to do what  we do.   If I, the son of a high school dropout and a guy who graduated high  school who walked into a fast-food restaurant in 1959 and had a dream  to own his own one day, if I, who had no family ever in politics or  government, can come and stand on this floor and work with colleagues  like Chairperson Lofgren and Congresswoman Porter to help put good  legislation like this through, anybody in this great country can do it.   It is a great opportunity to show the next generation that we care  enough about them to be able to show them how to do exactly what we do.   Let's all come together. Let's make this happen today. It is a great  opportunity for us to stand here on the floor and show the American  people the Republicans and Democrats do agree on issues, and we do work  together. I mean, maybe the news will cover it, maybe they won't. We  might be able to debate Nickelback or something and get them to cover  it today.   But do you know what? We know what happens here. We know we have  opportunities. We know that we are able to put good policies like this  together. We know that friendships do exist on both sides of the aisle  in this institution.   This is a great bill. This is an opportunity. I thank all of my  colleagues who are supporting this.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Will the gentlewoman yield?    Mr. Speaker, I ask Ms. Porter this:  Your legislation doesn't tell candidates they have to spend money on  this, right?    Mr. Speaker, can I inquire how much  time we have remaining on debate?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I love debate like this. It is an opportunity for us, again, to show  how we can work together, both sides of the aisle, and put good  policies forward that are going to affect the ability for people to  serve in this institution.   Hearing the talk about kids when running for Congress, it actually  takes me back. Many folks may see me walking around the Capitol tunnels  with earbuds in, in the early mornings about 5:30 our time, 4:30 back  home, because my wife is a nurse. They work on a different schedule.  That is my time that I get to talk to her. She was a nurse and left for  work very early in the morning when our kids were growing up. And my  job as a congressional staffer, I had a great boss who made sure that  he told me every day to put my kids first.   I cannot thank our colleague   John Shimkus, who I worked for, for 16  years, enough for telling me to put my family first. It is a guy like  that who not only makes me a better Member of Congress being around  him, but he helped me learn how to be a better dad.   Until I got elected, my job each day was to get my kids ready,  sometimes a little more labor intensive when they were a little bit  younger than they were when they were older. Although it was kind of  easier when I was holding twin boys in seats rather than chasing them,  but dropping them off at childcare, before we dropped them off at  school. During the summer, if we didn't have childcare opportunities,  if I didn't have the opportunity to take them and drop them off,  neither my wife nor I could have gotten to the jobs that we enjoyed  pursuing so much.   In today's day and age, with so many two-parent working families,  this is only a commonsense provision that is going to be a choice, a  choice for candidates to use if they choose. That is something that we  ought to all come together and make happen.    Look, there are great people on both sides of the aisle in this  institution. I want more of them. I want more people who want to be  able to do what we do. This is going to be an opportunity to show them,  too, that this institution isn't nearly as dysfunctional as the news  media says it is. Most of what we do here is actually done on a pretty  bipartisan basis, but it doesn't make the news.   Hopefully, today, maybe one of the folks covering us is going to talk  about what we did together, maybe. I am going to cross my fingers.  Maybe they will understand that this is what we need to highlight  instead of the nonsense that happens when the two parties and the  extremes scream at each other.   A good bill, again, from Congresswoman Porter, and it is great to  work with her, and a great bill from Chairperson Lofgren. I appreciate  the opportunity to serve with each and every one of my colleagues.   I will ask, again, for every Member to support this today loudly on  the floor, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairperson Lofgren for, again, working  with me on this issue--it is such a very important piece of  legislation--because I am proud to rise with her today in support of H.  Res. 107, the SFC Sean Cooley and SPC Christopher Horton Congressional  Gold Star Family Fellowship Program Act.   Since being elected to Congress in 2013, my team has worked over  1,000 cases on behalf of veteran constituents in central-southwestern  Illinois, including when the USS John McCain collided with a merchant  ship off the coast of Singapore in 2017, killing 10 sailors, including  Petty Officer Logan Palmer from my district. My office was able to help  this Gold Star family navigate the confusing Department of Defense  policies relating to next-of-kin travel for noncombat-related deaths  and other important procedures that follow a tragedy like this.   Over the years since that tragedy, I have become friends with Petty  Officer Palmer's parents, Theresa and Sid, and deeply value our  friendship, which is one of the reasons why I am so honored to be on  the floor advocating for the passage of this bill.   I have also worked to change the next-of-kin family travel policies  at the DOD and am currently working in a bipartisan way with Members  across the aisle to codify those changes that are already in existence.  Let's codify them into law so they don't change again when  administrations change.   I will continue to use my office to assist those who have given so  much. That is why I believe in this program that will allow Gold Star  spouses, children, and siblings the opportunity to work for a  congressional office in D.C. or a district office.   We already have a model for success in Congress to shape this program  after. It is the Wounded Warrior Fellowship Program that lies within  the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer and has provided many  opportunities over the years for veterans to serve in the House of  Representatives.   Currently, there is a Wounded Warrior fellow who works in my  Maryville, Illinois, office, Peter Arsenault. He is doing a great job.  Peter helps veterans in my district every day and understands the  assistance and the help that they need to navigate the bureaucracy  within the Federal Government.   Mr. Speaker, I do want to give a special thank-you and a shout-out to  our colleague and my very good close friend, Trent Kelly, the gentleman  from Mississippi, for his work on taking this fellowship program from  an idea into a reality. Trent did everything to make sure that this  became law, that this bill passed the House and made it on its way to  become law.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank the Gold Star families for their  participation in making this process a reality, too, and for those  family members who could be here in the gallery to see this important  program come to fruition.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am happy to take this  opportunity to offer one of our great colleagues from the great State  of Nebraska the opportunity to speak in favor--like Trent Kelly from  Mississippi--one of the former generals, or current generals, who  serves in our Nation's military, but whom we also have the great  privilege of serving with here in this institution, General   Don  Bacon.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr.  Bacon).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how  much time remains. I am sure I talked longer than I thought.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), my good friend, another  veteran who serves in this great institution with us. I am honored to  be able to serve with him on the House Administration Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, again, this is one of those rare opportunities where we  get to talk about our heroes.   The worst vote I think any of us would ever have to take is a vote to  authorize to send young men and women off to war, off to battle, to  protect the freedoms and the liberties that many of us in this country  take for granted every single day. We expect freedom and liberty to  exist in the United States of America, but it doesn't happen without  the courage and the sacrifice of so many families throughout our  Nation's history. I cannot imagine. I have never had the chance to take  that vote in 6\1/2\ years, and I hope and pray every day that I don't  personally ever have to take it. But many in this  [[Page H8582]]  institution, who have been here and have served here, have had to make  that vote.   I could not imagine what our Gold Star families go through when they  get that knock on the door. But to know that the legacy of their young  sons and daughters is going to live on in a fellowship program here in  the United States House of Representatives--because General Trent Kelly  and his team and an idea from his constituents is now moving forward in  the next step to become law--that is one thing that we can do here in  the House of Representatives to honor those families who have  sacrificed so much.   We often imagine the future of what would have happened if these  young men and women would have been able to come back home, families  torn apart by tragedy at a time when their sacrifice gave us the  freedoms and liberties that we enjoy being able to serve here.   We have an opportunity today to say thank you again. This is our  opportunity to show those families that their sons and daughters  perishing during battle, or noncombat-related deaths, like Petty  Officer Logan Palmer from Harristown, Illinois, in my district, let's  say thank you to them. Let's let their memory go on.   Let's let the next generation of people who, like Chairperson Lofgren  and I, we started out as congressional staffers. Do you know what, I  think both of us are here because of that experience. And to have this  program, this Gold Star Fellowship Program, allow young men and women,  who have been affected by so much, come into our institution, who  knows, maybe they will be the next chairperson and ranking member of  the House Administration Committee, and maybe their constituents, like  General Kelly's constituents, will give them a great idea like this,  and maybe they will be able to move it on the next step in becoming  law.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairperson Lofgren again for allowing us the  opportunity, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how  much time remains?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Baird), my colleague and wounded warrior, a  hero. I am glad I get the opportunity to serve with heroes like the  gentleman from Indiana.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Kelly), and I can't  tell you how proud I am to yield to the sponsor of this legislation,  somebody who deserves a lot of thanks for moving this bill forward.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance  of my time.                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.
