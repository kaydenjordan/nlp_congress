 Madam Speaker, I rise to recognize Augostina Mallous on  her many accomplishments.   Augostina is currently a freshman journalism major at Hofstra  University with a 4.0 grade average. Augostina is a member of the  competitive dance team and practices 50 hours a week. Augostina is the  former Miss New Jersey's Outstanding Teen and is the current Miss  Garden State.   During this pandemic, Augostina has made a significant impact on our  community. She not only organized a food drive for seniors to help  deliver food to those in need, Augostina was also making masks for Cape  Regional and Shore Medical Hospitals, along with several nursing homes.   Madam Speaker, Augostina exemplifies the virtues of compassion,  honor, integrity, dignity, and sincerity. Augostina's family, friends,  and community are proud of her.   Madam Speaker, I thank Augostina for her inspiration, and may God  bless her.                            ____________________
