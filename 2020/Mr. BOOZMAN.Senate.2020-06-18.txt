 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the  career of U.S. Air National Guard CMSgt. Del G. Atkinson, who is  retiring after almost 40 years of faithful service to our country.   Chief Atkinson entered Federal Active-Duty service in the U.S. Army  in August 1982. He was stationed in Nuremburg, West Germany, with the  595th Military Police Company, First Armored Division ``Old Ironsides''  and the 101st Airborne Division ``Screaming Eagles'' with the 101st  Military Police Company Fort Campbell, KY.   Upon completion of his Army service, he entered into the Air National  Guard. During his lengthy career in the Guard, Chief Atkinson served a  number of combat deployments, including Operations Southern Watch,  Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and Coronet Oak.   Chief Atkinson used his experience in the Army to launch a career in  law enforcement, working as a member of the University of Arkansas  Police Department and the Springdale, AR, Police Department.   Over the course of almost 36 years, his military service took him  around the globe, and yet, whether it was in Arkansas, our Nation's  Capital, or overseas, he and I always seemed to be crossing paths.   A number of those occasions were more than just fortunate  circumstances, as for a time, he was part of a team responsible for  providing protection for aircraft transitioning between overseas  airfields with inadequate security.   He often found himself assigned to Senate, congressional, and White  House missions. I was privileged to have been onboard for some of those  flights. My colleagues and I relied on Del and his teammates, for our  protection as we traveled to some dangerous parts of the world.   On those trips, I remember looking back on his time in local law  enforcement and thinking to myself how special it was that northwest  Arkansas had extra representation onboard. Del and his colleagues took  great care of us, each and every time, and for that, I will always be  appreciative.   Chief Atkinson was promoted eight times during the course of his  military career. He earned a number of prestigious awards and medals  including a Meritorious Service Medal with three oakleaf clusters and  the Joint Service Commendation Medal.   His pride in our Nation and his fellow servicemembers is apparent,  including with his service as a member of the Liberty Jump Team, where  he performed commemorative parachute jumps honoring veterans of wars  and foreign conflicts. He joined the team because he ``wanted to give  back to the Greatest Generation'' and honor how they ``overcame all  obstacles and persevered to win the victory on all fronts.''   I remain grateful for Del's combat service to the Nation, dedication  to keeping the UA campus and the community of Springdale safe during  his law enforcement days, and commitment to keep alive the memory of  those who sacrificed for our Nation. I wish him years of joy and  happiness in retirement.                            ____________________
