 Madam President, I wish to speak about the  importance of and my strong support for the final passage of the fiscal  year 2019 National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA, and the reason for  my absence.   As we all know, the NDAA addresses many issues including the  modernization of major weapons systems, security assistance to our  allies, and significant changes to personnel policy. Our Nation's  military relies on Congress to fulfill our obligation with the timely  passage of this legislation. I am proud to support our men and women in  uniform yet again in the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization  Act for Fiscal Year 2019, legislation appropriately named for our dear  friend and colleague Senator John McCain.   I deeply regret the need for my absence today. While my record  reflects the rare nature in which I miss a vote, I did not come to this  decision lightly. An unfortunate incident at the Fayetteville VA  Medical Center in Fayetteville, AR, required my presence and advocacy  on behalf of our Nation's veterans. While untimely, I strongly believe  it is my congressional duty to ensure that our government fulfills its  promise to the men and women who have worn the cloth of our Nation.  Such a requirement demanded my immediate attention today in Arkansas. I  would like to thank Senators Inhofe, Reed, and McCain, along with their  staffs, for all their hard work and support.
