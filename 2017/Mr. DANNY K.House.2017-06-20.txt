 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   First of all, I want to thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for  yielding.   I strongly support H.R. 2847, the Improving Services for Older Youth  in Foster Care Act. This bill would expand eligibility for the Chafee  Foster Care Independence Program services and education for older  foster youth, and ensure that all funds and education vouchers are  used. I want to commend my colleague, Representative Bass, for her  longstanding leadership on this bill.   As has been indicated by the ranking member, this important bill, and  the other child welfare bills we will consider today, come from the  Families First Prevention Services Act. The Families First Prevention  Services Act begins a fundamental shift in Federal child welfare policy  to preserving families rather than separating them. I look forward to  working with my colleagues to ensure that we enact the larger bill with  these important child welfare provisions and as we consider the other  bills separately today.   I would like to note that there are, indeed, five child welfare bills  on the floor this afternoon, which is a real testament to the  leadership of Chairman Brady and Ranking Member Neal. So I commend both  of them for their leadership in bringing the Ways and Means Committee  together to the extent that we can have five bills that have been  researched, that have been debated; levels of agreement have been  reached.   I strongly support the Improving Services for Older Youth in Foster  Care Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell).    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu).    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass), the sponsor of this bill.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I have no further  requests for time, and I yield myself the balance of my time.   H.R. 2847 would provide important assistance for youth aging out of  foster care.   In my State of Illinois, 22 percent of the more than 16,000 children  placed in foster care in 2015 are aging out. Illinois is widely  regarded as a leader among States when it comes to foster youth aging  out of care; therefore, it is, indeed, one of the first jurisdictions  in which young people who are in foster care on their 18th birthday  were able to remain in beyond the age of 18.   Research conducted by the University of Chicago found that allowing  foster youth to remain in care beyond the age of 18 is associated with  an increase in child well-being, including postsecondary educational  attainment. Specifically, former foster youth from Illinois are twice  as likely to have ever attended college, and more than twice as likely  to have completed at least 1 year of college by age 21, compared with  foster youth in other States that have not been given the option to  stay in care beyond 18 years of age.                                time  1600    Due to school mobility issues experienced in high school, only 58  percent of foster youth graduate from high school by age 19, which  makes it unlikely that they would be graduated from college by age 21.   Extending access to Chafee Independence Act programs to age 23 rather  than cutting these young people off at age 21 would ensure these youth  are able to be supported beyond their first year of college. We know  that when students lose access to critical financial aid resources such  as the education training voucher in the middle of their college  journey, it forces them to drop out of college in search of employment.   Last Saturday, I spent 2 hours with a group of young people who had  been organized by a young fellow, Kenneth Bennett's son. His name is  Taylor Bennett. Taylor is the younger brother of Chance the Rapper. He  is 21 years of age and had organized young people who were transgender,  who were homeless, who were out of school, who were in need of  assistance and help, and they were pleased to know that we were going  to be considering this legislation today, which I strongly support.  [[Page H4955]]    I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she  may consume to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell) for the  purpose of a colloquy.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I strongly support H.R. 2866, the Reducing Unnecessary Barriers for  Relative Foster Parents Act.   This important bill helps relative caregivers by requiring States to  examine whether their licensing standards align with the best practices  in licensing family foster homes. In so doing, H.R. 2866 requires  States to set reasonable requirements for family homes, standards that  consider community norms and cultural differences and standards that  remove artificial barriers to family care.   I have advocated these provisions within my own bill to improve  support for kinship caregivers, and I am proud to support Congresswoman  Sewell and Congressman Smucker's bill.   More than 25 percent of children in care live with a grandparent or  other relative. My congressional district has the highest percentage of  children living with grandparent caregivers in the Nation, followed  closely by two other congressional districts in Illinois.   In Illinois, 37 percent of all children placed in out-of-home care  are placed with relatives; however, less than half of these children  are placed with relatives in homes that are licensed.   The vast majority of relative caregivers are not able to become  licensed caregivers because the standards do not make sense with their  circumstances, such as requiring a grandmother in an expensive city  like Chicago to have one bedroom for each of her three grandbabies or  requiring her to take dozens of hours of parent training each year.   In 2008, I worked with Congressman Jerry Weller from Illinois to  allow States the ability to waive nonsafety licensing standards on a  case-by-case basis to help kinship caregivers via the Fostering  Connections Act. Unfortunately, many States chose not to exercise this  waiver authority to assist kin caregivers.   For example, in 2011, although Illinois had more than 3,600  nonlicensed relatives caring for youth, only 72 licensing waivers for  relatives were approved. Less than 2 percent received waivers.   H.R. 2866 requires States to modernize their licensing standards to  align with the best practices in licensing. This is a commonsense and  important change.                                time  1615    Further, this bill advances our goal of ensuring that States follow  the waivers to meet the best interests of the children. To understand  the use of waivers, Children's Bureau should collect data on State's  granting waivers for nonsafety licensing standards for relatives,  including the number of relatives applying for waivers, the number of  waivers issued or denied, and the reason for denial.   I strongly support H.R. 2866, the Reducing Unnecessary Barriers for  Relative Foster Parents Act and urge my colleagues to support it.   I reserve the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell) who is a sponsor of this bill.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass).    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   H.R. 2866 is important because it supports kinship caregivers.  Research shows that children placed in kinship care are safer, more  stable placements and are more likely to be connected with their  siblings and community than children placed in nonrelative placements.   In addition to these positive outcomes for children in relative care,  research shows that kinship care placements are more cost effective. In  Illinois, cost studies estimated an average of $4,778 in savings of  title IV-E administrative expenses over an 8-year period compared to a  match control group that did not have this option.   More than 400,000 children make up our Nation's foster care  population with more than one in four of these vulnerable children  living with a grandparent or other relative. We should do as much as we  can to strengthen these families and children. H.R. 2866 takes an  important step forward.   Mr. Speaker, I have two facilities in my congressional district that  have outstanding programs. They are 45-unit buildings that have been  constructed for grandparents raising grandchildren. One is operated by  the Sankofa Safe Child Initiative, the other by the Coppin AME Church  Community Development Agency. Both of these are tremendous examples of  what can happen when children have the opportunity to be nurtured by  grandparents.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support this legislation. I urge its passage,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I strongly support H.R. 2742, the Modernizing the Interstate  Placement of Children in Foster Care Act.   Cross-State placement of youth in foster care is particularly salient  to children living with kinship caregivers. Given that my congressional  district has one of the highest percentages of grandparent caregivers  in the Nation, I am pleased to join with Congresswoman Walorski in  leading this important legislation.   This bill helps reduce the barriers and delays that continue to exist  when the best new home for a child is in a different State than the  unsafe home the child had to leave. Removing barriers that delay or  prevent interstate child placement is a longtime bipartisan goal within  Congress.   This bill addresses an important factor in those delays: the ability  of State computer systems to link up to process the paperwork. The  current paper-based system is antiquated and slow.   As part of an HHS pilot project, seven States, and the District of  Columbia, currently participate in the National Electronic Interstate  Compact Enterprise, or NEICE, an online tool that allows State office  systems to talk to each other and process interstate placements more  quickly. I am, indeed, proud that Illinois is one of those States.   An early evaluation found that this system reduced waiting times for  affected children by about one-third. Ten of the States have already  announced plans to join the exchange over the next 2 years. H.R. 2742  would accelerate the number of participating States in the short run  and ensure that all States participate in the long run. The more States  that join, the more it speeds up the process for everyone.   The director of the Illinois Department of Children and Family  Services  [[Page H4965]]  often emphasizes that we need to operate in ``kid time'' and not  ``adult time,'' meaning that we need to recognize the urgency of  restoring permanency for children in child welfare rather than allowing  adult bureaucracy to impede permanency.   Modernizing the technology to increase efficiencies and quicken  placements is common sense and respects the urgency of finding  permanent, loving homes for children.   This is a good bill, and I thank Congresswoman Walorski and her staff  for their excellent work. Our States are joined together, so we join  with this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the bill, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett), an outstanding legislator.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass).    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I have no further  speakers, but I will say that my staff and I have been delightfully  pleased to work with Representative Walorski and her staff in preparing  this very commonsense, good legislation. I strongly support it and urge  its passage.   I yield back the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I strongly support H.R. 2834, the Partnership Grants to Strengthen  Families Affected by Parental Substance Abuse Act.   I am pleased to join with Congresswoman Noem in leading this bill to  strengthen families by addressing parental substance abuse and  decreasing the number of children entering foster care. Our bill is  common sense. It takes the research lessons from the smaller scale  Regional Partnership Grants and expands those efforts to the State  level.   We know that substance abuse underlies a substantial percentage of  child welfare cases, affecting between one-third to two-thirds of  children in care. Aside from neglect, alcohol or other drug use is the  number one reason for removal from the home. In 2014, over 77,000  youths were removed from their homes due to drug abuse.   What is exciting is that we have strong empirical evidence that  working with parents experiencing substance abuse significantly helps  children and families; specifically, working with these families helps  children to experience fewer days in foster care, higher reunification  rates, less recurrence of child maltreatment, and better permanency  over time.   H.R. 2834 provides the opportunity to scale up these successes from  smaller, targeted interventions into full State interventions, while  building the research to better inform Federal policy overall.   My home State of Illinois has led the Nation in addressing substance  abuse issues in child welfare. We know that we need to do more to  address this problem, but we know what works and we know we can work  bipartisanly to support families in addressing substance abuse so that  we can increase permanency and safety.   When I ask foster youth what policymakers could do to make child  welfare better, they almost always say: ``You could have helped my mom  and dad.'' That is what we do today.   I urge passage of this important legislation.   I reserve the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California, (Ms. Bass).    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, over a decade of research shows the successes of helping  families involved in the child welfare system who struggle with  substance abuse. Through this research, we know that there are seven  common ingredients that help improve families' outcomes: a system of  identifying families, earlier access to assessment and treatment  services, increased management of recovery services and compliance,  increased judicial oversight, responses to participant behavior based  on proven contingency management approaches, collaborative approaches  across service systems and courts, and improved family-centered  services and repair of parent-child relationships.                                time  1730    Again, Mr. Speaker, it has been a pleasure for my staff and I to have  the opportunity to work with Mrs. Noem and her staff in preparing this  legislation.   And I might note that on Saturday of this past week, a group of us in  Illinois took two busloads of children to a special program run by the  Illinois Department of Corrections at the Sheridan Correctional Center  to see their fathers, who were all involved in a special program  established for individuals who were incarcerated for crimes dealing  with substance and who, themselves, were substance users. This  experience was so exciting in terms of these individuals finding help,  and their children being able to interact with them, even though they  were incarcerated.   So someone asked me what was I going to do for Father's Day, and I  told them after we returned that I have had my Father's Day experience.  If we can help these individuals to rid themselves of the tremendous  habits and difficulty that they have of substance use, then Father's  Day would be good enough.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. Noem),  and I yield back the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly support H.R. 2857, the Supporting Families in  Substance Abuse Treatment Act.   Substance abuse has had a devastating impact on families in the U.S.  Between 60 to 80 percent of substantiated child abuse and neglect cases  involve substance use by a custodial parent or guardian.   Early access to substance use treatment improves parental, family,  and child-focused outcomes. However, treatment access can come at the  cost of removing a child from their parents' care. This separation  disrupts opportunities for mothers and children to develop emotional  bonds, increasing the likelihood of childhood emotional and behavior  problems.   Although research shows that keeping children in a parent's care  while they seek treatment has benefits to the parent and the child,  access to parent-child treatment centers have been limited. To address  this concern, a significant number of programs in Illinois and  nationally have led the way in family substance abuse treatment.   One example in my congressional district is the Haymarket Center,  with a 16-bed pregnant and postpartum program that allows patients to  bring up to two children with them. Using evidence-based practices for  trauma, family reunification and children's development, the Haymarket  Center has demonstrated significant positive outcomes through an  independent evaluation.   For example, women experienced significant declines in substance use  at both 3- and 6-month follow-ups; improvements in mental and physical  health; less victimization, homelessness and criminal activity;  increased safe and healthy pregnancies, and improved birth outcomes.   In addition, the Haymarket Center has expanded its residential  treatment center services to include a responsible fatherhood program,  which they document as playing a crucial part in achieving strong  outcomes.   Another example is on what we in Chicago call the South Side of  Chicago and the West Side of Chicago and the North Side of Chicago and  the East Side of Chicago, but on the South Side of Chicago, the Harriet  Tubman Program, which is a 16-bed facility that can accommodate up to  10 children under the age of 5. Women who participate in these programs  remain in the program longer and have lower rates of recidivism.   There is also The Women's Treatment Center on the West Side. This  center has a pregnant and postpartum women's program for up to 12 women  and up to 12 children, as well as a residential rehab for up to 14  women and up to 23 children. All of these programs provide real  assistance to strengthen real families.   H.R. 2857 is common sense. These family-based treatment programs have  demonstrated success, lower relapse rates, decreased attachment trauma  for children, and they build families and health.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the passage of this  bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 4  minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu), who is a  sponsor of this legislation.     DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Bass).    DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   I want to commend Representative Noem and all of the cosponsors of  this important bill. These are programs that have been proven to work.  They are what are called evidence based, where the research  demonstrates that, with them, individuals have been able to improve the  quality of not only their lives, but certainly the lives of their  children and the lives of everyone with whom they come into contact.   I agree that today has been a tremendous day for the Ways and Means  Committee and also a tremendous day for the people of the United States  of America, where we have come together with five bills that will be  passed at the end of the day dealing with the needs, hopes, and  aspirations of our vulnerable population of children. You really can't  have a better day than that.   And so again, I commend Chairman Brady, Ranking Member Neal, and all  of the Members for their participation, engagement, and involvement.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
