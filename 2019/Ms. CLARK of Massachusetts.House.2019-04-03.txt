 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Mr. Chairman, every day, millions of  Americans use the internet to enrich their lives, engage with their  communities, and do their jobs.   While most online interactions are positive, the sad reality is that  for far too many Americans having an online presence means being  subjected to harassment, stalking, sextortion, and sexual abuse.   In recent years, the internet has become an easy way for abusers to  stalk victims of domestic violence and prey on vulnerable children.   These crimes aren't just one-off occurrences, they are not just  virtual. They can destroy lives.   One of my constituents received an onslaught of rape and death  threats so horrific and explicit that she and her husband fled their  home and eventually moved because they feared for their lives.   Unfortunately, when she reported these threats to law enforcement,  the officers she worked with did not have the training or the resources  necessary to fully investigate this crime and bring the perpetrators to  justice.   And this is just one story.   In fact, 20 percent, one in five, of all adult internet users have  been affected by cyberstalking, persistent harassing emails or other  unwanted online contact.   One increasingly common form of online abuse involves perpetrators  threatening to expose private or sensitive material, including nude  images, unless victims produce sexual materials or pay the abuser  money.   The Department of Justice recently declared that this type of abuse,  known as sextortion, ``. . . is by far the most significantly growing  threat to children,'' and that:         Sextortion cases tend to have more victims who are minors       per offense than all other child sexual exploitation       offenses.    According to a 2015 FBI analysis of 43 sextortion cases, at least two  victims committed suicide and at least ten more attempted.   From self-mutilation to suicide, the consequences of sextortion for  traumatized victims can be devastating.   If we are going to prevent these types of online crimes, we need to  make sure our law enforcement understands how to best combat them.   This amendment establishes a grant program to train local and State  law enforcement to prevent, enforce, and prosecute crimes carried out  online. It creates a national resource center to study these crimes and  requires the FBI to update the Uniform Crime Reports and National  Incident-Based Reporting System to include cybercrimes.   In an economy that is increasingly online, these crimes can  profoundly impact career choice and economic participation.   My amendment would make sure our criminal justice system is equipped  to respond to the crimes that happen online or offline.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to provide law enforcement with the  tools they need to combat these crimes by supporting my amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.
