 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, if this bill sounds familiar to Members, there is good  reason for that. Once again, the House of Representatives is debating a  bipartisan bill to secure Federal agency use of modern cloud computing  services.   However, this time we are doing it as H.R. 8956, the Federal Secure  Cloud Improvement and Jobs Act. Formerly named the FedRAMP  Authorization Act, this was the first bill the House passed this  Congress, as H.R. 21, on January 5, 2021.   We also passed the same legislation as part of this year's House  version of the National Defense Authorization Act.   This is such an important issue that we are here again to send an  improved bill back to the Senate for final passage.   Cybersecurity and technology modernization are both vital issues to  ensure this government runs efficiently, effectively, and safely. We  need this legislation to address the continued onslaught of  cyberattacks that have compromised both the private and public sectors'  critical information systems.   Cloud computing is an important innovation.   It allows users to tap into extra resources to meet spikes in demand,  like what agencies saw when trying to deliver COVID-relief assistance.   It also allows them to access modernized applications without the  need for them to also invest in their own data storage equipment.   While cloud computing is the norm in the private sector, we still  need to encourage agencies to adopt this technology when it makes  sense. We also must ensure cloud computing services are secure. That is  where the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program comes in.   FedRAMP, run by the General Services Administration, is the main  Federal program focused on helping agencies procure secure cloud  computing systems. It provides a consistent process to ensure agencies  know a given cloud service meets Federal cybersecurity standards. It  also provides clarity for vendors, so they understand the requirements  to ensure their products are secure enough for Federal agency use.   Shifting to the cloud is more cost effective, allows for better  citizen services and mission-based solutions, and provides more  responsive technology capabilities overall. These improved efficiencies  have led to significant cost savings.   At the end of fiscal year 2021, the GSA estimated that over the  FedRAMP program's 10-year lifespan, it had helped agencies avoid $716  million in individual security review costs. So while agencies are not  required to buy FedRAMP-approved services, it makes sense to encourage  them to do so.   After passing the earlier version, H.R. 21, the Senate also made  changes that improved the bill we are considering today.  [[Page H8140]]    Such updates include striking the unnecessary authorization of $20  million in appropriations and requiring better oversight of the  industry costs associated with becoming FedRAMP certified. This will  help ensure both small and large businesses can participate in the  program.   In addition, this version also seeks to identify and avoid  bottlenecks that slow approval. It also takes steps to secure the  software supply chain from threats by foreign bad actors, the likely  source of the 2020 SolarWinds attack that targeted numerous private  sector companies and Federal agencies.   Codifying this successful program into law is an important step  towards encouraging Federal agencies to take full advantage of this  program and all the security benefits it offers.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, protecting our public's valuable information is  something we can all agree on. I hope we can continue to do our job and  work together on improving the Federal Government cybersecurity and  adoption of modern technology.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to express sincere condolences to the family of  Mr. Suthammanont. I appreciate the underlying intent of this  legislation: To ensure the safety of Federal workers.   I also appreciate how this version of the bill has been improved from  the prior versions the House has considered.   Thankfully, there are no longer vaccine requirements for Federal  workers in the bill, and the bill is now future-looking, no longer tied  specifically to the COVID-19 pandemic.   Nevertheless, it makes sense to be prepared for any future public  health emergencies. While the safety of the Federal workers is  important, so is mission accomplishment and customer service.   In considering this new version, Committee on Oversight and Reform  Republicans ensured the plans this bill requires would be made through  the lens of continuity of operations. That is, continuing to provide  Americans the services they need, regardless of the situation.   I am pleased to see my colleagues, Representative Jody Hice's  amendment receive full support in the Committee on Oversight and Reform  last week and be incorporated into the bill we are considering today.   H.R. 8466 now ensures that the next time America faces a public  health emergency, Federal agencies will be required to balance their  workforce safety measures with plans to accomplish their missions while  minimizing impacts to customer service. Agencies will be required to  make these plans public for Inspector General review and congressional  scrutiny.   Americans who rely on Federal agency services, such as our veterans,  should never again be forgotten when their government sends its  workforce home.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Connolly for working with Mr. Hice to  improve the bill, and I encourage my colleagues to support the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, it is important that Federal agencies plan  and prepare for future infectious disease outbreaks and do so in a  transparent manner.   This bill is much improved and now also focuses on maintaining  Federal agency services to the American people through a potential  future public health emergency. Federal agencies exist to serve the  American people. This is true during national public health  emergencies, also.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the End Human Trafficking in Government Contracts Act  ensures that Federal agencies are not paying for or participating in  human trafficking or human sex trafficking through grants or contracts.  This is a particular concern for overseas contracts in which some  unscrupulous companies may take advantage of vulnerable third-country  workers.   Congress has acted before to address this problem. Unfortunately,  both the Government Accountability Office and the Department of Defense  Inspector General have found that trafficking by contractors and  grantees continues. This bill moves to send a clear message:  Trafficking will not be tolerated.   Under current law, agencies are already required to refer allegations  of human or sex trafficking to the Inspector General for investigation.  If found to be true, that agency has a number of options to deal with  the situation, but this bill requires all substantiated cases be  reported to the agency's suspension and debarment official.   In the contracting world, this is serious business. After due  process, a contractor could be prohibited from receiving future  government contracts or other government benefits. This bill ensures  all current or would-be grantees or contractors take all measures  necessary to stop human or sex trafficking.   Finally, the bill directs the Office of Management and Budget to  report on enforcement of the laws so we in Congress could conduct the  necessary oversight.   I thank Senators James Lankford and Joni Ernst for sending this  important bill to the House for final passage in Congress today.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and for the  President to sign S. 3470 into law.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, let me be clear. Not a single dime of  taxpayer money should ever flow to anyone engaged in human or sex  trafficking activities. This bill is an important step toward ensuring  responsible stewardship of taxpayer money.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.  [[Page H8144]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, artificial intelligence, or AI, is a term that applies  to a wide variety of technologies. AI plays a role in applications to  simplify our everyday lives by performing complex tasks.   Navigation apps, online banking apps, spam filters, and even asking  Siri or Alexa who won the Presidents Cup in North Carolina this weekend  all employ various types of AI technology. The Federal Government also  uses AI to improve government services and efficiency.   While there are multiple executive orders and initiatives promoting  the use of AI across the government, to date there has not been a  collective effort to train Federal workers who identify, buy, and  manage artificial intelligence capabilities.   The National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence,  established in the fiscal year 2019 NDAA, has called for the Federal  workforce to be better trained on artificial intelligence.  [[Page H8145]]    Mr. Speaker, when you consider the technology race against nations  like China, the stakes are very high. In fact, the commission noted in  its final report that the competition for government adoption of  artificial intelligence technologies will not be won by the side with  the best technology, it will be won by the side with the best, most  diverse, and tech-savvy talent.   The Artificial Intelligence Training for the Acquisition Workforce  Act establishes a government-wide training program for Federal workers  responsible for AI program management and acquisition. This training  will help ensure the consistent and safe procurement and use of AI  products across the Federal Government.   Those purchasing and using AI systems in Federal agency missions and  programs need to understand the limits of the technology's capabilities  and the risks posed by potential misuse. The American taxpayers deserve  nothing less.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Chairwoman Maloney working with me on the  House companion bill for this legislation. I am pleased to be an  original cosponsor. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker I have no further speakers.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, artificial intelligence is proving to be a  game-changing technology for nearly every sector of our economy. For  instance, artificial intelligence helps farmers efficiently grow crops,  scientists develop new materials, and weather forecasters predict  hurricanes more accurately.   In the Federal Government, the Social Security Administration uses AI  to determine benefit claims. Artificial Intelligence Training for the  Acquisition Workforce Act will be invaluable to the Federal approach to  artificial intelligence.   Mr. Speaker, I, once again, encourage my colleagues to support this  bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, Congress is charged with overseeing the general  management and operations of government agencies. For the success of  each Federal program, we must have a competent and skilled workforce to  deliver services to the American people, defend our Nation, and execute  the laws passed by Congress. However, agencies currently lack the tools  to identify and hire the best candidates to fill the broad types of job  positions supporting the Federal Government's various missions and  programs.   The problem is that hiring for the Federal civil service has over- relied on the paper credentials and self-administered job proficiency  assessments of candidates.   The Chance to Compete Act makes sure agencies use objective, skills- based assessments to evaluate job candidates. The private sector  already uses such structured interviews, knowledge tests, and writing  samples for the hiring process. It is time for the Federal Government  to do so, as well.   Agencies should be able to hire professionals that can do the work,  and there are many ways to build the right kind of professional  expertise.   H.R. 6967 represents one of those rare, bipartisan legislative  reforms that targets a specific problem, implements tested solutions,  and reflects private-sector best practices. The bill codifies and  improves upon policy initiatives begun in the Trump administration  which the Biden administration is continuing to implement.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the House Oversight and Reform Committee  Chairwoman Maloney and Government Operations Subcommittee Chairman  Gerry Connolly for working diligently with the bill's cosponsor,  Congressman Jody Hice, to strengthen this bipartisan bill.                                time  1530    Mr. Speaker, I thank Representatives Ro Khanna, Virginia Foxx, and  Kweisi Mfume for their support. We hope that our Senate colleagues can  rapidly advance this important legislation so it can be signed into law  this year, and I urge my colleagues to support this smart reform bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Hice), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Government Operations.    Mr. Speaker, this is a commonsense bill aimed at hiring  applicants for Federal positions based on whether they have the  relevant skills to do the job. The American people deserve nothing less  from their Federal Government.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
