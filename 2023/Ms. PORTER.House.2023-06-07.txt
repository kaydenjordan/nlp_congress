 Mr. Speaker, in 2018, a State law required licensed  childcare centers to test their water for lead every 5 years. Last  month, we got the results and they are grim for California's children.   One in four California childcare centers has dangerously high levels  of lead in their drinking water. Lead exposure seriously harms  children's health, damaging their brains and nervous systems.   Frighteningly, children exposed to elevated levels of lead are often  asymptomatic, but the damage is irreversible. Many of the worst  facilities for lead levels are in low-income areas or communities of  color.   Congress took a step in the right direction when we passed the  bipartisan infrastructure law, which invested $15 billion to remove and  replace lead service lines. But there is more work to be done.  [[Page H2773]]    Children are our future, and we owe it to every American to protect  all kids' safety and well-being.                    Honoring the Service of Randy Cammack     Mr. Speaker, I rise to celebrate labor champion and proud  Californian, Randy Cammack. This month, Randy will retire from his post  as president of Teamsters Joint Council 42, where he fought alongside  some 200,000 working members and retirees for 14 years.   Randy's time in organized labor began in 1967, when he started as a  delivery driver in Los Angeles, California. From there, he went on to  spend 42 years as a business agent, becoming a member of the Governor's  freight advisory committee and serving as a vice president of the State  labor federation.   Randy is also a proud U.S. Air Force veteran, and I join millions in  thanking him for his service to our country.   I am honored to celebrate Randy on the House floor today and extend  my deepest gratitude to him for his many years advocating for  California's workers.                   Innovation in Orange County, California     Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the innovation happening  in Orange County and across California.   Last year, I was proud to celebrate NASA's successful Artemis I  mission. Nearly a dozen businesses in my district played a direct role  in suppling the necessary components to make Artemis I possible. With  dozens of contributing businesses across Orange County, and over 500  companies employing 16,000 people statewide, California had more people  working on Artemis than any other State.   Orange County has a storied history in the aerospace industry. It has  been home to several of NASA's most critical partners for over 60  years, dating back to the Apollo missions.   I am proud that Orange County and California continue to advance  science, strengthen our economy, and push the limits of what is  possible.                   Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend Orange County  leaders for their recent decision to establish an Office of Immigrant  and Refugee Affairs. At our Board of Supervisors' April 25 meeting,  they unanimously approved the establishment of this new office, which  will provide resettlement resources in the form of housing assistance,  language programs, legal support, and other vital services.   As Orange County welcomes immigrants and refugee families, we need to  empower these new members of our community with what they need to  thrive. The Office of Immigrant and Refugee Affairs will fulfill this  mission by strengthening outreach and building on successful  partnerships with community organizations.   Honoring our diversity is a California value and an Orange County  value. I look forward to the development of the Office of Immigrant and  Refugee Affairs and to new families calling our community home.                            ____________________
