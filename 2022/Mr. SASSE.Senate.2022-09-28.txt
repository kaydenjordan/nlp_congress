 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the human spirit abhors tyranny.   Since February, the world has witnessed examples of extraordinary  courage. In Ukraine, we have watched ordinary men and women mount a  defense of their homes and their homeland against overwhelming odds-- people never having handled firearms before who are getting training,  getting arms, getting munitions, and joining together in the cause of  defending their homes and their homeland. We know what it has cost  them. Across the border, we have seen thousands and thousands of  ordinary Russians challenge the suicidal thuggery of Vladimir Putin. We  know what it has cost them too.   Today, I want to call our attention to the courage on display in a  different part of the world. I want to look to Iran.   Two weeks ago yesterday, on September 13, Iran's so-called morality  police arrested a young woman named Mahsa Amini. They detained her on  the grounds that she was wearing her hijab improperly. She was bundled  into a van, where eyewitnesses could hear the police beating her. A few  hours later, she was delivered to a local hospital, where she was  declared brain dead. The police shamelessly claimed that she had had a  spontaneous heart attack.   Thousands upon thousands of Iranians have poured into the streets  since. Protesters are calling for an end to the savagery that has made  absurd arrests and vicious beatings a regular part of the rhythm of  life in Tehran. They are demanding dignity for the millions and  millions of people who have lost it under Tehran's maniac theocracy.  This is no small thing, what they have done--the courage that is on  display as they pour into the streets. Protests have erupted now in  more than 80 cities and in all 31 of Iran's provinces. This is not a  minor demonstration.   The mullahs are facing one of the most significant challenges to  their rule since they seized it 43 years ago, in 1979. How has the  regime responded? As expected--with more brutality, with more  repression, and with more savagery. Human rights groups estimate that  76 people have been killed so far by the authorities.   Meanwhile, the crackdown has also included a shutting off of social  media and the internet. They hope that a country and a world that can't  see their thuggery won't notice it, will pretend it doesn't exist,  won't know. Well, they know, and we know. The Iranians know how this  regime operates. We know that these pathetic cowards have no regard for  human dignity.   Who are they?   These bloodthirsty men are the goons who hang homosexuals from  gallows, who protect child rapists, who deny women education. The  regime is rotten to the core. The people who are suffering under it  know, and we know. These men have told the world exactly who they are  again and again and again.   In 2009, Iranians erupted at the grotesque human rights abuses  perpetrated by then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. In an election  riddled with fraud, the world saw who he was again. During the Green  Revolution, thousands of protesters, including key opposition leaders,  were arrested and thrown in Iran's dungeon prisons. Many were tortured,  and several dozen were killed. A 26-year-old woman, a student, was shot  from a nearby rooftop by pro-government militia men. Her dying moments  were recorded by cell phone video and were broadcast around the world.   We know who they are.   Ten years later--3 years ago, in 2019--massive nationwide protests  erupted again. This time, it was following an announcement of massive,  unsustainable hikes on gas prices. The protests and the violence that  followed were the worst since 1979.   Hundreds of people took to the streets, and the government responded  with a campaign of systemic savagery,  [[Page S5124]]  hoping to drive people back into their homes in order to hide the truth  and to not admit to what this regime was and the ways that they failed.  Protesters were shot from rooftops and helicopters by the Iranian  Revolutionary Guard. Their troops opened fire on unarmed protesters who  were attempting to block roadways and entrances. In one southwestern  city, IRGC forces pursued several dozen, mostly young, unarmed  protesters into a march outside the city and then began massacring  them. Most reliable outside observers believe that about 1,500  protesters were killed.   In 2019, Tehran also conducted a near-total internet shutdown,  plunging the country's 83 million people into information darkness for  about 6 days. That practice, as we are seeing again right now, as we  see this month, has become one more regular instrument of terror. These  guys are scared of sunlight. They are scared of information. They are  scared of the truth.   We know that the despots in Iran who brutalize their own people also  export their terror tactics. Look at the last 2 months alone.   In July of last summer, 2021, a group of Iranian spies tried to  kidnap Masih Alinejad--an Iranian-American journalist and human rights  activist--at her home in New York. In July of this year, she was the  target of an assassination attempt again at her home in our country.   We learned in August that a member of the IRGC had plotted to  assassinate former National Security Advisor John Bolton on American  soil.   Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Iran Envoy Brian  Hook still require personal security details everywhere they go because  Iran has put targets on their backs in our country.   It was also just last month that, inspired by the Ayatollah  Khomeini's 1989 fatwa, an American man attacked and nearly killed  novelist Salman Rushdie during an appearance in New York.   Then, in August, Vladimir Putin received his first shipment of  Iranian drones--birds of a feather.   Inside its borders and beyond them, the regime in Tehran thinks  nothing but bloody thoughts. They think no one has dignity who doesn't  subscribe exactly to their theocratic views. It is long past time that  American policy and the policies of our friends and allies recognize  these blunt facts. We should tell the truth.   In 2009 and again in 2019, we had the opportunity to support and  encourage protesters who were agitating against a regime that is their  enemy and is ours, and in both cases, under administrations Democratic  and Republican, we failed the test.   Last week, President Biden told the U.N. General Assembly:         Today, we stand with the brave citizens and the brave women       of Iran, who right now are demonstrating to secure their       basic rights.    It is a good start, but it is far from sufficient. It is far from the  end.   Right now, America's policy toward Iran is hopelessly schizophrenic.  We cannot stand on the side of Iranian protesters at the same time that  we are trying to re-sign a nuclear deal with the same mullahs who would  release billions of dollars back into their hands, help them shore up  their power, and do nothing to prevent putting a catastrophic weapon  into their genocidal hands. President Obama chased a flawed nuclear  deal with Iran's terror state instead of more aggressively standing  with the Iranian people. Today, the same hodgepodge of national  security advisers is at it again.   Newly announced sanctions against the leaders of the Ministry of  Intelligence and Security, the Army Ground Forces, and the pro- government militias are good, but we cannot stand on the side of the  men and women of Iran who are in the streets at the same time we refuse  to sanction the leaders who matter most. Ayatollah Khomeini and the  circle of elites around him continue to escape serious consequence.   We shouldn't trick ourselves and should not delude ourselves into  thinking that economic sanctions are a magic wand or that the mullahs  themselves care very much about the economic pain that the people under  their regime are suffering. We should not think that the mullahs care  about elite opinion in Paris. We have to have a serious top-to-bottom  evaluation of our Iran strategy, and a coherent policy must begin by  telling the truth over and over and over again.    We cannot stand on the side of the people on the streets demanding  dignity at the same time that we welcome Iran's President--someone  personally responsible for show trials and mass executions and  assassination attempts on our soil, in our country. We can't allow him  to spout lies and propaganda on our same American soil as we did last  week at the U.N. General Assembly in New York.   Now is the time for a serious, coordinated policy that admits the  threat that Iran poses, not just to its people and its neighbors but  also to America, and to take seriously our commitment to the rights and  freedoms of all 7.8 billion people across this globe created in God's  image.   We can start by helping illuminate the government-imposed blackout so  that Iranians can see what their government and its blackshirts are  doing--more light, more information. We can expand and intensify the  sanctions regime that has pushed Iran to the brink in the past, before  we lost our nerve. We can amplify the voices of the Iranian protesters  and stop providing platforms to the regime's propagandists. We can make  sure that the voices of the Iranian people are heard by keeping the  internet on while Tehran works to put the country back into the black  box of despotism.   The courage of men and women on the streets of Iran today has not  gone unnoticed. They have imagined the possibility of an Iranian future  no longer under the thumb of Tehran's bloodthirsty dictators. We should  be able to imagine that future too and to do more to make that a  reality.   The Iranian people hate Tehran's blood-soaked tyrants. This is not a  regime that has the consent of the governed. The American people are on  freedom's side. The administration should drop the fantasy of another  nuclear deal, walk away from the table, and turn the screws on these  monsters by, first, telling the truth again and again.   We ought to do everything we can to celebrate the heroism of the  Iranians in the streets and to expose Tehran's human rights abuses  around the watching world. And the best way to do that is by making  sure that the internet stays on in Iran--more light, more truth, more  information.
