 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  hundreds of thousands of victims of Hurricane Harvey in Houston and  Harris County and throughout Texas and call on Congress to immediately  pass emergency funding to help victims with this unprecedented  disaster.   Our district in east side, north side, and southeast side Houston,  Harris County, is familiar with hurricanes and tropical storms. We were  hit hard by Allison in 2001, again by Hurricane Ike in 2008.   Harvey's destruction is beyond anything witnessed in living memory in  Texas, flooding over 100,000 homes in Harris County alone, killing at  least 60 people, 12 innocent victims in our own district.   Countless lives in Houston and along the Gulf Coast have been on  hold: families who cannot return to their flooded homes, children whose  schools are damaged, mothers and fathers who can't get back to work.   I urge my colleagues to vote for this critical emergency funding bill  today that will help the people of Houston and Harris County and Texas  on the road to recovery.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our ranking  member not only for yielding to me, but also for her call a couple of  weeks ago.   And I want to thank our colleague from Lubbock, Texas. We have a lot  of water we can send to west Texas, but appreciate the support not just  from Texas, but all across the country. People are coming in  everywhere.   And I see me colleague, Brian Babin, who is my neighbor. We are not  Democrats and Republicans; we are Americans. And that is what we are  seeing. And our Speaker pro tempore of the House, also, is neighbor to  both of us.   But I rise in support of the hundreds of thousands of victims of  Hurricane Harvey in Houston and Harris County and throughout Texas, and  I call on Congress to immediately pass emergency funding to help  victims from this unprecedented disaster.   Our district is in northeast and southeast Houston and Harris County.  We are familiar with hurricanes and tropical storms. We were hit by  Tropical Storm Allison in 2001, hit by Hurricane Ike in 2008.   Harvey's disaster and destruction is beyond anything witnessed in  living memory in Texas, flooding over 100,000 homes in Harris County  alone and killing at least 60 people, including 12 innocent victims in  our district.   Countless lives in Houston and along the Gulf Coast have been put on  hold: families who cannot return to their flooded homes, children whose  schools were damaged, mothers and fathers who cannot go back to work.   I have a school district in northeast Harris County, Sheldon ISD.  They have eight schools. Four of those schools are so damaged they  can't be reopened.   Houstonians and Texans are proud and independent people. We take  pride in our can-do attitude, as witnessed by our brave first  responders and countless volunteers who rescued neighbors during the  worst of the flooding.   I urge all my colleagues to vote for this critical emergency funding  that will help the people of Houston and Texas on the road to recovery.  But this is not the only time we will need this emergency funding.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article in Monday's Houston  Chronicle on the dedication of our doctors and public health workers at  the Texas Medical Center in Houston during the worst of Harvey.                        [From the Houston Chronicle]             My 60-Hour Shift in the ER During Hurricane Harvey                             (By Benjamin Gold)         I was on call at St. Luke's when the major flooding began.       I decided to stay in the hospital, along with many other       residents, attendings, nurses and support staff.        It turns out that a hospital is a fantastic place to be in       a crisis--it has food, water, electricity, even Wi-Fi. I       ended up staying there until Monday, taking shifts with other       residents as we watched over our patients. We even saw some       new ones who somehow managed to make their way through       floodwaters to the emergency room.        Here are some of the things I saw during those 60 hours.        I saw nurses working for almost 20 hours straight and       managing way more patients than usual, refusing to leave       them--they didn't know when the next nurses would arrive.        I saw the cafeteria transformed into a support station with       round-the-clock free meals. The lunch tables transformed into       war rooms as the various medical departments strategized       about how to staff the hospital despite being desperately       under capacity. I got meals from the same cafeteria worker--      Anne--on Friday night, Saturday morning, Saturday evening,       Sunday morning, Sunday evening and Monday morning.        I saw patients placed in impossible circumstances. One, a       young man with a son in the ICU at Texas Children's, recently       heard that his house had flooded. He was having high fevers       and coughing up yellow sputum. His chest X-ray showed he had       developed a lobar pneumonia. He was pale and clammy, with       bloodshot eyes.        ``Doc, I need go,'' he told me. ``I have to see my son. I       have to call my wife and make sure she's safe. I can't stay       here.''        I was in the ICU when an impromptu meeting was held to       discuss the fact that no relief would be able to come in for       the foreseeable future. There were only two attendings, each       taking 12-hour shifts so the other could sleep. They'd       already been working for 48 hours.        Midway through one of the shifts, one of the sleeping ICU       doctors woke up and asked the active doctor if he was OK.        ``I'm cruising,'' he said, smiling. He was bleary-eyed and       weary, but it didn't matter. ``I'm rolling,'' he said and       gave a thumbs-up.        ``I'm good to go.''        My fiancee, who also is a doctor, told me that one of her       patients wanted to meet me after they found out that their       doctor had a significant other in the hospital.        ``Sure,'' I said, and went over to the room. They were so       appreciative of her care that they invited us to go fishing       with them in Corpus Christi when this was all over. ``I'm       telling you, you've never seen a more beautiful place to fish       your entire life. You'll stay with us, of course! It won't       cost you a penny.''        The man took out his iPhone and showed us pictures of a       gorgeous coastline, Texas-sized sunsets and smiling nephews       proudly holding up fish as big as they were. ``We'll make it       down there,'' he said. ``We'll get through this.''        Finally, on Monday morning, the first wave of relief       arrived, and those whose houses hadn't flooded and had clear       streets were able to go home. Others weren't so lucky.        The Texas Medical Center is what brought me to Houston. It       has more medical schools, hospitals and nursing facilities       per square foot than any other place on earth. It was       incredible to see the resiliency, camaraderie and       selflessness of those who work there in a crisis. Learning       about what to do in a crisis is standard in medical       education. But to see it in action, to see people refusing to       leave until they knew their patients would be cared for, is       something else entirely.        It's been a grim few days, and the worst is not over. We       don't know how many more casualties there might be. Untold       billions in property damage has already been done. But       Houstonians showed their true colors over this past weekend.       I've never been prouder to be a Texan.  [[Page H6663]]         Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to  bring up H.R. 3440, the DREAM Act, to protect DREAMers like Jesus  Contreras, who as a DACAmented paramedic worked 6 days straight after  Hurricane Harvey. Jesus rescued people from flood waters and  transported them to local hospitals. Jesus deserves our support.    Mr. Chair, the Drug Quality and Security Act  was passed in 2013 in response to the multistate fungal meningitis  outbreak that occurred due to contaminated compounded drug products  from the New England Compounding Center.   Drugs from a single facility in one state were shipped nationwide,  over 750 patients were affected, and 64 patients died in 20 states  across the country.   DQSA (D-Q-S-A) helps ensure that if compounders are shipping drugs  nationwide, they are doing so from states that exercise meaningful  oversight. This is an important patient safety protection in the law.   This amendment would weaken FDA's ability to implement this important  patient protection legislation by denying FDA funding to finalize the  Memorandum of Understanding Congress mandated FDA develop.   Congress must not forget the tragedy that happened just 5 years ago  by turning back the clock and remove the protections Congress itself  put in place to prevent another outbreak.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment offered by Rep. Carter.                                time  1930
