 Madam President, I just really want to thank Senator  Udall for his commitment to public service. When I think of a person of  his talent, his expertise, and his effectiveness, he has devoted his  entire life to public service to make New Mexico better, to make  America better, and for global justice. I just really want to thank him  for his many years of public service. I know that he has not finished  his commitment to try to help our community, but we are going to miss  him on the floor of the U.S. Senate.   I had a chance to work with Senator Udall when he and I were in the  House of Representatives, and we worked on so many issues--from the  environment to justice issues, to integrity in the process to make sure  our system of justice, our system of law, and our system of legislating  meet the high expectations of our democracy. We know that we can do  better to form a more perfect union. We are on that path, and we can do  better. And thanks to Senator Udall, we have done better, but we still  have a road ahead of us.   So, you are an inspiration to all of us. We want you to know that. We  love you. We greatly admire your service to this body and to our  community. As has been said by others, we are not only going to miss  your relationship on working with issues here; we are going to miss the  friendship and seeing you on a more regular basis.   We know that your life partner Jill has been a steady supporter of  what you have done. So on behalf of your colleagues in the U.S. Senate,  we say thank you for a job well done. We are proud to have called you  our friend and associate, and we will continue to work with you.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I take this time, along with my  colleague from Maryland, Senator Chris Van Hollen--and I am also  pleased that we are joined by Senator Stabenow and Senator Reed. We  take this time, on a very sad note, to announce the death of Paul  Spyros Sarbanes, our former colleague in the U.S. Senate, who passed  away on December 6, 2020, at the age of 87.   I first got to know Senator Sarbanes when he first ran for public  office in 1966. We both were elected to the Maryland General Assembly  that year, and we became good friends. Delegate Sarbanes at that point  made a name for himself on the House Judiciary Committee in the  Maryland General Assembly and was a rising star from his first day in  the Maryland General Assembly.   He shortly thereafter ran for the House of Representatives. He served  three terms in the House of Representatives with a very distinguished  career. During that time, it was the time of the Watergate issues, and  Congressman Sarbanes was on the Judiciary Committee and was given the  responsibility of the first Article of Impeachment against President  Nixon. That article dealt with obstruction of justice. It was the key  engagement against President Nixon on impeachment, and it is very  telling that that responsibility was given to a young Member of the  House of Representatives, Congressman Paul Sarbanes. It was because of  his work ethic, his commitment to scholarship, and his understanding of  issues that he was entrusted with that responsibility.   He then served five terms in the U.S. Senate, the longest term for  any Senator in Maryland. Paul Sarbanes was known as a Senator's Senator  for his integrity, for his public commitment to public service, and his  strong commitment to principles. He was a Rhodes scholar who chose to  serve the public rather than using his skills in the private sector for  his own personal gain. His entire life was devoted to public service.  What a legacy he has left us by his incredible public service.    In 2002, the Enron scandal hit America, and Chairman Sarbanes, the  chairman of the Banking Committee here, teamed up with Chairman Oxley  in the House to pass the Sarbanes-Oxley legislation. George W. Bush-- President Bush--said it was ``the most far-reaching reforms of American  business practices since the time of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.'' The  leadership of Senator Sarbanes was deeply needed at that time, and he  delivered on behalf of the American people.   Senator Van Hollen and I know firsthand what Senator Sarbanes did in  helping to create the Federal partnership in the Chesapeake Bay  Program. It was during the time that he was the junior Senator from  Maryland, along with Senator Mathias, that the two of them partnered in  order to develop the Federal program for the Chesapeake Bay, and then  Senator Sarbanes carried the burden of that partnership. For many  years, it was through his efforts in the U.S. Senate that we were able  to continue and expand the Federal partnership for the bay.   Now, those of us who live in the bay region--and I know that Senator  Stabenow has heard me talk about this many times when we talk about the  great water bodies. We know that the Chesapeake is the largest estuary  in our hemisphere. It is the most diverse estuary, and it is a  challenge because of the way that the water flows and it cleanses  itself. So we started this Federal partnership--Senator Sarbanes did-- and it has provided incredible dividends for the people of Maryland and  the people of our Nation--indeed, the global community.   He was an expert on foreign policy. He served on the Senate Foreign  Relations Committee. He was involved in the leadership of passing  ratification of the Panama Canal Treaty, and there are so many other  areas in which Senator Sarbanes excelled.   We all receive honors; I know that. I am just going to mention three  because they were really reflective of what Senator Sarbanes  accomplished during his career. He got the Paul H. Douglas Ethics in  Government Award for his incredible standard of integrity and ethics;  the Roth Award for extraordinary impact on policy, on economic  business, and finance--his lasting legacy on the financial institutions  here in America; and the Cox, Richardson, Coleman Award for  distinguished public service. He was a Senator's Senator. He devoted  his life to public service.   In a way, Paul Sarbanes represents the American success story. He was  a son of Greek immigrants, grew up on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in  Salisbury, and rose to serve in the U.S. Senate.   His lifetime partner was Christine. All of us remember Paul and  Christine together. What a couple they made. What a love story it was.   There are three children. John, whom we all know very well because he  serves in the House of Representatives, holds the seat in the Third  Congressional District. It is the same seat that Barbara Mikulski held,  the same seat that I held; the same seat that Paul Sarbanes held is now  being held by Paul's son John, and what a great job he is doing. It is  interesting that he was the leading sponsor of H.R. 1 in this Congress,  which was basically the good governance legislation that passed  overwhelmingly in the House, and so many other things that follow in  his father's tradition.   Paul's other son Michael has had a distinguished career, and Janet,  his daughter, has also had a distinguished career.   Paul had seven grandchildren. Christine predeceased Paul.   I want to just talk a moment about the partnership between Senator  Sarbanes and Senator Mikulski. They had different styles. I think most  people would acknowledge that from the beginning, Paul was very much  stately and represented the traditional, I guess, demeanor that you  would expect of a U.S. Senator. And I love Barbara Mikulski, but no one  would ever accuse her of having that type of demeanor. But the two of  them had an incredible relationship together. They were called the  ``Diner Democrats'' because Paul's father's family ran a diner, and  Barbara Mikulski's family ran Mikulski's Bakery, as we all know. They  worked together in true partnership over so many years. It was a  friendship that was really one of total trust and respect.   I had a chance to communicate with Senator Mikulski, and she, because  of COVID, could not join us tonight.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that her statement be  printed in the Record of these proceedings  [[Page S7271]]    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:       Mikulski Statement on the Passing of Senator Paul S. Sarbanes         Baltimore.--Retired U.S. Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD)       today issues the following statement remembering Senator Paul       Sarbanes:        ``We join Maryland and all of America in mourning the loss       of Senator Paul Sarbanes. We extend our condolences and       sympathies to his family and loved ones during this time.        America has lost a great statesman, the state of Maryland       has lost a champion, and I, along with so many others, have       lost a friend.        The Maryland Delegation calls itself Team Maryland, and we       became a team because of Senator Sarbanes's work in reaching       hands across the aisle to Senator Mac Mathias. Senator       Sarbanes knew that each of us could make a difference but       working together was how we would make change. His legacy of       bringing Marylanders together to make change lives on in the       Delegation today.        Senator Sarbanes never forgot his family's strong immigrant       roots or their belief in the American Dream. He knew the       transformational power of education and championed an       opportunity ladder and increased access to higher education.       An unabashed believer in America's promise, he became a voice       for civil rights and voting rights. And in his advocacy on       housing, he worked to eliminate barriers of discrimination.       He championed the stabilization of the Social Security and       Medicare trust funds and worked tirelessly to protect and       preserve the Chesapeake Bay for tomorrow while advocating for       jobs on the Port of Baltimore today.        Senator Sarbanes believed that discussion and debate should       always be based on civility, intellectual rigor, and respect       for others. He was a workhorse, not a show horse, who cared       more about the getting job done and getting it done right,       than in taking credit.        We served together in Congress for 30 years, 20 of them       together in the Senate. And just as he was Maryland's       champion, he was my champion, too. As well as my ally and       friend. We joked that we were ``diner democrats,'' not       ``dynasty democrats.'' He was the son of a diner owner, and I       was the daughter of a grocer. We were both raised to ask how       we could help those around us every day. Senator Sarbanes       took that lesson to heart; it was his commitment to helping       not only the people of Maryland, but every American that       drove him. And each of us is better off for having been       helped by him.        He was always there when you needed him. He will be       missed.''     Madam President, let me conclude by just quoting from  Senator Sarbanes himself on the final speech that he gave when he left  the Senate. He said:         Throughout my years in public service, I have worked to the       limits of my ability to provide the people of Maryland and       the Nation dedicated, informed, and independent       representation based on the fundamental principles of       integrity and intelligence. I have been guided in this effort       by the vision of a decent and just America, based on a strong       sense of community and offering fairness and opportunity to       all its people.        Service in this body has reinforced, many times over, my       understanding and commitment to the institutions upon which       our system of Democratic governance critically depends.        So long as [that] vision of America's promise continues to       shine brightly in this body, I have every confidence that our       Nation will prevail in the face of great challenges and that       its future will be assured.    It is our responsibility to heed those words of Senator Sarbanes and  strive to carry out his legacy.   Before I yield to Senator Van Hollen, the two of us, on behalf of all  of the Members of the U.S. Senate, have filed a resolution to honor  Paul Sarbanes. This has been cleared.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration  of S. Res. 797, submitted earlier today.    I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to;  that the preamble be agreed to; and that the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Madam President, I now yield the floor in anticipation  that my colleague from Maryland--the two of us have joined together to  pay tribute to Senator Sarbanes--be recognized.    Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Van Hollen and  myself, I want to thank our colleagues for their tribute to Senator  Paul Sarbanes--Senator Stabenow and Senator Reed. I know that Senator  Schumer and Senator Durbin have spoken on the floor. Many of us have  and many have expressed their condolences through our office to the  family. We just want to express our appreciation.   As Senator Van Hollen said, I had the honor--or the challenge--to  follow Senator Sarbanes in this body. I have his seat in the Senate.  When I was sworn in almost 14 years ago, Senator Sarbanes escorted me  to take the oath of office. As I mentioned earlier, he is an  inspiration to all of us.   I want to thank our colleagues for the tribute they have paid to an  outstanding Marylander, an outstanding American, and he will be missed  by all   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
