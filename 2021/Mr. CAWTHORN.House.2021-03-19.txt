 Madam Speaker, there is nothing an American will not do  to defend his country. I rise today in defense of my homeland. I am  angry, not just for the destruction of American values perpetrated by  those on the left, but I am angry because my colleagues simply do not  seem to care.   They do not care that our border is non-existent, that 6,000  criminals cross into our country daily. They do not care that 64  percent of the Federal arrests are of illegal immigrants. They do not  care that America's welfare and infrastructure system simply cannot  handle this influx of criminal immigrants. They do not care because, to  them, power is all that matters.   I have a message to the power-hungry and the partisan. Power  corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.   It is in the nature of Americans to be kind. It is in our nature to  be gentle and loving. But know this, when it comes to the matter of  protecting our  [[Page H1605]]  friends, our family, and our heartland, do not trifle with this  representative democracy. For we the people will not stop, we will  never back down. We will give our everything to protect those dear to  us. This is our country. This is our Republic. Finish the wall.                            ____________________
