 Madam Speaker, we learned from civil rights giant  Congressman John Lewis that we have a moral obligation, a mission, and  a mandate to speak up, to speak out, and do it in good trouble.   In honor of your legacy, Congressman Lewis, I will continue the path  of good trouble by demanding that water is a human right, by banning  racist facial recognition technology, repealing the opportunity zones  and spend that money on helping end poverty in Black communities. I  will continue to fight to pass your Voting Rights Act.   You reminded us every single day in this Chamber that waiting isn't  always the right option. Too many of our residents don't have time to  wait any longer. The oppression is killing them.   It is an honor to have served with you, Congressman. I will never  forget walking across the Pettus Bridge with you and my young son.   Peace and love.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today as a proud Member of this  body, as a woman of color, and as a sister in service to my colleague,  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who was verbally assaulted by a  Member of this same Chamber.   Gaslighting my colleague in our country won't work here. I rise to  tell my sister in service: I believe you. I believe you not just  because reporters happened to be standing there to hear the sexist  attack, but because I believe women across our country when they tell  us of the violence they experience at the workplace.   Violence against women in politics specifically is a global problem.  I know. I would invite any of my colleagues across the aisle to answer  the calls into my office for just 1 day to hear the vile sexist remarks  made about me and other women serving in this Chamber.   When my colleague from Florida made the remark in question, he echoed  and perpetuated those sexist and violent calls.   Madam Speaker, we must condemn in the strongest terms possible this  kind of violent sexism so that women and girls across the country know  that there is no room for it in any workplace, not in Congress, not  anywhere.    Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of my amendment,  which increases funds for lead drinking water pipe replacement by $500  million, to a total of $1 billion.    This amendment is an investment to remove the 6 to 10 million lead  service lines that contaminate our tap water across our Nation, and the  over 600,000 lines alone in Michigan.   Contaminated water is a fact of life for Michigan's 13th  Congressional District. Too many of our families and communities are  suffering, and it is time we step up our investments to guarantee  environmental justice for all.   I thank Chairwoman McCollum for working with me on this amendment to  secure historic funding to replace lead pipes. And I also thank my  colleagues, Representatives Kildee and Slotkin for their partnership on  this.
