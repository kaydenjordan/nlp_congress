 Madam Speaker, on Monday, the Trump administration  released what has to be the cruelest and most irresponsible proposed  budget in our Nation's 243-year history.   The Trump budget adds trillions of dollars to our national debt. The  Trump budget cuts $1.5 trillion from Medicaid, $845 billion from  Medicare, and $26 billion from Social Security. Meanwhile, it cuts over  90 percent of the funding for freshwater in the Great Lakes Restoration  Initiative.   We are not going to be able to combat deadly algal blooms in Lake  Erie. We are not going to be able to contain invasive species like the  Asian carp. We are not going to be able to restore the Great Lakes and  its environmental integrity.   The President promised he would never cut Social Security, Medicare,  or Medicaid, yet he has done exactly that. His proposed budget adds  trillions to the national debt while also undermining the financial  pillars of Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid.   Madam Speaker, budgets are a reflection of our values, and President  Trump's values are clearly with the 1 percent. He is out of step with  the majority of the American people and, surely, those living in  northern Ohio.                            ____________________
