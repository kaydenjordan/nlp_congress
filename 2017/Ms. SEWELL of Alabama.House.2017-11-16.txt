 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my  colleagues to reject this misguided and mean-spirited tax bill that is  being rushed through this Congress today.   Mr. Speaker, this Republican sham tax bill picks winners and losers.  The winners under this tax bill are corporations, Wall Street fat cats,  the top 1 percent of the highest wage earners in America, and the  special interests. The losers are the middle class, working families,  students, the most vulnerable in our society, and our farmers.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from the National  Farmers Union, which objects to this bill.                                         National Farmers Union,                                                  November 14, 2017.   Congressional Tax Plans Jeopardize the Farm Safety Net, CBO Analysis                                    Says       For Immediate Release.                                            Contact: Andrew Jerome.        Washington.--Amidst the steepest drop in farm profitability       in a generation, U.S. Congressional leadership is proposing       tax reform legislation that would jeopardize all funding for       farm bill commodity safety net programs.        The two tax bills being considered in both the U.S. Senate       and the U.S. House of Representatives would add $1.5 trillion       to the federal deficit. According to new Congressional Budget       Office analysis of the bills, that $1.5 trillion deficit       increase would need to be offset by eliminating all funding       for vital farm programs such as Agriculture Risk Coverage       (ARC) and Price Loss Coverage (PLC), among other mandatory       federal spending programs.        ``If Congress passes legislation that increases the       deficit, they will subsequently be forced to cut federal       spending. In the case of the tax bill, current law could       require 100 percent sequestration of all commodity program       payments and other farm bill programs,'' said National       Farmers Union President Roger Johnson ``Tax cuts for the       highest income brackets should absolutely not come at the       expense of programs that protect our nation's family farmers       and ranchers.''        The House and Senate budget resolution that was passed       earlier this year paves the way for tax cuts that would       increase the U.S. federal deficit by $1.5 trillion over ten       years Statutory pay-as-you-go (PAYGO) rules require that       increases in deficit spending be offset by reduced spending       across non-exempt mandatory programs The government would be       required to cut such programs by $150 billion per year in       accordance with PAYGO.        The total available pool of funding across all non-exempt       mandatory programs amounts to, in CBO's estimation, ``only       between $85 billion to $90 billion,'' meaning that all       impacted mandatory spending programs other than Medicare,       including the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), would be       entirely stripped of funding.        The CCC is the second largest non-exempt mandatory program,       after Medicare It funds dairy and other farm program       payments, including ARC and PLC, both of which are critical       for keeping family farmers and ranchers in business during       times of economic uncertainty. Discretionary spending and a       number of mandatory programs, including Social Security, the       Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), federal       crop insurance, and the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP),       are exempt from PAYGO. ``Farmers Union has long opposed using       budget sequestration to reduce the federal deficit,       especially through cuts to agricultural programs,'' added       Johnson. ``This proposal asks farmers and ranchers to trade       any possible tax benefits for the elimination of farm safety       net payments, like ARC and PLC. That would be a disastrous       trade. NFU continues to advocate for a simplified,       progressive tax code that does not risk programs vital to the       livelihoods and well-being of American family farmers and       ranchers.''     These are the very same people that this  President promised to benefit.   This is what this bill does for corporate America:   It dramatically cuts rates from the largest companies in the world,  moving the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent.   It creates loopholes for wealthy individuals to recharacterize their  wage income as small business income so that they can pay less in  taxes.   It repeals the alternative minimum tax, which captures the tax  liabilities for wealthy individuals. In fact, the only tax return that  we have ever seen of Mr. Trump was his 2005 tax return in which he had  to pay $38 million. Why? Because of AMT.   And this tax bill will also permanently repeal the estate tax, which  only affects 5,500 households in America. And I can tell you, Mr.  Speaker, none of those households are in my district.   In contrast, how will this tax bill impact the middle class? Mr.  Speaker, 36 million middle class households will pay more taxes. One in  four taxpayers will pay more taxes.   To pay for the corporate tax cuts, this bill will hurt working  families. It will eliminate deductions on interest on student loans. It  will eliminate medical expense deductions, which many, many households  use to pay for long-term care needs. It will eliminate  [[Page H9396]]  the lifetime learning credit. And it will also do away with deductions  for families that pay for daycare and aging parents.   Mr. Speaker, this is not comprehensive tax reform. The American  people deserve better, and we as a Congress can do better.   Please reject this bill.
