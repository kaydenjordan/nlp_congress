 Madam President, now more than ever, we must find  bipartisan solutions wherever possible to stimulate our economy, get  Americans back to work, and ensure we maintain our position on the  world stage as the leader in scientific and technological innovation.   This amendment would preserve funding related to U.S. competitiveness  and innovation by retaining the full expensing for research and  development and expanding tax incentives for small businesses.  Immediate R&D expensing incentivizes long-term investments in  innovation and technological breakthroughs.   By passing this amendment, we can make sure that the United States  continues to be the world leader in this space.   I understand we are prepared to pass this by voice vote.    Madam President, I call up Young amendment No. 3444 and  ask that it be reported by number.    Madam President, over 60 times during their campaign and  since taking office, President Biden and Vice President Harris have  pledged not to raise one single penny in taxes--not one single penny-- on anyone making less than $400,000 a year.   Today, my Democratic colleagues are using this budget to try to pull  a fast one on the American taxpayers by giving lip service to this  pledge while proposing tax hikes that will largely be borne by middle-  and working-class Americans. For example, it is well-understood that a  significant portion of corporate tax hikes are borne by American  workers in the form of fewer job opportunities and reduced wage growth.   Now, while my colleagues included a nominal mention of the tax pledge  in the underlying budget, importantly, the budget's reserve fund for  the upcoming $3\1/2\ trillion reckless tax-and-spend bill is not  conditioned on that pledge. So this amendment will prevent Congress  from breaking the Biden-Harris tax promise to pay for reconciliation.   As President Biden said:         Not one penny. It's a guarantee.    I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
