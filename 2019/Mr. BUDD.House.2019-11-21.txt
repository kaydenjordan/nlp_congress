 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 78th  anniversary of National Bible Week.   In this very Bible, the Apostle Paul tells us in 2 Timothy, Chapter  4:         For the time is coming when people will not endure sound       teaching, but have itching ears, they will accumulate       themselves teachers to suit their own passions and will turn       away from listening to the truth and will wander off into       myths.    Even as I look behind me at the words ``In God We Trust,'' I wonder  if we as a nation are succumbing to what the Apostle Paul warned about  2,000 years ago.   There is a solution to this problem, and it is found in the very same  chapter. Paul writes:         Preach the Word, be ready in season and out of season;       reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and       teaching.    He writes in the prior chapter, 2 Timothy, Chapter 3, that all  Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for  reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, and that a  person of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.   So we see the people of His creation are intended for purposeful good  works, and we are guided into that purpose by God through the very  Scriptures that we celebrate this week.                            ____________________
