 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor an east  Tennessee icon, Ed Westcott.   Those who knew Ed would tell you that his ability to capture a story  through images was evident at an early age. At just 20 years old, Ed  became the 29th individual hired by the Clinton Engineer Works to begin  to capture images at Oak Ridge. Ed was the sole photographer of the  Manhattan Project--the Manhattan Project, now well known, then a  secret.   His images lifted the veil off the secret city and gave Americans a  glimpse into the lives of those who helped our Nation win World War II.   From the alpha racetrack at Y-12 to the images of daily life, we had  Ed to thank for over 15,000 photographs. His work is proudly displayed  in east Tennessee and in Washington at the National Archives.   To honor his contributions, I joined with my colleagues in the Senate  to nominate him for the Presidential Medal of Freedom.   On March 29, Ed Westcott passed away, but his legacy will live on  through his images.                            ____________________
