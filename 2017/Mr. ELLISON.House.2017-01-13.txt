 Mr. Speaker, we are voting on a Budget Resolution later  today that makes it possible to take away health coverage from tens of  millions of people.   But the Democrats know that this is just the beginning.   Congressional Republicans have started their plans to not just repeal  the Affordable Care Act, but to gut Medicare, Medicaid and Social  Security.   Republican proposals would threaten nursing home coverage for  millions of seniors, undermine comprehensive health care for children  by cutting Medicaid, and slash benefits earned after years of hard  work.   The CPC and Congressional Democrats will not stand for this. That is  why we introduced an amendment that would ensure the Budget Resolution  we are voting on today or any future bill can't be used to cut benefits  from Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid, increase the retirement age  for these benefits, or privatize Social Security.   But, the majority is not allowing debate or a vote on our amendment.   This sends a clear message: Congressional Republicans are willing to  put the lives and futures of millions of children, seniors and working  families at risk.   It also puts them on the wrong side of history. Cutting Medicare,  Medicaid and Social Security is not what the American people want.   President-elect Trump has promised several times that he will not  support cuts to these important programs that help millions of  Americans make ends meet.   This leaves Congressional Republicans in a tough spot. Whose side are  they on?   Will they commit to protecting hard-working Americans? Will they  protect America's children? Seniors? What about people with  disabilities?   Or, will they yet again cut the benefits of working people so they  can give tax breaks to big corporations?   The Congressional Progressive Caucus and House Democrats will not  back down. We will oppose any cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social  Security.   I urge my colleagues to vote no and defeat the previous question so  we can bring up the CPC amendment to block the House GOP from cutting  Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.   Will House Republicans stand with us?   Today, 55 million older people and people with disabilities have  health care because of Medicare.   82 percent of Americans--including 74 percent of Republicans, 88  percent of Democrats and 83 percent of independents--agree it is  critical to preserve Social Security for future generations even if it  means increasing Social Security taxes paid by working Americans.   In 2015, 11 million Americans became newly eligible for Medicaid  thanks to Medicaid expansion.   If Republicans repeal the ACA, at least 11 million people's Medicaid  coverage will be at risk.   The House Republican budget plan far fiscal year 2017 would have cut  federal Medicaid funding by $1 trillion--or nearly 25 percent--over ten  years. That is in addition to ending Medicaid expansion.   The Urban Institute estimated that the 2012 Ryan proposal would lead  states to drop between 14.3 million and 20.5 million people from  Medicaid by the tenth year, in addition to the effects of repealing  health reform's Medicaid expansion.   The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:             An Amendment to H. Res. 48 Offered by Mr. McGovern         At the end of the resolution, add the following new       sections:        Sec. 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of this       resolution, following general debate on Senate Concurrent       Resolution 3 and prior to consideration of the amendment       printed in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying       this resolution, the amendment specified in section 4 shall       be in order if offered by Representative Pocan of Wisconsin       or a designee. Such amendment shall be considered as read,       shall be debatable for 10 minutes equally divided and       controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be       subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand       for division of the question in the House or in the Committee       of the Whole. All points of order against such amendment are       waived.        Sec. 4. The amendment referred to in section 3 is as       follows:        At the end of the concurrent resolution, add the following:       SEC. __. POINT OF ORDER AGAINST LEGISLATION THAT WOULD BREAK                     DONALD TRUMP'S PROMISE NOT TO CUT SOCIAL                     SECURITY, MEDICARE, OR MEDICAID.         (a) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the House       of Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill, joint       resolution, motion, amendment, amendment between the Houses,       or conference report that would--        (1) result in a reduction of guaranteed benefits scheduled       under title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et       seq.);        (2) increase either the early or full retirement age for       the benefits described in paragraph (1);        (3) privatize Social Security;        (4) result in a reduction of guaranteed benefits for       individuals entitled to, or enrolled for, benefits under the       Medicare program under title XVIII of 18 such Act (42 U.S.C.       1395 et seq.); or        (5) result in a reduction of benefits or eligibility for       individuals enrolled in, or eligible to receive medical       assistance through, a State Medicaid plan or waiver under       title XIX of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 5 et seq.).        (b) Waiver and Appeal in the Senate.--Subsection (a) may be       waived or suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote       of three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. An       affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members of the       Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required to sustain       an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order       raised under subsection (a).        (c) Waiver in the House.--It shall not be in order in the       House of Representatives to consider a rule or order that       waives the application of subsection (a). As disposition of a       point of order under this subsection, the Chair shall put the       question of consideration with respect to the rule or order,       as applicable. The question of consideration shall be       debatable for 10 minutes by the Member initiating the point       of order and for 10 minutes by an opponent, but shall       otherwise be decided without intervening motion except one       that the House adjourn.          The Vote on the Previous Question: What it Really Means         This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous       question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote.       A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote       against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow       the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a       vote about what the House should be debating.        Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of       Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the       previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or       control the consideration of the subject before the House       being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous       question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the       subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling       of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the       House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes       the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to       offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the       majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated       the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to       a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to       recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said:       ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman       from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to       yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first       recognition.''        The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous       question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an       immediate vote on adopting the resolution .  .  . [and] has       no substantive legislative or policy implications       whatsoever.'' But that is not what they have always said.       Listen to the Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative       Process in the United States House of Representatives, (6th       edition, page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the       previous question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is       generally not possible to amend the rule because the majority       Member controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of       offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by       voting down the previous question on the rule .  .  .  . When       the motion for the previous question is defeated, control of       the time passes to the Member who led the opposition to       ordering the previous question. That Member, because he then       controls the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or       yield for the purpose of amendment.''        In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of       Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special       Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on       such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on       Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further       debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues:       ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a       resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control       shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous       question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who       controls the time for debate thereon.''  [[Page H489]]         Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does       have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only       available tools for those who oppose the Republican       majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the       opportunity to offer an alternative plan.
