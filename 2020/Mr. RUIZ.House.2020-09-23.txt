 Madam Speaker, environmental injustices disproportionately  impact underserved communities and communities of color around the  country.   We have experienced this firsthand in the Eastern Coachella Valley in  my district--environmental hazards that worsen quality of life and harm  the public's health; children struggling to breathe on their way to  school; residents with undrinkable water from high levels of arsenic.   Let me be clear. Having clean water to drink and clean air to breathe  is not a privilege just for the affluent few. It is a right and a  common good for everyone. That is why I am glad my bill, H.R. 3923, the  Environmental Justice Act of 2019, is passing the House this week as  part of the Clean Economy Jobs and Innovation Act.   My bill will strengthen protections for vulnerable populations, give  impacted communities the ability to hold big corporations and  government accountable, and provide needed funds to mitigate and  prevent future instances of environmental injustice.   I would like to thank Chairman Pallone and Subcommittee Chairman  Tonko for working with me on this important legislation.
