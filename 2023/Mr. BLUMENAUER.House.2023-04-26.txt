 Mr. Speaker, I listened carefully to the chairman of  the Ways and Means Committee, and there are some shared goals here:  Ending welfare for the wealthy and helping people realize the dignity  of work. There are ways we can come together to do that, but let's not  do it by making it harder for poor people to get food.   You want to end welfare for fairway farmers. There is no recognition  that people who get these lavish subsidies are actually on the farm and  working. There were almost 20,000 farmers who got payments averaging $1  million a year for 37 consecutive years. Let's cap and limit those  lavish subsidies. Let's require people who get them to work on the  farm. Let's have some limits, not poor people seeking food, but fairway  farmers and those who are benefiting from these lavish expenditures. We  can do better.
