 Will the Senator yield for a question about how long  he plans to speak, just for the convenience of others?    I appreciate that very much. Thank you.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to support my  colleague and friend Senator Cortez Masto in her efforts to bring this  legislation not only to the floor but to passage.   This has been a long, long trail of broken promises and false  assertions. It began with the broken promises and false assertions of  judicial nominees who came before the Judiciary Committee to assure us  that the protections of Roe v. Wade were a precedent and that they  would respect precedent. Of course, that all evaporated.   We then heard the argument that this was ``States' rights.'' My  friend from Utah may not like the phrase, but it is one that his side  has used over and over and over again. Call it States' rights or call  it federalism, the notion was that all we were doing was opening this  up to States.   But you heard right here on the Senate floor that the notion that  every pregnancy is subject to the control of the government from the  moment of conception. That does not allow for a differentiation between  one State and another.   And now that the States' rights assertion has been proven false, now  that it is clear that there are many Members not only of Congress but  of State legislatures who want a nationwide ban on women's ability to  make these reproductive choices, it becomes clearer and clearer why  this particular bill is so important. It is only a matter of time until  we see those bills being voted on in legislatures, trying to  criminalize a citizen of one State if they go to another State to get  this kind of care or trying to create a nationwide abortion ban.   However you call it, it will intrude on the ability of women to go  and seek this care. And what we are seeing already is women with  troubled pregnancies, for whom there is an indicated treatment, unable  to get the treatment that medical science knows is the right treatment,  whether it is twins, one of whom isn't viable, or a woman's ability to  have further pregnancies if this one is not terminated, or the ability  of a woman to simply be treated for sepsis, for instance, before it  turns to life-threatening and not have to wait and look at the watch  and let her get sicker and sicker, knowing that the end is the same, in  any event, but putting her life and health at risk in order to allow  the will of a bunch of State legislators to turn up in the examination  room or the treatment room with her and her family and her doctor. For  all of these reasons--because the proponents of a nationwide abortion  ban, because the proponents of undoing Roe v. Wade, have simply been  incredible for too long--we simply have to assume the worst.    And this bill is an important and sensible way to make sure that if  the Presiding Officer's State or my State want to allow that freedom  for women, that women can come there and get the care that they need-- very often, in a troubled pregnancy, for their own or their future  children's or the siblings' well-being. So for all those reasons, I  wish we had the chance to vote on this and look forward to future  chances.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of  2023, P.L. 118-5, which Congress passed earlier this month, resolved a  manufactured default crisis and avoided an economic catastrophe. In  addition, the bipartisan bill provided a congressional budget for 2024.   Specifically, the legislation instructs the chairman of the Senate  Committee on the Budget to file enforceable budgetary levels in the  Senate consistent with current law. Today, I submit the required  filing.   Section 121 of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 requires the  chairman to file a spending allocation for the Committee on  Appropriations for 2024; spending allocations for other committees for  2024, 2024 through 2028, and 2024 through 2033; an aggregate spending  level for 2024; aggregate revenue levels for 2024, 2024 through 2028,  and 2024 through 2033; and aggregate levels of Social Security revenues  and outlays for 2024, 2024 through 2028, and 2024 through 2033. Section  121 also requires the chairman to include a list of accounts eligible  for advance appropriations.   The amounts included in this filing are consistent with the  Congressional Budget Office's May 2023 baseline, adjusted for the  passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023, including the  discretionary spending limits established by that act. Because the  legislation does not include budget enforcement for fiscal year 2023,  it will not be possible to submit reports required by section 308(b) of  the Congressional Budget Act until fiscal year 2024.   In addition, section 121 allows the deficit-neutral reserve fund in  section 3003 of S. Con. Res. 14--117th Congress--to be updated by 2  fiscal years. Pursuant to that authority, that reserve fund shall be  considered updated and available for use for legislation which does not  increase the deficit for the time period of fiscal year 2024 to fiscal  year 2033.   For purposes of enforcing the Senate's pay-as-you-go rule, which is  found in section 4106 of the fiscal year 2018 congressional budget  resolution, I am resetting the Senate's scorecard to zero for all  fiscal years.   Section 111 of the act requires my counterpart, the chairman of the  House Committee on the Budget, to file similar enforceable budgetary  levels in the House of Representatives consistent with the  discretionary limits in the act. That filing will help both Houses  uphold the bipartisan agreement.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:             ALLOCATION OF SPENDING AUTHORITY TO SENATE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2024   (Pursuant to Section 121 of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 and Section 302 of the Congressional Budget                                                   Act of 1974)                                                  ($ in billions) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                              Budget Authority       Outlays ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Appropriations:     Revised Security Category/Defense.....................................            886.349                N/A     Revised Nonsecurity Category/Nondefense...............................            703.651                N/A     General Purpose Discretionary.........................................
