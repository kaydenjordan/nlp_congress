 Madam Speaker, a Senator from Alabama  is now many months into a blockade of all the generals and admirals in  our military who are scheduled to advance in their leadership. This is  no longer just a political statement from him. This is a national  security issue for all of us.   He has taken a personal crusade and made it an impediment to our  entire  [[Page H3215]]  military. We are at 250 nominations blocked so far. By the end of this  year, it will be 650.   These are our military's top leaders. The notion that all of these  positions should remain vacant because one Senator objects to the  Defense Department's travel policy regarding servicemembers who get an  abortion is a perfect example of letting culture war politics impact  our military.   This year, we have been treated to countless speeches about whether  politics has infected our military and whether that has impacted its  readiness. Now, the single clearest example of culture war politics  colliding with our military is this blockade of our top military  leaders, a blockade built by one man in defense not of our Nation but  of his politics on the issue of abortion.   The clearest price yet was paid this week as the leader of the Marine  Corps retired and then Congress tried to replace him with his appointed  successor, General Eric Smith, and the Senator from Alabama blocked  that replacement. The Marine Corps is now without a confirmed leader  for the first time since 1910.   Up next, we have several members of the Joint Chiefs with scheduled  retirements, including the Chair of the Joint Chiefs. Half of those  positions will be vacant by the end of this year if the Senator from  Alabama decides to maintain his blockade.   Asked about this, the Senator from Alabama expresses indifference. He  says everything will be fine. He is wrong. We have leaders in place for  a reason. When they are not there and crisis strikes, we get chaos.   We are the world's most powerful Nation, and when one Senator chooses  to sideline hundreds of nominations for military leaders, he chooses to  reduce our power knowingly, willfully, and in the face of our enemies  who are delighted by the self-inflicted wound.   When in doubt, act in a way that frustrates your enemy. This does the  opposite.   I respect everyone's sincere beliefs on matters of culture and  policy. That does not extend to respecting any and all tactics in  pursuit of those goals. Those who disagree with the Defense Department,  as the Senator does, do their cause a disservice by adopting extreme  tactics that carry with them such collateral damage.   The Senator from Alabama is in his first term in Congress, as I am.  He is in the minority party in his Chamber, as I am. I have lost  several battles here. I will lose several more. But when you can't get  something done that you very much care about, how you conduct yourself  in that moment matters. Even people who don't follow politics every day  can tell the difference between standing on principle and a very  powerful man throwing a temper tantrum.   I think he sees that there is no endgame where this tactic works. He  is now all the way out on a limb. That limb is starting to crack. I  don't think he knows quite yet what to do.   I have been in the military a long time. One of the things you learn  is that hopeless strategies produce disastrous results. The strong move  for him is to change course, not to recommit to a path that will lead  to nothing except chaos and danger for our country, as seven former  Secretaries of Defense, from both administrations, are strongly urging  him to do.                            ____________________
