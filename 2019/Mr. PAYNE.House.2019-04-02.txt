 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.    Mr. Speaker, Alzheimer's is a public health crisis. It is  fitting that today, the second day of National Public Health Week, the  Alzheimer's Association held their annual Day on the Hill. That is why  I am wearing purple, to help raise awareness about Alzheimer's.   Someone new develops Alzheimer's every 65 seconds in the United  States. The cost of caring for those with Alzheimer's and other  dementias is around $290 billion a year in the United States. That cost  is only going to get higher.   In New Jersey alone, there are 180,000 people over the age of 65 who  suffer from Alzheimer's. Each year, nearly 3,000 of them die from  Alzheimer's.   Mr. Speaker, I ask that my colleagues join me to raise awareness on  Alzheimer's. But raising awareness is not enough. We need to increase  research funding, commit to a public health response to Alzheimer's,  and support Alzheimer's planning and care services under Medicare.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Garamendi for once again setting  aside time to talk about the issues that affect the lives of people  across this country.   I want to start by saying that the contrast between Republicans and  Democrats on this issue of healthcare could not be any clearer.   As the gentleman has described in his discussion of the ongoing legal  case down south, Republicans and the Trump administration want to make  Americans sick again. They want to eliminate protections for people  with preexisting conditions.   Let me just stop there. This Nation was built on a morality that we  held very deeply in this country. But, to me, it feels like it has been  torn apart, is falling apart, that we do not care about people who find  themselves in circumstances that they did not create on their own, that  they should alone be left, because of a preexisting condition, not to  be afforded healthcare.   That is unconscionable. That is profiteering at its worst. It deeply  upsets me that we find ourselves turning our backs on our brothers and  our sisters, our mothers and our fathers, and our aunts and our uncles  in this country to say, no, because you have an illness, we cannot  protect you and give you insurance. It is unconscionable.   They want to take the United States backward, and they are  weaponizing the courts to do what they failed to do in Congress: repeal  the Affordable Care Act.   I arrived here in 2012, and the Affordable Care Act was already the  law of the land. But what I witnessed in my time here was the over 50  times, close to 60 times, that the Republicans attempted to repeal the  Affordable Care Act but could never do it. They could never do it. With  the White House, with the Senate, and with the House, they still could  not do it, because it was too popular with a lot of Americans in this  country. They did not listen to the people. They did not want the  Affordable Care Act repealed.   Now they are trying to go the court and the executive route and do  what they could not do in this body, which is the body that determines  those matters.   Democrats, on the other hand, want to make America healthy. We want  to expand healthcare access. We want to strengthen the Affordable Care  Act. We want to make sure that people with preexisting conditions are  not denied insurance coverage.   Now the Trump administration is fighting to bring healthcare  discrimination back. Well, there is no going back. More than 200,000  people in my State of New Jersey who purchased their insurance through  the Affordable Care Act marketplace have preexisting conditions.   President Trump wants to make it easier for insurers to deny  coverage. He is playing politics with their lives.   What my constituents want and need is for the Affordable Care Act to  be strengthened. The 200,000 New Jerseyans who purchased their  insurance through the Affordable Care Act should not have their  insurance coverage put to risk because of politics. New Jerseyans and  all Americans deserve protection, not discrimination.   Let me be clear: The Trump administration wants to put lives at risk  by undermining people's access to healthcare across this country. The  Trump administration is sabotaging the Affordable Care Act, and  Americans are paying the price.   The Trump administration has made it more difficult to enroll in the  Affordable Care Act by increasing website downtime during open  enrollment and cutting the budget for healthcare navigators, the people  who help Americans determine and figure out what they need in terms of  coverage. They cut that.   The Trump administration has stopped finding cost-share reductions,  which lower people's out-of-pocket expenses.   The Trump administration has launched a full-scale legal attack on  the Affordable Care Act.   In light of those attacks, let me be clear about one thing: Democrats  will keep fighting to ensure that all Americans' healthcare is  protected. We will fight in the House. We will fight in the Senate. We  will fight in the courts.   Once again, I thank the gentleman for his true leadership on the  issues that are facing the American people.
