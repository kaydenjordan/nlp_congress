 I yield the floor.    Mr. President, section 251 of the Balanced Budget and  Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, BBEDCA, establishes statutory  limits on discretionary spending and allows for various adjustments to  those limits. In addition, sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974 allow the Chairman of the Budget Committee to  establish and make revisions to allocations, aggregates, and levels  consistent with those adjustments.   The Senate will soon consider H.R. 8337, the Continuing  Appropriations Act, 2021 and Other Extensions Act. This measure  includes two provisions, found in sections 126 and 163, that are  designated as being for emergency purposes pursuant to section  251(b)(2)(A)(i) of BBEDCA. The Congressional Budget Office estimates  that these provisions will have no net effect on budget authority but  would result in $92 million in outlays in fiscal year 2021.   As a result of the emergency designations, I am revising the outlay  allocation to the Committee on Appropriations by $92 million in fiscal  year 2021. Further, I am increasing the budgetary outlay aggregate for  fiscal year 2021 by equivalent amounts.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustment, be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      REVISION TO BUDGETARY AGGREGATES  (Pursuant to Sections 311 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of                             1974--$ Millions) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            2021 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority...........................                3,832,200     Outlays....................................                4,008,705 Adjustments:     Budget Authority...........................                        0     Outlays....................................                       92 Revised Spending Aggregates:     Budget Authority...........................                3,832,200     Outlays....................................                4,008,797 ------------------------------------------------------------------------    REVISION TO SPENDING ALLOCATION TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS FOR                             FISCAL YEAR 2021  (Pursuant to Sections 302 and 314(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of                             1974--$ Millions) ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                            2021 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Current Allocation:     Revised Security Discretionary Budget                        671,500      Authority.................................

Brown of Thermopolis, WY.   Robert Brown was a lifelong resident of Thermopolis, WY, and he  exemplified Wyoming's values and a commitment to public service.   After graduating from Thermopolis High School, Bob was inducted into  the Army in 1944, and he served in both the Europe and Pacific  theaters. Later, in 1950, when he was part of the National Guard, Bob  deployed to Korea, where he was a member of the 300th Armored Field  Artillery Battalion.   He served in World War II, in both theaters, and then in Korea. The  United States was poorly prepared for Korea, downsizing the military  after the Second World War. The National Guard responded with little or  no training or equipment.   Bob Brown went to another war. He earned a Unit Citation. He received  the Combat Infantry Badge and the Purple Heart.   Upon returning to Thermopolis, Bob began a career with the U.S.  Postal Service. That career spanned 44 years, including many years as  postmaster. I hope John will tell more of the postal love affair and  how Bob Brown met and courted the person who picked up the mail. That  lady later became my first Sunday school teacher.   Bob passed away earlier this month. At 94 years of age, he did have  some health issues, but he had a devoted daughter, Bobbi Brown  Barrasso, wife of Senator Barrasso, who had been Senator Thomas' State  director. She was her dad's caregiver. She took care of him in Casper  as well as Thermopolis. She drove him back and forth wherever he wanted  or needed to go, which meant especially back and forth to needed  clinics with doctors in Thermopolis and in Casper. When COVID happened,  she stayed with him and protected him.   Bob Brown will be sorely missed in his community, and I can think of  no  [[Page S5868]]  better way to honor someone with such a long and storied career with  the U.S. Postal Service, as well as with the people of Thermopolis,  than to introduce this bill to name the Thermopolis post office after  him.   That historic building holds the memories of a veteran who came home  to work and spent his entire career in that building, winding up as  postmaster.   The lead Democratic cosponsor of this bipartisan bill is Senator Tom  Carper, who is the strongest advocate I know of for the U.S. Postal  Service.
