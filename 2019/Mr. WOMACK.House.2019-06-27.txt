 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Oklahoma for  leading in this discussion.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the question on consideration. We  should be taking up the Senate-passed bill. It has already been  mentioned that it passed 84-8.   We don't have a CBO score for the changes made by the House  amendments to the bill, and without a CBO score, we don't know the cost  this bill would have on State and local governments.   Yesterday, in a budget hearing on matters of immigration, we heard  testimony from the mayor of Yuma, Arizona, which clearly demonstrates  the economic impacts and costs that States and local governments are  incurring due to the crisis at the border.   My friends just said changes made by the House on this Senate-passed  bill take tens of millions of dollars away from the Department of  Defense for reimbursement and limit the ability of Customs and Border  Patrol to adequately pay for the services incurred as a result of this  ongoing crisis.   Madam Speaker, Democrats have had many opportunities to advance  bipartisan solutions that would provide the kind of relief to these  communities and begin to address the crisis at the border, and for  nearly 2 months, they have refused to act.   This week has been an unfortunate loss of precious time. This is a  situation where Congress clearly needs to come together and act  swiftly. I am sorry to say, we are falling short in this basic  obligation of the duties of the Congress of the United States of  America.   Madam Speaker, again, I rise in support of the question that we have  under consideration.
