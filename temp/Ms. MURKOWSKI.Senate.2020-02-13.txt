 Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to  recognize the life of Ugiaqtaq Wesley Aiken, who died January 6, 2020  at the age 93 years old, only 19 days shy of his 94th birthday.   With the passing of Native elder Wesley Aiken, Alaska has lost a  highly respected Inupiat leader who dedicated his life to leadership in  the Alaska Native community and ensuring that cultural and traditional  knowledge will be passed down to younger generations.   Wesley Aiken was born in 1926 in Utqiagvik, to a completely  subsistence lifestyle north of the Arctic Circle. He grew up in a small  village, Isuk. which lays east of Utqiagvik, until the age of 12,  moving for his education. As a teenager, he became a reindeer header  for 3 years in order to help out his family. He was a man of many  trades--he was a mechanic, laborer, member of the Alaska Territorial  Guard, and later a member of the Alaska National Guard. He served as  the land chief for Ukpeagvik Inupiat Corporation following its  formation in 1973. He was a spiritual leader for the community and was  always asked to pray. He would pray when the whale was caught, before  big celebrations, the Nalukatak blanket toss, the Winter Games, and he  prayed with the whaling captains. He loved the gatherings of the people  and strived to see all the community's children participate. He was a  hard worker  [[Page S1072]]  and would say, ``If you have dreams to do something, you, yourself have  to work hard to get to that goal.''   Wesley grew up using dog teams in the wintertime to camp and hunt  long before snow machines were prevalent and available in his region.  His traditional knowledge of the subsistence lifestyle was extensive,  and he enthusiastically shared with his community. He learned whaling  from his grandfather and uncle and later became a whaling captain. He  took it upon himself to teach the next generation whaling. His  daughter's generation was sent off to boarding schools, and so many  youth were not taught the traditional ways of hunting and needed to be  retaught when they returned. He taught many of his nephews traditional  hunting methods and said it was his job to give back, just as his  elders had taught him how to hunt whale and inland animals. He observed  changes in sea ice and climate in his generation and shared with the  world what he saw.   Wesley also served on the North Slope Borough's Inupiat History,  Language and Culture Commission. He often stressed the importance of  language, and his dream was an immersion camp in which only Inupiat was  spoke. He reminded the youth about the hardships their ancestors  experienced and that the whole community looked out for each other. And  if you took care of animals and the land, they would take care of you.   In 2018, he served as the keynote speaker at the Elders and Youth  Conference in Anchorage, during which he delivered a strong message on  respect. He said it is all about respect. It is about respect for self  and for one other, as well as a respect for the animals, which he said  have spirits just like we do. In fact, when he took his daughter  hunting, he taught her where to put a hole behind the neck to release  the spirit of the caribou.   Wesley was also known for his Alaska Native rights activism. He  participated in the 1961 Barrow Duck Sit-in, protesting the Federal  Government's regulation of Native hunting rights, and this protest,  among others, led to the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. A  respected leader, he also helped establish the Alaska Federal of  Natives.   Elder Wesley's wisdom and kindness will be missed. He is survived and  respected by his children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, friends,  and his whole community.                            ____________________
