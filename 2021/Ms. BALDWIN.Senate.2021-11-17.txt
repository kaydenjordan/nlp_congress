 Mr. President, today I rise to honor Wisconsin residents  James ``Jim'' and Marty Harris for their humanitarian work in Southeast  Asia and their embrace of those displaced from that region. These two  lifelong educators have made it their life's mission to welcome Hmong  and Lao refugee families to Central Wisconsin, as well as make a  positive impact for those living in Laos.   Over the course of more than 20 years, the Harris' have made over 20  trips to Laos. Beginning in 2000, they began the effort to reconnect  families from their Wisconsin community with friends and relatives left  behind when they departed their homeland. During these trips, they  assisted Lao villagers in desperate need of medical care, helped  provide hospitals with medical supplies, and provided many Lao schools  with their very first library, a most appropriate endeavor for the now  retired elementary school principal and retired English and art  teacher.   However, their largest impact comes with their assistance in the  removal of bombs, land mines, and other unexploded ordnances that dot  the Laotian landscape after years of war and turmoil. As Jim told me  during a visit I made to Laos several years ago, ``Many villagers are  waiting 40 years for four days of help.'' To address this, the Harris's  founded the nonprofit ``We Help War Victims,'' an organization that  assists survivors of war and other conflicts to rebuild their lives.  With half of its annual budget stemming from fundraising sales of Lao  coffee beans, it allows paid teams to continue ordnance removal even  when Jim and Marty aren't able to be halfway around the world.  Countless lives and limbs have been saved because of this continuing  work and dedication. Now, villages can enjoy expanded gardens and rice  fields. This increased agricultural output allows these populations to  better sustain themselves and provide food for neighboring communities.   With every trip, Jim returned to Wisconsin with relics and mementos  gathered during his time in Laos. Slowly, this collection has amassed  to become one of, if not the largest, known private collection of  Southeast Asian artifacts in all of the United States. Jim started off  by displaying some of these items at the school he worked at as  principal. In 2016, he made the collection more accessible by  developing an exhibition called ``From Laos to America: The Spirit of  '76'', which was housed at the Wausau Center Mall in Wausau, WI. Since  then, more than 10,000 people have visited the museum.   The ``From Laos to America'' collection now enters into a new chapter  in 2021. This impressive collection has found a new home in Washington  Square in downtown Wausau. Jim and Marty have also partnered with the  Hmong American Center to ensure that this collection remains in central  Wisconsin. This new home will highlight the full collection and provide  educational opportunities so the community and visitors alike can learn  more about the Southeast Asian refugee experience. I am pleased to  celebrate this important partnership and the new home for this  important collection, and I am proud to commend Jim and Marty on their  tireless humanitarian work and advocacy in Southeast Asia and in  central Wisconsin.                            ____________________
