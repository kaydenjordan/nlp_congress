 Madam President, I rise to enter into a colloquy  with the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Wyden, to discuss  sections 13701 and 13702 of the Inflation Reduction Act. These sections  establish new sections 45Y and 48D of the Tax Code that provide new tax  credits for, respectively, production from and investment in clean  electricity resources that are placed in service after December 31,  2024.    As the chairman of the Finance Committee knows  well, the Inflation Reduction Act includes new and improved clean  energy tax credits, and I commend Senator Wyden for leading the effort  to simplify the Tax Code's incentives for clean electricity. These  credits will advance our transition to a clean energy future and are a  key part of this legislation's goal of reducing carbon emissions from  the electricity sector more than 40 percent by 2030.   The 45Y and 48D provisions expressly make geothermal energy eligible  for critical tax credits, and I appreciate the chairman's attention to  this issue given its importance to Nevada's economy. Nevada is a leader  in geothermal energy and the industry provides critical jobs and  revenues for my State and others across the country. Geothermal  resources also provide clean power, and they are essential to meet the  emissions reduction goals of this legislation. As the current chairman  of the Finance Committee and former chairman of the Energy and Natural  Resources Committee, can Senator Wyden comment how this legislation  intends to spur the deployment of this critical clean energy  technology?    I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee and  my friend from Oregon for his comprehensive answer, his commitment to  solving for climate change, and for joining me today in this colloquy.                            ____________________
