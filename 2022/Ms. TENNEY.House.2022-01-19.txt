 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and remember Mrs.  Shirley Waters of Rome, New York, for her outstanding leadership and  service.   Sadly, Mrs. Waters passed away this December at the age of 100,  leaving a legacy of service whose impact is felt throughout our entire  area.   Shirley and her late husband, George Waters, have been devoted  pillars of our community. The Waters family has owned and published the  Rome Daily Sentinel newspaper since 1928. Shirley served as the vice  president until her retirement in 2012.  [[Page H228]]    Our family also published a newspaper in central New York, and I have  always been inspired by Shirley's endless energy, good humor, and, yes,  strong opinions on many subjects--a woman after my own heart.                                time  1100    I have also always been inspired by Shirley's tenacity and commitment  to informing our community with depth and integrity, something that the  Rome Daily Sentinel has always done throughout its history.   In addition to being a publisher, Shirley was a beloved mother of  five who was active in her church and a member of our local artist  community. Shirley's paintings hang in galleries in our region and live  on to evoke wonder and inspire serenity to so many.   Shirley was also an honored member of the Order of Saint Barbara, as  well as an honorary member of the Northeast Air Defense Sector. Shirley  even helped secure the B-52 bomber displayed in Rome at the entrance to  the former Griffiss Air Force Base, which she obtained from the  national B-52 museum committee.   On behalf of our community and those in the news business who are  committed to serving the public as true members of the fourth estate,  we are grateful to Shirley Waters for being our standard-bearer. We are  also grateful to her for her distinguished service to our community  beyond her role as a newspaper publisher.   Her legacy will continue to live on in so many important ways, from  the great newspaper she leaves, the Rome Daily Sentinel, to her work  which she also loved, to her works of art that are exhibited throughout  our region, and her strong belief in our region's greatness and  history.   My deepest condolences to the Waters family on the loss of this  wonderful, venerable wife, mother, grandmother, and tenacious community  leader with a wonderful sense of humor.                      Recognition of Trooper Kevin Beach     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Rome Police Chief  Kevin Beach who will retire at the end of January after an incredible  career and true devotion to public service.   Kevin first joined the Rome Police Department in September of 1994,  following in his father's footsteps. Kevin's father, Bruce, also served  the department for many years. Kevin showed leadership early on the job  and was promoted quickly to the rank of detective after only 6 years.   In 2005, Kevin was appointed detective commander and then deputy  chief in 2007. In 2008, he was appointed as the youngest police chief  in the history of the city of Rome.   At just 36, Kevin had served the department for only 14 years but was  picked for the top spot because of his exemplary track record and  strong leadership skills. Kevin's hard work, dedication, and love for  the city was evident every day he was on the job.   During his tenure as chief, the department introduced community  programs such as Shop with a Cop, Law Enforcement Day, and the creation  of a Community Impact Unit. Kevin has also successfully navigated the  department through difficult times through the COVID-19 pandemic and  the national defund the police movement.   Kevin, thank you for your lifetime of service and commitment to the  city of Rome. We are grateful for your devotion to service on behalf of  your community. I also want to thank you for your friendship and sage  counsel to me and so many others during your important work as our  chief. May you enjoy a productive and healthy retirement.                     Recognition of Trooper David Draudt     Madam Speaker, it is often said that law enforcement  officers work for a cause, not applause. This is certainly true and  today I would like to recognize a trooper from the southern tier of New  York's 22nd district who deserves our applause.   Trooper David Draudt went to work on the morning of November 29 with  the intent to protect and serve. Yet, on that day Trooper Draudt not  only protected and served his community, but he also called on his  extensive training to courageously save the life of an unresponsive 2- year-old boy who had choked himself into unconsciousness. Trooper  Draudt didn't lace up his boots that morning intent on saving a life.  But that is exactly what he did.   Law enforcement officers do not have the opportunity of choosing who  or what they encounter each day. They rely on their training and their  knowledge and their experiences to respond with honor, courage, and  integrity and, of course, compassion to whatever situation may arise.  On November 29, that is exactly what Trooper Draudt did.   Today, our cause is applause; applause not just for Trooper Draudt  who saved the life of a child, but to all who answer the call to serve.                            ____________________
