 Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman for her  leadership and continued respect for the oversight of this body. And I  particularly thank the gentleman from Illinois and his cosponsors for  this very astute legislation.   I join with my bipartisan colleagues to indicate that the  transparency of funding by way of the budget process is absolutely  crucial to be able to be guided by what is right, as well, to ensure  that we, the Congress, have a knowledge of the importance of the  funding process, the importance of the programs that are used for  taxpayer dollars.   Mr. Speaker, let me just take a microcosm of what I believe will be  an important aspect of this. Why don't I take COVID-19 as an example?   Mr. Speaker, I believe that we have been hearing from all over the  Nation that the Federal Government needs to be in charge. The agency  that I think would be most effective as a national coordinator of  vaccine transport and delivery is FEMA.   For safe and effective supply chain transport, delivery, and site use  of vaccines, FEMA has the ability to tell other agencies what to do or  to be able to be part of the success of the distribution of these  vaccines. They have broad stakeholder engagement. FEMA has personnel  all over the Nation, and they are not in the business of picking  business winners or losers. And implementing CDC COVID-19 vaccine  recommendations, they know how to do that.   Mr. Speaker, I say thank you to all the private-sector volunteers,  all the pharmacies located in grocery stores and well-known chains, but  that is not working. It is not going to work.   This particular legislation would let us know the budget plan of an  agency, like FEMA, which really looms large in our lives because  whether you have experienced a fire in California, or whether or not  you have experienced Hurricane Harvey in Texas, or whether or not you  have experienced tornadoes, FEMA has been on the ground. They know how  to put large efforts together. They can lead the effort for vaccine  delivery so that we don't have these kinds of episodes.   ``One American dies from COVID-19 every 33 seconds.'' Mr. Speaker, I  include in the Record an article.                          [From CNN, Jan. 5, 2021]  One American Dies From Covid-19 Every 33 Seconds as the Vaccine Rollout                                 Hits Snags                    (By Holly Yan and Madeline Holcombe)         While hopes of vaccinating 20 million people by New Year's       Day sputtered out, the US now faces staggering new challenges       in the fight against Covid-19.        Over the past week, the US has averaged 2,637 coronavirus       deaths every day, according to Johns Hopkins University.        That's an average of one Covid-19 death every 33 seconds.        December was the deadliest month yet of this pandemic, with       77,572 lives lost. And  [[Page H64]]       deaths are likely to accelerate as new infections and       hospitalizations rise.        On Monday, more people were hospitalized with Covid-19 than       any other day in this pandemic--128,210, according to the       Covid Tracking Project.        The US averaged 213,437 new infections every day over the       past week, largely fueled by holiday gatherings, health       experts say.        But while daily new infections soared 16% over the past       week, testing has actually decreased 11.65% over the past       week, according to the Covid Tracking Project.        Doctors worry this rampant spread of Covid-19 will push       more hospitals beyond capacity and lead to more deaths as the       vaccine rollout staggers along.              The possibility of giving half-doses of a vaccine         About 15.4 million vaccine doses have been distributed in       the US, but only 4.5 million people have received their first       doses, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said       Monday.        That's far behind what officials had hoped for by now. And       it means herd immunity is still many months away.        ``We agree that there is a lag. We'll work with the       states,'' said Moncef Slaoui, chief scientific adviser of the       federal Operation Warp Speed vaccination effort.        To help expedite vaccinations, the US might start giving       half-doses of Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine to people age 18 to       55, which could make the vaccine available to twice as many       people in that age group, Slaoui said.        Slaoui said Sunday the US Food and Drug Administration       would meet this week to consider the idea.        But the FDA commissioner and its vaccine division chief       said in a joint statement that people need to get two full       doses instead of two half-doses.        ``At this time, suggesting changes to the FDA-authorized       dosing or schedules of these vaccines is premature and not       rooted solidly in the available evidence,'' said FDA       Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn and Dr. Peter Marks, who heads       the agency's vaccine division. ``Without appropriate data       supporting such changes in vaccine administration, we run a       significant risk of placing public health at risk,       undermining the historic vaccination efforts to protect the       population from Covid-19.''        It's understandable that people may want to stretch the       vaccine supply, they said. But it's not advisable.        ``If people do not truly know how protective a vaccine is,       there is the potential for harm because they may assume that       they are fully protected when they are not, and accordingly,       alter their behavior to take unnecessary risks,'' they said.        The two 100-microgram Moderna vaccine doses are intended to       be spaced 28 days apart.        CNN has reached out to Moderna for comment.        Dr. Jonathan Reiner, a professor of medicine at George       Washington University, said he does not agree with the idea       of half-doses.        ``We have about 13 million doses that have been shipped out       to the states, and only barely 4 million doses that have gone       into arms. So the bottleneck is not the lack of availability       of vaccine. The bottleneck is actually the logistics of       vaccinating people in this country.''        It's difficult enough to get some patients on board with       getting a vaccine, he said. Going against the recommended       dosing could hurt patients' confidence.        ``When I see people in clinic, I talk about the vaccine       every single day. I'm trying to reduce vaccine hesitancy,''       Reiner said Monday.        ``And the strongest weapon I have is the data. I can tell       people that these two vaccines have been studied in 70,000       people--more than 70,000 people--in this two-dose strategy.       And when given that way, they're both 95% effective, and       basically no one gets critically ill if you get this vaccine.       . . . Once you break from the data, I can no longer say       that.''          Study says holding back fewer doses could cut cases by 29%         Right now, the federal government is allocating about half       of the vaccines being produced. The other half is held in       reserve to be used as a second dose or as replacements in       cases where doses are unusable.        But by reducing the amount withheld to 10% for the first       three weeks and supplying a steady dose of 6 million doses       per week, the US could avoid up to 29% more coronavirus cases       over eight weeks, a study published in the Annals of Internal       Medicine found.        ``We find that under most plausible scenarios, a more       balanced approach that withholds fewer doses during early       distribution in order to vaccinate more people as soon as       possible could substantially increase the benefits of       vaccines, while enabling most recipients to receive second       doses on schedule,'' write the study's authors, who were       supported by the Canadian Institutes for Health Research and       the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.        The researchers modeled several scenarios, with variables       including vaccine supply, protection provided by the first       dose, and waning efficacy of a first dose if a second dose is       delayed.              An emergency department employee dies of Covid-19         In California, health care workers are treating an       unprecedented number of Covid-19 patients. Sometimes, those       patients are colleagues.        At Kaiser Permanente San Jose Medical Center, 44 emergency       department employees tested positive for Covid-19 between       December 27 and January 1, said Irene Chavez, senior vice       president and area manager.        On Monday, the hospital said one employee who was working       on Christmas has died of Covid-19.        ``Our thoughts and prayers are with those affected by this       terrible loss,'' the hospital said in a statement. ``We are       providing support to our employees during this difficult       time,'' according to a statement from the hospital.        Over the weekend, Chavez said the medical center is       investigating whether an inflatable, air-powered costume may       have played a role in the spread.        ``A staff member did appear briefly in the emergency       department on December 25th wearing an air-powered costume,''       she said.        ``Any exposure, if it occurred, would have been completely       innocent, and quite accidental, as the individual had no       Covid symptoms and only sought to lift the spirits of those       around them during what is a very stressful time.''        Chavez said air-powered costumes will no longer be allowed       at the facility.        ``If anything, this should serve as a very real reminder       that the virus is widespread, and often without symptoms, and       we must all be vigilant,'' she said.                           `A rough start to 2021'         On Sunday, five states reported their highest number of new       infections ever in one day--Arizona, New Hampshire, Oklahoma,       South Carolina and Washington.        And over the past week, at least five states have average       test positivity rates higher than 40%--meaning more than 40%       of people who take a Covid-19 test get a positive result.        Those states include Idaho (57%), Alabama (46.7%), Iowa       (44.6%), Pennsylvania (44%) and South Dakota (43.8%). For       perspective, the WHO has recommended governments not reopen       until the test positivity rates stays at or below 5% for 14       days.        In South Carolina, which had a 29.6% test positivity rate       Sunday, officials in four counties said their hospitals were       at 100% capacity, according to the South Carolina Department       of Health and Environmental Control.        ``We're in for a bit of a rough start to 2021,'' said Maria       Van Kerkhove, the World Health Organization's technical lead       for Covid-19 response.        But it's possible daily life in the US could be closer to       normal by the summer or fall, she said. Other countries are       already well on their way--thanks to quarantining, testing,       isolation and contact tracing.        ``We've seen countries bring this virus to its knees,       without vaccination,'' Van Kerkhove said. ``We have the tools       at hand right now to actually bring this virus under       control.''     The city of Houston has done a phenomenal job by  trying to open up these centers, but guess what? They are looking for  their next delivery. We should not be looking for the next delivery.  The delivery should be organized, logistically. It should be stored on  the ground.   ``Houston, have you finished your utilization? Are you ready for your  next?''   ``L.A., have you finished your utilization? Are you ready for your  next?''   That is not happening.   ``COVID vaccine rollout is going about as well as you'd feared.'' Mr.  Speaker, I include in the Record that article, along with an article  regarding the opening of Houston's first public COVID-19 vaccine  location.        COVID Vaccine Rollout Is Going About As Well As You'd Feared         Texans are beginning the new year the same way we spent       much of the last one: straggling through a devastating       pandemic with a patchy public health infrastructure, a       confusing mishmash of rules and procedures, and an ominous       absence of effective statewide leadership.        We have a COVID-19 vaccine now: that's the good news. Two       of them, actually, one by Pfizer and the other by Moderna,       both developed as part of the federal Operation Warp Speed       and approved by the Federal Drug Administration for emergency       use last month.        We knew that distributing hundreds of millions of vaccines       would be a challenge. Each requires two doses and careful       handling--including ultra-cold storage for the Pfizer       vaccine. Each is being distributed to a population that       includes potential recipients skeptical of vaccines in       general, and the COVID vaccine in particular.        But we had several months to figure this out. And it's       quickly become painfully clear that we didn't.        In Phase 1A of the plan put forward by the Texas Department       of State Health Services, the first doses of the vaccine were       distributed to front-line health care workers and residents       of long-term care facilities, beginning last month. On       Tuesday, the state announced that vaccine providers could       begin immunizing Texans in group 1B--those over age 65 and       those with pre-existing conditions.  [[Page H65]]         The experiences of Texans in that group gives you the       impression that we've responded to an ongoing crisis with a       maddening, high-stakes scavenger hunt. In Harris County, for       example, there are dozens of providers that have partnered       with the state to distribute vaccines, but making an       appointment at any of them seems to require persistence,       endless phone calls, and a hefty dose of luck.        Overall, the distribution process has been inefficient and       confusing. As of Dec. 31, according to DSHS, some 283,000       people across Texas--roughly 45,000 in Harris County--had       received the first dose of the vaccine. That's of the 773,000       doses the state had shipped to various providers, up to that       point.        And it's a worrisomely low figure, according to public       health professionals, given that we'll need to vaccinate up       to 80 percent of the population to achieve the herd immunity       that will allow normal life to resume. Dr. Peter Hotez,       professor and dean of the National School of Tropical       Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, has pointed to the       straightforward back-of-the-envelope math: with roughly 30       million people in Texas, we should be aiming for a million       immunizations a week to achieve herd immunity by mid-year.        Last week, as these difficulties began coming to light,       Gov. Greg Abbott pointed the finger at the state's hospitals       and other vaccine providers.        ``A significant portion of vaccines distributed across       Texas might be sitting on hospital shelves as opposed to       being given to vulnerable Texans,'' Abbott said on Twitter.        ``The state urges vaccine providers to quickly provide all       shots,'' he continued. ``We get plenty more each week.''        In the Houston area, at least, providers say they're doing       just that. And Texans are having unpleasant memories of the       early days of the pandemic, when state leaders such as Abbott       took a largely hands-off approach to the public health       response--intervening only when local leaders in cities such       as Houston and Austin crossed what he deemed to be a red       line.        ``Here we are, once again, hoping that private companies       will figure out a decent vaccine distribution system since       the State of Texas sure hasn't,'' said state Rep. Erin       Zwiener, a Democrat, on Twitter. ``But that means it will be       disparate and confusing and hard for our constituents to       navigate.''        These issues aren't unique to Texas. Even states with       relatively robust public health systems have seen what       Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker described this week as a       ``lumpy and bumpy'' rollout.        An exasperated U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah vented in a       statement on New Year's Day.        ``That comprehensive vaccination plans have not been       developed at the federal level and sent to the states as       models is as incomprehensible as it is inexcusable,'' Romney       said.        ``It was unrealistic to assume that the health care workers       already overburdened with COVID care could take on a massive       vaccination program,'' he continued. ``So too is the claim       that CVS and Walgreens will save the day: they don't have       excess personnel available to inoculate millions of       Americans. Nor are they equipped to deal with the rare but       serious reactions which may occur.''        The distribution of COVID vaccines is, without question, a       matter of urgency. We begin the new year with more than       12,000 Texans hospitalized due to the virus, and public       health experts fretting about the impact of holiday       gatherings and travel on those statistics--as well as reports       that cases of a more transmissible variant of the virus have       been confirmed in the United States.        The state's plan to rely on public/private partnerships to       distribute the vaccine may be sensible, given Texas's extant       public health infrastructure. But, at the minimum, we need       better communication from state leaders about how Texans who       are eligible for the vaccine can access it--not finger-      pointing and politics.                                   ____      Houston's First Public COVID-19 Vaccine Location Officially Opens         Houston.--On Saturday, Houston's first public COVID-19       vaccine location opened on the city's Southside. City and       state leaders believe this could be one of the first public       Coronavirus vaccine locations to open in the country.       ``Houston may be the very first city of this size to setup a       massive distribution of vaccines,'' said Congresswoman Sheila       Jackson Lee. ``I believe that deserves an applause.''        The site, located off Knight Road in South Houston, had a       long line of cars surrounding the parking lot early Saturday       morning.        ``The goal will be to get these vaccines out as quickly as       we get them'' said Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner.        The free Coronavirus shots were originally planned to be       given to people who made appointments over the phone.       However, the Houston Health Department quickly had to change       their plan after being overwhelmed with calls.        Within an hour of opening their call center, the Houston       Health Department tweeted, ``The volume of calls to our       COVID-19 call center overwhelmed the system and it's       currently experiencing technical issues . . .''        ``Call-in centers across the board received about 250,000       calls today,'' said Mayor Turner. ``The system was literally       overwhelmed, so we went to Plan B. Plan B was on-site       registration.''        ``Seven out of 10 people who die from COVID are 65 years       and older,'' said Houston Health Department Director Stephen       Williams. ``If you look in line, we're actually seeing those       folks, and I'm grateful for that.''        Texas recently started Phase 1B of the state's COVID-19       vaccine distribution plan. Now, front-line medical works,       people at least 65 years-old, or adults with chronic health       issues can get vaccinated.        ``Even though there's a lot of vaccine hesitancy, there's       still a strong desire from people to get the vaccine,'' said       Mayor Turner.        According to Mayor Turner, he hopes to have the City of       Houston open a mass distribution location for Coronavirus       shots by the end of the week.        ``The New York Mayor announced that they were going to try       to do 1-million vaccines in the month of January,'' said       Mayor Turner. ``I think we can do the same thing in the month       of January. I'd like to do even more than that.''     Mr. Speaker, FDA is considering to halve the amount  of vaccines going to Americans. This haphazard way will not work. And  the budget bill that is before us gives Congress the insight into how  agencies plan their work.   So, is FEMA well-funded to take care of a pandemic? Were they funded  the way they should have been in case a pandemic came and they were the  right agency to do it?   Please remember, when we were flagging around and flustering around  at the beginning of COVID-19, the PPE had to be taken over by FEMA.   That is what happened. We were struggling. People were fighting over  PPE. Governors were out on the market. They were making negotiations  individually with China while their health professionals were dying or  reusing masks or reusing PPE. FEMA came in and did it.   Mr. Speaker, I will be discussing this even further, but I support  this legislation because it gives Members of Congress the ability to  know budget and appropriations so that if a pandemic comes, what agency  can handle it? FEMA, because it has the funding.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the underlying  legislation, and I look forward to this further discussion.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in support of H.R. 22, the Congressional  Budget Justification Transparency Act, which requires congressional  budget justifications to be posted online in a centralized, searchable  database, as well as on a Federal agency's websites.   The bill also would require the Office of Management and Budget to  maintain and regularly update a public list of agencies expected to  submit congressional budget justifications, the date they are submitted  to Congress, and when they are posted online.   This bill is identical to one that passed the House under suspension  in the last Congress.   As a member of the Budget Committee, I applaud this progovernment  budget transparency legislation because it will make sure that the  people we represent know and understand how each agency is spending  taxpayer dollars.   Budget transparency is important during ordinary time but is much  more important during extraordinary times like a global pandemic.   I am particularly focused on federal pandemic response that FEMA is  engaged in as it relates to the COVID-19 Pandemic.   Since the beginning of the pandemic, I have worked on community  access to testing and through this effort have opened over 40 testing  centers in and around Houston, Texas.   Now that there are vaccines it is time to pivot to vaccinations.   For this reason, I will be introducing a new bill that will address  vaccine delivery to every community across the nation.   Making FEMA the lead agency is the first step, the next important is  making sure the American people have access to information on how the  agency is accomplishing the task and at what cost.   My bill would establish: FEMA as the National Coordinator of vaccine  transport and delivery; Safe and effective supply chain transport,  delivery, and site use of vaccines; Broad Stakeholder Engagement; No  picking business winners or losers; and Implementing CDC COVID-19  Vaccine Recommendations.   FEMA will be empowered to:   Lead the effort for vaccine delivery from the receipt from  manufacturing facilities to delivery to designated inoculation sites  (hospital, clinic, doctors' offices, schools, places of worship,  community centers, parks, or neighborhood gathering locations, etc.)   Develop and deploy a fully staffed and resourced 24-7 advanced real- time tracking system that allows FEMA to monitor shipments of vaccine  units that can provide end-to-end transparency on the temperature,  real-  [[Page H66]]  time location, origin, and destination data, anticipated time of  arrival, and update recipients on the progress of their delivery and  report on changes that may impact expected delivery or the viability of  the vaccine while in transit;   Provide an advanced communication system that allows public health  departments to communicate their vaccine readiness, their capability of  receiving vaccines, delivery locations, details of facility capability  of storing, securing, personnel authorized to receive deliveries,  logistics for delivering vaccines to patients, report on vaccine  receipts, condition of vaccines, patient reactions, and feedback on how  to improve the process;   Design custom Apps for use by public health agencies, doctors'  offices, etc. to be provided to patients to communicate information on  the vaccine being received and the date and location of a second dose  if required. The App should generate a token that corresponds to their  vaccination record to ensure that the right vaccine is administered  should a second inoculation be required and to ensure that a person is  not vaccinated with different vaccines, additional information such as  vaccine effectiveness period may be addressed as more is learned about  this;   Secure transportation for delivery or use of vaccines, and, when  requested, security for the vaccine delivery sites or inoculation  locations to ensure the life and safety of personnel and patients who  seek to provide or receive vaccinations are free of interference or  threat;   Provide public education and patient engagement through the provision  of inoculations of persons in areas and locations where vulnerable  populations are under performing in getting vaccinations;   Waive authority of the states to share vaccination data with HHS;   Provide HHS with the capacity to manage the inoculations data on  persons and tracking the second vaccination to ensure full immunity and  to determine when enough vaccinations have been administered to unique  persons to achieve herd immunity. HHS shall protect Vaccination Data as  HIPAA protected data, and under the Privacy Act, which shall not allow  a waiver of any provision of that law; and the Freedom of Information  Act shall not apply to the records maintained.   Provide civil fines of up to $10,000 per violation, per instance; and  criminal penalties of 5 years in prison for violation of this section;  or for the use of the information outside the specific purpose of the  data collection, which is to assure full inoculation of individuals;  and determination of local, state and national herd immunity goals  being achieved. Include a data retention limitation--all records shall  be destroyed after 5 years--Sunset this provision after 5 years.   Provide an ombudsman to support: public (tribal, territorial, state,  and local government); stakeholder input on the work being done;  provide advocacy and advice for those who elect not to be vaccinated;  and champion the privacy, civil liberty rights on behalf of the  American people.   Waive state laws regarding management of inoculation data;   Provide HHS with the capacity as evidenced by the agency's prior  experience in managing healthcare.gov, to manage the inoculations data  on persons; for the purpose of tracking the second vaccination to  ensure full immunity and the management of national inoculation goals.  The protection of inoculation medical information is provided by the:  Federal HIPAA medical information privacy law; the Privacy Act and  eliminate access to that information through the Freedom of Information  Act; and providing for civil and criminal penalties for access or use  of the information outside the specific purposes of the collection,  which are to ensure inoculations; and determination of progress in herd  immunity goals. Patient Inoculation Data retention limitation--all  medical records on inoculation of persons under this title shall be  destroyed after 5 years--Sunset this provision after 5 years.   Keep oversight Committees in the House and Senate, and the American  people informed through daily and weekly reporting requirements  comprising data the CDC determines to be relevant and have public  benefit in measuring and reporting on inoculation statistics;   Establish a stakeholder advisory board to support the collaboration  and cooperation of participants that shall include representatives  from, federal, state, and local governments, businesses, colleges,  universities, K-12 schools, hospitals, clinics, professional medical  associations. Others as deemed essential to the success of a national  vaccination program.   Lead government collaboration with Stakeholders in establishing  vaccine inoculation centers in locations that shall include: Stadiums;  Arenas; K-12 schools; Colleges and Universities; Places of Worship; and  Other locations determined to be conducive to reaching the greatest  number of person who are in need of inoculations.                               Empowering FEMA    FEMA will be empowered to engage all stakeholders and marshals the  resources of the federal government where needed to accomplish the  objectives.   FEMA employs about 20,000 people nationwide who are stationed in 10  regional offices and the Washington DC headquarters.   FEMA has the authority during times of emergency to leverage its  tremendous capacity to coordinate within the federal government, pull  federal agency personnel from agencies throughout the federal  government to make sure America is equipped and prepared to respond to  disasters.   I ask that my Colleagues join me in support of H.R. 22, and greater  accountability to the American public on what the federal government is  doing and the budget justification that supports expenditures.
