 Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer congressional recognition to  the Lake Tahoe Pizza Company to mark their 50-year anniversary in  business.   For over five decades, this family-run restaurant has survived many  challenges, including the Great Recession, a global pandemic, and the  recent California winter storms. Despite these challenges, all the hard  work and dedication the Touryan family has put into this restaurant has  made it into quite the success story.   John Touryan, the founder, embodies the spirit of the American Dream.  Mr. Touryan emigrated to the United States as a child. He began the  restaurant in the bay area as a recent college graduate with no  financial support, all while living in his Volkswagen bus.   After moving from the bay area to South Lake Tahoe in the late 1970s,  Mr. Touryan's new home became a great location for his restaurant. In  just 3 years, business was booming. In 1980, he had to move the  restaurant to another location within South Tahoe to keep up with the  pressing demand.   He grew a successful restaurant from the ground up and has kept it in  the family throughout. Now ownership of the restaurant has been passed  to his son, Brenon Touryan, and many, many members of the family have  all played an important role in the day-to-day operations of the  restaurant.   It is truly special to witness a family that works so collaboratively  and effectively together to run a thriving business, and it is  inspiring to see that business being passed on through the generations.   The Lake Tahoe Pizza Company serves as a local gathering place in the  Tahoe area and continues to contribute positively to the community. The  restaurant has received both local and national recognition, including  selection as the Best of Tahoe more than a dozen times through popular  vote, and awarded the Best of Tahoe Pizza by the Tahoe Quarterly  magazine, a feature on the Travel Channel's ``Best Places I Have Ever  Been'' in an episode titled Pizza, and it was filmed by Discovery  Channel's Monster Garage.   On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I am honored  to acknowledge the Lake Tahoe Pizza Company for reaching this  significant milestone, as well as for their invaluable contributions to  our State and local economies and outstanding dedication to the Tahoe  community.            Annastasia Maloney Exhibits Bravery and Winning Spirit     Mr. Speaker, I rise to offer congressional recognition to  Annastasia Maloney, an athlete from Grass Valley, California, who will  travel to Germany this summer to compete in the 2023 Special Olympics  World Summer Games.   Ms. Maloney is a tremendously talented athlete who plays basketball,  softball, soccer, and flag football. She has also competed in throwing  the mini javelin, but running is her main event. She has won gold and  bronze medals in the 400- and 800-meters in track and field  competitions in both local and national Special Olympics. This will be  her first World Olympics.   The Special Olympics World Games offer the opportunity to unite the  world like no other event can, where people of different nations,  cultures, political views, and religions are brought together through  the power of sport.   Eunice Kennedy Shriver founded the Special Olympics in 1968 because  she believed that everyone, regardless of physical or intellectual  ability, can realize their potential for growth through sports and  competition.   In addition to working full time and adhering to a daily training  schedule, Maloney is a global messenger for the Special Olympics. This  summer her message of persistence and excellence will be conveyed from  the global stage, where she will compete according to the oath sworn by  every athlete since the Games' inception: ``Let me win; but if I cannot  win, let me be brave in the attempt.''   Maloney has undoubtedly already demonstrated her bravery and winning  spirit. I am confident the crowds in Berlin this summer will cheer for  Annastasia Maloney and the 7,000 Special Olympics athletes from 170  countries.   On behalf of the U.S. House of Representatives, I express admiration  and best wishes to Annastasia Maloney, Special Olympics USA, and all  the athletes in the Special Olympics World Summer Games.       Celebrating 75 Years of Auburn Area Recreation and Park District     Mr. Speaker, I rise to mark and celebrate the 75-year  anniversary of the Auburn Area Recreation and Park District.   When the district was originally formed on July 1, 1948, it had one  park aptly named Recreation Park and the use of the Gold Country  Fairgrounds. Today, the district proudly maintains and operates many  exceptional parks as well as open space and trail systems, recreation  programs, community events and facilities, such as community centers,  pools, and courts for sports, to name a few.   I had the pleasure of visiting last month and was very impressed with  their award-winning Auburn Bike Park and the ever-popular preschool  program. I even ended up planting a tree at Recreation Park and managed  to fit in a quick game of pickleball.   Such a bounty of recreational opportunities promotes the health and  quality of life of residents in the Auburn and Meadow Vista  communities. For over seven decades, the Auburn Area Recreation and  Park District has exhibited a strong commitment to providing safe,  quality, and accessible parks and recreational activities that are  enjoyed by all.   I wish to express gratitude and thanks on behalf of the Third  Congressional District of California for the Auburn Area Recreation and  Park District's service and dedication to enriching the greater Auburn  area with comprehensive recreational opportunities.            Andrea Seastrand's Legacy will Endure for Generations     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer congressional  recognition to a remarkable public servant, former Congresswoman Andrea  Seastrand, whose unwavering dedication to her constituents and tireless  commitment to public service have left an indelible mark on our  Nation's history.   Andrea Seastrand was born on August 5, 1941, in Chicago, Illinois.  She graduated from DePaul University with a BA in education, and moved  to Salinas, California, to find work as an elementary schoolteacher.  Before serving one term as a Member of the United States House of  Representatives, she served as a member of the California State  Assembly for 4 years, where she was part of the Assembly Education  Committee and served as assistant minority leader.   After her time in public service, she founded the California Space  Technology Alliance, a private nonprofit organization focused on  promoting California's participation in space ventures. She has also  served in leadership positions on local boards and civic groups focused  on fiscal responsibility and citizen involvement.   The career of former Congresswoman Andrea Seastrand is a testament to  the power of visionary leadership, dedicated public service, and a  profound commitment to serving with dedication and responsibility to  our fellow citizens.   Her contributions have shaped the aerospace industry in California,  protected taxpayers, and improved the  [[Page H2874]]  lives of countless Americans. The impact of her legacy will endure for  generations to come.   It is with the utmost respect and admiration that I commend her  exceptional service and numerous contributions to our State and Nation.                   Casa Diablo IV Groundbreaking Investment     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a groundbreaking  investment in renewable energy development in my district, the Casa  Diablo IV geothermal plant.   The Mammoth Geothermal Complex, located just outside of Mammoth  Lakes, California, has been powering Inyo and Mono Counties since 1984.  A new geothermal facility has recently been added to the existing three  facilities of the complex.   With the addition of the Casa Diablo IV plant, the total generation  for the complex will double and produce enough energy to power 45,000  homes.   Geothermal energy harnesses the power contained in the fluids and  heat from the Earth's core to produce clean energy for our communities  while producing zero nitrogen oxide emissions, virtually no carbon  dioxide emissions, and presenting low visual and noise impacts.   I commend the owners and operators of the complex, Mammoth Pacific  Geothermal and Ormat Technologies for their leadership in this  industry, their dedication to promoting clean, renewable energy  resources, and their meaningful contributions to the Mammoth community  through their support of local projects, scholarship programs, and  housing assistance.   I also applaud the Inyo National Forest for their close partnership  and collaboration on this important project.   On behalf of the United States House of Representatives and the Third  Congressional District of California, I am pleased to celebrate today  on the House floor this valuable addition to the Mammoth Geothermal  Complex.                 Honoring the Service of Dr. John A. Ungersma     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a truly outstanding  individual in my district, Dr. John A. Ungersma for his heroic and  invaluable service to our Nation and community.   Dr. Ungersma earned his bachelor of arts degree from Stanford  University and his medical degree from the University of Southern  California. He used his education and experience to serve our Nation in  the United States military as a naval flight surgeon and senior surgeon  in the 1st Marine Division. He also served with honor in both Desert  Shield and Desert Storm and ended his 48 years of service as a captain  of the Medical Corps in the United States Navy.   Dr. Ungersma established the first orthopedic surgery practice in  Bishop, California, in 1966. He was the only orthopedic surgeon on the  Highway 395 corridor between Los Angeles and Reno for almost a decade.   Dr. Ungersma additionally served for 18 years on the Northern Inyo  Hospital Board of Directors as president, vice president, and director  at large. During his tenure, he was active in the planning, financing,  and construction of a new 25-bed critical access hospital, which became  one of only 28 critical access hospitals in California. He also served  as vice president and treasurer of the Association of California  Healthcare Districts and was named the Association's trustee of the  year in 2015.   Dr. Ungersma has touched countless lives, and his contributions have  made a meaningful and lasting impact on the healthcare industry.   On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I am honored  to recognize Dr. John A. Ungersma for his leadership and the years of  service he has provided to the people of Inyo County, the State of  California, and the United States of America.                         Julie Su Nomination Stalled     Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to discuss a  hearing that was held last week by the House Education and the  Workforce Committee where Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Su testified  as a witness.   Now, as background, Ms. Su, of course, has been nominated by  President Biden to be Secretary of Labor. She has been in that role in  only an acting capacity now for several months, and the nomination has  been stalled for those months.   In fact, the Biden administration, as being reported by Bloomberg,  has now set up a nightly war room to try to advance Su's nomination,  but there is a reason that the nomination has remained stalled, and  that is because she is exactly the wrong person for the job.    The testimony she gave at last week's hearing before the Education  and the Workforce Committee was evasive, nonresponsive, and in some  cases outright dishonest in a way that provided further confirmation  that she should not be the next Secretary of Labor of the United  States.   For starters, the hearing almost didn't happen because Acting  Secretary Su tried to cancel at the last moment. Chair Virginia Foxx  began the hearing as follows: She said to Ms. Su: `` . . . you have  been a hard witness to schedule. The committee began working with the  Department to secure your in-person testimony beginning in March. When  you would not appear in May, we honored your request to appear in June,  using a date, June 7, that was offered by your staff and to which you  agreed.''   Chair Foxx continued: ``So why is it that on a late Friday evening,  following the committee's public posting of the hearing a week ago,  your staff told us that you were `no longer able to make June 7th  work?' ''   The only reason Acting Secretary Su did appear before the committee  is that the committee was going to resort to a subpoena to get her  there otherwise.   That was the first major issue with Ms. Su's performance at this  hearing, but there were several others.   First, was her response on the topic of Proposition 22, which was a  major labor initiative passed by California voters less than 3 years  ago, in 2020. Now, Ms. Su was California's secretary of labor at the  time. She would have been substantially affected by whether this  initiative passed or failed. It ended up passing. California voters  overwhelmingly chose to allow companies like Uber and Lyft and Door  Dash to continue to use independent contractors, and thereby allowing  them to stay in California.   When I asked Ms. Su how she, herself, voted as a California voter on  Prop 22, she answered as follows: ``How did I vote on Prop 22? I don't  remember how I voted on that.''   Now, Mr. Speaker, this utterly exceeds all bounds of plausibility,  that the secretary of labor for our State would not remember how she  voted on this major labor initiative less than 3 years ago. I think it  is fairly safe to conclude that this was a false statement that Ms. Su  made to our committee.   Just to be fair, I gave her several opportunities to correct her  statement on that later in the hearing, and she still did not retract  it. That is her testimony on the record, that she does not remember how  she voted on this major labor initiative while she was California's  secretary of labor.   Second, was her testimony with respect to AB5. Now, AB5 is a law that  has made it virtually impossible for countless professionals in  California to continue their careers. It has essentially abolished  independent contracting in hundreds of professions and has been widely  condemned across the partisan spectrum.   Now, Ms. Su has been called an architect of that law, AB5. As  California's secretary of labor, she was the one who enforced it, and  she did so in the most aggressive, ruthless, broadest way possible to  ensnare as many people as possible.   After the law passed, she was on the record celebrating its passage,  so you would think she would have a pretty good answer when I asked her  whether she thought AB5 was a good law. However, after I asked that,  here is what she said: ``I don't know what--I mean, I don't know. I  don't know. Tell me what--give me a little bit more on what you mean by  that.''                                time  2045    I took several other opportunities to ask her whether she thought AB5  was a good law. Each and every time she refused to answer.   I also asked Ms. Su whether she was involved in the drafting of AB5,  and she responded simply no. However, she then contradicted herself  later in the hearing when my colleague, Mr. Burlison, asked her about  her involvement. She said that, oh, yes, she did, in fact, provide  technical assistance.  [[Page H2875]]    When I asked Ms. Su whether she was aware that people have lost their  livelihoods in California because of this law AB5, she said: I have  heard from people who have said that.   She reiterated that exact language again: I have heard from people  who said that. I have heard people who said something different too. I  have had people tell me that. She responded, refusing each time to  recognize the legitimacy of these claims, refusing to recognize that we  have had countless people who have lost their livelihoods in  California.   Also, it was no less than 2 days after that hearing that we got yet  another example of this when the city of Los Angeles announced that it  was having to terminate a contract with almost 100 truckers for a road  repair program that had been around for about 130 years and the  Department of Public Works in the city of Los Angeles specifically  cited AB5 as the reason it was canceling that contract.   There are countless examples like this, and yet the most that Ms. Su  is willing to say is: I have heard from people who have said that.   Next, I asked Ms. Su about her role with the massive $32 billion, at  a minimum, unemployment fraud that occurred in California on her watch.  I asked her several times: Do you take any responsibility for that  fraud?   She evaded the question several times before finally saying: Yes. I  do take responsibility to the fact the system did not deliver in ways  that we would have hoped that it delivered.   I then asked her several times what she would have done differently,  what she has learned if she could do it all over again, and she could  not name a single thing that she would have done differently to prevent  this $32 billion unemployment fraud, even though the independent State  auditor and the leading Democrat lawmakers in California have blamed  her specifically for the fraud.   I also asked Ms. Su about the migrant child labor crisis that has  been uncovered by The New York Times, and I asked her whether she had  communicated the scale of this problem to the White House prior to this  year. Her response was: I don't know. I don't know that.   I, along with several other members of the committee, asked Ms. Su if  she would commit to not changing the joint-employer rule or bringing a  new joint-employer rule that would threaten the entire franchise  business model.   She was evasive each and every time and would give no such  commitment. She made comments such as: We do not have a plan to do  that. It is not on our agenda.   She also said: I commit to following all of the rules of rulemaking,  everything that we are required to do, I pledge to you that we will do  under my leadership, under my tenure at the Department of Labor. I  can't sit here at this moment and tell you with certainty everything  that is going to happen.   Again, we tried several times, myself and several members of the  committee. She would not commit to not bring a new joint-employer rule.   Finally, I asked Ms. Su about the economic performance of her home  State, California, where she was the Secretary of Labor for Governor  Gavin Newsom and was the labor commissioner for several years before  that. I asked Ms. Su if she knew where California ranks among the  States when it comes to its unemployment rank. She did not know.   The answer is that California has the second highest unemployment  rate in the Nation. I asked Acting Secretary Su if she happened to know  which State has the highest poverty rate in the country. She didn't  know. The answer, once again, is California.   I asked Acting Secretary Su if she knew which State has the lowest  rate of net earnings growth of any of the 50 States. She didn't know  that either and, once again, the answer is her home State of California  where she was the Secretary of Labor.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is clear, based on Acting Secretary Su's  record, that she is not the right person for this role. She is not the  right person for the highest labor position in the land, in our  country, at this moment of such great importance for the American  economy and American workforce.   I will, once again, encourage President Biden to withdraw her  nomination and to nominate a secretary who will be on the side of  American workers.   Mr. Speaker, I will take a moment to offer a little bit of background  on the individual that President Biden is planning to appoint as the  new director of the CDC. It is being widely reported that he will name  Dr. Mandy Cohen of North Carolina to this post.   Now, interestingly, the position of CDC director will soon be a  Senate-confirmed position starting in 2025, based upon legislation  passed last year. It was recognized that this is a position of such  great importance that during the COVID era was so relevant to the lives  of so many people that it should be a Senate-confirmed position.  However, that provision has not taken effect yet, so if President Biden  does, in fact, move forward with this appointment, as has been  reported, then there will be no opportunity for her to be vetted.   With the appointment not yet official, this really is the one  opportunity that Americans have to weigh in on whether this is the  right person for the job.   We need to recognize that there is a huge gap in the level of trust  that Americans have in our entire public health establishment, based on  many of the things that have happened in the last few years.   I will actually point to a comment from the CEO of Facebook, or Meta,  as it is now called, Mark Zuckerberg, just a couple weeks ago. Mr.  Zuckerberg said this: ``Just take some of the stuff around COVID  earlier on in the pandemic, where there were real health implications,  but there hadn't been time to fully vet a bunch of the scientific  assumptions and, unfortunately, I think a lot of the establishment on  that kind of waffled on a bunch of facts and asked for a bunch of  things to be censored that, in retrospect, ended up being more  debatable or true. And that stuff,'' Mr. Zuckerberg continued, ``is  really tough, right? It really undermines trust.''    We are learning more and more about the role that the CDC and  government authorities played in those efforts to censor certain facts  or opinions related to COVID-19, many of which, in the words of Mr.  Zuckerberg, ``ended up being more debatable or true.''   We also saw in the CDC, throughout the COVID era, take truly radical  positions, such as recommending masks for children as young as 2 years  old. This defied the international consensus. It was not what the WHO  recommended. It was not what the European counterpart of the CDC  recommended, yet it was the CDC's position.   We also saw how the CDC apparently changed its school reopening  guidance in February 2021 after pressure from teachers' unions. Texts  between the outgoing director of the CDC, Ms. Walensky, and Randi  Weingarten have been uncovered showing this level of coordination and  how the guidance was, apparently, revised based on input or pressure  from the unions.   This, of course, is not a role, head of a teachers' union, that is  selected for based upon one's scientific credentials, yet apparently  played an important role in guidance that was then used to keep many,  many schools across our country closed and to deprive millions of kids  of the education that they deserve.   We also had time and again the CDC make statements on issues like the  transmissibility of COVID for vaccinated individuals that turned out to  be incorrect. We saw vaccine mandates struck down by the courts as  unconstitutional.   With all that as background, let's turn to the question of whether  Dr. Mandy Cohen of North Carolina is the right person to restore trust  in our public health system, and I would say, based upon her record,  she absolutely is not the right person. Indeed, she manifested the very  worst tendencies of the COVID era.   Let's start with the method she used for shutting down the economy in  her own State. Now, I will first give you her words when she described  it. She said: Our scientific team, in coordination with looking at  recommendations for the Centers for Disease Control and others, and  really understanding, again, what we have learned this year about how  this virus spreads. We know that there are settings and activities  [[Page H2876]]  that are lower risk. It doesn't mean that they are no risk, but lower  risks. We know there are things that are medium risk, things that are  higher risks, and so forth.   So you would think this is a very considered process that she went  through. However, feedback from others in her State suggested the  opposite.   Dale Folwell, who was the North Carolina State treasurer, said: I  tried for months during COVID to get the council of State to convene  with Dr. Cohen to explain the lack of transparency in the data used to  shut down our economy and our schools. These decisions  disproportionately hurt lower- and fixed-income adults and kids. By  closing schools and the economy, it closed opportunity and upward  mobility for students and citizens. The damage, he said, is  generational.   That is how another Statewide elected official in North Carolina  described the level of transparency and the implications during the  COVID era, but what is even more revealing is comments that Dr. Cohen  recently made herself.   In contrast to the more methodological approach that she claimed to  have followed, she made these comments in a 2022 interview with the  Duke Health Sector Management. When asked how she decided what to lock  down, what could remain open, what wouldn't, she said: So I would call  probably the person I called most was the Secretary of Health and Human  Services in Massachusetts.   Dr. Cohen went on: When she was, like, are you gonna let them have  professional football? And I was, like, nope. And she's, like, okay,  neither are we. Neither are we.   At this point, Dr. Cohen laughs at this.   She goes on: So it was, you know, conversations like that, so or I'd  be, like, when are you gonna think about lightening up on masks?  They're, like, next Monday, and I'm, like, okay, next Monday.   See, this is what we all suspected was happening in many of these  States that seemed to have no rhyme or reason to the way they went  about these lockdown and reopening policies.   Here, you have President Biden's own presumptive nominee to be the  CDC director saying, yes, that is exactly what she did. In a flippant  and arbitrary manner, she decided what industries would be shut down  and which would remain open, as well as what would be mandated and what  wouldn't.   In addition to that, Dr. Cohen adopted many policies that were on the  extreme end of the spectrum when it came to COVID mandates. For  example, on July 26, 2021, she said: Schools with students in K-8  should require all children and staff to wear masks indoors, regardless  of vaccination status.   Now, we have already seen this was a position that is at odds with  the international norm. She also repeated claims that turned out to be  false with regard to transmissibility. She said in a 2021 interview  with the Carolina Business review: What we heard from the CDC last week  was even better than what we heard before, right. We had heard that  vaccines protect you from getting COVID. I think the new piece of  information for us was that we now have more definitive data to show  that it prevents you from giving COVID to others. And that is really  where masks come in, right, a mask is about protecting you from giving  COVID to others even if you don't know you have it.   She also promoted masks for vaccinated individuals 7 months after the  CDC dropped its mask requirement for vaccinated individuals. She said:  We still need to mask--everyone. This was during a December 20 news  briefing. Even if you are vaccinated, she said, you should wear a mask  in public, indoor spaces, and if possible, wear a medical grade mask  for more protection. This was in December 2021.    In addition to that, Ms. Cohen threatened to sue a school district,  Union County School Board, for their decision to drop contact tracing  and quarantine processes in September 2021. The dispute came after  Union County Health Department officials would not work with the  district on reducing quarantine times if students presented a negative  test or other mitigation measures were used.   In other words, they were trying to get their kids back to school.  School officials made this request to minimize the impact a quarantine  has on students and their families; the Union County Public School's  statement reads: Local health officials would not consider this request  despite the fact that health officials around the State have  implemented similar measures. The district also refuted Cohen's claims  about infections in their district using her own agency's data.   Dr. Cohen also strongly supported vaccine mandates for healthcare  workers. In July 2021, she said: Thank you to the North Carolina  Healthcare Association and the health systems that are leading the way  requiring vaccination for employees, for taking action to protect the  healthcare workforce, their parents, our communities and the State.  Vaccinations are our way out of this pandemic, she concluded.   Dr. Cohen also wore a double mask at an event in January 2021, and  even posted a photo of herself wearing a mask with Dr. Fauci's picture  on it.   Mr. Speaker, while this is not an appointment that will be subject to  a vote in either House, I would simply encourage President Biden to  acknowledge the lack of trust that exists right now in many parts of  this country, with even Mark Zuckerberg saying that we had public  health decisions that undermined public trust, and to instead appoint a  CDC Director who will actually adhere to science, who will adhere to  norms, and who will not take us down this road ever again.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
