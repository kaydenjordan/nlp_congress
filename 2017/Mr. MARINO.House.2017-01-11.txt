 I thank the chairman.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 5, the Regulatory  Accountability Act.   This bill represents a monumental opportunity for the American  people. After 8 years of one new crushing regulatory burden after  another, the time has come to finally free the American people and  create a new future for our economy.   In 2017, regulatory burdens are at record levels. One recent analysis  by the American Action Forum puts the cumulative paperwork burden on  the American people at 11.5 billion hours.   How could any small business person or entrepreneur survive in the  face of this monstrous web of regulation?   The short answer is that they cannot.   It is a fact seen across my district as I have talked to workers  covering every industry or occupation imaginable. When I ask  businessowners about their concerns, first and foremost, the greatest  hardship they face is the burden of Federal regulation and red tape.  Funds, which otherwise could be invested in new employees, training, or  equipment, must be dedicated to the demands of faceless bureaucrats in  D.C. This applies to plumbers as well as to farmers, manufacturers to  home builders. The list of those affected is long and varied.   The simple truth is that the Obama administration's one-size-fits-all  regulatory agenda has been a disaster for the American Dream, and we  have seen over the past several months how disconnected it was from the  wants and needs of Americans across the country.   In Congress, however, we have heard their pleas and have taken action  in the early days of the 115th Congress. H.R. 5 is the third regulatory  reform bill we have considered in 2 weeks. It represents our brightest  opportunity to unleash innovation and investment so that American  businesses, big and small, can create new futures.    I am also grateful that H.R. 5 includes my bill, the REVIEW Act. The  REVIEW Act was featured as part of Speaker Ryan's A Better Way agenda  and passed the House on a bipartisan basis last fall. It represents a  simple premise: regulations should be narrowly tailored, and massive  regulations deserve full and thorough scrutiny.   The REVIEW Act would mandate a stay of any high-impact, billion- dollar regulation while judicial review is underway. Historically,  billion-dollar rules have been few and far between. In fact, only 26  have been put in place since 2006; but, in recent years, their  frequency has grown along with the unprecedented reach of the  regulatory state. In the past 8 years, an average of three per year  have been put in place.   Their significance, however, lies in their impact on our country.  These regulations are massive and have the potential to fundamentally  and irreversibly change entire industries. If, later, judicial review  finds the agency's reasoning to be legally unsound or contrary to the  intent of Congress, the  [[Page H330]]  compliance costs incurred--often meaning jobs that were lost--cannot be  undone. The REVIEW Act provides an important check on regulatory  largesse and is an important piece of this bill.   The American people have spoken, and they have spoken clearly. It is  time for us all to take our country and the economy in the right  direction. The Regulatory Accountability Act provides the reforms that  are necessary to get us there.   I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, the gentlewoman's amendment would strike from  the bill the Separation of Powers Restoration Act and the core judicial  review provisions of the Regulatory Accountability Act. The resulting  legislation, rather than restore an adequate framework of checks and  balances against agency overreach and abuse, would perpetrate and  perpetuate features among the worst of our current, runaway regulatory  system. We cannot complete true regulatory reform without restoring to  the judicial branch the vigorous powers of judicial review the  amendment would strike.   In addition, the bill would exclude from title I's critical  rulemaking reforms all rules to reduce the incidence of cancer,  premature mortality, asthma attacks, and respiratory diseases in  children and seniors.   All of us support the reduction of morbidity and mortality among  children and seniors. Rules to advance these goals, done properly,  contribute substantially to our Nation's health and well-being, but the  bill does nothing to frustrate the effective achievement of those  goals. It simply assures the agencies issuing these types of rules--and  all agency rulemaking in general--will avoid unnecessary and  overreaching regulation and issue smarter, less costly regulation and  guidance when necessary.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I believe in the Constitution just like  everyone else does, and primarily we, as congressmen and congresswomen,  have  [[Page H356]]  a responsibility to make the laws, not unelected bureaucrats who have  no experience in a lot of the areas where they are making these laws.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Like the previous amendment, the gentleman's amendment  would strike from the bill the Separation of Powers Restoration Act and  core judicial review provisions of the Regulatory Accountability Act.  Faced with a runaway administrative state, we must not gut the bill's  crucial reinforcements of judicial checks and balances against agency  overreach and abuse. For this reason alone, the amendment should be  rejected.   In addition, the bill would exclude from title I's long-needed  rulemaking reforms numerous types of food safety regulations. All of us  support food safety. But the bill does nothing to frustrate the  protection of food safety. In fact, it clearly calls upon regulatory  agencies to achieve their statutory objectives in this and all areas.  Beyond that, it simply ensures that agency rulemaking will avoid  unnecessary and overreaching regulations and produce smarter, less  costly regulation and guidance when necessary.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I respectfully disagree with my friend and  NATO member. We have traveled together.   A lot of the delay now is because of the agencies and how long they  take to make decisions. With the premise behind our bills combined,  agencies come  [[Page H357]]  up with an idea that they think will improve the quality of life, and  that is what they should be doing. But then they immediately send it to  us in the House, in Congress, and then we make the determination as to  whether it is good law or it is bad law and apply it that way. We  certainly have the time in the House, and I am sure the Senate has the  time, too, to address these matters quickly and not delay it as long as  the agency has been delaying making rules.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    This amendment would strike from the bill the Separation  of Powers Restoration Act and the essential judicial review provisions  of the Regulatory Accountability Act. It, too, should be rejected for  those reasons.   In addition, the bill would exclude from title I's rulemakings  reforms numerous types of rule related to employment and wages. But  once again, the bill does nothing to prevent good rules in these areas.  On the contrary, it would produce better rules, rules that are smarter  and less costly, freeing resources for job creation and higher wages. I  urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I simply would add that I ask my colleagues to  oppose this amendment.   As far as the jobs increase, or lack thereof, that my colleague  speaks of, we have had the slowest growth rate in jobs in the history  of this country. There are millions of people that are unemployed that  are not seeking unemployment benefits, and they are not taken into  consideration in the unemployment rate because it is much higher than  it is; and the mean family income is at a low as far back as 14 years  ago.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.    Well, first of all, I would certainly enjoy working on  job growth with the gentlewoman. We have worked on issues in the past.   But the gentlewoman forgets about the technology that has created  jobs. People have to write those programs. People have to build that  hardware. They have to come up with very intense, very intricate ways  to make the machinery, continue updating the software. My daughter is a  software major in college, and the jobs there are abundantly available.   So the jobs are there, but what I am hearing from people in my  district and across the country is the regulations that have been  imposed, not only by this administration but other administrations as  well, are crushing particularly our small businesses.   So if we can step back and eliminate these job-crushing regulations  and take into consideration the economics involved, we are going to  create more jobs, we are going to protect people, and we are going to  protect the health of people.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, like other carve-out amendments just  offered, this amendment would strike from the bill the Separation of  Powers Restoration Act and the essential judicial review protections of  the Regulatory Accountability Act. It should be rejected. We should not  be settling for weak judicial review that produces rubber stamps of  agency action. We should be voting for the strong judicial review  reform in the bill that prevents judicial rubber stamps.   Beyond that, the bill would exclude from title I's rulemaking reforms  children's toys and product safety rules. But again, the bill does  nothing to prevent good rules in these areas. It will produce better  rules, rules that are smarter and less costly, freeing resources for  job creation and higher wages. Smarter rules are precisely what we need  to protect children's health and safety, and more jobs and higher wages  are what are needed to help families provide for their children.  [[Page H359]]    I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, respectfully, the gentleman does not have  the market cornered on worrying about the safety of our children. I  think anybody in this room who has children has just as much concern  for our children.   What his amendment does is gut--it guts--regulations, and what our  amendments do--and the way we should be handling these as Congress  making any laws--will improve the quality of life and improve the  protections.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I certainly respect what my friend on the  other side of the aisle has to say, but, again, I respectfully  disagree.   Once again, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would strike  from the bill the Separation of Powers Restoration Act and the  essential judicial review provisions of the Regulatory Accountability  Act. That would have but one effect: to preserve the freedom to run  riot that Washington bureaucrats have enjoyed for decades  [[Page H360]]  as they have racked up roughly $2 trillion in regulatory burdens on the  American people.   The amendment also would exclude from title I's rulemaking reforms  workplace safety rules issued by OSHA or the Mine Safety and Health  Administration to reduce traumatic injury, cancer, or lung disease.   I would urge my colleagues to read the bill and listen more closely.  The bill does nothing to prevent good rules in these areas. It will  produce better rules, smarter rules, less costly rules. That will free  up resources for desperately needed job creation, meaning more workers  will have more safe workplaces in which to earn a living.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                time  1700     Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, one last time, my colleagues on the other side  of the aisle would strike from the bill the Separation of Powers  Restoration Act and the judicial review provisions of the Regulatory  Accountability Act. One last time, that attempt should be rejected.  [[Page H361]]    We need a strong judiciary, not a supine one, to stand up to agency  overreach and abuse and protect the liberty and property of the America  from the long hands of Washington's restless bureaucrats.   The amendment also would exclude from title I's rulemaking reforms  rules issued under the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st  Century Act. Chemical safety is important to all of us. Congress worked  hard on chemical safety legislation. But it is smarter regulations,  supported by sounder science, at less cost that will best produce  chemical safety under that act. That is precisely the kind of  regulation that will happen once the 21st century rulemaking reforms in  the Regulatory Accountability Act become law.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to  recommit.    Mr. Speaker, this bill's bold reforms deliver the heart  of the regulatory reform this Nation desperately needs; and I cannot  overstate how desperately we need it because, after 8 years of the  Obama administration's blowout administrative state, what do we have?   We have an economy that for 8 straight years has failed to produce  enough good, new, full-time jobs to sustain growth and restore dignity  to the unemployed. We have 92 million Americans outside the workforce,  a level not seen since the Carter years. We have nearly $2 trillion of  American wealth commandeered each year to be spent as Washington  bureaucrats demand, through runaway regulation--$2 trillion. This is  more money than the GDP of all but eight countries in the world.   We do not need a regulatory state that is that size; we need a  regulatory system that is cut down to size. And lest we ever forget, we  need a regulatory system that never again allows  [[Page H371]]  a runaway executive branch to do what the Obama administration did: use  a pen and a phone to undertake an end run around Congress and force on  the American people job-crushing policies that their elected  representatives in Congress never supported.   This motion to recommit turns a blind eye to all of that. It says to  the runaway administrative state: Keep on running as fast as you can;  we don't care. It says to the American people: Sit down and be quiet.  Washington bureaucrats are your betters, and you need to just keep  doing what they tell you to do.   Well, the hardworking taxpayers have spoken and yanked the boots of  unelected bureaucrats off the throats of hardworking Americans. Enough  is enough. Support this bill. Reject this motion to recommit. Show the  American people that they come first, not bureaucrats in Washington.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
