 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   What is the difference between us and them that was just on full  display?   We care about everyday Americans. They don't.   We make life better for everyday Americans. They don't.   We get things done for everyday Americans, and they don't.   Insulin is a drug that is lifesaving and life-sustaining. It has been  around for more than 100 years. It is off patent. There are no research  and development costs associated with it.   Yet so many Americans pay approximately $4,000 a year for insulin.  That is unacceptable, un-American, and unconscionable. And that is why  Democrats are doing something about it.    The Affordable Insulin Now Act will lower out-of-pocket costs to $35  per month. That is not fiction. That is fact. That is not hyperbole.  That is help that is game-changing for everyday Americans. Once again,  Democrats deliver for the people.
