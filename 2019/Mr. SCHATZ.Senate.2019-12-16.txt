 Mr. President, 90 years ago, Inter-Island Airways  launched the first scheduled commercial passenger air service in  Hawaii. Now known as Hawaiian Airlines, it is our State's largest and  longest serving airline. Its fleet of 67 aircrafts flies between our  islands and connects Hawaii to the mainland and around the world.   As a State comprised of islands, safe, reliable air service is  critical to the movement of people and goods. Whether it is  transporting people and cargo for leisure, medical appointments,  business, cultural and sports events or carrying fresh produce,  equipment, or other supplies, Hawaiian has and will continue to be a  major part of our highways in the sky.   From its modest beginnings--a $3-per-person sightseeing tour on a  five-passenger plane--Hawaiian transported 11.8 million passengers and  92,000 tons of cargo last year alone. Today, Hawaiian is one of the  largest employers in the State, with more than 7,300 employees across  its network, including some 6,600 who live in Hawaii.   Its impact is felt beyond jobs. Every year, Hawaiian and its  employees partner with and help support hundreds of nonprofit  organizations. As one example, Hawaiian leads a mentorship program that  promotes aviation careers and provides students with hands-on learning  about all aspects of the industry.   I am particularly proud of the steps Hawaiian has taken to adopt eco- friendlier practices throughout its operations to improve fuel  efficiency, reduce carbon emissions, and cut waste. In 2018, despite  continuing to grow, Hawaiian lowered annual jet fuel burn by 7 million  gallons and reduced annual carbon output by 86,300 metric tons. It is  also contributing toward climate research by collecting air samples  over the Pacific Ocean. The data is used as part of an international  effort to measure climate change and air quality.   On behalf of the Hawaii congressional delegation, I wish to  congratulate Hawaiian Airlines on its 90th anniversary and wish them  continued success in serving the travel needs of our residents and  introducing Hawaii to the world.                            ____________________
