 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge all  American citizens to complete the 2020 Census. The Census is an  incredibly important tool that impacts our daily lives more than many  people realize.   Many important decisions impacting Federal support for education,  healthcare, transportation and infrastructure, and more will depend  upon data the Census provides. The more people who participate, the  more accurate the Census will reflect the needs of our communities.   Census takers have been working hard, going door-to-door to ensure  everyone is counted. If you haven't been visited by a Census taker, it  is easy to complete online. Go to my2020census.gov to make sure you and  your family are counted. Completing the Census is easy, quick, secure,  and very important. You can also respond by phone by calling 844-330- 2020.   The last day to complete the 2020 Census is tomorrow, Wednesday,  September 30. I can't stress the importance of the Census enough, and I  encourage every American household to ensure they are counted.  [[Page H4966]]                                ____________________
