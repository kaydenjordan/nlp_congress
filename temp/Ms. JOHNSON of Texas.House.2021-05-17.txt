 Madam Speaker, the Tulsa-Greenwood Massacre was  a mass killing targeting Black Americans in one of the prosperous Black  communities in the country. As we approach its 100th anniversary, we  must reflect on the events and beliefs that led to those fateful days  in late May of 1921, its place in our nation's history, and its lasting  impacts on the Black community.   Founded and built by former slaves, freed by the ratification of the  13th amendment, the Greenwood District was a true testament to the  American Dream. The district was defined by its entrepreneurial spirit  and success and offered newly-freed men and women the chance to make a  name for themselves and their families.   But their success was being followed closely by those who wished  otherwise--those who were looking for any opportunity to materialize  their resent. And in the face of baseless allegations of a crime  committed by a Black man, that hatred resulted in what is now known as  the Tulsa Race Massacre. The massacre resulted in the deaths of over  300 Black men, women, and children and left around 9,000 more without  homes or a source of income--not to mention the immeasurable impact  left on generations of Black Americans.   As Members of Congress, we stand here in the Capitol of the United  States, itself built by slaves who are largely forgotten, with a unique  opportunity to take action. That is why I am proud to be a cosponsor of  Congresswoman Jackson Lee and Senator Warren's resolution to recognize  the forthcoming centennial of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre and  condemning past and present efforts to downplay its significance. It is  critical that Congress take this step not only to honor the lives and  legacies of those lost but also to encourage education about the  massacre and the role white supremacy played in its inception.   Madam Speaker, today we recommit ourselves to fight the ever-present  racism and unjust violence against Black Americans. We do so on the  shoulders of those that came, fought, and suffered before us in the  hope that one day the American Dream is accessible to all--regardless  of race.                            ____________________
