 Mr. Speaker, the new market tax credits have  helped inject new economic viability into my western New York  community. The program continues to help revitalize economically  distressed cities throughout America; in western New York, more than  $300 million in private investment in the past decade that would not  have occurred without the tax credit program.   Historically and architecturally significant buildings like the  Electric Tower and Asbury Hall in downtown Buffalo are buzzing with new  residential and commercial life. Most recently, Roswell Park Cancer  Institute, the Nation's first cancer center, opened their new clinical  sciences building with the help of the new market tax credit program.   I urge my colleagues to support my legislation to make the new market  tax credits permanent.                            ____________________
