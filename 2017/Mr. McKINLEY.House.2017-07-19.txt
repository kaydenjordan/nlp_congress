 Mr. Speaker, today I would like to recognize a little  known role model, Eli Borochov, a 22-year-old young man from  Cedarhurst, New York.   While on a trip to Israel with his family in 2015, Eli was praying  during a Shabbat service at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron. While  praying, Eli was targeted by a pair of Arab snipers and was shot twice  in the leg. Thankfully, after emergency surgery and a lengthy  rehabilitation, Eli has recovered.   After the terrorists were apprehended and put on trial, Eli was  called upon to speak in court, which meant he had to face his shooters  in person. While addressing the court, Eli displayed conviction and  character well beyond his years.   As Eli mentioned in his statement, the only reason he was targeted  was the fact that he was practicing his Jewish faith. I commend Eli for  standing tall in the face of violence and showing great courage. He is  a role model.                            ____________________
