 Mr. Chair, as the proud daughter of immigrants, the  wife of a Dreamer, the Representative of a district proud of its  immigrants and how they contribute to our economy, I am disgusted with  the Republicans' relentless persecution and scapegoating of immigrants.   While we should be looking for ways forward to keep providing  essential services for our districts, Republicans want to play games  with lives and livelihoods because of their inability to lead.    They are repeating false claims that the border is open and  conditioning government funding on dangerous and irresponsible requests  that will neither make the border more secure nor protect our security.   There is a dissonance between this party of fiscal responsibility  that is driving us to a shutdown while immigrants--supposedly our  economic downfall--are contributing more than $20.4 billion in taxes  just in Illinois.   With 11 million more immigrants ready to boost our economy through  needed pathways to work, it is time to leave the political theater  behind. People are tired of it. Let's recognize the positive fiscal  contributions of immigrants to our Nation and do the work our  constituents sent us here to do.
