 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   H.R. 497 authorizes a land exchange in California between the San  Bernardino Valley Conservation District and the Bureau of Land  Management. After 15 years, stakeholders have finalized the habitat  conservation plan for the Santa Ana River Wash that balances the needs  of endangered wildlife with regional economic development.   This is a stellar example of the Endangered Species Act at work, and  I commend Representative Cook for his work on this bill.   This land exchange is a key component of the Habitat Conservation  Plan and a win-win for all parties. It will help protect important  wildlife habitat while allowing the conservation district to increase  water storage capacity and direct mining activity into the appropriate  areas.   So again, this is exactly how the Endangered Species Act should work.  It is something we should all support. This is a good bill, and I urge  swift adoption by the House.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from California (Mr. Aguilar).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 220 would authorize an expansion of the existing  Terror Lake Hydropower project in Alaska to meet increased powder  demands from Kodiak Island.   The expansion would have to comply with environmental protections  required under the Federal Power Act and National Environmental Policy  Act.   This bill unanimously passed both the House Natural Resources  Committee and the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.   I want to thank Mr. Young for his persuasive presentation both in  committee and on the House floor. I fully support the sensible  bipartisan legislation and urge my colleagues to vote for it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as my friend, Mr. Cook, just pointed out, H.R. 1500  designates a small triangle of land in Washington, D.C., as Robert  Emmet Park. The parcel is home to a statue of Robert Emmet, a seminal  figure in Ireland's quest for independence. The bill also authorizes  the National Park Service, which manages the area, to add interpretive  displays and signage to the area.   Emmet admired the independence we achieved in this country and only  wanted the same freedom and liberty for his compatriots in Ireland.  Designating this small plot of land and the accompanying statue as  Robert Emmet Park will stand as a constant reminder of the call to  liberty and freedom that binds our Nation together.   I would like to thank my friend, Representative Crowley from New York  City, who is also a proud son of St. Patrick, for his work on this  bill, and I urge its swift passage.   Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Crowley).    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today, H.R. 1073, authorizes the  National Park Service to construct a visitor services facility that  includes a restroom at the U.S. Marine Corps Memorial, also known as  the Iwo Jima Memorial. The memorial is located in Arlington, Virginia,  adjacent to Arlington National Cemetery, and a short drive from the  Pentagon and from here.   This iconic statue of marines raising the flag over Iwo Jima is one  of the country's most recognized memorials--the most recognized  memorial in the whole world--and receives a tremendous amount of  visitation. Unfortunately, there are no permanent restroom facilities  at the site. It goes without saying that this is a major hurdle to  visitor comfort, especially given that this is a popular destination of  our veterans, not all of whom are able-bodied.   However, once this bill becomes law, the National Park Service will  be able  [[Page H5207]]  to construct a restroom with funds that have already been donated for  this purpose. This is in keeping with a broad policy of improving  accessibility of all the memorials on and around The National Mall.   This bill is a long time coming. I want to thank my bill cosponsors  for their support, Mr. Cook of California and Mr. Graves of Louisiana.   I understand that our good friends from the Park Service are watching  with excitement and pleasure this afternoon as we take this up on the  floor. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1135 reauthorizes the Historically Black Colleges  and Universities Historic Preservation program. This program provides  grants to revitalize and conserve historic structures at Historically  Black Colleges and Universities in Virginia.   I am very proud and grateful of the five HBCUs we have in Virginia:  Virginia State, Norfolk State, Hampton University, Virginia Union  University, and Virginia University of Lynchburg.   I point out that the Nation's first elected African-American  Governor, Douglas L. Wilder, was a graduate of Virginia Union  University.   Since the program was first authorized in 1988, as Mr. Cook has said,  there has been over $60 million in grants to help restore iconic  structures on many of these college campuses, and two-thirds of this  money appropriated has been leveraged to generate matching funds to  maximize the impacts of taxpayer dollars. But despite all the progress  made with respect to revitalizing these campuses, there is still a lot  of work that remains to be done in all 107 HBCUs.   Reauthorization and sustained support for this program is long  overdue. So I would like to thank my esteemed colleague from South  Carolina (Mr. Clyburn) for all of his hard work and relentlessness to  bring this bill to the attention of Congress.   I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this good bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn), the distinguished leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  North Carolina (Ms. Adams), a distinguished Member of Congress.    Mr. Speaker, how much time do I have remaining?   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia has 9\1/2\  minutes remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Alabama (Ms. Sewell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a graduate of the University  of Virginia School of Law.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the manager of this  legislation, the cosponsors, Mr. Clyburn, and so many others who have  been part of this historic legislation for their leadership on it.   Mr. Speaker, I rise as a member of the bipartisan Congressional HBCU  Caucus and as an original cosponsor of H.R. 1135.   H.R. 1135 would authorize the appropriation of millions of dollars  from 2018 through 2024 to the Historic Preservation Fund to provide  assistance for the restoration and preservation of historic structures  at Historically Black Colleges and Universities.   Let me indicate that this has been a long journey. The  reauthorization is very special and emotional to many of us. As many of  us know, Historically Black Colleges and Universities came at the wake  of the ending of slavery and were a place of refuge for so many  students.   I am reminded of those individuals who, as freed slaves, told stories  of walking miles to be able to get to a school like Fisk University or  to a school for so many in North Carolina and South Carolina or all  throughout the South. They were great refuges for individuals who  wanted a better life.   It is important to note that in the 1980s, the National Park Service  awarded more than $65 million. These grants require you to cover 30  percent of the project. So it is not a handout. It is a hand-up. It is  preserving the history of this great Nation.   I am very grateful to the Congressional Black Caucus. When the  question is asked, ``What is the Congressional Black Caucus and what do  we do,'' I will say without shame that we are the conscience of this  Nation and we recognize that we have a responsibility to protect the  vulnerable things of this Nation, whether it be people or things.   So the idea was to make sure that not only students have a brilliant  education, but those who would seek knowledge will be able to come to  the campuses of these Historically Black Colleges and Universities.   I happen to represent two State schools: Texas Southern University  and Prairie View A&M. There are many HBCUs throughout the State of  Texas. We are grateful for the leadership that they have given. They  have history.   Soon I will be establishing what we call the Emancipation Trail,  which chronicles the announcement of freedom in Texas. It was called  Juneteenth. It was 2 years that some learned about their freedom after  everyone else was free.   Those stories are being told at the HBCUs, but at the same time, STEM  education is being taught. Oakwood College, a historically Black  college of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, educates huge numbers of  doctors. I am told it has the largest number of African Americans that  go into medical school.   STEM is very important to our HBCUs. Texas Southern University has a  renowned homeland security program.   This is a good bill, and I thank my colleagues for voting for this  very right and positive bill.   Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Bipartisan Congressional HBCU Caucus  and an original co-sponsor, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1135,  which reauthorizes the Historically Black Colleges and Universities  Historic Preservation Program.   H.R. 1135 would authorize the appropriation of $10 million annually  from 2018 through 2024 for the Historic Preservation Fund to provide  assistance for the restoration and preservation of historic structures  at Historical Black Colleges (HBCUs).   Specifically, H.R. 1135, reauthorizes $10 million in annual  appropriations for the National Park Service grant program supporting  the preservation of historic buildings on the campuses of historically  black colleges and universities.   Since the 1980s, the National Park Service (NPS) has awarded more  than $65 million to more than 80 HBCUs to repair historic buildings on  their campuses.   To be eligible for grants under the program, recipients have to cover  30 percent of the cost of a project.   Eligible projects include stabilization, masonry repair, removing  lead paint or other hazards, and the improvement of access for the  disabled.   Mr. Speaker, the Historically Black Colleges and Universities  Preservation Program exists to preserve, and stabilize historic  structures on HBCU campuses through projects such as structural  stabilization, masonry repair, replacement of antiquated electrical and  plumbing systems, abating environmental hazards such as asbestos,  ameliorating termite damage, and replacing leaking roofs.   The HBCU preservation project is critically important because much of  the history of African Americans has been lost due to it not being  considered important enough by historians to study and the fact that  many of the repositories of that history--black churches--have been  destroyed by arson.   I thank and my colleague, Assistant Democratic Leader James Clyburn  for his work in bringing this important legislation to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud that one of the greatest HBCUs in the  country, Texas Southern University, is located in my congressional  district.   Texas Southern University has a rich history with nine academic  units, 1,000 dedicated staff members, and over 9,200 esteemed students.   Like most of my HBCU Caucus colleagues, I have worked closely with my  local HBCU to provide funding and resources needed to enable them to  fulfill their mission of educating the next generation of social  engineers and conducting research programs addressing issues of major  concern to the African American community.   I was proud to spearhead the initiative that brought more than $13  million in financial aid relief for the students and campus of Texas  Southern University.   I also worked with TSU administrators to initiate digital archive  projects to preserve the records of two of its most distinguished  alumni, the legendary Barbara Jordan and Mickey Leland, both of whom  preceded me as the Member of Congress for the Eighteenth Congressional  District of Texas.   I was pleased to facilitate a partnership between Comcast and TSU's  School of Communication to provide scholarships and internships to TSU  students and in-kind marketing services to the university.   I helped secure funding needed to establish the Center for  Transportation, Training and Research in the TSU College of Science,  Engineering, and Technology.   HBCU's have played a critical role in American history.   As the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. stated:         The function of education is to teach one to think       intensively and to think critically. Intelligence plus       character--that is the goal of true education.    HBCUs do not just educate--HBCUs have and will continue to fill an  important role in education opportunity and engagement for millions of  young people from diverse backgrounds.   I ask my colleagues to support reauthorization of the Historically  Black Colleges and Universities Historic Preservation Program by  joining me in voting to pass H.R. 1135.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Cook) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 1135.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1967 would amend the permitting process for pumped  storage hydropower projects utilizing multiple Bureau of Reclamation  reservoirs.   Currently, hydropower projects involving Reclamation facilities are  subject to either the FERC permitting process or the Reclamation  permitting process, based on whether a Reclamation facility was  originally authorized for hydropower development.   The unique nature of pumped storage projects, which require the use  of multiple separate reservoirs, can mean that a single proposed  project can be subject to both Reclamation and FERC's permitting  processes, since different reservoirs are under different agency  jurisdiction.   If enacted, H.R. 1967 would subject pumped storage projects using  multiple Reclamation reservoirs to just the Reclamation permitting  process instead of the process for both Reclamation and FERC.   Like FERC, Reclamation's permitting project requires authorized  pumped storage projects to comply with the National Environmental  Policy Act, the Endangered Species Act, the National Historic  Preservation Act, and other statutory requirements.   While I believe that H.R. 1967 is a commonsense bill and I support  its passage, I also support ongoing efforts to incorporate feedback  from the Colville Tribe in Washington State as this bill advances to  the Senate and proceeds through the legislative process.   Mr. Speaker, I had the remarkable opportunity to live in Switzerland  for 4 years, and hiked and climbed many of the Alps. It was fascinating  to see the high-altitude dams that made hydropower the dominant form of  power in the country. Eighty percent of all electricity was hydropower  or nuclear.   I thank my good friend, Congressman Lamborn from Colorado Springs,  for his leadership on this issue. I encourage unanimous passage of this  bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
