 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow, the Supreme Court's  decision in Dobbs will have been the cruel law of the land for 1 year.   In that short time, 14 States enacted near-total abortion bans, and  others are trying to do the same.   Wasn't that the goal?   This is not about being pro-life or being for States' rights. The  goal is a nationwide ban on abortion. The goal is control over women  and girls. The goal is cruelty.   Healthcare providers, the medical experts actually in the rooms with  patients who know them by name, have said many times, and it bears  repeating, abortion care is healthcare.   Yet, one in three women and over one-fifth of the American public is  now living without abortion access.   Mr. Speaker, 68 percent of OB/GYNs say the management of pregnancy- related medical emergencies is now worse, and 70 percent say Dobbs has  widened the racial maternal healthcare gap.   Dobbs puts the physical and mental well-being of millions at risk.   Judges and legislators are grossly unqualified to make personal  medical decisions for millions of women.   I have three daughters-in-law and three granddaughters. I will not  rest until their full rights, until the rights of all women and girls  in this country, are restored.                            ____________________
