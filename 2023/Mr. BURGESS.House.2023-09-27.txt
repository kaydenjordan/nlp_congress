 Madam Chair, I thank Representative Pfluger for yielding  and for working on this issue. It is so critically important.   Maybe the President didn't have an absolute plan in mind, but he did  say he wanted people to remain in Texas and not bother the mayor of New  York City and the Governor of Massachusetts.   The gentleman knows this really well that that rainy Saturday we were  working on this up in the Rules Committee, the President said he was  going to veto the Homeland Security appropriations bill. Veto the  Homeland Security appropriations bill when the Governor of  Massachusetts says we have an emergency, the mayor of New York says we  are losing our city, and he is going to veto the Department of Homeland  Security appropriations bill?   This policy that Mr. Pfluger is attempting to prevent is wrong. The  President should not have articulated it, and he certainly should not  have articulated that he is going to veto the bill to protect the  border.   Governor Abbott had to declare an invasion. He had to declare an  emergency. He is having to spend Texans' billions on doing the job the  United States Government should be doing. We need to fund this bill and  pass this bill.
