 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 727 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 727         Resolved, That if House Report 117-152 is called up by       direction of the Select Committee to Investigate the January       6th Attack on the United States Capitol: (a) all points of       order against the report are waived and the report shall be       considered as read; and (b)(1) an accompanying resolution       offered by direction of the Select Committee to Investigate       the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol shall be       considered as read and shall not be subject to a point of       order; and (2) the previous question shall be considered as       ordered on such resolution to adoption without intervening       motion or demand for division of the question except one hour       of debate equally divided among and controlled by       Representative Thompson of Mississippi, Representative Cheney       of Wyoming, and an opponent, or their respective designees.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Mrs.  Fischbach), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 727. The rule provides for  consideration of the resolution accompanying House Report 117-152 under  a closed rule if the report is called up by direction of the Select  Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States  Capitol. It provides 1 hour of debate equally divided among and  controlled by Chair Thompson, Vice Chair Cheney, and an opponent.   Mr. Speaker, today, we face a fundamental choice: Whether we are  going to get to the truth about the violent January 6 attack, the worst  assault on the Capitol since the War of 1812 and the worst domestic  assault on American democracy since the Civil War, or whether we are  going to allow lawful subpoenas to be ignored and the investigation  being conducted by the select committee to be obstructed to puff up the  ego of the former President, who has launched another frivolous  lawsuit, this time against the select committee.   I have to tell you, Mr. Speaker, I still remember January 6 like it  was yesterday. I was standing right where you are now, Mr. Speaker. Our  democracy was in peril; the lives of Members of Congress, our staffs,  and all the workers here were endangered. And Capitol Police officers  were beaten or worse.   Getting to the truth of what happened or placating the ego of a  former President, that shouldn't be a tough call. In any ordinary time,  it wouldn't be. This measure would probably have passed on suspension.   Because as a Member of Congress, we have fewer more important and  solemn duties than what is at the heart of the measure before us today,  and that is protecting our democracy and preventing future attempts to  overturn the results of an election.   This is about country, not about party.   Now, many witnesses are already doing their patriotic duty and  cooperating voluntarily with the select committee.   In fact, 10 of the 11 witnesses required to produce records to the  select committee by the required deadline are engaging with the  committee.   Only one person, Mr. Speaker, is refusing. One. Stephen K. Bannon.   Instead of doing the right thing, the legal thing, the patriotic  thing, Mr. Bannon is hiding behind the former President's false claims  of executive privilege to try to run out the clock on this  investigation.   Now, maybe he has something to hide. I don't know. But the law isn't  on his side. It is not on Donald Trump's side either.   Executive privilege is not absolute, and President Biden has declined  to invoke that privilege.   There is a long history of the White House making accommodations to  investigative requests from Congress. That is especially true when the  public interest outweighs other interests, as it does here.   But apparently facts and the law don't matter to some. Apparently,  Steve Bannon thinks he is above the law. Maybe it is because he was  pardoned by the former occupant of the White House.   But ultimately, in the United States of America, no one should be  above the law.  [[Page H5739]]    That shouldn't be a controversial idea. But we live in an age where  apparently some put fidelity to Donald Trump over fidelity to the  Constitution. And I find that disgusting.   I get it. The former President is in Mar-a-Lago somewhere seething  about our efforts to get to the truth about January 6.   But is he so feared, Mr. Speaker, that my Republican colleagues are  going to keep denying what happened that day? And keep trying to sweep  it under the rug as if it never happened? Oh, it was no big deal.   This is our democracy that we are talking about here. This is about  the oath we took and the freedoms we cherish, freedoms that Americans  have fought and died for, Mr. Speaker.   And some on the other side, are they really willing to throw away all  of that to placate the whims of one man? Really?   This has to stop.   The legal scholar James Landis once said: ``To deny Congress power to  acquaint itself with facts is equivalent to requiring it to prescribe  remedies in darkness.''   We need to see the facts in the cold light of day and follow them  wherever they lead.   That means not only holding those who attack this building itself  accountable, as the legal system is currently doing, it also means  holding people accountable when they attack what this building stands  for: Democracy and rule of law.                                time  1230    We will not tolerate being left in the dark, and certainly not when  something so fundamental is at stake.   Now, this doesn't have to be a partisan fight. And just yesterday in  the Committee on Rules, we debated the underlying measure at length.  And, yes, we heard from the usual Members who rushed to the former  President's defense, who deflected and wanted to talk about anything  other than the events of January 6. But we also saw something more  remarkable.   Chairman Thompson, a Democrat, sat side-by-side with Vice Chair  Cheney, a Republican, two people who probably have never voted for the  same Presidential candidates in their lives; two people who disagree on  virtually every issue. But they agreed on this: On defending the  Constitution and rule of law. Let's follow their example.   Mr. Speaker, I sat across the dais from Congresswoman Cheney for  years on the Committee on Rules when the Republicans were in charge. We  were polar opposites. But yesterday, I couldn't have agreed with her  more, not as a Democrat but as an American.   Now I don't give a damn if you are a Democrat or a Republican, and I  don't care if you like Donald Trump or not. Matters like this are about  something more than petty partisanship.   So I urge my colleagues, let's put our country before our party.  Let's put defending our democracy before defending Donald Trump. Let's  support this rule and the underlying measure, not as Democrats or  Republicans, but as public servants, as Members of Congress dedicated  to preserving American democracy and the rule of law. That is what is  at stake here and nothing less.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my good friend from Minnesota said we wouldn't be in  this position if we had done what the Republicans had asked us to do.  We did.   And I include in the Record the letter that the minority leader,  Kevin McCarthy, sent to Speaker Pelosi requesting a number of items.                                       House of Representatives,                                  Washington, DC, February 22, 2021.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Pelosi: We are in agreement that the best path       forward for bipartisan legislation is to create an impartial       and bipartisan Commission.        In keeping with the suggestions from the Co-Chairs of the       9/11 Commission, the legislation the House puts forward       should mirror the precedents that fairly and successfully       governed that Commission. Simply put, House Republicans are       asking for no more and no less than what Congress came       together and agreed upon in the past. Specifically, those       precedents include:        An equal 5-5 ratio in appointments by Democrats and       Republicans        Co-Equal Subpoena Power for the Chair and Vice Chair of the       Commission        No inclusion of findings or other predetermined conclusions       which ultimately should be rendered by the Commission itself        As the Co-Chairs of the Commission stated, a ``bipartisan       independent investigation will earn credibility with the       American public.'' I am confident that following their       procedures and precedents can do just that, in a way that an       overtly partisan commission will not be able to.        Thank you and I look forward to hearing your response.            Sincerely,                                                    Kevin McCarthy,                                           House Republican Leader.    Mr. Speaker, those items include: an equal 5:5 ratio on  a committee; coequal subpoena power; no inclusion of findings of other  predetermined conclusions which ultimately should be rendered by the  Commission itself.   Mr. Speaker, the Committee on Homeland Security agreed to every one  of them--every single one of them. And what did the Republicans do?  They said, Well, we didn't think you would agree to everything, but we  still don't want the Commission. So they voted  [[Page H5740]]  against it. And then they blocked it in the United States Senate.   So don't talk to me about partisanship or bipartisanship when it was  very clear early on that my friends on the other side had no intention  of wanting to work with us to get to the truth, because they couldn't  take yes for an answer.   Mr. Speaker, let me also point out that today, President Trump issued  a statement--he had to issue a statement because he can't tweet anymore  because of mistruths and embrace of violence. Anyway, he issued a  statement today. This is what he said:   The statement says, ``The insurrection took place on November 3,  election day. January 6 was the protest!''   Let me just say that one more time.   Trump said today in a statement, ``The insurrection took place on  November 3, election day. January 6 was a protest!''   And by the way, he didn't mention that it was a violent protest on  January 6.   Mr. Speaker, are any of my Republican colleagues, aside from  Congresswoman Cheney and Representative Kinzinger, who have shown  courage and patriotism, are any of them willing to come to the floor  and say unequivocally that the election on November 3 was not an  insurrection, as the former President has now said?   It was a free and fair election held by one of the oldest democracies  in the world. And that used to mean something to my Republican friends.  Please, please. The former occupant of the White House is trying to  tear this country apart. And unfortunately, too many on the other side  are going along with him. Enough.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I was hoping that someone on the other side would  respond to former President Trump's statement today, which I find  stunning and shocking, but apparently they don't want to talk about  that. They want to talk about legislative purpose. When we get to the  bill, I will let the committee members respond to that.   I do want to say one thing again; that Speaker Pelosi was committed  to a truly bipartisan commission, and we did a bipartisan commission--a  truly bipartisan commission. My friends on the other side of the aisle  tried to undercut it and get their friends over in the Senate to tank  it. That is what happened. They basically destroyed what could have  been a bipartisan commission that, quite frankly, was the way we all  wanted to go.   But then they said, well, she wouldn't let us put who we wanted on  this current commission. Well, the minority leader suggested Mr. Jordan  to be the lead Republican, and he very well may be a material witness  in this investigation. You would put him on to oversee an investigation  of, what, himself and others?    Give me a break. What is going on here? At least be honest enough  with the American people to say what is going on here; and that is, you  don't want to get to the truth about what happened on January 6. You  never did; notwithstanding the violence that occurred right here in  this Chamber, in this sacred building.   So, please, let's not get into this, Oh, we wanted to cooperate but  somehow you wouldn't let us. We gave you everything you wanted, and you  could not take yes for an answer.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Pascrell).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am not going to waste my time debating this  information. What my friend is talking about is a false government  takeover. What about the people who tried to take over our democracy on  January 6? What about what happened here on January 6?   Why is there no interest in getting to the truth? They come with this  instead. Again, I am still waiting for somebody to respond to President  Trump's statement that insurrection day took place on November 3. Do  you really believe that? Is that what we have come to, that my friends  on the other side would embrace such a shocking and such an offensive  statement?   We had a free and fair election, and this is what the former  President--who my friends are all so afraid of--says.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Scanlon), a distinguished member of the Rules Committee.    Mr. Speaker, let me just remind everybody that  democracy doesn't defend itself; people have to defend democracy. It  would be nice to see a little courage on the other side of the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from  New York (Mr. Jeffries), the chairman of the Democratic Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, let me just say, not only will my  Republican friends not condemn the President's outrageous and  unacceptable and unconscionable statement today, but they won't even  talk about what we are here for.   That is what fear looks like, and it is really unbelievably sad.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Pennsylvania  (Ms. Dean).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who is the distinguished majority leader.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman updating us on the bills  that she has cosponsored and her opinions about the IRS, which have  nothing to do with the underlying bill that we are debating here today.  But it is stunning to me that neither she nor any of my friends on the  other side of the aisle will respond to what the former occupant of the  White House said today in a statement, that the insurrection took place  on November 3; that our election, our lawful election in one of the  oldest democracies in the world, was somehow an insurrection; and that  January 6 was merely a protest.   I am stunned by this. I challenge the next speaker, please, can you  say that you disassociate yourself with this statement? Can you make it  clear to the American people that you want no part of this? I get it.  You endorsed this man. He campaigned for you. You are afraid of his  base. You are afraid every time he says anything. But the bottom line  is, this statement needs to be condemned, and the unwillingness of  anybody on the other side to condemn this statement is unconscionable.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr.  Cohen).    Mr. Speaker, when the gentlewoman from Minnesota  yielded the gentleman from Illinois an additional minute, I was kind of  hopeful that maybe he would be the one to say that he disassociates  himself from the statement of Donald Trump today in which he said that  the insurrection took place on November 3, election day.   I would be happy to yield 30 seconds to him if he wants to say that  this was a statement that is not only unconscionable but that every  American should condemn.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Clyburn), the majority whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, oh, my God, can somebody, please--I beg of you on the  other side--can somebody, please, disassociate yourself or condemn the  statement by the former President who said today that the insurrection  took place on November 3?   All my colleagues were elected on November 3 as well. If you believe  that election day was an insurrection, then your election results are  illegitimate.   Can somebody, please, for the sake of our democracy, say that what  was said by the former President is wrong? Please.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I don't know if this microphone is working, because I am  not sure my colleagues can hear me when I have asked them over and over  again, can you please disassociate yourself from the former President's  statement today? It is important. It is on topic.   By the way, what the gentleman just talked about has nothing to do  with what we are talking about today. It is amazing that nobody wants  to talk about what is on the floor today.   But my constituents, when they talk to me, you know what they are  fearful about? They are fearful about losing our democracy in their  lifetime. And the inability or the unwillingness of my friends on the  other side to be able to disassociate themselves with a statement by  the former President, which today he said the election on November 3  was somehow the insurrection. It is stunning to me. He is tearing this  country apart, and the silence and the indifference on the other side  is aiding him in his quest to do that.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I can't adequately express the outrage I feel about what  happened in this institution on January 6. It was not only an attack on  this building; it was an attack on our democracy.   I will tell you, if we don't have our democracy intact, you are not  going to fix the supply chain issues or the energy issues or any other  issues.   Our democracy is in peril. It was attacked on January 6.   Mr. Speaker, I am the chairman of the Rules Committee, so I  understand what the rules of the House are, so I cannot say what I  really feel about what went on in this Chamber today with this debate.  I am disgusted, to be quite honest with you.   We are trying to get to the bottom of what happened on January 6, and  many on the other side have done everything they could to frustrate  that effort. Now, we have somebody who doesn't want to comply with a  subpoena, and we are saying we are going to put some force behind that.  We need to be able to do our oversight. We need to get to the truth,  and my friends are trying to frustrate that.   Then today, former President Trump issues a statement saying  insurrection day took place on November 3. That was election day, when  we were all elected. That is what he thought? That is what he thinks  was an insurrection? And January 6 was just a protest.   We were all here that day. We saw the violence. People lost their  lives that day. People were wounded that day. People were traumatized  by that day. Again, it was not just an attack on this building and the  people who work here; it was an attack on our democracy.   And my friends on the other side of the aisle can't even muster the  courage to say that the former President was wrong in his statement.  That is what fear looks like. That is what fear of Donald Trump looks  like. It is so sad that a once great party has come to this.   I said it earlier. Members come and go. I know people are all worried  about the latest polls and where our base is and what political  implications will come from this or that. But at the end of the day,  you ought to be worried about your legacy, about what your children and  grandchildren think.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the rule and  ``yes'' on the previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mrs. Fischbach is as follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 727         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 5586) to prohibit the implementation of new       requirements to report bank account deposits and withdrawals.       All points of order against consideration of the bill are       waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All points of       order against provisions in the bill are waived. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on       any amendment thereto to final passage without intervening       motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and       controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the       Committee on Financial Services; and (2) one motion to       recommit.        Sec. 3: Clause l(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 5586.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
