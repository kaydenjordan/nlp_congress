 Madam Speaker, June is Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness  Month. There are so many things that are dividing our country right  now, but this is something that should bring us all together.   Alzheimer's and dementia are frightening diseases that impact  millions of Americans every year. Six million Americans are affected,  120,000 Tennesseans.   I have witnessed the effects of Alzheimer's, Madam Speaker, on  several people close to me, my Aunt Jane and my Aunt Virginia.   My Aunt Jane, I can remember that I hadn't seen her in years, and she  walked up to me and said, ``I don't know who you are, but I feel like  you are a good little boy,'' and I was an adult.   My sweet Aunt Virginia, who is married to my Uncle Floyd, suffers  from it, as well.   Pat Summitt, who coached the Lady Vols basketball team for 38  seasons--she grew up in my daddy's hometown--came to my daddy's funeral  and hugged my mama's neck. She lived with Alzheimer's disease and  worked hard to bring awareness to it until she passed away in 2016.    Before she left us, she formed the Pat Summitt Foundation to promote  research on Alzheimer's treatment and to educate the public. Also, the  Pat Summitt Foundation supports a clinic at the University of Tennessee  that cares for those with Alzheimer's.   We can't forget about the folks who take care of those with  Alzheimer's, as well. They take a huge emotional and physical toll. We  need to remember these folks. The Bible tells us that we need to  remember the least amongst us, and surely they are in that category.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous materials on the subject of this Special Order.    Madam Speaker, there are so many issues that are facing  our country right now thanks to the disastrous policies coming out of  the Biden administration.   Inflation is up 8.6 percent. Economists are predicting a recession  within 12 months or less. Our energy crisis--which is totally  preventable--is only getting worse. We need to turn our spigots back  on, Madam Speaker. We are relying on foreign adversaries--mostly  enemies, I feel like most of the time--to produce oil instead of  turning our spigots back on, as I stated.   The Biden administration is still shoving Americans toward electric  cars which cost on average $60,000. That is more than the average  Tennessean makes in a year. I know for folks living in the Beltway that  is nothing to them, but to the average working American, that is a  whole heck of a lot of money. The environmental problems that these  cars cause with their batteries and the slave labor to produce them in  these foreign countries that we have no regulations over is despicable,  and for anybody to wrap themselves up around that is part of the  problem.   Gas hit $5 per gallon last week--$5. People can't even afford to go  to work in most areas. President Biden is trying to act like he is  doing something about it by proposing a 3-month gas tax suspension.   Madam Speaker, that is laughable. That is laughable. The way it is  rising they will save no money. At best it is a short-term solution to  a long-term problem, and at worst it is just an attempt to distract  Americans from the Biden administration's refusal to turn our oil  spigots back on. Also, it would leave a $10 billion hole in the highway  trust fund.   Also, the baby formula crisis is still looming. We have got this  problem, and the solution that Washington offered was to pay more FDA  bureaucrats more money and not solve the problem.   The Democratic Party has accused the Republicans of some awful  things, but one of them was that we were standing in the way of this  when, in fact, we voted for the compromise bill, but the national  media, which is so in the tank for this administration, refuses to  mention it.   In closing, I thank all my colleagues who are here tonight to call  out the never-ending flood of problems coming out of President Biden's  White House.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr.  Grothman), who is Mr. Positive.    Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Grothman for his remarks. As  I have stated many times since I learned it when I first came up here,  there are three really great things that come out of Wisconsin. One is  Harley-Davidson, two is cheese, and the other is Glenn Grothman.    Next, we have possibly the only rice farmer that I know  in Congress and that I probably ever will know, and that is my good  friend, Doug LaMalfa, from the great State of California's First  District.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  LaMalfa).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from my home  State, Tennessee (Mr. Rose).    They definitely need to do better.   Madam Speaker, if it wasn't for the great State of Tennessee there  wouldn't be a great State of Texas. I yield to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Babin), one of the great ones.    Madam Speaker, I was always amazed in my hometown, as a  young man, I would watch people protesting out in front of a fur shop,  and they had leather-soled shoes on. I always wondered if those cows  died of natural causes.   Madam Speaker, next we have the man from a little town down in  Florida, Jacksonville, Florida, home of the greatest rock and roll band  of all time, Lynyrd Skynyrd. There is no other. I appreciate Mr.   John  Rutherford being here with us today, former sheriff, all around good  guy.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Rutherford).                                time  2030     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman.   Mr. Rutherford, I appreciate you. I appreciate Jacksonville, Florida,  and the influence it has had on this country and your influence on us  and your service as a sheriff and a man of law and order and a man of  conviction. I appreciate that.   One thing you talked about was taking responsibility. This  administration has refused to take responsibility. Although when  President Biden was debating Bernie Sanders when he was running for  office, he did not say anything worthwhile, I thought. He didn't say  anything like give me liberty or give me death or anything like that,  but he did say that he was going to raise gas prices, and he said he  was going to do that and put the oil industry out of business and get  people on electric cars.   Well, he is halfway there. He has just about put the oil industry out  because of the rising prices and the way it is controllable. He refuses  to take the responsibility for that.   Now we are overseas doing business, trying to do business with folks  that we have not really been on friendly terms with, for good reason,  their involvement in September 11 and other things.   Yet, we still are back over with our hands out to the members of  OPEC. That is very unfortunate.   Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to my good friend, Madison Cawthorn,  the pride of the Carolinas.   Thank you, sir.    Thank you, Mr. Cawthorn.   Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure being here with you all. I know my  wife is watching this and probably wants to get to the Mexican  restaurant right now, and so I will cut this really short, Madam  Speaker.   Thank you for your indulgence tonight. It has been a real pleasure.   I say thank you to the leadership for whoever canceled out at the  last minute and allowed me to be up here and do this. It has been very  enjoyable. It is the first in my life and maybe a last. I thank all the  young folks back there who work very hard to make our lives a lot  easier.   Madam Speaker, I would go on a tirade right now, but I believe I will  just let it go. You probably want to go home after a long day as well,  so you can just say you owe me one.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
