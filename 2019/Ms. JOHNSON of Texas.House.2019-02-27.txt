 Mr. Chair, I rise today to voice my support for  H.R. 8, The Bipartisan Background Check Act of 2019. This  [[Page H2254]]  common sense bipartisan legislation would expand the current firearm  background check system to cover all commercial firearm sales  nationwide.   Our nation is currently enduring a crisis that is putting families  and communities at risk. Gun violence has become so commonplace in our  society that we no longer seem to flinch whenever these events occur.  Gun violence threatens national security and inflicts a toll. 125,000  people are shot every year and more than 36,000 people die as a result  of these shootings. A 2018 report conducted by the Centers for Disease  Control & Prevention revealed that there were 3,353 firearm-related  deaths in my home state of Texas. 352 of these were children and  teenagers under 19 years old. Texas unfortunately has played host to  some of the most viscous recent mass shootings, such as the 2009 Fort  Hood shooting, the Dallas police officer shooting in 2016, the Plano  and Sutherland Springs Church shootings in 2017, and last year's Santa  Fe High School shooting.   We have high levels of gun violence in this country because we have  weak laws that are riddled with loopholes. This bill will not only  eliminate those loopholes, but it will do so without infringing upon  second amendment rights. Implementing universal background checks is  supported by 97 percent of Americans, including 97 percent of gun  owners.   The reality is that gun safety laws will reduce violence and we must  do everything in our power to prevent the reoccurrence of unnecessary  tragedy and loss of life in this country. I urge my colleagues to  support this bill.
