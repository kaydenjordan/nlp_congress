 Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on  this. Telehealth is critical for rural and low-income communities like  many in my district, and I absolutely support this bill.   Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth was widely used since we  were not able to see our healthcare providers in person. Even before  the pandemic, many of my constituents were not able to go to their  health appointments because oftentimes the office was way too far, or  they did not have the transportation to get to their provider.   Through this legislation, the Advancing Telehealth Beyond COVID-19  Act, some of the healthcare flexibilities we have seen since 2020 would  be extended for another 2 years. This action is very necessary, but I  also believe it is in the  [[Page H7193]]  best interests of our constituents to take these flexibilities and make  them permanent.   I introduced a companion bill with my colleagues that would make  permanent the expanded list of practitioners eligible to provide  telehealth services.   Congresswoman Cheney's bill is a great starting point, but I  encourage my colleagues to make these flexibilities permanent so our  constituents can have access to the care even after the public health  emergency declaration has ended.
