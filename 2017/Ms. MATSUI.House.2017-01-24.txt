 Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R.  7.   On Saturday, I joined millions of women, men, and children who took  to the streets and raised their voices in defense of equality. We  marched because women's rights are truly human rights. We marched  because women should be able to make their own choices about their own  bodies. We marched because everyone deserves health care, not just the  privileged few.   And yet, here we find ourselves voting on another Republican attempt  to cut off reproductive health care from the people who need it the  most. H.R. 7 would be devastating for all women, but would  disproportionately impact low-income families, women of color,  immigrants, and young people.   But we were reminded this weekend that, as women, our destinies are  tied together, and we will not be silent as Republicans attempt to  interfere with a woman's constitutional right to choose. Women are  watching.
