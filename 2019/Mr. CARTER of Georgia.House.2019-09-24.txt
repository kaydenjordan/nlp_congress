 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Chief  Warrant Officer Harry W. Sweezey, Jr., as we celebrate his 80th  birthday on September 27.   Mr. Sweezey is a true American hero who served for more than 20 years  in the United States Navy and Coast Guard, earning numerous awards for  his valiant service.   Born in Malden, Massachusetts, in 1939, Mr. Sweezey's father served  in the Navy during World War II but passed away in an aircraft accident  after the war. Nevertheless, Mr. Sweezey's passion for serving our  Nation persisted, and he enlisted in the U.S. Navy upon graduation from  high school.   After transferring to serve in the U.S. Army, he fulfilled his  lifelong dream of becoming a helicopter pilot, serving all over the  world, including in the Korean Demilitarized Zone, the  [[Page H7890]]  Czech Republic-Germany border, and in the Middle East.   Rising to the rank of chief warrant officer, Mr. Sweezey retired from  the Army in 1991 and was awarded the Legion of Merit.   Mr. Sweezey continues to serve, having joined the U.S. Coast Guard  Auxiliary in his retirement community of Panama City, Florida, rising  to the rank of flotilla commander.   Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Sweezey for his service to our country. He  is an inspiration to us all.                            ____________________
