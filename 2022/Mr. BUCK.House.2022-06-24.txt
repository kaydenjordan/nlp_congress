 Mr. Speaker, it is estimated that legal guns save 162,000  lives annually and prevent 2.5 million crimes a year, or 6,849 crimes  every day. By their own admission, criminals fear armed citizens more  than they fear the police.   Up to 90 percent of criminals who commit crimes with a gun do not  acquire that firearm legally.   We have serious problems in this country involving family, drugs, and  mental health. Those issues have been going in the wrong direction for  decades. Instead of addressing these issues head-on, the bill will  instead jeopardize the right to bear arms for millions of law-abiding  citizens.   Decades of Supreme Court precedent prevent the government from  exercising prior restraint on our First Amendment rights to free  speech. We should not treat the Second Amendment differently.   The Court just spoke forcefully in favor of this right. This body  should do the same. I urge a ``no'' vote.
