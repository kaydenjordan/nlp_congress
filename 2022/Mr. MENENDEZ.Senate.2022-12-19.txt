 Madam President, a few days ago, in front of a townhall  in northern Turkey, President Erdogan threatened a missile strike on  Athens.         Greece is afraid of our missile. They say that the Typhoon       Missile will hit Athens.    Then he addressed the Greek people directly and said:         It will, unless you stay calm.    This is a NATO member directly threatening to target Athens, a city  of 3 million civilians. According to the United Nations, an intentional  attack on civilians--an intentional attack on civilians--is a war  crime.   I come to the floor today to condemn the recent actions of the  Turkish President, which are not only disturbing, they are totally  unacceptable. For years, Erdogan has pursued repressive, anti- democratic policies at home and abroad, from criminalizing insults of  Turkey and freedom of expression, to the suppression of dissent and  political opposition figures. Erdogan has jailed and silenced so many  pro-democracy and human rights activists that at one point, there were  more lawyers and journalists in Turkish jails than anywhere else in the  world.   His government continues to try to hide the truth about the Armenian  genocide, prosecuting writers and historians. In 2008, one of the  journalists who wrote about the genocide was assassinated on the  streets of Istanbul.   As violent as Erdogan's tenure has been at home, his foreign policy  has been absolutely awful. On the eve of Baku's war in Nagorno- Karabakh, Turkey sold Azerbaijan $77 million of military equipment that  was used to attack innocent Armenians.   It is no surprise that Erdogan met in Tehran this summer with the  Russian and Iranian Presidents, some of the world's most brutal  dictators. Just look at the leaders he collaborates with. It is because  he shares their world view, and you can see this clearly in the way he  approaches the region.   Five decades after Turkey's illegal occupation of Cyprus, Erdogan is  still stoking divisions on the island. Last year, he proposed reopening  the Cypriot town of Varosha in an attempt to spread Turkish influence.  That is a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions that was  condemned by the European Union. This September, Erdogan threatened to  reinforce the already 40,000 Turkish troops in Cyprus with more land,  naval, and aerial weapons, ammunition, and vehicles. Clearly, Erdogan  looks at Putin's illegal annexation of parts of Ukraine and is taking  note. That is what makes President Erdogan's recent comments about  launching missile attacks on Greece so disconcerting.   We have seen Erdogan challenge Greek sovereignty repeatedly. This  summer, he sent fighter jets over the Greek islands in the Aegean Sea.  His threats to strike Athens fit a pattern of Turkish claims to what is  Greek territory. He has said Turkish forces may land in Greece  ``suddenly one night.''   He seems to be increasing his illegal autocratic behavior in the  runup to the elections in Turkey next year. In November, he launched an  air, artillery, and drone assault on Kurdish cities in northern Syria  and suggested ground forces would soon follow. ``Payback time,''  Turkey's Ministry of National Defense tweeted, announcing the operation  against the Kurds who have long been a target of Erdogan's wrath,  attacking the very forces that are essential U.S. partners in combating  ISIS, and in doing so, putting at risk U.S. troops in Syria.   He has been out for revenge at home too. Just last week, one of  Erdogan's political rivals, the popular mayor of Istanbul, was  sentenced to prison for 2\1/2\ years. The charge? Insulting members of  the Supreme Electoral Council. The charge was insulting members of the  Supreme Electoral Council. That would be the equivalent of an American  being put in jail for 2\1/2\ years for insulting some State electoral  commission or the Federal Election Commission or any entity as such.  And in case the prison sentence didn't send a clear enough message, the  court also imposed a political ban on the mayor.   Erdogan might be using this aggression and oppression as a diversion,  no doubt, from the dire failure of his own economy, he might be doing  it out of spite, or he might be doing it because he is a thug. But one  thing is clear: The United States must take the Turkish President's  actions seriously. Those who just simply say: Oh, well, he is a lot of  bluster--they do so at risk. They said Putin was bluster, and we have a  war in the European continent.   We need to hold Erdogan accountable for his behavior when he violates  international laws or challenges democratic norms or allows his forces  to commit human rights abuses. That is why I am calling for free and  fair elections in Turkey. I am asking the international community of  democracies to condemn Erdogan's jailing of his political opponent. I  want our allies to use their leverage to try to prevent further  incursions into northeastern Syria. And I am demanding that Erdogan end  all overflights of Greece and pull every last Turkish soldier out of  Cyprus.   I think, given all of his recent behavior, the United States should  not be putting F-16 fighter jets in President Erdogan's hands. That is  why, as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I will not  approve any F-16s for Turkey until he halts his campaign of aggression  across the entire region. I am sure this won't make me many friends in  Ankara, and President Erdogan has criticized me personally, calling me  an enemy of the state. But if standing up to human rights abuses makes  me an enemy of Erdogan's; if calling out Turkey, under Erdogan, for  arming Azerbaijan and enabling the massacre of innocent Armenian  civilians makes me an enemy of Erdogan's; if demanding Turkey  recognizes Greek and Cypriot sovereignty makes me an enemy of  Erdogan's, that is a badge I will wear with honor.   So to my colleagues here in the Senate, I will close by saying do not  be afraid to stand up for American values in the face of Erdogan's  aggression.   To the international community, do not hesitate to hold Turkey  accountable for violating international law.   To the citizens living in the shadow of Erdogan's Typhoon missiles,  do not forget the United States stands shoulder to shoulder with you.   To those people in Turkey who still hope for a free, democratic  future, do not give up. One day soon, with your bravery, peace and  prosperity will return to your homeland.   I yield the floor.
