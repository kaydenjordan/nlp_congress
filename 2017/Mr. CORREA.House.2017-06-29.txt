 Mr. Speaker, I want to speak about H.R. 3004, but let me  first talk about two of my constituents, Officer Jose Vargas, one of  the most decorated police officers in the State of California, and the  other, Jose Angel Garibay, a young marine that made the ultimate  sacrifice for America.   In 1977, Jose Vargas was named as 1 of the 10 most outstanding police  officers in America by the International Association of Chiefs of  Police. But it wasn't always that way. At age 16, Jose Vargas headed  north to the border for a better life.   Officer Vargas crossed the border 15 times over 4 years. Officer  Vargas was probably the only police officer who we know that spent time  in a Federal holding cell. America today is better because of Jose  Vargas. Jose Vargas added to the greatness of this country and to the  security of this country.   Jose Angel Garibay, a young marine, was the first soldier from Orange  County, California, to make the ultimate sacrifice in the Middle East.  He also came to this country undocumented and became a U.S. citizen  posthumously.   Mr. Speaker, yes, we must keep out the bad hombres. We don't welcome  those who would do us harm, but America must continue to welcome those  who come to America to work hard and to contribute. This bill fails to  make this critical and important distinction.   At the end of the day, we are all immigrants and we are all part of  this great country, and I urge my colleagues today: do not brand  millions of immigrants as criminals when their only crime is searching  for the American Dream.   I urge Members to vote ``no'' on H.R. 3004.
