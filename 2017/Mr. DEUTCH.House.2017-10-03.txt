 Madam Speaker, today I rise for Phil and his wife, to  tell their story.   Phil and his wife tried to get pregnant for several years. After  fertility treatment, they were thrilled when his wife finally became  pregnant with identical twins. Sadly, their twins were diagnosed with  twin-twin transfusion syndrome, a deadly complication.   At week 21, Phil and his wife learned the devastating and frightening  news that not only would both twins die, but that without an abortion,  his wife was at serious risk of suffering a ruptured uterus.   Their options were limited. Their doctor could not perform an  abortion because he was affiliated with a Catholic hospital, and Phil's  wife was unable to fly due to her high-risk pregnancy. Instead, they  drove from their home in Missouri to Kansas to terminate the pregnancy  by induced labor and delivery.   Phil and his wife were devastated. After the twins' deaths, Phil  participated in a baptism and grieved their loss.   Phil wants lawmakers to know: ``Decisions about abortion need to be  made  [[Page H7718]]  with the families and with the best medical information available.'' As  he rightly puts it: ``There is no one-size-fits-all situation for all  pregnancies.'' Placing government limitations on the constitutionally  protected healthcare options of American women and their families will  only add heartache and tragedy to these most difficult and painful  decisions.   Madam Speaker, on behalf of Phil and his family, I urge my colleagues  to vote ``no'' on H.R. 36.
