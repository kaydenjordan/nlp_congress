 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the  desk on behalf of myself and Senator Braun, and it is to the  President's counsel.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you. The question from Senators Scott of  Florida and Braun for counsel for the President:         If Speaker Pelosi, Chairman Schiff, Chairman Nadler, and       House Democrats were so confident in the gravity of the       President's conduct and the ``overwhelming evidence'' of an       impeachable offense that prompted the inquiry, why were the       House Republicans denied the procedural accommodations and       substantive rights afforded to the minority party in the       Clinton impeachment? Additionally, why were the President's       counsel and agency attorneys denied access to cross-examine       witnesses during committee testimony and present the       testimony of witnesses in defense of the issues under review?    Mr. Counsel CIPOLLONE. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the  Senate. I don't know why they would do that. I don't know. They  violated every past precedent. They violated all forms of due process.   Now, they say that is a process argument, and it is, but it is more  than that. It is more than that. If you feel confident in your facts,  then why do you design a process that completely shuts out the  President? Why do you cook up the facts in a basement SCIF instead of  in the light of day? Why do you do that?   Why don't you allow the minority to call witnesses, as they have had  the right to do in all past impeachments? And then they come here and  say: By the way, we were fully in charge, so completely in charge that  we locked out the President's counsel, denied all rights, denied the  minority any witnesses at all. But when we come here, they don't--they  still don't get witnesses. They want you not only to do their job but  to make the same mistake, the same violation of due process, that they  did. They said: Well, let's just pick the witnesses that we want. The  other ones are irrelevant--not relevant.    In listening to Mr. Schiff over these months, I have come to a  determination about what he means by ``irrelevant.'' He means bad for  them, OK. He means witnesses that the President wants to call. So I  don't know why they did that.   I will say something else. I will say something else. I have respect  for you, and I have respect for the House. And when I first got this  job, I went--one of the first things I did is I went to visit Mr.  Schiff, Chairman Schiff. I went to visit Chairman Nadler. I went to  visit Chairman Cummings at that time. And I said: We are here to work  with you, to cooperate where we can, but in the institutional interest,  obviously. We will participate in oversight, but if we have  constitutional points to make, we will make them and we will make them  directly.   And the administration has participated in oversight. Many, many  witnesses have testified in oversight hearings. A large number of  documents have been produced in oversight hearings.   And in fact, in the letter that I sent on October 8, I made the same  offer. I said: Look, this is not really a valid impeachment proceeding,  for all of the reasons that we have stated, but if the committees wish  to return to the regular order of oversight requests, we stand ready to  engage in that process. But that never happened.   So I respect Congress. The administration respects Congress, but we  respect the Constitution. We respect the Constitution, too, and we have  an obligation to the executive branch and to the future Presidency-- future Presidents--to vindicate the Constitution and vindicate those  rights.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Oregon.
