 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for  his leadership on this issue.   Madam Speaker, I rise to oppose President Biden's unconstitutional  vaccine mandates on our businesses.   I believe this vaccine is effective. That is why I took it, and that  is the reason my family has taken it. But I strongly believe getting  the vaccine should be a personal choice, not a mandated choice.   The Federal Government has no right to mandate the vaccine on job  creators or workers who are already struggling to recover from this  pandemic and to get our supply chain back working properly again. The  last thing they need right now is more government rules and  regulations, and that is all we are seeing out of this administration.   The American people are fed up with it. They are fed up with Big  Government overreach in our lives.   That is why I am proud to stand with so many of my colleagues to  introduce this Congressional Review Act resolution, which would  officially strike down President Biden's illegal vaccine mandate on our  businesses.   We will continue doing all we can to fight back against President  Biden's war on American workers, and I urge my colleagues on both sides  of the aisle to stand with us.
