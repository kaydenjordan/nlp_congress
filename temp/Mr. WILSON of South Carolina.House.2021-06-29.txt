 Mr. Speaker, President Joe Biden  claimed a bipartisan agreement on infrastructure. On the surface this  sounds like great news. Unfortunately, quickly following this new-found  agreement, President Biden crushed the bipartisan bill by mandating  wasteful Green New Deal borrowing, destroying jobs.   Improving America's infrastructure should be a priority and to delay  it for partisan reasons is another insult to the American people. The  President's voters are misled with an absurd interpretation of  infrastructure.   This chaotic mentality has been exhibiting a reversal from the  bipartisanship President Biden promised when running for President.  Dishonoring promises and undermining bipartisan negotiations, the  administration should actually be focused on the needs of the American  people instead of destroying jobs.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we should never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the Committees on Energy  and Commerce, Ways and Means, and the Judiciary be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 18, No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act,  and I ask for its immediate consideration in the House.
