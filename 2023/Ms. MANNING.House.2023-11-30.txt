 Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend, Congresswoman  Wasserman Schultz, for putting this evening together and for meeting  with me and so many other of our Members with hostage families for week  after week.   On October 7, we woke in horror to Hamas' brutal and despicable  terrorist attacks, invading Israel, firing rockets at innocent  civilians, going house to house, murdering babies, executing parents in  front of their children, and massacring 250 young people at a music  festival.   As if killing 1,200 people was not enough, Hamas took an estimated  240 innocent civilians hostage in Gaza, including elderly women,  babies, young children, and Holocaust survivors.   Like many of my colleagues, I have spent the past 7 weeks meeting  with the families of hostages, hostages including Keith Siegel from  Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and his wife Aviva, who were kidnapped  from Kibbutz Kfar Aza.   I met with Keith's sister, Lucy, and his niece, Emily, who spoke so  lovingly of their family members.   Keith and Aviva are the parents of four children and the proud  grandparents of five grandchildren. Keith grew up in my home State of  North Carolina. He moved to Israel as a young man, where he met Aviva,  who was born in South Africa and had moved to Israel at the age of 8.  Keith and Aviva have lived happily in Kibbutz Kfar Aza for 40 years.   On the morning of October 7, Keith and Aviva were having a quiet day  at home when they were brutally attacked and abducted by Hamas  terrorists, who drove them into Gaza in their own car.   After 51 days of grueling captivity, Aviva was finally released  earlier this week as part of a temporary cease-fire. Keith is still  being held hostage. I can't even imagine what Aviva has gone through or  the agony the entire family is going through waiting for their beloved  Keith to be freed from captivity.   I have met with other hostage families and learned about their loved  ones. I realized that just like the stories of Holocaust survivors,  each story about a hostage is unique. Each story is heartbreaking  because each of these hostages has loving family members whose lives  have been torn apart, who are living the agony of not knowing what has  become of their loved ones: Are they okay? Are they healthy? Are they  injured? Are they alive? Will they ever see them again?   I have heard stories that have brought me to tears, that haunt my  dreams, and that should make all of us redouble our efforts to bring  those hostages home. I have met with several of these families so often  that I feel like they are my own extended family members.   Over the past few days, we have seen some of the hostages released  and brought home to their families, and I thank President Biden and  this administration, along with Israelis and our regional partners who  have worked to ensure that the agreed-upon hostage exchanges took  place, but there is still much more work to do.                                time  1915    There are still more than 130 people being held hostage, and we have  only begun to learn about the terrible circumstances of their  captivity. This has told us we have absolutely no time to waste.   Earlier this week, I was proud to help lead the debate on the House  floor on a bipartisan resolution that we passed unanimously demanding  the release of the hostages, but passing a resolution is not enough. We  must do more.   Hamas has still not allowed the International Red Cross to visit the  hostages. This is unacceptable. Our country and countries around the  world must join together and demand the immediate release of all the  remaining hostages: the children, the women, the men, the civilians,  and the soldiers. We have no time to waste.   I look forward to rejoicing with the Siegel family when Keith is  finally released, and I look forward to bringing all the hostages home.
