 Madam Speaker, I rise today to thank  veterans, non-governmental organizations, congressional offices, and  ordinary citizens who have stepped up where the Biden administration  has failed to save the lives of Americans and our Afghan allies who  fought alongside U.S. troops and now are trapped behind enemy lines.   In many cases they have taken the lead in helping Americans and our  allies flee the country through independent rescue operations.   Veterans like marines Andrew Darlington and Jeremy Horton who worked  with my office tirelessly helped those Afghans whom they fought  [[Page H4535]]  alongside. They served our country honorably in uniform and did so  again when they were called.   The administration's withdrawal has been a failure, but these  individuals who have volunteered to be on the front lines of saving  lives are heroes, and they have shown the world why we are an  exceptional people. This is not about politics; this is about America  keeping the promises we made. Our mission is not over.                            ____________________
