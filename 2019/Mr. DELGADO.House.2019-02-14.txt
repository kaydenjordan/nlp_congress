 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor the life of Chief  Petty Officer Shannon Kent, a true hero from Pine Plains, New York, who  tragically lost her life in service to this country on January 16,  2019, in Syria.   Chief Kent was 35 years old and is survived by her husband, a retired  member of the Army, and her two young sons.   After graduating with honors from Stissing Mountain High School on  December 11, 2003, Chief Kent enlisted in the United States Navy, where  she quickly rose through the ranks and served as a member of the Navy's  Cryptologic Warfare Unit.   Chief Kent was fluent in five different languages and six dialects of  Arabic and was one of the first women to complete the rigorous course  required for troops to accompany Navy SEALs on raids.   Chief Kent could run a marathon in 3 hours 30 minutes, do a dozen  full-arm-hang pull-ups, and then march for miles with a 50-pound  rucksack--amazing.   A cancer survivor, Chief Kent had assignments in Iraq, Afghanistan,  and, finally, Syria. Just 1 month into her deployment, Chief Kent was  killed by a suicide bomber.   A recipient of the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star, Chief Kent gave  the ultimate sacrifice in service to our country and will be remembered  for her courage and determination.                            ____________________
