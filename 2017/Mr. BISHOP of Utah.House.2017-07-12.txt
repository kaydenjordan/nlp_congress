 Mr. Chair, let me say in 90 seconds then, it may  sound counterintuitive that BRAC doesn't save us money, but even though  it can take money off the Defense rolls, the question is: Where does  this property end up and who pays for it?   The bulk of the property ends up in the hands of local government,  State government, and if it was public domain to begin with, the  Department of  [[Page H5737]]  the Interior has got first crack at it. I have also always  sarcastically said every time there is a BRAC base closure, I end up  with a new national park and national monument. And even though we have  never done a study to verify it, I can give you a half dozen off the  top of my head where that happened.   So the question is: Does the taxpayer save money? And if you invent a  BRAC process that will guarantee that the Federal estate will not be  enlarged, that you won't simply transfer property from one Federal  entity to another or from the Federal Government to State governments  so the taxpayer saves money, then I will gladly support a BRAC process.   But until we can guarantee that, all we are doing is shifting the  money around, shifting the entity around. We may help the Department of  Defense change their budget, but the taxpayer is still on the hook for  all the property and all the efforts that go into it, and that is  wrong, and that is the process.   When we change the BRAC process to make it more public, to make it so  the taxpayer saves, then I will support it, but that hasn't happened  yet.   Therefore, I ask Members to vote ``no'' on the amendment.
