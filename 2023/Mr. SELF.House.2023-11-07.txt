 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment, which  would prohibit funds from going toward implementing, administering, or  enforcing the equity action plan of the Department of Housing and Urban  Development.   This plan clearly violates the Federal civil rights law that has been  in place since the 1960s. The intent of the Fair Housing Act is clear:  to prevent ``discrimination in the sale, rental, and financing of  dwellings based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex,  familial status, and disability.''   In other words, individuals with the financial means to rent or  purchase a home cannot be discriminated against.   Unfortunately, the executive order signed by President Biden, and the  equity action plan laid out by the Department of Housing and Urban  Development stretches the definition of ``fair housing'' far beyond the  original intent of Congress.   This administration has twisted the definition of the word ``equity''  to mean the exact opposite of fair and impartial treatment under the  law.   Equity is the administration's way of manipulating the rule of law to  offer preferential treatment to various constituency groups.   Rather than addressing the merits of those in need, the  administration is conjuring up groups of individuals who have been  assigned a predetermined victimhood status.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H5530]]         Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Montana (Mr. Rosendale).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Montana.     Mr. Chair, when considering the mission of this equity  action plan, it becomes clear that instead of rewarding people based on  their merits, the government is attempting to pick winners and losers.   This policy would negatively impact Americans by creating the  potential of another housing crisis, as my good friend mentioned, and  exacerbating existing problems embedded in our economy.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, let me be very clear. We are discussing an  executive order here.   Mr. Chair, if this is so important, bring a bill to the floor of the  House. Do not give us an executive order. It is clear that this  executive action plan will be rejected by the courts because it is in  violation of the 14th Amendment.   This administration is clearly attempting to hide under layers of  bureaucratic red tape and, in the process, grow the administrative  state and erode the power that voters have invested in this body. This  action plan is, in fact, so radical that it won the endorsement of  Marxists, who openly proclaim: ``Keep dismantling the organizing  principle of this society.''   We should not fund this initiative. It is time for Congress to do its  job by directing taxpayer dollars to priorities that affect all of our  constituents.   Mr. Chair, I urge the passage of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
