 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  June as National Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Awareness Month. During  the month of June, we raise awareness for those suffering from post- traumatic stress disorders.   After a trauma or life-threatening event, it is common to have  reactions such as upsetting memories, increased jumpiness, or trouble  sleeping. If these reactions do not go away, or if they get worse, you  might suffer from PTSD.   PTSD is especially prevalent for those who have served in the  military, affecting nearly 30 percent of Vietnam veterans and up to 20  percent of veterans who served during the global war on terror.   As a former rehabilitation specialist, I know firsthand the  incredible strides individuals can make when they have access to  appropriate rehabilitation.   PTSD Awareness Month is not only an opportunity to raise awareness  about PTSD; it is also an opportunity to raise awareness about  treatment options.   I applaud all the organizations that raise awareness about this  important issue during June. There is help and support for those who  have PTSD.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 7606 because, simply  put, this bill does nothing in the immediate future to lower food and  fuel costs.   Long before Russia's invasion of Ukraine, America's farm families and  consumers were struggling with fractured supply chains, skyrocketing  input costs, and historic levels of inflation, each of which continue  to contribute to increased food prices and diminished inventories.   Despite these crises, Democrats have neglected to take serious action  to incentivize increased American production. In fact, we are here  today to debate a bill that compounds the situation, further limiting  American farmers' abilities to meet global food demand and doubling  down on the idea that more spending and big government will feed the  world.   Adding insult to injury, the White House has been quick to blame the  private sector and alleged industry concentration for the current  crisis.   Economists across the spectrum--including former Obama and Clinton  administration officials--have dismissed the strategy as misleading, at  best, or otherwise, blatantly political.   So it is not surprising that at the behest of the White House, we are  debating a package where the anchor piece of legislation perpetuates a  tired narrative of blame, duplicates existing authorities, ignores  industry and producers, and undermines the Department of Justice.   It is also not surprising the party of defund the police also has  become the party of more cops for cows. At every turn, this  administration has obsessively pointed the finger at the packing  industry, in particular, blaming them almost singlehandedly for rising  food costs.   They have done so via blog posts, contrived public events, and press  briefings, all without any acknowledgment of the culpability of their  own reckless spending and heavy-handed regulatory agenda.   My Democratic colleagues have dutifully played along, executing  sensationalized hearings and political theatrics designed to support  unvetted and controversial bills.   Mr. Speaker, it is no wonder many of us question the seriousness of  the bill before us today. If this were a serious exercise, my  Democratic colleagues would not have paired such an egregious example  of legislative overreach with several other very thoughtful, very  bipartisan bills.   If this were a serious exercise, my Democrat colleagues would not  have added two unvetted Democrat amendments that are more about  political point-scoring than genuine near-term policy solutions.   If this were a serious exercise, my Democrat colleagues would have  worked with Republicans to form a concrete, immediate policy solution  with a chance of consideration in the Senate.   Now, I know both parties understand the gravity of these issues.  While we may have disagreements on policy, I was confident that we  could find common-ground solutions, if given the opportunity.                                time  0930    I am dumbfounded as to why Democratic leadership would choose this  moment--when consumers are deciding between gas in their cars or food  on their tables--as an attempt to score political points, especially on  the heels of a nearly 9 percent increase in consumer prices, the worst  this Nation has seen since the Carter administration.   So, Republicans forged ahead, and we developed solutions. Earlier  this week, Leader McCarthy and I, along with nearly 100 of our  Republican colleagues, sent a letter to President Biden outlining  administrative actions that he could take immediately to mitigate  rising input costs, and strengthen the role that American agriculture  plays in global food stability.   And yesterday, I, along with many of those same Members, introduced  H.R. 8069, the Reducing Farm Input Costs and Barriers to Domestic  Production Act. This bill would reverse many of the more harmful  regulatory burdens spearheaded by this administration, address  escalating input costs, and provide certainty to farmers, ranchers,  agribusinesses, and other entities across the food and agriculture  supply chain.   Specifically, the bill provides relief from EPA's unprecedented  actions related to pesticides and other vital crop protection tools;  offers clarity related to WOTUS regulations; rescinds the SEC's harmful  proposed rule on climate-related disclosures; reinstates the 2020 NEPA  streamlining; and requires an economic analysis on the costs and the  benefits of GIPSA rules. These are all actions which would provide  immediate relief to our farm families and households across the globe,  and they all were rejected by the Rules Committee majority as  amendments to the bill before us.   The letter and this bill stand in stark contrast to what we have seen  from the White House and the Democrats in Congress and their efforts to  scapegoat private industry for skyrocketing gas prices and sustained  supply chain failures.   So, in short, the crises we are facing cannot and will not be  mitigated with unfunded mandates, duplicative authorities, politicized  agencies, and Big Government, all of which are laced into H.R. 7606.   I remain opposed to this bill and the process which got us here but  stand willing to work with my colleagues on commonsense, near-term  solutions to provide immediate relief to farmers, ranchers, foresters,  and American consumers.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas), the former chairman  of the full House Agriculture Committee, who continues to this day to  be an incredible advocate for agriculture and a mentor of mine as I  have worked my way into this leadership role.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think we should see an extension, a little bigger of  that poster that we saw there. That concentration occurred because of  exactly what we are seeing today of government and Democrats leveling  regulations. It was regulations that caused the concentration within  the meatpacking industry. What happened when you put on more  regulations, small- and medium-sized processors weren't able to  continue to work. They couldn't cope with the compliance costs. They  just couldn't handle those increased regulations.   Today, we are seeing not just additional regulations, but a whole new  police officer being created under the poison pill within this  legislation, special investigator bill.   I would argue that maybe we ought to blow that chart up a little more  so we can see and project just how much more concentration occurs when  we force more small- and medium-sized processors out of the business.  It will result in increased concentration with this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Kansas (Mr.  Mann), a  [[Page H5621]]  great member of the Agriculture Committee who represents the Big First  Congressional District.     Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30  seconds to the gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   During the recent packer hearing, Chairman Scott mentioned that he  used a chart compiled of what really was cherry-picked data with zero  context to accuse all four of the major beef packing CEOs of price- fixing and collusion.   The packing executives explained the multitudes of supply and demand  dynamics supporting the data, including the cyclical ebbs and flows of  cattle production. Each of them denied the chairman's accusation under  oath.   Despite their denial, this week at the Rules Committee, the chairman  accused the packers of lying under oath. According to the chairman, a  price-fixing scheme is the only plausible explanation for increased  meat prices. It is no wonder I have serious doubts about this  administration's ability to objectively carry out these new  authorities.   I agree with the chairman, who is a dear friend. We work well  together on well over 99 percent of everything that we engage on, just  not this particular poison pill today. USDA is the right place to be  the cop on the beat for this. In fact, they already are.   USDA already has an entire Packers and Stockyards Division charged  with enforcing the Packers and Stockyard Act that has been in place  since the 1930s. Based on the latest available data, they have filed  and closed almost 1,900 cases just in 2020 alone. The division already  consists of a team of seasoned attorneys, market specialists, and  auditors, and it has the option to pursue administrative enforcement  through USDA's Office of General Counsel before an administrative law  judge or through the Department of Justice in Federal court.   I agree the USDA is the place for oversight of the packing industry,  and it is already in place. This duplicative mandate with all the  issues it brings is not warranted.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Crawford), the vice ranking member of the House Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer), a member of the Committee  on Agriculture.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Rose), a strong agriculture advocate and  a leader in agriculture.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Jackson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen), a great member of the Agriculture  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am honored to yield 3  minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Cammack), who is another  great member of the House Agriculture Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much  time is remaining on each side of the aisle.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to replow some of the fields and the  comments that have been offered here today. One of my friends on the  Agriculture Committee on the other side, Ms. Spanberger, claims  industry support. She referenced two specific organizations. But it is  certainly not widespread support among farmers and ranchers.   I will offer up this fact: Organizations that are constituted by  farmers and ranchers, including the National Cattlemen's Beef  Association, which is a large cattlemen's association throughout this  country made up of men and women in the cattle industry, and the  National Pork Producers Council are organizations that oppose this  piece of legislation. The National Pork Producers Council is made up of  farmers who raise hogs in so many different States in the United States  of America. It is a huge industry in terms of agriculture. That  organization opposes this bill.   The National Chicken Council--poultry--is huge certainly in the State  of Virginia, the State of Pennsylvania, and the State of Georgia. They  oppose this piece of legislation that is on the floor today. The same  thing with the National Turkey Federation and the North American Meat  Institute. All are in opposition to this bill that we are voting on  today.   The American Farm Bureau Federation is not opposed publicly to the  bill, but they have raised a litany of concerns and unanswered  questions.   This bill comes with an additional price tag of $700 million, not  offset, on many of the other provisions. Quite frankly, there are zero  dollars for this duplicative poison pill part of this bill, the special  investigator for cattle and pork. That leaves me concerned that the  existing enforcement resources that I have already made reference to  with USDA and the Department of Justice is going to be drained. We are  actually probably going to see less effective investigations as a  result of this.   We are going to see an increase in consolidation because it is a new  layer. If you are a packer of any size, not just the four big ones, but  medium and small size, and you have a new cop for cows on the beat,  then you are going to have to add compliance staff to be able to  prepare when, quite frankly, the Department of Justice and the Packers  and Stockyards Division is already doing an incredible job. Active  investigations are going on.   I agree with an earlier speaker, I think it was Mr. Lucas from  Oklahoma, if there is evidence of price-fixing and collusion, we have a  regulatory mechanism and a litigation mechanism. People should be held  accountable to that.   Although there are some really good parts of this bill, I am also  disappointed. We know that the only way we really get legislation  through the other side of the Capitol, in the Senate, is where we show  cohesion and where we stick together and work together. We have  complete consensus on basically all the other aspects of this bill. We  did request that this bill be divided and that the special investigator  portion come out of the bill.   I think we could be scoring some victories for the American people  and for the American farmers. But, quite frankly, I think to be in line  with President Biden, because President Biden's approach to everything,  all the problems that have been created with his ill-fated policies, is  that it is somebody else's fault.   This is blaming the private sector, which works hard to provide us  with the food that we need. This is blaming them when, quite frankly,  it is a failure to take responsibility for what has happened on day  one, starting with President Biden.   We would love to work with President Biden to make sure we can  address inflation, but adding this $700 million today, I have never  seen, in my lifetime anyway, or my experience, how you can spend more  money and spend your way out of inflation. It just doesn't work that  way. The economics do not work that way. The inflation issue, again, I  have never seen inflation reduced by spending more money.   I would respectfully encourage, because we can go back to the drawing  board and take each of these bills that are really good bills, the  bipartisan and strong bills, we ought to take those up individually and  give Congress an opportunity to speak on behalf of the American people  and affirm that these are good bills. Let the special investigator  stand on its own.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage a ``no'' vote on H.R. 7606, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in  opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I express my appreciation  to the gentleman for bringing forth a concept that could provide  relief, but not for many years.   This is an amendment to a bill that talks about immediate reduction  in food prices, but this is kind of a long-term investment. I  appreciate that concept, but it is not what this bill says. It really  doesn't contribute to immediate relief to American consumers or  reducing input costs for our farmers in the immediate or near term.   Working together is how the House Committee on Agriculture solves  problems. The committee has been working together with the Department  to better understand this amendment, its purpose, and its implications.   Mr. Speaker, the Department and I have agreed that this is not a  near-term solution to the high price and limited availability of  fertilizer.   As the gentleman knows, this amendment was pulled from consideration  by my Democratic colleagues in a recent committee markup.                                time  1045    Unfortunately, we have not learned much since then, which furthers my  opposition to it. Growing the size of government by codifying the Biden  administration's half-baked initiatives, authorizing $100 million,  specifying further use of the Commodity Credit Corporation, and  minimally funded research programs is no way to tackle rising inflation  or to address skyrocketing fertilizer costs. In fact, it leaves us in a  rather more tenuous situation when it comes to our farmers.   The Commodity Credit Corporation is what we use and what we depend on  and rely on when our farmers fall on difficult times. And they are  there, these input costs.   Not in all commodities but in most commodities, we see a record price  that they are getting for their commodity. But the fact is that  agriculture is a business. Farming is a business. Ranching is a  business. At the end of the day, it is the margin. It is not what you  get paid. You have to consider what you are paying in input costs.   With this inflation, with these types of policies we are talking  about today, there will be many commodities that soon will be upside  down. They will be more expensive to produce than what they are able to  get for price. There are commodities that are already at that point.   Draining the CCC in any year, in 2022, is not only wrong; it is  dangerous. We are not going to have the resources to be able to help  our farmers to keep them farming and to use the CCC for what its  primary purpose and mission was about.   Even more perplexing is the idea we would want to solidify in law  concepts that USDA admittedly has not developed into programming or  policy, as the public comment period was just extended yet again.   Now, we would have been better served by considering Republican  amendments, all of which would have provided immediate relief through  reversing the regulatory assault stifling the innovation and  exacerbating strained supply chains.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this  amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   The gentleman offered an amendment. He is a good friend. We do work  together. Another area of jurisdiction on the Agriculture Committee  that shocks people, actually, is cryptocurrency because it is a  commodity and traded and overseen by CFTC. He has been such a great  partner as we have worked together with those solutions.   The whole concept of bipartisan work, it is alive and well in the  Agriculture Committee, but just not reflected with this poison pill  that is in this particular piece of legislation.   With this amendment, I think, as I said before, yes, we need to be  looking long term. But this legislation we are dealing with today,  according to the Democrats, is supposed to have an immediate reduction  in inflation.   While I believe we do need to do an investment long term and look at  other methods of producing fertilizer, this doesn't really fit with  reducing prices for American families today. To do it and do it right,  we really do need USDA on board. We need to have their input. We need  to have their ability to do this through their programming.  [[Page H5629]]    This is something I look forward to continuing to work on with the  gentleman. I continue to voice my opposition to this amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I express my appreciation  to the gentlewoman from Virginia for bringing forth an idea, and I do  wish the same courtesy had been extended to my Republican colleagues  who were denied the opportunity to bring their amendments forward for  debate.   Working together is how the House Committee on Agriculture solves  problems, and the committee has been working together with the  Department to better understand this amendment, its purpose, and its  implications.   As the gentlewoman knows, this amendment was pulled from  consideration by my Democrat colleagues in a recent committee markup.  Unfortunately, we have not learned much since then, which furthers my  opposition to it being considered prematurely on the floor today.   I cannot support this amendment as written, an amendment that falls  short of its advertised goals, and does not offer any immediate relief  to farmers, ranchers, or consumers, because that is the myth that my  Democrat friends are trying to sell with the overall bill today, which  will not happen. In fact, I am afraid inflationary costs, more  concentration, are going to occur as a result of a specific part of the  package.   Growing the size of government by codifying the Biden  administration's half-baked initiatives is no way to tackle rising  inflation or address rising fuel and fertilizer costs.   Even more perplexing is the idea that we would want to solidify in  law concepts that USDA admittedly has not developed into programming or  policy.   Now, we would have been better served by considering Republican  amendments, all of which would have provided immediate relief through  reversing the regulatory assault stifling innovation and exacerbating  strained supply chains.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing this  amendment. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, to reiterate, in my comments, I said it was premature,  and I do believe it is. I think that this is a concept that the  gentlewoman is pursuing that is worthy of consideration, worthy of  development and full development so that we can have an appropriate  consideration of the text of this particular amendment.   I also think it is out of place with this particular bill because the  context, the pretext that my Democratic friends are presenting here, is  a false promise that whatever would pass, and if this would somehow  find a pathway through the Senate and be implemented, that it would  immediately lower food and fuel costs. That is just not the case.   This is more of a long-term vision. I appreciate that because I think  we should be looking long term when it comes to the needs of input  costs for our farmers because, quite frankly, when we have inflation,  when we have burdensome regulations, when we have an administration  that is really out of control from a regulatory perspective, sidelining  their scientists at the EPA--which, by the way, actually, part of those  are funded under a public-private partnership with agribusinesses to  make sure that farmers can have access to crop protection tools,  significant crop protection tools that have been sidelined by this  administration, when these same scientists have found them to be safe  in application in the past.   What I would say is that I look forward to working with the  gentlewoman in the future on this concept, but I continue to remain in  opposition.   This is not quite ready for prime time, not ready for consideration.  We need to be working more. We need more time working in a bipartisan  way and, quite frankly, hearing from the administration as well and  USDA.   Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1100     Mr. Speaker, I continue to offer my  opposition to this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas  and nays.
