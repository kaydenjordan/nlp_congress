 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 6092, the Veteran's Prostate Cancer Treatment and Research Act.   Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosis amongst U.S.  veterans. I speak in two roles: one as a practicing urologist who has,  for over 30 years, taken care of prostate cancer patients, and then  also as a Congressman, too, to the Third District of North Carolina,  which is home to roughly 95,000 veterans, the third most in the  country. So this bill is especially important to me.    This legislation requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to  establish a national clinical pathway and a national registry related  to the diagnosis, research, and treatment of prostate cancer. This  information will be critical to help ensure our VA's prostate cancer  patients have the best opportunity for early diagnosis and treatment.   Prostate cancer often sneaks up silently, without symptoms, and,  thus, early detection is the key. Early diagnosis leads to a much  greater chance for cure.   Also, very important is this bill's requirements for the VA to  develop a real-time, actional national prostate cancer registry online.  The more we can keep the VA up to date with the medical advances of the  21st century, the more veterans' lives we will save.   I want to thank my colleague and fellow urologist, Congressman Neal  Dunn, for leading this initiative in the House. Bills like this one are  the reason more and more veterans are surviving this horrible disease.  I am proud to be a cosponsor and look forward to its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for this legislation.
