 Mr. President, I endorse the remarks of my friend  Senator Graham, and I want to thank him for his persistent work on this  issue.   I would also like to recognize Senator Blumenthal and Senator Bennet,  who had significant roles helping on our side, and Representative  Malinowski, who has come over from the House, who championed it on that  side as well.   I join Senator Graham in asking not only for an ``aye'' vote but a  voice vote.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.    Mr. President, I just want to say, on behalf of  Senator Reed and myself, that we urge a ``yes'' vote from Rhode Island  in memory of the nine Rhode Islanders who perished in the Beirut  bombing blast on that deadly day--a ``yea'' vote and a voice vote.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.
