 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember Branch County,  Michigan, Sheriff Posse Deputy Michael Winter, who lost his life in the  line of duty. He is survived by his wife, Connie, and two daughters,  Cheyenne and Sierra.   Deputy Winter was known as a committed family man with a sense of  humor and a big smile. He loved being around horses and loved the  posse.   From his time in the United States Navy to the Branch County  Sheriff's Posse, Deputy Winter was the type of person who put his  community and country before himself. He is a hero in every sense of  the word.   This week, during National Police Week, his name was carved into the  National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial here in Washington, D.C. It  is a lasting tribute to those who paid the ultimate sacrifice to  protect us.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of a grateful nation, we honor Deputy Winter's  memory and his service to Branch County and our country. He will not be  forgotten.                            ____________________
