 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a brilliant  doctor and a pioneer of global health, Dr. Paul Farmer, who sadly  passed away last week.   Dr. Farmer dedicated his entire life to improving the lives of  others.   As co-founder of Partners in Health alongside Dr. Jim Yong Kim and  Ophelia Dahl, he forever altered our understanding of the fight against  global poverty and how to care for those in need.   In his mission, ``To Repair the World,'' that is his book, he brought  his unique and innovative brand of compassionate care to fight HIV in  Haiti, tuberculosis in Peru, Ebola in Sierra Leone, to name just a few,  while helping transform public health outcomes in Rwanda.   At the Harvard Medical School, he inspired a generation of aspiring  doctors to pursue careers in global health.   Personally, it was a privilege to see his saintly work firsthand on  our congressional delegation visit to Haiti in  [[Page H1185]]  2015 after the earthquake. We visited one of his initiatives to address  the needs of orphan children.   May it be a comfort to his wife, Didi, and their three children that  Congress, the country, and the world join them in mourning this  visionary hero.                            ____________________
