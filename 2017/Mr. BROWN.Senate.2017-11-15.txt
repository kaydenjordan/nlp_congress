 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the  nomination of Joseph Otting to be Comptroller of the Currency.   I appreciate Mr. Otting's willingness to enter public service. That  said, he is not the person we need in this very important financial  watchdog roll. We have learned lessons from the quality, the attitude,  and the work of the person in this office, and I am virtually sure he  is not the right person. We have made a lot of progress in the last 7  years since we passed Wall Street reform. The last thing we need is  someone leading the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency working  to weaken or eliminate important safeguards, instead of looking out for  workers, borrowers, and the stability of our financial system.    The financial watchdogs, including the previous Comptroller, Thomas  Curry, took significant steps to right the wrongs that led to the 2008  financial crisis. It is important that we not have this collective  amnesia that seems to permeate this body about what happened to this  country 10 years ago. Working together, Comptroller Curry and other  financial watchdogs strengthened rules for the largest banks.  Independently, the OCC enhanced the supervision and examination of  these banks, took enforcement actions against bad actors, and took  steps to address concerns that the agency had been captured by the  industry. There was clear evidence of that by previous people in this  job.   This administration is putting the banking industry back in charge of  policing itself. We should have learned from that a decade ago. Mr.  Otting is yet another bank executive who profited from the financial  crisis and is being rewarded by the Trump administration with a  powerful job overseeing our Nation's banking system. This is a man who  worked at OneWest and made a fortune kicking military servicemembers,  seniors, and working families out of their homes, all while pocketing  $2.5 billion--that is billion with a ``b''--from the FDIC to protect  his bank from any losses.   The bank, OneWest, in this behavior, in this money from FDIC, in this  action of kicking military servicemembers and seniors and working  families out of their homes--this all might sound familiar to my  colleagues; it certainly sounds familiar to the people in the Finance  Committee and the Banking Committee. It is the same place that Mr.  Mnuchin--now-Secretary of the Treasury--worked, doing the same kinds of  things and work that Mnuchin did.   Mr. Otting and his former boss, Secretary Mnuchin, refused to provide  Senators State-by-State data on OneWest's foreclosures on seniors,  servicemembers, and other borrowers. They refused to answer questions  about OneWest loan modifications. I think Ohioans--and I hope enough of  my colleagues to constitute a majority--would like to know what they  are hiding.   It was pretty amazing to sit in the Finance Committee and listen to  Secretary Mnuchin and watch Secretary Mnuchin--then-Secretary-Designee  Mnuchin--refuse to release information, refuse to disclose information.  In fact, he had forgotten about a $100 million investment he had when  he testified in front of the committee. We found out later that he had  this investment that he forgot to disclose; $100 million is a lot of  money. Even to Secretary Mnuchin I think that is a lot of money. Even  to this administration, that is a lot of money.   What we do know, thanks to important work by our independent press,  is not pretty. What we do know about what OneWest did is not pretty. In  January, the Columbus Dispatch--the most conservative newspaper in my  State, the second largest paper in our State--ran a front-page story on  that bank's abuses. Their investigative journalism found that OneWest  used so-called robosignings on mortgage documents. According to the  Dispatch, in its fine investigative work, under Mr. Otting's watch from  2009 to 2015, nearly 2,000 Ohioans in our six largest counties were  foreclosed on by OneWest. The abuses were so bad that Mr. Otting signed  an OCC consent order--a legal agreement that a bank and its regulator  enter into when illegal practices at the bank force the government to  step in.   If you are signing an OCC consent order, it is a pretty serious  problem. In any other administration, this would  [[Page S7249]]  have been disqualifying. In any other administration, Mr. Otting--or  for that matter, Mr. Mnuchin, who was engaged in the same kind of  practices--would have withdrawn their name. In any other  administration, if the nominee didn't withdraw their name, the  administration would have told them to withdraw their name, but not in  this White House. Frankly, when you walk into this White House, it  looks like a retreat for Wall Street executives and people like OneWest  executives and people who foreclosed on home after home and, frankly,  have almost no contrition and paid almost nothing, suffered almost no  consequences for their action.   The consent order documented OneWest's breathtaking list of  foreclosure abuses, gouging borrowers with excessive fees and unfairly  evicting servicemembers on Active Duty. Think about that. They not only  evicted servicemembers, they evicted servicemembers on Active Duty. In  some cases, I assume the wife was serving overseas and the husband was  evicted because he couldn't make the payments, partly because his wife  is paid so little as a member of the Armed Forces.   Mr. Otting was held accountable for one of the major abuses,  robosigning, by the bank's regulator in 2014. But during his Senate  Banking Committee confirmation hearing, he continued to deny  wrongdoing, even when faced with a legal document proving otherwise.   One of the things that amazes the American public is that nobody went  to jail for what they caused in the last decade, what they caused in  2007, 2008, and 2009--the pain and the hardship, the pain of plant  closings and lost jobs, the hardship of losing your home, the terrible  consequences of losing much of your retirement savings. The people who  caused this suffered almost no consequence. The American public, first  of all, can't believe none of them went to jail. Maybe they are not so  surprised anymore that there is no contrition. Then, we reward these  people by making them Secretary of the Treasury or Comptroller of the  Currency.   Mr. Otting was held accountable. In all of these legal proceedings-- and I am not a lawyer so maybe I don't exactly understand this, but  these people signed some document, but they never really admitted they  did anything wrong. Mr. Otting followed that process. Even though we  had this documentation, he continued to deny wrongdoing, even when we  presented him with that legal document.   Instead of helping families recover from the financial crisis as CEO  of Secretary Mnuchin's--not Secretary then--OneWest Bank, Mr. Otting  contributed to devastation. So this administration has chosen him to be  in charge of one of the key agencies protecting ordinary Americans from  Wall Street. I will say that again. He was a big part of the problem,  as CEO of OneWest Bank. He has committed wrongdoing; we presented him  with a legal document proving that. Yet the administration chooses him  to be Comptroller of the Currency.   It is a job most of America doesn't know much about. I didn't either  until I came here. I acknowledge that. It is a job that most Americans  don't think much about. It is a job that most Americans don't think has  a great impact in their lives, but Americans know what happened 10  years ago. I live in ZIP Code 44105, Cleveland, OH. My ZIP Code in 2007  had more foreclosures than any ZIP Code in the United States of  America. I can't leave my house, if I go more than about 300 yards,  without seeing the devastation caused by people like Mr. Otting--people  who lost their homes, people who lost their jobs, people who have  suffered and lost their life savings because of Wall Street  malfeasance, because of companies like OneWest. I am guessing that Mr.  Otting doesn't think about this, and I am guessing that most people  here don't think about this.   Pope Francis, soon after assuming the Papacy, admonished parish  priests to go out and smell like the flock. It wouldn't hurt all of us  to do that a little more around here, to talk to somebody who has lost  a job. It typically happened, in my neighborhood near Slavic Village,  Cleveland, OH, where the spouse lost her job, and then the husband's  plant closed, and then they couldn't keep up with the payments. Then  they had to tell their teenage daughter: Honey, we are going to lose  our home. First, they had to give away their family dog, probably,  because owning a dog costs money, and they were squeezed. They knew  they were in trouble. Then they had to explain to their daughter that  she is going to go to a different school district--and all the things  of life have turned upside down. Your life turns upside down if you are  foreclosed on or if you are evicted.   I am guessing Mr. Otting doesn't think a lot about that. I am  guessing Secretary Mnuchin doesn't think a lot about that, as he  travels on private planes and his wife brags about her expensive  clothes. I am guessing very few in this White House think about that,  but maybe they should. If he is confirmed--and I assume he will be  because the Republicans in this body generally do whatever Wall Street  and whatever companies like OneWest want them to do in confirming  nominees like Mr. Otting, but I wish Mr. Otting would think about a  little bit more about the devastation to which he contributed.   Right now at the OCC, Keith Noreika--previously, a big bank lawyer-- has spent his time rolling back rules to protect Americans from  predatory payday lenders. He has worked against a Consumer Financial  Protection Bureau rule that would have allowed customers to take their  banks to court when they were cheated.   Mr. Noreika has done all this as Acting Comptroller. He wasn't  confirmed by this body. Get this: His temporary role as a special  government employee means he doesn't have to live up to the same ethics  or conflicts of interest rules as everyone else. He takes this job as  Acting Comptroller while we wait for Mr. Otting; he takes this job as  Acting Comptroller, and he does the bidding of all of these financial  service interest groups, all of the payday lenders, and all of the  people who are preying on working families and preying on low-income  people. He leaves and joins some of these companies, and he is very  amply rewarded, and he doesn't have to live under any ethics rules.   The people who run watchdog agencies are supposed to be independent  voices who protect workers in the economy from financial crisis, not  banking industry lapdogs who help their former boardroom buddies on  Wall Street. If his record is any guide, certainly Mr. Noreika didn't  serve the public. He served as a lapdog. He served the banking  industry. If his records are any guide, I am concerned that Mr. Otting  will be no different, that the OCC's independence will be compromised  under his leadership. He worked side by side with Secretary Mnuchin at  OneWest Bank. Mr. Mnuchin hand-picked Mr. Otting for this job.   We are already seeing signs of Wall Street influence at some of the  agencies, consistent with Secretary Mnuchin's agenda. They have pulled  back on Wall Street reforms. They have attacked other agencies for  doing their jobs.   For wealthy bank executives and private investors like Mr. Otting,  the crisis wasn't a life-changing event. Think about that. The crisis  for Mr. Otting wasn't a life-changing event, but those people who live  in ZIP Code 441, in Slavic Village in Cleveland, for those people whose  homes I drive by every day, people who lost jobs because of the  financial crisis, people who lost homes because of the financial  crisis, people who lost their life savings because of the financial  crisis, those weren't just life-changing; those were life-destroying  kinds of events. Yet Mr. Otting and Mr. Mnuchin go forward, and they  pocket their tens of millions of dollars, and then they are appointed  by the President of the United States to watch over these financial  watchdogs.   They saw the crisis. The crisis was life-changing to my neighbors.  They saw a crisis as an opportunity to profit by flipping failing banks  bought at rock-bottom prices, but not before foreclosing, as the  Columbus Dispatch said, all while raking in taxpayer dollars.   If confirmed, Mr. Otting will be in charge of ensuring that all  national banks, including Wells Fargo--we certainly heard about Wells  Fargo's abuse of millions of its customers. His job will be to ensure  that all national banks, including banks like Wells Fargo, are  complying with the law, that they operate in a safe and sound  [[Page S7250]]  manner, and that they protect customers.   To be real, do we think we can trust him to do that after the worst  financial crisis since the Great Depression, the financial crisis that  devastated Ohio, Colorado, and Massachusetts families? After people  lost their jobs, their homes, and their savings, Mr. Otting clearly  isn't the right person for this job.   Yesterday, the Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,  Marty Gruenberg, said:         I confess to having a certain sense of deja vu. Banking       conditions today are strong and the possibility of a serious       downturn anytime soon is generally viewed as remote. That was       certainly true during the pre-crisis years as well. If I have       one key point to make today, it is that we should guard       against the temptation to become complacent about the risks       facing the financial system.    I would comment on Mr. Gruenberg's comments that 11 years ago or so-- 10, 11, 12 years ago--it didn't seem all that likely to many, at least  to those in the Bush administration, that there would be an implosion  of the economy and an implosion of the banking system, a crisis; that  there was, in fact, the new head of supervision at the Federal Reserve  who pretty much said, as late as 2007: We really shouldn't be concerned  about a housing crisis. It is only going to hit the higher, upper end  of homeowners, and it will not affect the economy. Those are the people  this President has put in charge to be the watchdogs of our financial  system.    Again, Mr. Gruenberg said: If I have one key point, it is this. We  should guard against the temptation to become complacent about the  risks facing our financial system.   We need to take Chair Gruenberg's warning seriously. Confirming a  banker to the OCC--a banker who will give Wall Street its wish list--is  a high price for working families to pay who are still feeling the  impact of the last financial crisis.   I urge my colleagues to vote no on Mr. Otting.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.    Mr. President, today I wish to honor a great  Ohioan, Dave Dilly.   Dave is here in Washington this week to fight for the pensions he and  thousands of Ohioans earned over a lifetime of hard work. You may have  even seen him and his union brothers and sisters donning the camouflage  t-shirts that have become the trademark of their cause. Dave is a  member of the United Mine Workers of America. He has served as the  president of his own UMWA Local 1188 in Coshocton County and for  several years has represented his fellow miners from all over our State  and Nation to lobby for permanent healthcare and retirement security  for our miners.   That is how I came to know Dave well, through his many trips here to  stand up for these workers. This May, the Senate passed a bill to  finally give our miners permanent healthcare. No doubt, Dave and his  fellow miners were responsible for that victory. If we have the same  success this year in securing their pensions, we will owe it once again  to Dave and hundreds of workers from around the country.   Dave's service on behalf of our miners would be enough to earn him  all of our respect and gratitude, but that is not why I rise to honor  him today. His UMWA shirt is not the first time he has worn camo  attire. Like many of our miners, Dave is also a veteran. This past  weekend, Dave was inducted into the Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame.   If you know Dave, it comes as no surprise to learn that service runs  deep in his family. It is just who they are. Dave had four older  brothers who served in the Korean war and inspired him to serve.   Dave signed up for the Air Force, where he was a weapons mechanic and  systems specialist from 1965 to 1968. He served in Thailand and South  Vietnam. For part of Dave's service, he was in Da Nang, known as Rocket  City, for the number of times it was attacked during the war.   Dave received many military honors and carried on his service by  working on behalf of his fellow veterans in so many ways. He served as  a veterans service officer for Coshocton County. He is active in local  veterans organizations, including the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the  Disabled American Veterans.   Every Memorial Day since 2000, Dave has helped lay flags on the  graves of veterans. Right now, he is the vice president of the  Coshocton County Veterans Service Commission. Dave has helped organize  and chaperone Honor Flight trips to Washington, DC, so other veterans  can see the memorials built in their honor.   There seems to be no limit to what Dave will do for his fellow  veterans, fellow workers, and fellow Ohioans.   Dave, thank you for your service to our country, to your fellow  veterans, and to our State. So many of us are proud of you and honored  to call you a friend. Congratulations, Dave, on your induction to the  Ohio Veterans Hall of Fame.                            ____________________
