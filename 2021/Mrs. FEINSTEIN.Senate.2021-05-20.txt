 Mr. President, I am pleased to reintroduce the ``Rim  of the Valley Corridor Preservation Act'' along with my California  colleague Senator Padilla.   This legislation, based on a Congressionally-authorized National Park  Service study, would increase the size of the Santa Monica Recreation  Area by 191,000 acres, accomplishing multiple goals of expanding access  to green space for underserved communities and conserving and  connecting wildlife habitat corridors, while maintaining private  property rights and existing land-use authorities.   In 2008, Congress passed the Rim of the Valley Corridor Study Act,  which directed the National Park Service to study the area. The park  expansion in our bill is based upon this six-year special resource  study.   This bill also takes into account more than 2,000 comments received  by the public, elected officials, local organizations, and other  stakeholders.   The ``Rim of the Valley Corridor Preservation Act'' would add 191,000  acres to the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation area. This  addition, known as the Rim of the Valley Unit, would provide improved  recreational, educational, and outdoor opportunities to the local  communities.   The proposed expansion would also better protect natural resources  and habitats, including valuable habitat for endangered wildlife, such  as the California red-legged frog, mountain lions, bobcats, foxes,  badgers, coyotes, and deer.   Notably, the ``Rim of the Valley Corridor Preservation Act'' would  only allow the Department of the Interior to acquire non-Federal land  within the new boundaries through exchange, donation, or purchase from  willing sellers.   As I mentioned, this legislation will significantly expand outdoor  recreational opportunities for residents of Los Angeles County, one of  the most densely populated and park-poor areas in California. The  impact of the coronavirus pandemic has only underscored the importance  of having access to green spaces close to home.   In fact, 47% of Californians--that's six percent of the total U.S.  population--live within two hours of the proposed expansion area.  Enlarging the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, at no  cost to U.S. taxpayers, will provide these communities with increased  access to public lands and boost the local economy.   In light of President Biden's January 27, 2021 Executive Order on  ``Tackling the Climate Crisis at Home and Abroad'' setting the goal of  protecting ``30 percent of our lands and waters by 2030'', this  legislation aligns with that goal and provides an opportunity to  advance it based on federal agency recommendation and a robust public  process.   Last Congress, we successfully advanced this legislation out of the  Energy and Natural Resources Committee in the Senate.   My colleague, Representative Adam Schiff, reintroduced this  legislation in the House, where it passed as part of a larger package  in a bipartisan vote last February.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the ``Rim of the  Valley Corridor Preservation Act'' out of the Senate as well.   Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
