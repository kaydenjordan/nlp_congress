 Mr. Speaker, William Nguyen is a 32-year-old from my  district. His graduation from graduate school was last week, but he  missed it because he was jailed while vacationing in Vietnam,  imprisoned after taking part in a peaceful demonstration.   I am here to stand up for my constituent and ask that he be treated  humanely. This young man is a son, brother, and a friend to many. I see  his passion for justice in the millennials I represent. Will is part of  a generation that cares deeply about the world beyond our borders. They  are advocates for the most vulnerable, voices for the voiceless, and  now William needs our voices. He needs our collective resolve to help  him through this difficult time.   Will's case has unified Democrats and Republicans to work together on  his behalf. For weeks, we have done everything to build diplomatic  efforts needed to bring him home. Today, I am asking all Americans,  regardless of their politics, to join us in supporting the Nguyen  family. Keep them in your thoughts, in your hearts, and in your  prayers.                            ____________________
