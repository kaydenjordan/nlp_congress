 Madam Speaker, the United States Marine Corps is  characterized by their values of honor, courage, and commitment--as  Marines would say, ``Semper Fi.''   Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Major General Herbert Lloyd  Wilkerson on his 100th birthday, a decorated veteran who truly  personifies these values of the United States Marine Corps.   Major General Wilkerson first felt the call to serve following the  attacks on Pearl Harbor in December of 1941. Still three hours short of  graduation, he courageously enlisted as a private. Major General  Wilkerson would go on to serve our country in World War II, the Korean  war, and Vietnam, soon becoming chief of staff and base commander for  Camp Lejeune. General Wilkerson's unrelenting commitment to serve the  United States of America will inspire generations to come just as it  inspired his own son, Major General Tom Wilkerson.   Please join me in celebrating Major General Wilkerson's 100 years of  being always faithful to our country, serving with relentless  patriotism and valor.                            ____________________
