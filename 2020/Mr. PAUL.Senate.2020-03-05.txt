 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I call up my amendment, No. 1506, and I ask  that it be reported by number.    Mr. President, my amendment would pay for the emergency  funds for the coronavirus.   I think that we should not let fear or urgency cause us to lose our  minds and cause us to act in an irresponsible fashion. I, for one, have  looked at foreign aid over the years as welfare that we send to other  countries that really is not particularly in our best interests anyway.  If you follow foreign aid through the years, what you will find is that  it goes from middle-class folks in rich countries to rich people in  poor countries. Frankly, people enrich themselves at our expense. They  steal our money. The Mubarak family in Egypt is now worth billions of  dollars, which it skimmed off the top. The history of this throughout  the Third World is legion and is well known.   My amendment would basically take the $8 billion from the welfare we  give to foreign countries in order to pay for this. I see no reason we  shouldn't do this. I am not opposed to the emergency funding, but I  think that the emergency funding should be gotten from elsewhere in the  budget and that this is the responsible way to act.   Every day, people across the country are confronted with unexpected  expenses. We budget and we plan, but things happen. When they do, we  adjust and plan accordingly. Sometimes we confront an expense that is  not only unexpected but is urgent, and that is where we find ourselves  today. We want to respond and make sure we are providing resources to  our medical professionals and researchers. That is important, and I  fully support that, which is why we should use this moment to  [[Page S1517]]  ask ourselves whether it is really necessary to keep spending on  wasteful things.   If we don't consider this now, when will we ever consider this?   We want an all-hands-on-deck response, so we should be cutting out  waste and moving those resources to something that is of more immediate  concern. So, if the coronavirus is of immediate concern--and I think it  is--let's address that situation now, but let's do so by taking money  from less urgent things and money that we are wasting overseas--money  that is often stolen by Third-World dictators. That is exactly what I  am proposing today.   We have the money. We don't need to borrow more money. We just have  to start setting our own priorities. For example, we shouldn't spend  another dollar in developing a foreign economy this year. That spending  should be stopped, and the money should be spent here to buy supplies,  to help expedite research, and to support our communities. The funds I  am proposing to keep at home have been used abroad for all kinds of  unnecessary and wasteful things. I will give you a few examples.   We send U.S. taxpayer dollars to fund kids from Pakistan to go to  space camp in America. We spend money on combating student truancy in  the Philippines. We have been funding the Peruvian Green New Deal. We  actually send money to help deported illegal immigrants start up  businesses in El Salvador. What business is it of the U.S. taxpayer to  be funding small businesses in El Salvador for people who broke the law  by trying to break into our country? It is insane. At this point in  time, I think this money would be better spent on research on the  coronavirus and on a response to this epidemic should it become worse  in our country.   The list doesn't stop there. I don't know why we can't agree to spend  this money on the coronavirus instead of spending it abroad. We spend  over $50 billion a year in Afghanistan--building their roads, building  their schools, trying to create a nation where there really is no  nation. We need to spend that money here at home. Besides, it is the  law.   We have a law called pay-go, or pay as you go, which is supposed to  require Congress to pay for new spending. It has been around for a  couple of decades. Yet we have broken the law thousands of times. What  do they do? They see something they want. You know, they are kids in a  candy store. They want to spend. They want to give you, give you, give  you free money, so they just ignore the law. So what happens every year  is that they exceed the pay-as-you-go, and they don't do the thing they  are supposed to do, which is to offset this with a spending cut. Then  they just write a small, little note in there, reading they have agreed  to ignore the pay-go rules again. That is what will happen in this  case.   The other way they ignore the rules on pay-go is they declare things  to be emergencies, so everything is an emergency. They say: Well, what  would we do if we didn't have this--if it weren't an emergency?   We already spend billions of dollars and have spent billions of  dollars over the years to prepare for epidemics. We fund the CDC, and  we fund the NIH. There is a lot of money out there.   Once again, I am not against giving additional money, but we should  just make a decision. We should be mature people and say we are not  just going to print up the money or borrow it from China but are going  to take it, maybe, from something less necessary.   When we don't want to pay for new spending, we just simply waive  these rules on pay-go. We declare the spending to be emergency, and we  get around the requirement. That is how we got a $23 trillion debt. We  actually borrow $2 million every minute.   People say: Well, we have to do something. People are running around,  acting crazy--we have to do something. Well, who is going to do  something about the $23 trillion debt?   Do we not have 5 minutes to take a vote? In 15 minutes, we will be  taking this vote, and people could simply vote and say that we are not  going to borrow more money and that we will take the money from  somewhere else in the budget that is less pressing.   Mark my words--there is no fiscal responsibility up here among either  party. It will be a small minority of us who will say that this funding  should be offset by taking it from somewhere else in the budget.   In times of emergency, Congress scrambles to put together new  spending, but we should be working just as hard to pay for the cost  that comes with emergencies.   Which is a higher priority--spending millions of dollars to stabilize  the supply chain of medical supplies and treatments here at home or  spending millions on international arts festivals? Which is a higher  priority--spending millions to train frontline medical professionals  here at home on how to limit exposure to the coronavirus or spending  millions of dollars, if not billions of dollars, paving roads in  Afghanistan? My amendment gives us a chance to set priorities.   We can support our communities and give our medical system the  resources its needs, and we can do it without adding to the debt. That  is the responsible way. My amendment would do exactly that, and I  encourage the other Senators to consider fiscal responsibility.   I thank the Presiding Officer.    Mr. President, I recently had the honor of being welcomed  by Game Changers, an organization based in Louisville, KY, devoted to  guiding our youth toward productive and meaningful lives, for a panel  discussion on the impact of violence in our community. The executive  director of Game Changers is Christopher 2X, whom I have known for many  years and watched change the lives of so many Kentuckians through his  advocacy, leadership, and community building efforts. In December of  2019, just a few months ago, Christopher showed me the findings of Game  Changers's study on the impact of youth violence recently released by  his organization. Subsequently, I asked him to organize  [[Page S1593]]  an event in West Louisville with a panel of community leaders and  parents to discuss the report and how violent crime affects the lives  of Louisville youth.   At the event, we not only discussed the findings but also heard from  Louisvillians whose real-life stories are contained in the pages of  those reports. Earnestine ``Tina'' Tyus described how the ongoing  physical and the mental suffering of her grandson, Ki'Anthony Tyus  resulted after being shot. Rather than excelling at football and  basketball, Ki'Anthony was focused on learning how to walk again.  Violence also has indirect consequences. Stevonte Wood started failing  out of school, treating those around him poorly, and had trouble  sleeping at night. This downward spiral was a result of witnessing the  murders of his mother and older brother. Jarron Jones, a behavioral  therapist, recounts a story of how a once-promising baseball career for  one student may now never come to fruition because he is too afraid of  violence to continue playing the sport. Only personal stories such as  these truly demonstrate the extreme toll taken on children exposed to  violence.   That is why I feel compelled to share Game Changers's findings on  violence and its impact on our youth with my colleagues. Tragically,  children are exposed to violence in every corner of our Nation. I ask  unanimous consent that this report be printed in the Congressional  Record with the hope that every Member of Congress will read it and  work with me to create safer communities for our children.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                    Violence Impact on Children Learning     The Christopher 2X Game Changers Target Education--Crush Violence         KI'ANTHONY TYUS AND HIS GRANDMOTHER ERNESTINE ``TINA'' TYUS         Tina Tyus has a comfortable home in West Louisville where       photos of grandchildren she has raised are on display or       within easy reach.        There's Ki'Anthony as an infant along with one of the last       pictures of him, at the family's Thanksgiving gathering last       year, a lanky teenager smiling next to a proud grandmother       who ``had him since he came into this world.''        Their world, from the time Ki'Anthony was 9, has been       devastated by gun violence.        At age 9, Ki'Anthony was shot by a stray bullet while       playing basketball in a park and suffered a debilitating leg       injury. Four years later, on Dec. 22, 2018, he died when the       stolen Lexus SUV he was riding in crashed into a utility pole       on Fern Valley Road after a police chase. Four other       juveniles in the car including the driver survived.        His family is grabbling with the circumstances of his death       and does not understand how or why he ended up in the stolen       car.        Known as ``Lil King,'' playful and fun to be around,       Ki'Anthony was a symbol of resilience in a media spotlight       during anti-violence efforts after he was shot. He was an       active participant in a Christopher 2X ``Hood2Hood''       antiviolence movement. He visited other gunshot victims in       the hospital to offer encouragement and comfort.        He also struggled with his wounds, both emotional and       physical, and navigated among peers who were not always good       influences.        His gun shot injury put him in the hospital for several       days. He had multiple surgeries in the aftermath followed by       months of physical therapy. He had a rod in his leg for a       year and a bullet was left there permanently because of the       damage it could cause if it was removed.        The boy who loved to play football and basketball ``wasn't       able to play any sport and that devastated him. He had to       basically start all over again walking,'' his grandmother       said. He was ``angry, very angry.''        He began disobeying rules in her home, and feared getting       shot again, she said. His grades suffered, and she said a       contributing factor was his assignment to a middle school far       away from home that required a long commute on two buses each       morning and afternoon while he was using a walker because of       his leg injury. He acted out, she said, so he could be sent       to another school.        His two sisters--11 and 16--also have been impacted.       Neither are doing well in school, and ``they are just hurt,''       she said.        A happy time was last Thanksgiving, a few weeks before       Ki'Anthony died, and she had made his favorite foods       including a strawberry cake for the large annual family       gathering in her home. ``He was jumping around here,       dancing.''        At Thanksgiving, she told Ki'Anthony she would buy him a       purple suit for Easter like the ones he saw and admired at a       gospel program they had attended, ``not knowing I had to bury       him before Easter. He died on my mother's birthday. It just       eats me up.''        385--Number of people shot in Louisville in 2017, an       average of 32 people each month.        355--Number of people shot in Louisville in 2018, an       average of nearly 30 people each month.        276--Number of people shot in Louisville in the first nine       months of 2019, an average of more than 30 people a month.                  JAMIE DENTON WITH HER SON ROBERT LEACHMAN         Jamie Denton chokes up talking about the impact her son's       violent death has had on his three younger brothers and how       she's struggled.        Robert Leachman, 20, died on Aug. 2, 2017, from multiple       gunshot wounds at Parkway Place Apartments two weeks before       he was to start nursing school. The family believes the       shooting stemmed from an earlier argument on a basketball       court.        Jamie's three other sons, who were 9, 11 and 16 at the       time, were close to their brother and their behaviors all       changed in different ways after his death.        ``It took something out of them,'' she said.        Before the death of their brother, they were good students       with good grades, she said. Afterward, her 16-year-old ``shut       himself off and didn't go out, was scared to take TARC and       had to have a ride with someone to go anywhere. He no longer       wanted to attend Ballard and instead now attends Jefferson       County High School.        The 11-year-old became out of control in school, not       listening, but now is doing better, she said. The 9-year-old       withdrew but also began writing rap songs about his brother       and at the end of the school year he chose the topic ``Stop       the Violence'' for a project.        She and her children have all had counseling and their       public schools have been helpful but her children ``are hurt       and stressed and looking at me, they see more stress because       they are worrying about me,'' she said.        They moved after the shooting, she said, and now feel safe       in their neighborhood but not safe enough to visit a nearby       park. Her older son warned her to stop walking in the park       because of a gang that frequents there. ``So, I don't go to       that park,'' she said.        A few weeks after her son was killed, when she was still in       her old home on Madison Street north of Broadway, during a       neighborhood cookout on Labor Day weekend, shooters fired       bullets at homes including hers and shot up cars. ``We were       terrified,'' she said.        ``I switched up my house and I switched up my car. I had       to, to survive.''        In the aftermath of her son's death, her health declined,       and she suffered a heart attack at age 39 last spring.        ``Kids will keep you strong because they know what you're       going through. They want to see you the same.''        Murders from gun fire are a ``totally different'' level of       dying than by other means. ``It's the cruelest thing, that a       person can die of that.''        1,616--Number of times in the first six months of 2019 that       an electronic gunfire detection system alerted police to       shots fired in an area totaling six square miles, an average       of nine times a day, 269 times a month.        The system called Shotspotter operates in parts of the 1st,       2nd and 4th police districts in West Louisville, and       Smoketown and Old Louisville just east and south of downtown.                                STEVONTE WOOD         Stevonte Wood, 23, earned a college degree in three years,       has a fulltime job as a security officer, and is recently       married--a happy, fulfilling life that was highly unlikely 10       years ago.        Stevonte was 13 when he witnessed a horrendous act of       violence, the shooting deaths of his mother and older brother       after an argument on a basketball court at his family's       Shively apartment complex. After that terrible day, for       Stevonte, ``things really took a turn.''        He was on a grieving, trauma-filled downward spiral marked       by anger, bad conduct and failing grades. Family support,       counseling, caring teachers, others in his life--and his own       hard work and determination--helped Stevonte rebound.        Before the shootings, he had been a good student, making       A's and Bs, which he credited in part to his mother who       ``made me book heavy.'' His father worked long days, taking       two buses to and from their home to his construction job.        After the shootings, Stevonte was deeply troubled and       struggling. He was still living in the apartment where his       mother and brother were killed, and he had trouble focusing       and sleeping. When he did sleep he often had nightmares. He       argued with his father, who had been injured in the shootings       and was grieving. (They now have a close relationship).        Angry and withdrawn, he failed 9th grade. He went to school       but had trouble concentrating. ``I was there but I wasn't       there. I was constantly thinking about what happened.'' He       wanted to communicate but he said he didn't know how; his       words were angry, and he said he felt ``a lot of self-      hatred.'' He worried about his father's safety and that       someone might retaliate against his family in another act of       violence.        From Butler High School he was sent to Western High School       to repeat 9th grade, which turned out to be blessing, he       said.        Counseling helped him manage his grief, overcome his anger       and detachment so he could focus on schoolwork, he said, and       teachers encouraged him while holding him responsible. A       turning point came when one told him he didn't want to fail       the same grade twice, that would ``not be good, trust me.''        ``I started listening in class, participating and my grades       climbed up.''  [[Page S1594]]         He was motivated to make up for failing at Butler. ``The       people I was surrounded by were well-rounded people. Once I       put myself around people who wanted me to succeed, that was       one heck of an opportunity. I didn't want to miss out on       it.''        With good grades, he pursued advanced placement classes in       his junior year at Western and started racking up college       credits through courses taught through Jefferson Community       Technical College. When Stevonte received his high school       diploma in 2015 he had 31 college credits toward his degree       from the University of Louisville, which he earned in 2018.        His decision to major in criminal justice was influenced by       the good relations he had with police officers after his       mother and brother were murdered. ``I began to idolize the       good police and those who interact with the community,'' he       said. Police were kind to his family and checked on them, he       said, and he thought he could be like them and help people.        He has shared his story with other survivors of gun       violence to offer hope and encourages awareness of the signs       of trauma in children.        Anger, withdrawal, depression are key signs, he said.       Schools and parents also need to be connected. ``When you get       that disconnect, that's when you start losing kids. We need       to find who these kids are and take the time to understand       their situation and help them to the best of our abilities.''        4,558--Number of times citizens reported hearing gunfire to       Louisville Metro Police in 18 months, from Jan., 2018-June,       2019, over 200 times a month.           JERRON JONES--LICENSED PROFESSIONAL COUNSELOR ASSOCIATE         As a behavioral therapist, Jerron Jones spends much of his       time trying to help families and children suffering from       trauma resulting from exposure to violence.        The symptoms of trauma in children vary based on age and       the individual child but a ``huge sign'' is an inability to       develop a relationship with an adult and show respect for the       teacher, Jones said. Children in those situations, he said,       often lack a consistent, nurturing adult in their lives.        A lot of kids lack confidence and self-esteem and don't       hear encouraging words or praise for what they do well and       the strengths they have, he said, and ``that leaves them       without a skill set to build on.''        Jones advises adults in their lives to celebrate them with       compliments and praise for their efforts. Children should       also be comforted by adults who remain calm and patient even       though the circumstances can be difficult, he said. Listening       to them and showing an interest in what they like to do, he       said, as well as working with them and sharing new ideas can       help them build self-esteem.        Parents and teachers should be aware of signs of trauma,       and seek help when needed, he said, but often parents don't       feel comfortable revealing upsetting circumstances that may       be a root cause of a child's trauma. Building trust and       showing integrity, he said, goes a long way in addressing a       traumatized child's needs.        ``Early exposure to extremely fearful events affects the       developing brain, particularly in those areas involved in       emotions and learning. . . . For young children who perceive       the world as a threatening place, a wide range of conditions       can trigger anxious behaviors that then impair their ability       to learn and to interact socially with others.'' Source:       National Scientific Council on the Developing Child (2010).       Persistent Fear and Anxiety Can Affect Young Children's       Learning and Development: Working Paper No. 9.        Jones cites the following age-related symptoms children may       have in response to a traumatic event or series of events       including exposure to gun violence:        Five and under: May be irritable, fussy or difficult to get       calmed down. They may be easily started or show behaviors       common in younger children such as thumb sucking. Clingy       behavior and frequent tantrums may also be present, and they       may talk or act out a traumatic event.        Ages 6-12 may have trouble paying attention or be       withdrawn. Their performance may decline in school. They may       be in trouble at school or home, fearful, sad or want to be       left alone.        Teenagers may refuse to follow rules, talk back more often,       talk about the event or deny it happened, withdraw, engage in       risky behaviors, change sleeping or eating patterns, have       nightmares and may turn to drugs or alcohol.        Professional help should be considered, he said, if       symptoms persist, get worse or the child's symptom are       extreme and unresponsive to attempts to help.    NYREE CLAYTON-TAYLOR--2019 KENTUCKY ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER OF THE                                    YEAR         Teaching predominately African American students in West       Louisville, NyRee Clayton-Taylor recognized symptoms of       suffering--anger and lashing out, or withdrawal and not doing       the work. Kids would tell her about an uncle who was shot, a       father lost to gun violence, parents in prison. Some couldn't       find words to express themselves.        So, Clayton-Taylor, a resource teacher at Wheatley       Elementary School, created a curriculum around their joys in       life, their interests, their culture. Her energy, creativity       and impact earned her recognition as the 2919 Kentucky       Elementary School Teacher of the Year.        ``Academics will not happen if a student is not healed,''       she said. ``I decided to infuse academics with healing so       they could get it at one time.''        Her solution was to use hip hop, the popular music genre       especially among African American youth, as a primary       teaching tool, along with rap, graffiti artwork, and books       about African American history and culture to help children       focus, write, create, work in teams, and solve problems, all       beneficial lifelong skills.        ``I had to bring in hip hop. It was a must so that they       could have a narrative that was their own,'' said Clayton-      Taylor, now in her 20th year of teaching.        In a nationally represented survey, 8.2 percent of all       children, from age 2-17, were reported to have witnessed gun       violence or heard gunshots in their communities. Youth ages       14-17 had the highest exposure at nearly 17 percent. Source:       Finkelhor D, Turner HA, Shattuck A, Hamby SL.
