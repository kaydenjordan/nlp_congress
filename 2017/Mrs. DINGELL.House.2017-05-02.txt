 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and  underlying bill, and I thank my colleague from Colorado for yielding.   Contrary to its name, the Working Families Flexibility Act provides  no flexibility for working families but makes it harder to plan  financially at a time when wages have stagnated and American workers  are working harder than ever.   The 40-hour workweek is a long established American way of life--a  way of life won by hardworking American men and women. This legislation  aims to undermine the Fair Labor Standards Act and the 40-hour workweek  by handing even more power over to employers by giving them the right  to not pay for overtime hours.   This legislation amounts to a handout for large American companies at  the expense of their workers. Hardworking Americans can't afford to  loan their bosses overtime pay for months at a time. Employees would  also find themselves at a disadvantage if they wanted to get paid for  overtime instead of opting for comp time. Companies would find it in  their financial interest to select comp time workers instead of workers  who want overtime pay. This isn't the flexibility that American workers  need.   The bill is right about one thing: American workers do deserve an  update to the FLSA. If they really want to talk about helping American  working families gain more flexibility in the workplace, Congress  should be taking up bills on paid sick days, paid family and medical  leave, and a real increase in wages.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.
