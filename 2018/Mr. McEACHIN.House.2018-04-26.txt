 Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, this amendment seeks to preempt important State-level  protections that help ensure truck drivers are treated fairly and that  they are able to do their jobs safely.   This language would not just erase existing meal and rest break  requirements for truckers, it would affect all State and local wage and  hour laws, with adverse implications for everything from workers'  compensation to the minimum wage. Such changes would be deeply harmful,  and I urge my colleagues to oppose them.
