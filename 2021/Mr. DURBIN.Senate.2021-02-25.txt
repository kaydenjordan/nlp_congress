 Mr. President, a lot of people are familiar with this  saying. It goes like this:         Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night shall       [delay] these couriers from the swift completion of their       appointed rounds.    That is the motto of the U.S. Postal Service, inscribed on the  buildings, and emblazoned in our memories of the dutiful work and  awesome responsibility of the U.S. Postal Service throughout our  history.   I am proud of the Postal Service, and most Americans are as well. If  you ask many people ``What is your contact with the Federal Government,  the U.S. Federal Government?'' they might be hard-pressed to identify  it, but when you mention the Postal Service, they say ``Of course. Six  days a week, my mailman, the person delivering the mail.''   During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, many of us stayed home in our  neighborhoods for lengthy periods of time. It became a routine that  when the mailman came each day, as he did, we went out to greet him  with masks  [[Page S881]]  on and chatted for just a moment or two.   It was a tough assignment. They were no longer showing up at 2 p.m.  in the afternoon as usual but sometimes 7 and 8 o'clock at night. They  kept up with their responsibility.   I say that because I want to preface these remarks by letting  everyone know that I am proud of the Postal Service. I will fight to  keep it in business serving America, and I know that it is going  through extreme hardship at the present time.   But 2 nights ago, I was on a town meeting call with Alderman Leslie  Hairston of the Fifth Ward in Chicago. She asked me to come on the call  because of the problems that she is having in the Hyde Park area. She  wanted me to hear some of the situations that they were facing in the  Fifth Ward.   The U.S. Postal Service, unfortunately, is a lifeline that is being  threatened at the current time. So many people in Chicago and all  across the country depend on it for regular, prompt mail service to  deliver everything from birthday cards to bills, cards, checks, and  medicine. Yet, for months now, mail delivery has been slow and  unpredictable for millions of Americans.   I have heard from many Chicago-area residents, just like I heard the  other night, and small businesses that have gone upwards of a month--a  month--without the delivery of mail. These delays are having a  devastating impact on the lives of families in my State.   One Chicago man said that after receiving no mail for 3 weeks, he  went to the local post office to check where his mail was. He waited in  line for 6 hours before he finally was given his mail. Another woman  wrote me that she worries that missing bills will hurt her credit  rating, making it even harder for her to make ends meet. Another woman  wrote that she worries that missing bills will hurt not only her credit  rating but could hurt her personally by denying basic prescriptions and  medicine that she counts on. Small business owners are losing customers  because their mail-order deliveries are delayed or just flat disappear.   But this vivid example that brings these together is the story of Ms.  Carmella McCoy Gonzalez. She has a disability. She is unable to travel  really much outside her home--restrictions that have become even more  constraining during the pandemic. Ms. McCoy Gonzalez suffers from high  blood pressure and a heart condition, making her regular delivery of  medication essential. However, she reports that for the past few  months, she and her neighbors are lucky if they get mail delivered one  day a week. She told my office that a shipment of medicine sent on  February 8 didn't reach her home until February 23, while others just  simply didn't arrive at all.   When they reached out to the local post office, they were told that  they wouldn't be getting any mail because there weren't enough carriers  to deliver it. In fact, a report from the Postal Service Office of  the Inspector General in early February found that the reason there  weren't enough postal carriers to deliver the mail is that the  administrators just hadn't bothered removing the names of employees who  no longer worked there. This meant they weren't able to bring in  additional staff when needed to deliver a growing backlog of delayed  mail.    The report noted that more than 60,000--60,000--pieces of mail had  been delayed in Chicago neighborhoods over a period of several weeks.  These delays are not new, and they are certainly not confined to  Chicago. U.S. Postal Service customers in many States have endured  delays and other problems with mail service for months. Veterans are  going without medication that has been mailed to them from the VA.  Small businesses are missing delivery dates. Families are missing  paychecks and not receiving notices of premiums due in time.   Timely, reliable mail delivery is always important, and it is  especially critical now. Receiving medications and other important  deliveries enables people to stay safely at home rather than to  venturing out and risking COVID infections.   Regular mail service helps sustain the economy during an  unprecedented public health crisis by providing a low-cost shipping  option for small businesses that are struggling to survive. Yet, rather  than focusing on how to fix the current delivery delays, U.S. Postal  Service leaders are now considering changes that could result in higher  prices and even more delays. This is no plan to fix the Postal Service;  it is a plan to sabotage the Postal Service in order to benefit its  commercial competitors.   Cut service, raise prices, then lose customers because you cut  services and raised prices, and then just repeat that destructive cycle  again and again until there are little or no customers left--that is  the plan of the Postal Service under Postmaster General DeJoy, and  Congress needs to step in. We must demand that the Postmaster General  implement new policies and operational changes immediately to end  delivery delays in Chicago and across the country. Congress needs to  ensure the Postal Service has all the resources and tools it needs to  provide reliable and affordable services during this critical time and  to come out of this pandemic on secure financial footing.   Our Founders understood that reliable and affordable mail service was  essential to our economy and our national unity. The Postal Service is  the one public service that is so important that it is actually  mentioned by name in the Constitution. We cannot allow its temporary  custodians, appointed by the previous administration, to kill it with a  death of a thousand cuts in order to enrich private competitors,  especially during this pandemic.   This situation is grave and serious. For a lot of people, the delay  of a day or two in receiving mail is just an inconvenience; for others,  it could be a matter of life or death literally when so many medicines  are moving through the mail, prescriptions and medications that people  count on for their livelihood. And it really is something that has been  so fundamental in America.   We have to ask the basic question: What is going on here? I am happy  to report that yesterday the Biden administration announced that they  were appointing three new Governors to fill three vacancies on the  Postal Board of Governors. Those vacancies have been too long in  festering and creating the situation we have today.   The Postmaster General, Mr. DeJoy, who came to this position in  controversy when he started suggesting he was going to delay the  delivery of ballots in the previous election of November 3, is adamant  that he is going to continue on his mission. We have to intervene on  behalf of the people whom we represent and on behalf of this country.   I stand by the Postal Service. I believe in the men and women who  make it work. And everyone I have met--certainly in my neighborhood and  the ones who have been coming to my home over the years--almost became  a part of the family. I knew all about their families and some of the  problems and wonderful things that were happening in their lives. That  was part of the experience, the postal experience, in smalltown America  that we want to preserve. But when it comes to the big cities, we have  to be sensitive to that as well. When massive amounts of mail are being  held in trailer trucks behind the post office, not being sorted and  delivered, it is just absolutely, positively unacceptable.   If COVID-19 among the workforce is one of the reasons, let's address  that directly--in terms of vaccinations, No. 1; in terms of replacement  employees or temporary employees, No. 2; whatever it takes to keep the  Postal Service at the highest quality.   I urge my colleagues, when you go home, if you are hearing the same  stories about the U.S. Postal Service, let's make this a bipartisan  response. Families and businesses and vulnerable individuals across  America are counting on us.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, this week America reached a heartbreaking  milestone, one that would have seemed unthinkable a year ago. We have  now lost more than 500,000 Americans to the COVID-19 pandemic. That is  one in every five COVID-19 deaths in the world. We have lost mothers  and fathers, sisters and brothers, friends, neighbors, and coworkers.  On Monday evening, President Biden, Vice President Harris, and their  spouses remembered all of these lost souls in a moving ceremony at the  White House. Behind them, 500 flickering candles lined the White House  stairs, each candle representing a thousand lives cut short by the  virus, a thousand grieving families. In addition, more than 28 million  Americans have been infected by the coronavirus in this pandemic   No State, no community in America, has been spared in this sadness.  In my State of Illinois, COVID-19 has claimed more than 20,000 lives.  My heart goes out to and every American trying to survive in this  terribly difficult year. I have heard others say, and I agree: This  pandemic will not break us, but it is showing us where we are  broken.Like so many other diseases and health conditions, the pandemic  has inflicted disproportionate harm on people and communities of  color--Black Americans, Native Americans, and members of the Latinx  community.   Black Americans get sick and die of COVID at 1.5 times the rate of  White Americans. Despite their greater risks of infection and death,  people of color are receiving COVID vaccinations at less than half the  rate as White Americans. In Illinois, Black residents make up 15  percent and Latinx residents make up 18 percent of our State's  population, yet each group accounts for  [[Page S885]]  only 8 percent of the COVID vaccines allocated so far.   Sadly, these statistics come as no surprise. America has a long  history of medical inequality. From premature births to premature  deaths, people of color suffer disproportionately from America's  troubled health care system. People of color in America suffer more  chronic and acute health conditions. They are more likely to go without  needed medical care, and they have shorter life expectancies. According  to new estimates from the CDC, life expectancy in the United States  fell by a full year as COVID-19 swept through the Nation last year--the  steepest decline in life expectancy since World War II. Again, the pain  was unequal. Latinx Americans' life expectancy declined by 2 years and  Black Americans' by 3 years. The reasons for the disparities are many  and varied, but they include unequal access to affordable healthcare,  inadequate research, and too few healthcare professionals of color.   Martin Luther King called healthcare inequality ``the most shocking  and inhumane'' form of injustice. Far too often, this inequality begins  even before birth. It should shock our consciences that the United  States, one of the wealthiest nations on Earth, has one of the world's  poorest records for maternal and infant health. Think of this: The  United States is one of only 13 nations in the world where the maternal  mortality rate is worse now than it was 25 years ago. Every year in  America, nearly 1,000 women die from pregnancy-related complications  and 70,000 others suffer near-fatal complications as a result of  pregnancy. Now consider this: Women of color in the United States are  three times more likely than White women to die as a result of their  pregnancy. In Illinois, they are six times as likely to die. What makes  these maternal deaths even more tragic is that an estimated 60 percent  of them are preventable. The same is true of many infant deaths. Every  year in America, more than 23,000 infants die due to factors that, in  many cases, could be prevented. Among the 35 wealthiest nations in the  world, the United States ranks 32nd in infant mortality. Again, the  risks are unequal. Black babies are twice as likely to die in their  first year of life as White babies.   I have given a lot of thought and spoken with many experts about how  we can bridge this racial divide. This week, I am reintroducing a bill  with Senator Duckworth that I believe can decrease America's rates of  maternal and infant sickness and deaths, especially among those of  color. It is called the MOMMA Act. My companion in the House is  Congresswoman Robin Kelly of Chicago. She and I have introduced this  bill for the last two Congresses. It is time to make it law.   First and foremost, the MOMMA Act would expand Medicaid coverage for  new moms from 60 days to a full year postpartum. Making sure new moms  have health coverage for a full year postpregnancy will go a long way  toward catching, preventing, and treating potentially life-threatening  conditions and problems. This is critical because in some States--like  Illinois--nearly 60 percent of pregnancy-associated deaths occur  between 43 and 364 days postpartum. Many States' Medicaid Programs,  including Illinois's are strapped for cash, and the pandemic has  increased their shortfalls. In addition, our bill would provide States  with guidance and options to expand their Medicaid coverage to include  doulas, who are often invaluable assets and advocates for pregnant  women. Next, our bill would save lives by improving health care  education and training to reduce the unconscious biases and  discrimination that woman of color too often encounter from healthcare  professionals. Lastly, our bill would improve hospital coordination and  reporting on maternal health outcomes. Accurate reporting will enable  us to chart our progress and make adjustments where and when they are  needed.   Among the women at greatest risk of pregnancy-related health  complications are women who are incarcerated. Again, the risks for  Black women are greater. To help these mothers and their babies,  Senator Booker and I have introduced a separate bill. The Justice for  Incarcerated Moms Act helps incarcerated pregnant women and new mothers  with access to doulas and other health workers, as well as counseling,  because a jail sentence should never be a death sentence for a mother  or her newborn. As the poet Maya Angelou told us, we can't change the  past. But when we know better, we must do better. We now know how we  can do better to protect the lives of pregnant women and newborn  babies. I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting these two  important measures to give mothers and babies the healthy start in life  that they deserve.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
