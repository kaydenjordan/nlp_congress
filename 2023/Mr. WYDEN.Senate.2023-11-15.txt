 Mr. President, I am announcing my intent to object to any  unanimous consent request to proceed to S.1490, the Kids Online Safety  Act.   I agree with the sponsors of this bill that social media and online  games can have a negative impact on the mental health of minors.  However, this bill makes the mistake of empowering State attorneys  general already enforcing bans on LGBTQ information and prosecuting  individuals for helping others receive abortion healthcare. Armed with  this bill, all a State attorney general would need to do is link the  content they want to scrub from the internet with causing ``anxiety''  or ``depression'' and demonstrate that the platform allowed minors to  access such content. For everyone except the largest platforms, the act  of being served with the complaint, no matter how specious, would be  enough incentive to take down the content in question. Sadly, some  deep-pocketed groups that promote anti-choice and anti-LGBTQ policies  are cheerleading the bill for this reason.   Until the bill is amended to foreclose the ability of State attorneys  general to wage war on important reproductive and LGBTQ content, I will  object to any unanimous consent request in relation to this  legislation.                            ____________________
