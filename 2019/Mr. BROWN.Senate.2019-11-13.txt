 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, earlier this week, we celebrated Veterans  Day, a day we honor the sacrifice and the service of those who fought  in Normandy and Pearl Harbor and Inchon, at Khe Sanh, Somalia, Bosnia- Herzegovina, Kandahar, Mosul, and everywhere else where veterans work  to protect our country. We owe them and their families a debt that we  often fall short in repaying. That is what this is about today.   For years, the VA has been presented with scientific information from  the National Academy of Sciences making it clear that the list of the  conditions stemming from Agent Orange exposure is extensive. It  includes hyperthyroidism, bladder cancer, Parkinson's-like symptoms,  and hypertension. In the late iteration of the Veterans and Agent  Orange Exposure Update 11, published a year ago, the National Academies  recognized that those illnesses--hypothyroidism, bladder cancer,  Parkinson's-like symptoms, and hypertension--all have suggestive or  sufficient evidence associated with Agent Orange.   Historically, the VA added illnesses in those two categories to the  list of presumptive medical conditions associated with Agent Orange  exposure. On a bipartisan basis, this Congress has done the right thing  time after time. We are all on the same side when it comes to helping  veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange in Vietnam.   We recently found out that former VA Secretary Shulkin decided to add  three of these conditions to the list of presumptive medical conditions  associated with that exposure only to have OMB--the Trump  administration--block his decision. In an email to Director Mulvaney,  Secretary Shulkin said adding these conditions was ``imperative.'' Yet  no action took place. There are 83,000 veterans living with at least 1  of the presumptive medical conditions--83,000. They are in Tennessee.  They are in Georgia. They are in South Dakota. They are in Ohio. In a  discussion with blue water Navy veterans last week, I learned that  since the Department put a stay on adjudicating their Agent Orange  claims earlier this year, 12 veterans have died. Time is running out.  Some might accuse this body of waiting until they all die. As hard as  it is to say that and hear that, we are waiting until they all die  before we move.   For whatever political reason the administration seems to place on  this, we need to ensure that veterans receive the healthcare and the  compensation they earned. They shouldn't have to fight these one at a  time when there are sick men and women veterans of Vietnam. We did this  to them. The American Government decided to spray Agent Orange. We knew  it was harmful. We know it is harmful. We knew it then, and we know it  now. The chemical companies knew and the government knew. Why does the  administration now think it is OK to abandon our commitment to these  veterans? If you are exposed to poison while serving our country, there  should be no question that you deserve the benefits you earned. Period.  No exception.   Madam President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 420,  encouraging the President to expand the list of the Department of  Veterans Affairs of presumptive medical conditions associated with  exposure to Agent Orange to include parkinsonism, bladder cancer,  hypertension, hypothyroidism, which was submitted earlier today; I  further ask that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed  to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the  table with no intervening action or debate.    Senator Isakson knows this is no sort of false kind of  flattery. He knows how much I think of him. He runs the most bipartisan  committee in the Senate. I have been honored to be on it my entire 13  years in this body. No Ohioan ever served on this committee as long as  I have. I consider that a privilege, No. 1, and an opportunity to pay  people back.   I didn't serve in the military. I know Senator Isakson did. President  Trump had deferments from Vietnam. He didn't serve in the military. I  think that maybe perhaps, because I didn't serve in the military, I  should work a little bit harder to make sure those people, most of whom  are older than I by a little bit, during the Vietnam war--that they be  treated better than they were by the country and by the public upon  their return from Vietnam; that they, in this case, get the benefit of  the doubt and the history of what happened with Agent Orange.   You may remember years and years ago, veterans--people who had fought  in Vietnam and had been exposed to Agent Orange--had to prove,  initially, case by case, why they got sick, which was darn near  impossible, especially when you are sick, trying to do that and go  through that pain.   Congress, on a bipartisan basis, did the right thing back then. They  put a list of these illnesses together that exposure to Agent Orange  was likely responsible for. If you had one of these illnesses and you  were boots on the ground in Vietnam, you automatically qualified. You  didn't have to fight in court. You didn't have to get lawyers or do any  of that. That was then.   Now, even though Secretary Shulkin--and I don't know how many  Secretaries have come and gone. The President can't seem to keep  Secretaries of the VA or staff of the VA because of the erratic policy  he follows with veterans. The President of the United States goes to  New York and makes a great speech about veterans, and we all applaud  that, but then he is not willing to give them the benefit of the doubt.  These are four illnesses Secretary Shulkin thought--you heard the term  I used earlier, which is the term he used--he used the term about these  conditions that it was ``imperative'' that we do something.   I understand as well as anybody how important it is to protect  taxpayers. I also remember less than 2 years ago that Congress gave a  tax cut--hundreds of billions of dollars, and 70 percent of it went to  the richest 1 percent of people in this country--and we can't come up  with a few billion dollars to help veterans who are dying from these  four illnesses? We can't expand this list and give them healthcare as  we try to comfort them at the VA in Cleveland and Dayton and Cincinnati  and Columbus and in Atlanta--all over? This is no end run around  process. These aren't four illnesses I heard somebody talk about in  Steubenville or Cleveland that ought to be covered. These are four  illnesses the VA has looked at, the scientific community has looked at,  the medical community has looked at, and Secretary Shulkin--who served  as Secretary of the VA, appointed by President Trump, initially was  acting under President Obama--we can't give them the benefit of the  doubt? This is no end run. We can't give them the benefit of the doubt  and say, yes, we should cover this. I hope the chairman of the  Veterans' Committee--that at some point we can sit down and talk and he  can reconsider.   Why do we think we need to protect President Trump, who, like me,  didn't serve in the military? For me, it--I will not get into that. But  why can't we help these veterans and give them the benefit of the  doubt, cover these illnesses, and move forward with the VA taking care  of people the way we should?    Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Thune's comments about  the USMCA. Some might call it NAFTA 1.6. It just doesn't do very much.  I was not in this body when NAFTA passed. I was down the hall in the  House of Representatives. I voted against it.   I saw what NAFTA did to my State and what it did to our country in  the number of lost manufacturing jobs. States in the industrial Midwest  still have not recovered from that legislation, from that trade  agreement--the North American Free Trade Agreement. During the Clinton  administration, I opposed the President of my own party on this. In the  Bush administration, the other party pushed the one for Central  America. There was one after another after another of these trade  agreements, and we see the lost jobs. President Trump made a huge  campaign promise that he was going to do something about it, and this  agreement simply doesn't do it.   We have talked to the U.S. Trade Representative repeatedly about  enforcing labor standards. The whole point of fixing this agreement is  so that companies will not shut down in Mansfield, in Zanesville, and  in Lima, OH, and move to Mexico to build plants there and sell the  products back to the United States. Yet do you know what is happening?  Even the USMCA has no language in it that is going to stop the  outsourcing of jobs. So, if this Congress moves on the USMCA, you can  bet that month after month after month, we are going to lose  manufacturing jobs, that the business plan of shutting down production  in Ohio, in Rhode Island, in North or South Dakota, or in Montana will  continue, and that the USMCA will not do anything about it.   This is the same President who went to Youngstown, OH, as Lordstown  was about to shut down, and said: Don't sell your homes. We are going  to bring those jobs back.   No, we aren't. GM moved more and more jobs to Mexico at the same time  it shut down the GM plant in Lordstown, OH. There were 4,500 jobs lost.  This USMCA is simply a wallpapering over of an agreement. It doesn't do  what you have to do to stop the outsourcing of jobs.   I look at trade agreements in one way. Does it mean more jobs in our  country or does it mean fewer jobs? The USMCA will do nothing to stem  the tide of jobs that are moving to Mexico. That is why we should go  back to the table and include the Brown-Wyden amendment on labor  enforcement--language that will, in fact, mean there will be more  prosperity in both countries.   I thank Senator Whitehouse for yielding the floor.    Mr. President, I always appreciate Senator Menendez  standing up for human rights all over the world, and this is one of the  worst human rights violations the world has seen in the last 150 years.  I thank my friend from New Jersey.                            ____________________     Mr. President, judges make decisions around the country.  They are making them right now on workers' rights, voters' rights,  women's rights, civil rights, LGBTQ rights--decisions that would limit  those rights for a generation.   We used to be able to rely on judges to expand human rights and civil  rights and all rights of humankind. Today, we cringe so often because  of judges who get selected by this President who put their thumbs on  the scale to support corporations over workers and health insurance  companies over patients and Wall Street over consumers.   These same judges make decisions on healthcare and sentencing and  corporate power. That is why we can't afford to have Steven Menashi on  the Federal bench. On all of these issues, his record makes it clear  that he is not on the side of the people we were sent here to serve.   There is a simple rule for understanding where Steve Menashi stands  on any issue: If a policy helps ordinary, hard-working Americans,  Menashi opposes it. He argued that gun safety regulation is ``pointless  and self-defeating.'' We are talking about commonsense background  checks that 85 percent of the American public supports, all blocked by  the gun manufacturers. Tell that to the people of Dayton whose lives  were torn apart and ended in some cases by gun violence. Tell them  background checks are pointless.   Menashi also advised Stephen Miller on immigration policy--the man  who stands in the way of comprehensive immigration reform and helped  orchestrate the separation--the ripping of children from their parents'  arms. Menashi refused to answer any questions about whether he worked  on the Trump family separation policy with Stephen Miller.   He has been a senior adviser to Betsy DeVos at the Department of  Education, where we have seen one disastrous decision after another.  The headline in the New York Times says it all: ``Appeals Court Nominee  Shaped DeVos's Illegal Loan Forgiveness Effort.'' Menashi devised the  scheme to illegally use people's Social Security data to deny them debt  relief after they were scammed by for-profit colleges. It seems that  the Department of Education with Menashi there always sided with the  for-profit schools against Denison or Ohio State or the University of  Toledo or Lourdes or Case Western or any of the traditional, excellent  schools of higher education in this country.   We have seen how shady schools like Corinthian used deceptive and  even illegal tactics to trick Ohioans into taking out huge loans, only  to then close up shop and leave them with meaningless degrees or  credits--often falling short even of that but always with mountains of  debt. We need to hold these for-profit schools accountable, but, of  course, we learned not to hold our breath when it comes to the Trump  administration holding any of the elite in this country accountable.   Instead of figuring out how to provide relief for students, DeVos and  [[Page S6576]]  Menashi went to work figuring out how to let the schools that scammed  them off the hook. Be clear--it was not Menashi just doing his job  advocating for someone else's bad policy; he wrote the memo. It is  clear that he actually supported and supports Betsy DeVos's radical  agenda.   Now they want to put him on the Federal bench so he can put his thumb  on the scales of justice for shady for-profit schools over students and  corporations over workers and, as I said, for Wall Street and insurance  companies over patients. We have seen that from judge after judge after  judge with President Trump, but even by those Trump standards, Menashi  is particularly bad.   It always comes down to whose side you are on. Are you a judge who  will stand on the side of workers or stand on the side of corporations?  Will you stand on the side of students--struggling students, moderate- income and sometimes low-income students trying to build better lives  for themselves--or on the side of failed sham schools? His record is  clear.   The stakes for Ohio are too high to give Steve Menashi a lifetime  appointment on the Federal bench.                            ____________________     Mr. President, yesterday we got another reminder of the  urgency in the pension crisis facing more than 1 million workers and  retirees with the news that Dean Foods is filing for bankruptcy. The  company is part of the Central States Pension Fund. The bankruptcy puts  the pension fund that much closer to insolvency, that much closer to  having to turn to the PBGC for help, and that much closer to knocking  down the dominoes that could bring down our whole multiemployer pension  system and potentially and even likely trigger a recession. We have to  act now for the sake of our economy, for the sake of thousands of small  businesses, and for the sake of a million Americans who are on the  verge of facing massive cuts to the pensions they earned.   This crisis affects thousands of Ohioans. It affects the massive  Central States Pension Plan, the United Workers Pension Plan, the  Ironworkers Local 17 Pension Plan, the Southwest Ohio carpenters, the  bakers and confectioners, and many others. It touches every State in  this Nation. If the system collapses, it won't be just retirees who  will feel the pain. Current workers will be stuck paying into pensions  they will never receive. Small businesses will be left drowning in  pension liability they can't afford to pay. That will have ripple  effects throughout the economy. If we do nothing, this can trigger a  recession on par with the housing crisis. We know who gets hurt the  worst. It is the small businesses, workers, and the retirees who are  counting on these pensions to survive.   People in this town so often don't understand the collective  bargaining process. People give up dollars today at the bargaining  table for the promise of a secure retirement with good healthcare and a  pension. These workers' lives and livelihoods will be devastated if  Congress doesn't do its job.   I think about the words of Larry Ward at a hearing in Ohio last year.  He said:         I don't understand how it is that Congress would even       consider asking us to take a cut to my pension or to see it       going away, when it had no problem sending billions to the       Wall Street crooks who caused this problem in the first       place. They used that to pay themselves bonuses. We use our       pensions to pay for medicine and food and heat.    Think about that. Wall Street uses this pension money for bonuses.  Mr. Ward and his other workers and retirees use their pensions to pay  for medicine and food and heat. There is something wrong with this  picture. It is bad enough that Wall Street squandered workers' money;  it is worse that the government, which is supposed to look out for  these folks, is ignoring the promise to these workers.   I know there are Senators in both parties working in good faith to  fix this, but this bankruptcy is a reminder that we are running short  on time to come up with the bipartisan solution we need.   It comes back to the dignity of work. When work has dignity, we honor  the retirement security that people earned. When work has dignity, we  fight for those workers, we honor workers, and we respect workers.   I urge my colleagues in this body, let's pass a solution that honors  their work, that honors the dignity of work, and that keeps our promise  to the people who make this country work.   I yield the floor.
