 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the COMPETES  Act. And quite frankly, I am stunned to hear some of the rhetoric  coming from the other side around a bill that finally, after decades,  recognizes that we are in a very stiff competition with China, and for  the longest time America didn't know it.   China was in this competition. China was doing everything they could  to dump steel in our country. They spend 7 to 9 percent of their GDP on  infrastructure every year. They got islands in the South China Sea.  They told us they weren't going to militarize them; now they have.   They have bases in Africa, long-term raw material contracts in  African countries to solidify their control of precious metals so that  our phones, our weapons systems, our computers, they have a plan.   This is not complicated. But it is being seen through the prism of  our current, broken, insane political system.   And so what we are trying to do here is recognize that they are  winning. Seventy percent of chip manufacturing comes out of China. The  cargo ships along the California ports, those aren't coming from  Kansas. They are coming  [[Page H343]]  from China. Over 50 percent of the electric vehicle market is dominated  by China.   And so the thoughtful thing, the smart, strategic thing for us to do  in the United States is one, recognize this, and two, make sure we  reinvest back into the United States, which is what we did with the  bipartisan infrastructure bill.   Twenty Republicans in the Senate, led by Senator Portman from Ohio-- who I commend for his leadership--said we have got to rebuild our  country. Broadband, infrastructure, bridges are collapsing in  Pittsburgh. We have got to fix this stuff.   Workforce development, we have got to plug these communities in, if  we are going to win. And so that is what we did in a bipartisan way.   And so the next step is: How do we bring the chip manufacturing back?  How do we rebuild the industrial base here in places like Ohio? That  means we have to have a strategy that invests into the country. That is  what the COMPETES Act does. $52 billion to move these chip  manufacturers back.   And what is stunning to me about how radical the right wing has  become in this country, is that this isn't: Oh, we are going to invest  this money and maybe we will get a deal; maybe someone will locate in  the industrial Midwest. Last week, Intel announced a $20 billion  investment north of Columbus, Ohio, with over 100 suppliers in that  State that will benefit from locating there: thousands of construction  jobs.   And you know what they said? If we pass the COMPETES Act, if we pass  this bill, it is going to become a $100 billion investment in the  Midwest.   And all we are saying is: If there is nothing else we can agree on in  the United States Congress, I hope that it is this bill. I hope it is  infrastructure. But it is culture war du jour. I mean, what a joke.   China has a 10-year plan, 50-year plan, 100-year plan. We live in a  24-hour news cycle talking about Dr. Seuss, Big Bird, M&Ms, Sponge Bob,  and we are getting our clock cleaned.   And this is an attempt, by us, hopefully, in a bipartisan way-- doesn't look that way, but hopefully, in a bipartisan way--to actually  prepare America, post-pandemic, post-economic collapse, to bring back  manufacturing. And it is already happening. This is already happening.   We saw all the leaders in Ohio: Democrat, Republican, Governor  DeWine, Lieutenant Governor Husted, JobsOhio, under a Republican  Governor, J.P. Nauseef, the Columbus Partnership, Kenny McDonald, the  business leaders, everybody, the unions--and this bill creates 1  million union apprentices in the next 5 years to build this stuff.   Wake up. Wake up. We are losing. And this is a step forward for  America to start leading the way and leading the country again.                            ____________________
