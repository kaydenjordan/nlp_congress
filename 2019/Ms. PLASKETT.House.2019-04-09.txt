 Mr. Speaker, basic healthcare coverage for 23 million  everyday Americans and thousands of people in my district of the Virgin  Islands is at risk of being undermined because our friends across the  aisle fail to have the same urgency about these impending calamities.   Virgin Islanders are at a critical junction. We face a daunting and  devastating Medicaid cliff on September 30, 2019, an absolute collapse  in Medicaid.   Our Republican colleagues continue the work to dismantle healthcare  for millions of Americans right now. They voted to eliminate protection  for preexisting conditions and to strip their healthcare coverage.   Last weekend, the Trump administration escalated its attack on  Americans' healthcare by supporting a Federal judge's ruling that the  entire Affordable Care Act should be thrown out.   Today, I ask my Republican colleagues: What side will history find  you on, protecting American families or the need to protect partisan  interests?   A demonstration of this was the Republican-controlled Senate's  failure last week to advance a disaster aid package that includes  billions for American families still recovering from 2017 natural  disasters.   Be on the right side of history.                            ____________________
