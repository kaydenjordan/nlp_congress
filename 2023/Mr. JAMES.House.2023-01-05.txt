 Madam Clerk, I rise to nominate Kevin McCarthy for Speaker  of the House.   Madam Clerk, there has been a lot of talk about history over the last  few days. 1856 was the last time it took longer than 9 votes to find a  Speaker of the House. It took 133 votes over 2 months.   Without question, the issues that divide us today are much less  severe than they were in 1856. In fact, there is far more that unites  us than divides us, regardless of our political party or ideology.   The issues today are over a few rules and personalities, while the  issues at that time were about slavery and whether the value of a man  who looks like me was 60 percent or 100 percent of a human being.   It was a long, drawn-out, painful process, but it needed to happen.  In the end, Nathaniel Banks won by the slimmest of margins. But the  margins don't matter when your policies are on the right side of  history. On that day, long ago, the good guys won. On that day, long  ago, the abolitionists won. On that day, the people who believed in  [[Page H20]]  freedom and self-determination won. The leading Republican nominee won  then, and the leading Republican nominee will win again today.   Since then, our Nation has made a lot of progress. That includes  families like mine. My family has gone from slave to the floor of the  United States House of Representatives, being the first Member of his  freshman class to speak.   In a series of five generations, my family has gone from slave to  right here since 1856. My father and mother were born in the 1940s and  1950s in the Jim Crow South, and my dad lived directly across the  street from a school he couldn't go to because he was Black. He started  a business with one truck, one trailer, no excuses, with the help of  his wife, and now his son stands here on the precipice of taking back  the majority for the American people and taking this Nation in the  right direction.   I am a freshman. I have only been here a couple of days, but I have  heard a lot of D.C. politicians tell me about how broken D.C. is. I  don't need D.C. politicians to tell me how broken D.C. is. The American  people have already told us how broken D.C. is by giving the  Republicans the majority so we can fix this mess.                                time  1215    We will counter the socialist movement of envy and confiscation with  a conservative movement of access and opportunity. We will stand on the  right side of history again. We will end the growth of government, and  we will stop 87,000 new IRS agents from picking through your  pocketbooks. We will secure our energy independence. We will ban the  sale of petroleum from our strategic reserves to China. We will  establish a bipartisan select committee specifically to keep our eye on  the ball in China. We will address the crisis at the border that is  killing Americans by the day and improve both our safety in our Nation  and our dignity for those who come here in search of a better life.   But not yet. We are still stuck at the starting block. The American  people have told us, by putting a Republican majority here, that they  want Republicans to lead, and they want a government that works and  doesn't embarrass them. We are failing on both missions, and that must  change today.   Benjamin Franklin said: We must hang together, or we will, most  assuredly, hang separately.   We are stuck in a malaise, at an impasse, and we will stay here and  not be able to fight the real conservative fight until we find a way to  come together and fight that mission together.   Yesterday, we experienced, very briefly, our first win. It was a  small victory. It was a small victory, but didn't it feel good? We have  been working hard for that victory, and there are much more to come.   As a cadet at West Point, I learned the phrase that has always been  my motto throughout my life: ``Mission first, people always.''   Right now, the people are left out. Right now, they don't have a  Congress to speak for them at the highest level of government. Right  now, every individual in this room can concede that the rounds that we  have taken are not what we told our constituents we would do. We told  them that we would fight the opioid crisis.   For perspective, there is a hallowed monument that my father took me  to. My father is a Vietnam veteran. This monument has a total length of  500 feet, nearly 2 football fields. It is 10 feet high, and the letters  are only a half inch, with 58,000 names, for a war that lasted years.  According to the CDC, in 2021, we lost almost twice as many people as  we lost in Vietnam to overdoses. We lost 600 Americans to overdoses  since Tuesday.   We are talking about the debt rising. You can't count how many  dollars we have spent of our great-grandchildren's money since Tuesday.   The work we promised the American people we would do, we are welching  on that promise. But I have hope. I have hope that we will be able to  come together unified and put the right person in leadership. From  many, one, e pluribus unum.   I am standing here today because I am the seventh Member to stand up  in support of Kevin McCarthy for Speaker. He has earned my trust. The  first time we met was in his office under the watchful gaze of a  Frederick Douglass painting. He told me in that office, on the eve of  the 2019 State of the Union address, that there is nothing that could  be said or done during that address that embarrassed him more than the  fact that when the Democrat side stood up, they would look more like  the United States of America than we do.   He set out not to compromise our values, not to compromise our  ideology, but to work harder to make sure that more people with diverse  perspectives and different lived experiences could be here. In the very  next election, he won 14 seats up from 199. All the seats he won were  with minorities, women, and veterans. The very next cycle, this next  cycle, he helped me and my good buddy and classmate, the Congressman  from Texas, Wes Hunt, double the number of Black Republicans in the  Republican Conference.    We have a long way to go, but we have come so far. We have come so  far. We can't quit. We can't quit. You don't fire a guy who is winning.   Look at the Governor's mansions and legislatures we lost across the  country just this past cycle and look at the gains that Kevin McCarthy  has made uphill, getting the gavel as minority leader in half the time.  The mainstream media likes to laud the leadership of Nancy Pelosi.  Kevin McCarthy won the gavel back as minority leader in half the time  going uphill.   We want to talk about people who can win. I am a Lions' fan, and I am  well acquainted with snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. We need  to learn how to win. We need to learn how to take victory.   With Kevin McCarthy's leadership, he has given us victories on rules.  He has given us victories on keeping costs down. He has given us  victories with winning the majority back. I am so proud to be a part of  the majority-making class. He has earned my trust, and, hopefully, he  will earn your trust.   He has got 90 percent of us in the Conference. When is the last time  any of us had 90 percent approval ratings?   Kevin McCarthy, you will see up there, has over 90 percent approval  ratings. If you really want to start making history, let's do it the  right way.   We need a conservative fighter to help this country get back on the  right track, but the first thing we need to do is elect Leader McCarthy  as Speaker of the House.   I am ready to make history, and I know you are. I am excited to work  with each and every single one of you because we have a job to do.   At the direction of the Republican Conference, I advance the name of  Kevin McCarthy as Speaker of the House for the 118th Congress.   The CLERK. The Clerk recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr.  Aguilar).
