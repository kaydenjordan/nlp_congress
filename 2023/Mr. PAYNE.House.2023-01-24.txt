 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss smoking in the House  of Representatives.   In yet another self-serving move, the Republicans have allowed  smoking in House offices. It violates local and Federal law and  threatens public health.   In the last few decades, secondhand smoke has killed more than 2.5  million Americans. It causes heart disease, lung cancer, and strokes,  and it is extremely dangerous to children.   Local and Federal laws ban smoking in public and Federal buildings,  and many studies have shown that there is no safe level of exposure to  secondhand smoke.   It is a life-threatening decision that proves Republicans do not care  about the health and safety of Americans. They write the laws but don't  follow them.                            ____________________
