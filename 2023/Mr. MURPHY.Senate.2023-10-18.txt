 Madam President:         Today, our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very       freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and       deadly terrorist acts . . . Thousands of lives were suddenly       ended by evil, despicable acts of terror . . . These acts of       mass murder were intended to frighten our Nation into chaos       and retreat.    These were the words of former President George W. Bush speaking to  the Nation on the evening of September 11, 2001. But they could have  been repeated word for word by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the  wake of the heinous terrorist attacks by Hamas that left more than  1,400 dead in Israel on October 7.   As Americans, we know the horror of living through the mass murder of  our fellow citizens in a shocking terrorist attack; to be overcome with  these intertwined feelings of insecurity and fear, fury, and grief; to  be filled with the deep righteous desire for justice and retribution a  need to reconcile the moral universe by making the perpetrators of  these crimes pay a heavy price. And we know that, even as the impulse  to avenge may subside, there remains a need to deter, to show your  enemies that aggression against us will be met with overwhelming force.    Nine days after September 11, President Bush presented an ultimatum  to Afghanistan's Taliban government:         [H]and over the terrorists, or . . . share in their fate.    The United States moved swiftly to mobilize the support of the  international community and the overwhelming capabilities of the U.S.  military to destroy al-Qaida and wrest control of Afghanistan from  their Taliban hosts. It was a just mission. Neither America's security  nor the moral order of the world could have been preserved if the  Taliban remained in power, having made possible al-Qaida's training and  planning to execute the September 11 attack. Americans rallied around  the invasion of Afghanistan--so did the world.   In thinking back on those early days in the fall of 2001, America was  looking for partners, not second-guessers or critics. We would not have  taken kindly to lectures about how we should go about meting out  justice or keeping our Nation safe. Either you were with us or you were  against us. With 3,000 Americans dead, that was our mindset, and it was  an entirely understandable one.   Israel must seek justice for the 1,400 of its citizens murdered by  Hamas on October 7. Israel must bring to justice those who planned and  executed the attacks, and it must seek to destroy Hamas as an armed  group or, at the very least, destroy its capability to carry out  terrorist violence against Israelis. Israel must defend itself, just  like we had to do in 2001. This is the state's obligation to its  people.   And I, for one, will be there to support Israel, just like our  friends were there for us 20 years ago. And I, for one, am glad to see  this body, the U.S. Senate, coming together--Republicans and Democrats,  who fight over a lot of things--in our joint show of support for  Israel's defense.   But here is what I also believe. I believe that part of the way that  we support Israel is providing them with funding and with arms in order  to destroy Hamas's military capabilities, but I also believe that we  should be sharing the lessons that we learned  [[Page S5069]]  from our response to September 11 and the successive two decades of  wars waged in the name of counterterrorism.   If we are going to be honest with our friends in Israel, then we need  to admit that we often failed to see beyond our fury and that we made  mistakes by not understanding what came next after the invasion of  Afghanistan and the decapitation of our enemy. We had a day-one  strategy, but we did not have a day-two strategy, and we paid a  horrible price.   After al-Qaida fled and the Taliban government collapsed, we spent 20  years trying to ``win'' without a clear idea of what ``winning'' was,  how it would be accomplished, or how that was actually linked to making  America safer.   Now, let me be clear. The challenge Israel faces from Hamas is  different in really important ways from the al-Qaida threat to the  United States, and the lessons of America's global counterterrorism  campaign do not neatly map onto Israel's current crisis. For one, the  physical proximity of the threat is meaningful. Hamas does not operate  from a safe distance. It exists right next door, in Gaza.   America had no experience in or with Afghanistan before the  invasion--not so for Israel and Gaza. They know each other. They have  an intimate history, and that history impacts the effectiveness of the  fight to come.   Another key distinction is the disposition of the enemy. Hamas is not  hiding in caves in the Tora Bora. They are both a military and a  political entity. They live in a tightly packed corridor that is home  to more than 2 million people. Many of them have nothing to do with  Hamas.   So there is no perfect comparison between Afghanistan and Gaza, but  there are enough similarities that we should be confident in sharing  with our friends in Israel the lessons that we learned, the mistakes we  made--mistakes that Israel could avoid.   The first of those mistakes was lacking a realistic conception of  success. In Afghanistan, we set about the total and complete  elimination of ``ungoverned space'' and ``terrorist safe havens''; but  after 20 years of fighting, of raids, of targeted strikes, we finally  came to terms with a really harsh reality: Our tactics were often  producing more terrorists and insurgents than they were eliminating. We  were far too cavalier about civilian casualties and the humanitarian  cost of our pursuit of the Taliban, and it ended up simply making the  Taliban stronger.   Today, Israeli leaders talk about totally eliminating every last  Hamas fighter. It is an understandable objective, given the terror that  Hamas rained down on Israel. But is it realistic? Can the Israeli  military destroy an entire movement--not just a terrorist organization  or an armed group but a political entity that administers territory? Is  there a risk of our fate in Afghanistan--creating more terrorists than  we eliminated--repeating in Gaza?   Another mistake we made in Afghanistan was believing that every  proposal we put down on paper could, through the sheer force of  American will, become a reality on the ground. We drew up a viable plan  to replace the Taliban's kleptocratic theocracy with corruption-free  parliamentary democracy. But Afghanistan was not a fit for that plan,  and our plan, which looked good on a PowerPoint, was destined to fail.   What was an achievable outcome that we eventually, 20 years later,  settled on was eliminating al-Qaida's ability to attack the United  States and creating the political conditions on the ground in  Afghanistan so that al-Qaida would never again be granted safe harbor.  But, of course, that outcome didn't need to take 20 years. It was  likely available to the United States much earlier in the conflict.    If Israel does mount a ground invasion, the question is, of course:  What comes next?   Hamas administers Gaza. So if Hamas is eliminated, who takes their  place? Does Israel reoccupy Gaza in the long run and run Gaza directly?  That would seem like a recipe for perpetual conflict. Or does Israel  imagine that the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority could step up  and administer Gaza? I won't go into a full analysis, but there are  very few Middle East watchers who bet that that is a long-term, viable  arrangement.   Some Israeli leaders suggest that the question of the future status  of Gaza is a matter to be addressed after Israel has ``won the war.''  But what we learned in Afghanistan is that the very concept of  ``winning'' is meaningless if it is not built around the conditions of  a sustainable peace.   And what is the realistic possibility of building a post-Hamas  governing structure in Gaza, particularly when the only immediate  alternative would seem to be a renewed and indefinite occupation?   If there isn't a satisfactory answer to these questions, then the  military planning is incomplete.   But, make no mistake, America is going to support Israel in its time  of need, with funding, with weapons, with whatever they need.   But I raise these questions only because there are important lessons  that can be drawn--not perfect parallels but important lessons that can  be drawn--from both our successes and our failures.   We had to invade Afghanistan. We had to take out the Taliban. It was  the only way to square the moral universe. Israel must strike at Hamas.  Israel must destroy their military capabilities. It is the only way to  restore the balance of the moral universe. But supporting Israel also  means helping them learn from our successes and our failures and to not  reflexively repeat the same mistakes we made 20 years ago. Friends  support friends, but friends also level with friends.   I yield the floor.
