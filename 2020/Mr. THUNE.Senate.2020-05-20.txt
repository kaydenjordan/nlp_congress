 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded, and I ask unanimous consent that I be  able to conclude my remarks before the 11 o'clock vote.    Madam President, the internet has been a part of our daily  lives for quite a while now: Netflix, Twitter, and Amazon. The internet  has taken on new importance during the coronavirus pandemic. It has  become the main source of connection with friends and family. It has  enabled many people to work from home to help reduce the spread of the  virus. It is the main reason that schools and colleges have been able  to continue teaching students.   It has drastically expanded nascent services, like telehealth, which  has allowed doctors and other medical professionals to provide patient  care remotely.   With all of this new internet traffic, of course, has come a much  greater load on networks. Not all countries' networks have held up to  the strain. In Europe, networks have had to slow streaming and ask  providers like Netflix to diminish the quality of their videos.   Here in the United States, our networks have faced very few problems,  and there is a reason for that. Europe and the United States have very  different regulatory regimes for the internet. In Europe, the internet  has been regulated using outdated communications rules designed for  telephone monopolies. This has resulted in heavyhanded regulation,  which has discouraged companies from investing in communications  infrastructure and broadband expansion.   The resulting lack of reliable infrastructure is the primary reason  internet performance in Europe has suffered during the pandemic. The  regulatory situation in the United States, on the other hand, has been  much different. With a few exceptions, like the brief imposition of so- called net neutrality regulations in 2015, our country has taken a  light-touch approach to internet regulation.   This has encouraged companies to invest in the latest communications  infrastructure and new technologies to make more efficient use of  spectrum. Thanks to that investment, when coronavirus hit and internet  usage soared, American networks were ready. Despite the additional  burden on networks during the pandemic, Americans have been able to  enjoy the same high speeds and streaming quality that they typically  enjoy. Right now, most Americans are using 4G networks.   The next generation of internet, 5G, is here. 5G networks are  starting to be deployed, including in my home State of South Dakota. If  we want the United States to handle 5G the way that we handled 4G and  if we want our 5G networks to be as successful as our 4G networks, we  still have some work to do.   One thing that is absolutely essential is maintaining the light-touch  regulatory approach that has produced so much U.S. investment and  innovation. Despite the success of light-touch regulation, there is  always a segment of the Democratic Party pushing for greater government  regulation of the internet, and that would chill American broadband  investment.   When Democrats briefly succeeded in forcing through heavier  government regulations in the latter part of the Obama Presidency,  broadband infrastructure investment by U.S. companies dropped  significantly, and it only rebounded when the Federal Communications  Commission, under Chairman Pai, rolled back these heavyhanded  regulations.   Second, the United States still has more work to do to deploy the  infrastructure necessary for 5G. While 4G relies on traditional cell  phone towers, 5G technology will also require small antennas called  ``small cells'' that can often be attached to existing infrastructure,  like utility poles or buildings.   Last year, I introduced legislation, the STREAMLINE Act, to make it  easier for companies to deploy these small cells so that we can get the  infrastructure in place for 5G technology. We also need to update  Federal regulations to ensure that it doesn't take months or years to  get permits for wireless infrastructure.   Infrastructure is a key part of the 5G equation. The other key part  is spectrum. Like all internet technology, 5G relies on radio  spectrum--what we commonly call the airwaves. Radio spectrum is divided  into bands--low band, mid band, and high band. 5G will rely upon all  three.   The United States has done a good job freeing up high-band spectrum  for 5G, but we still need to free up more mid-band spectrum to see  full-scale 55 deployment.   In 2018, Congress passed my MOBILE NOW Act, which helped lay the  groundwork for freeing up more mid-band spectrum.   This past November, Senator Wicker and I introduced the 5G Spectrum  Act to require the Federal Communications Commission to free up a  critical portion of mid-band spectrum, commonly referred to as the C- band for 5G use.   While Congress did not enact our legislation at the end of February,  the Federal Communications Commission announced that it would adopt a  framework similar to that outlined in our bill to make 280 megahertz of  C-band spectrum available for 5G.   Finally, we need to ensure that we have the workforce in place to  handle the demands of installing and maintaining 5G technology. It is  estimated that deploying the necessary infrastructure for 5G will  create approximately 50,000 new construction jobs each year over the  build-out period, and that is just for construction.   Right now, there simply aren't enough workers with the necessary  training to meet the needs of nationwide 5G. Earlier this year, I  introduced the Telecommunications Skilled Workforce Act. My bill would  help to increase the number of workers enrolled in 5G training programs  and identify ways to grow the telecommunications workforce to meet the  demands of 5G.   The coronavirus has shown us the result of robust investment in 4G  infrastructure and spectrum--strong networks that can handle steep  surge in internet traffic. We need to make sure that we are putting in  the necessary work and investment to ensure that our 5G networks are  just as strong.  [[Page S2518]]    The 5G future is here.
