 Mr. Speaker, I am so grateful that our colleagues across  the aisle have become so interested in the impact of the national debt  on the American people. I only wish that, during their time in control  of the White House, we had not doubled the national debt.   I am similarly grateful that Members on the other side of the aisle  would say that we should know the impact of legislation before we vote  for it because, after all, it was former Speaker Pelosi who said: Let's  vote for it so that we know what is in the Affordable Care Act.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today because following an 8-year cycle of  abandonment, it is time we do right by our military members and their  families. I rise in support of the brave warriors stationed at Eglin  Air Force Base, Naval Air Station Pensacola, and all across the globe.  The 2.1 percent pay raise we provide in this appropriation is a modest  downpayment on what is owed to those who put themselves in harm's way  for our freedom.   Our current state of military readiness is not acceptable. Half of  the planes in our Navy cannot fly. Pilots are leaving. Marines are  harvesting parts out of museums. Soldiers downrange don't have the  unrivaled equipment they need to match their unrivaled patriotism.   This $583 billion appropriation is a first step. It means 74 new F-35  aircraft. The F-35 is the most capable aircraft in the sky. Pilots have  greater survivability in the F-35. This matters so much to me. In my  district, we are training the next generation of F-35 pilots to fight  and win against any enemy we encounter in the skies.   This legislation also reflects our values by investing in cancer  research and traumatic brain injury research.   Now, some say we cannot focus on defense; we should focus on other  domestic priorities. I would simply say our adversaries are not  waiting. Our warfighters and military families are tired of waiting and  so am I.
