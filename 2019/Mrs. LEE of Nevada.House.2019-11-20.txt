 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, healthcare and social workers are some of the most  dedicated, least appreciated workers in this country. They are the  workers caring for the sick, the elderly, and the most vulnerable  Americans, while usually making just barely enough to get by.   A tough job is made even tougher by the fact that these workers who  are treating workers in stress, often in private settings, are five  times as likely to be the victims of workplace violence.   What does it say about our country that we can't protect those  workers who have dedicated their lives to protecting our most  vulnerable citizens? It is unfair, and the bottom line is this: No  person should feel unsafe in their place of work.   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, has the  authority to protect American caregivers and healthcare workers from  workplace violence, but the reality is that there is no nationwide OSHA  standard for how employers are supposed to protect their employees from  workplace violence. Not just that, but in 24 States, nearly half the  country, public-sector health and social service workers are not  covered by OSHA protections.   We have the responsibility and we have the authority to protect  America's workers, but we have not given our government or our  businesses the tools they need to protect hardworking Americans from  workplace violence. The underlying bill of this rule will change that.   The Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service  Workers Act would require OSHA to implement a standard for workplace  protections for healthcare and social workers. It provides protections  for public-sector workers where none existed before, and it identifies  risks, solutions, training, and, importantly, protections from  retaliation for those workers who report violence in the workplace.   Madam Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to support this underlying bill and uphold our duty to keep every  American safe.                                time  1300
