 Mr. Speaker, I have a great deal of respect for both  you and the chairman, but there is a parting of the ways here. I want  to urge my colleagues to stand against the administration's vicious  assault on Medicaid. That is how I perceive it.   The expansion of Medicaid by the ACA is one of the great success  stories of government in action in the last 50 years. Despite the  decade-long obstructionism, Medicaid expansion has saved 19,000 older,  low-income adult lives--and I know they don't challenge those numbers-- and 825 lives just in our State of New Jersey.   But many Republicans have rejected the attempts to destroy--they  tried to destroy the ACA at the ballot box and at the courthouse. But  like Captain Ahab after his white whale, they remain singularly  dedicated to stealing healthcare away from as many Americans as  possible.   This administration knows their policy is pure poison. They gave it  an innocuous name and, as we heard on Tuesday, are lying about the  details to fool people.   Americans will not be fooled by this Orwellian scheme. This policy  would rip away healthcare for some of the most vulnerable of our  neighbors. They want to obliterate the ACA no matter what the  consequences.  [[Page H877]]    Mr. Speaker, I support this resolution to send a loud message: Those  on the other side cannot be allowed to steal your healthcare. We will  do everything in our power to stop their schemes.   Now, the ``Joker'' movie may not prevail at Sunday's Oscars. We must  think about any other jokers that go through any of their basements,  including the White House, after today's vote. What will they be  sulking about? This is important legislation.
