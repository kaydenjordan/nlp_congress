 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise to mention one piece of  legislative business and then will pay tribute to the senior Senator  from Mississippi, Senator Thad Cochran.   Last night, the Appropriations Committee, which Senator Cochran  chairs, released the 2018 Omnibus appropriations bill. It includes a  proposal that I feel very strongly about, and I am grateful to him and  all of our colleagues for their support. I particularly want to  acknowledge the advocacy of the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to  make sure this provision is included in the omnibus bill. The House  will soon vote on the omnibus, and then I hope we can quickly follow  suit here in the Senate.   The provision I am referring to is, in shorthand, called Fix NICS.  NICS, of course, is the National Instant Criminal Background Check  System. I think it is a reasoned and reasonable response to the  shootings that have, appallingly, occurred in our schools, our  churches, and in our public spaces.   Just this last week, a gunman opened fire at a high school in  Maryland, not far from here, and, of course, shootings have occurred in  Florida, Texas, Nevada, Charleston, SC, and elsewhere. Our constituents  are frustrated, frightened, and fed up. They want us to do something.  More importantly than that, they want us to do something that will be  effective and save lives. I am happy to say the Fix NICS bill fits that  description.   People who haven't been active on this issue now are raising their  voices and demanding that they be heard. Students are worried,  understandably, and parents of students are worried. They simply don't  want what happened in Parkland, FL, to occur to them. We need to listen  to all of these voices, including to these students, who obviously will  shape our Nation's future. They don't want to go to school and wonder  whether bullets will rain down their hallways or whether their friends  might be the next victims.   In a recent interview, one teenager said something that was trite but  true. She said: ``Guns are not the problem. The people are the  problem.'' I happen to agree with that.   One question about school shooters is, How did they get to the point  at which they thought that shooting up public places was what they  really wanted to do? How did they justify it in their own minds, as  warped as that might be? Also, what is it about our culture, their home  environments, or their mental states that allows them to rationalize  violence that does such tremendous harm? How does slaughter--because  that is what it really is--become justified in their warped  perspectives? I admit that those are tough questions to answer, and  they are tough to even ponder, but we still can and have to do what is  possible to protect our schools, our churches, parents, teachers, and  our children.   Recently, 13 families from Parkland, FL, wrote in support of this  particular legislation--legislation that would improve school safety,  that has been sponsored by our colleague, the senior Senator from Utah.  Senator Hatch's bill would fund the creation of and provide training  for threat assessment teams--in other words, to evaluate beforehand  where people are vulnerable. It includes security measures and  anonymous reporting systems. This bill is widely supported and shows  that even on a divisive issue, there is plenty of room for common  ground.   In that same letter, the 13 Parkland families said they supported  Senator Hatch's school safety measures. They also expressed support for  the Fix NICS bill, which they said is desperately needed to improve  compliance with firearms purchasing background check systems.   A recent Gallup Poll showed that the public broadly supports  proposals like Fix NICS. More than 9 in 10 see the importance of  background checks.   Over the last few weeks, there has been a true groundswell of support  for this bill that I and the junior Senator from Connecticut, Mr.  Murphy, cosponsored. The supporters now include not only victims'  rights advocates, gun violence prevention groups, and prosecutors, but  also the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, the  Major County Sheriffs of America, as well as other law enforcement  groups. All of these organizations have endorsed Fix NICS and signed a  letter that asks that the majority and minority leaders put this  measure to a vote. Now, in its having been included in the Omnibus  appropriations bill, we will finally have a chance to do that--first in  the House and then in the Senate.   These organizations and the general public agree that fixing our  background check system should be a national priority and that we  should better ensure that convicted criminals with past histories of  violence and mental illness do not purchase or possess firearms, as the  law currently in effect provides. They see merit in trying to fix our  system that currently has allowed these same people to slip through the  cracks and purchase firearms in order to kill innocent people, like the  26 who were gunned down inside the First Baptist Church in Sutherland  Springs, TX, just outside of San Antonio.   Some have said that Fix NICS doesn't go far enough, that it is a  modest measure. I have to question that sort of description. Is it  really a modest measure if it will, in fact, save lives? I think not.  It is a necessary measure and one that brings people together across  the political spectrum, Republicans and Democrats alike. Even if Fix  NICS were to save just one life, that would be reason enough to enact  it, but I think that is unlikely. I think it will save many lives once  it is enacted into law and signed by the President.   We have 78 cosponsors of this legislation. I can't think of another  piece of legislation that has enjoyed such broad bipartisan support,  including by the majority leader and the Democratic leader, Senator  Schumer. In today's hyperpolarized environment, that kind of support  speaks for itself.  [[Page S1892]]    I look forward to its passing in the House as part of the funding  bill, and I hope the Senate will do the same before the end of the  week.                           Tribute to Thad Cochran    Madam President, I close by saying a few words about our friend and  trusted colleague, the senior Senator from Mississippi, Thad Cochran,  who has announced his retirement from the Senate. I know the real  tributes are about to kick off in a minute when the majority leader  comes out, but since I am up here, I thought I would take the  opportunity to say a few words.   Senator Cochran has represented the State of Mississippi in the U.S.  Senate since 1978. He is one of the longest serving Members of Congress  in the history of the United States. His career and his life speak for  themselves.   He is the son of a school principal and math teacher. Not  surprisingly, he was a gifted high school athlete. He is a piano player  and a former college yell leader. Yes, even like me, he is a recovering  lawyer, but we will not hold that against him.   Before he joined Congress, he served in the U.S. Navy because he  loves this country and the opportunities it has afforded him and his  family. He is a man with a strong sense of duty and gratitude for the  opportunities he has been given in life. After ROTC at the University  of Mississippi, he received orders to join the USS Macon, and after  that he joined the staff of the Navy commandant in New Orleans. Later,  he ran for public office. He first served in the House of  Representatives. He then, of course, came here to the Senate, where he  quickly established himself as a cordial but formidable presence.   Before I came to the Senate, Senator Cochran was chairman of the  Senate Republican Conference. He has chaired the Senate Agriculture,  Nutrition, and Forestry Committee too. Most recently, he has alternated  between serving as ranking member and chairman of the all-powerful  Appropriations Committee.   Throughout his 45 years in Congress, he has participated in crafting  and enacting historic legislation, but his main focus has always been  on the people of Mississippi. His highest priority has always been on  the men and women he was elected to represent in places like Jackson,  Gulfport, Greenville, Starkville, and Hattiesburg. One example is when  he fought so hard for recovery funding after Hurricane Katrina had  destroyed large swaths of the southern part of Mississippi. Many people  forget that that awful storm was much bigger than New Orleans'.  Mississippi was hit almost equally as hard, and Senator Cochran made  sure his State got the help it needed to get back on its feet.   His storied career is one of service and collegiality even amidst the  fractious debates. He treats friends and political adversaries with  respect. He listens to what people have to say. We need more people  like that in public life.   The majority leader has called him the ``quiet persuader,'' one who  knows ``there's a big difference between making a fuss and making a  difference.''   Judge E. Grady Jolly, of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth  Circuit, who has known Senator Cochran as long as anyone, said that  back home, he is known for his ``modesty and his retiring nature''--not  attributes you would normally associate with somebody in politics, but  he is a class act. He is also known for the consistent attention he has  paid to the Mississippi Delta--one of the poorest regions in the  Nation's poorest State. The judge calls Senator Cochran the ``ultimate  model of sincerity,'' one who ``never engages in ad hominem or personal  attacks'' and always ``keeps a sense of humor about himself.''   My office spoke to one Mississippi resident this week because we  wanted to learn a little bit more about what Senator Cochran has meant  to her. That woman, who had met Senator Cochran only a handful of  times, said she had always respected and admired Senator Cochran's  statesmanship and the dignity with which he represented Mississippi.  Her comments are a good note to end on--statesmanship and dignity.  Those traits never go out of style.   I know I speak for my other colleagues--and they will speak for  themselves--when we all say thank you to Thad Cochran for setting a  higher standard for the Members of this body. The U.S. Senate will not  be the same without him.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4851, which was received  from the House.
