 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I like the gentleman from Pennsylvania. He and I are friends. We  disagree.   I proudly voted against the tax bill which, I think, spiked the  deficit, and we had a continuation of the extraordinary growth of jobs  and the economy under the Obama administration, and that has continued  in a straight line. It didn't spike up--straight line.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Raise the Wage Act. This  is direct--not indirect, not trickle down, direct--saying to some of  the people who worked hardest and make the least: We are going to help.  We think what you do is valuable to our community and to our society.   We need to make certain that wages keep pace with the cost of living.  We haven't done that. For 10 years, we haven't given a raise.   We need to value the labor that our people contribute into the  economy. That is why we have a Federal minimum wage, to ensure that  everyone who works hard, full time, ought to be able to afford, not  simply to get by, but to try to get ahead.   I have heard from many in my district who have told me that  increasing the minimum wage will have a major impact on their incomes  and their lives.   Dana Hudson from Owings in Calvert County, Maryland, makes the  minimum wage of $10.10 an hour and supplements his income with farming  on his land. He is 60 years old and looking ahead to retirement,  knowing that a higher minimum wage in his final years of working will  go a long way towards giving him and his wife retirement security.   Delano Alexander of Clinton, Maryland, is an environmental services  aide at Prince George's Hospital Center. He earns $12.85 an hour,  presently, and if we pass this bill, he will get an income boost  through the years to help him and his family get ahead.   Victor Reyes of Berwyn Heights, Maryland, started his career as a  nonunion day laborer barely making a living. Now he has a union  construction job, and he is earning better pay. He wrote to ask me to  support a higher minimum wage so that others who are working with him  and haven't found better jobs can get the same economic security he now  has.   We referred to 27 million, 33 million--whatever that number is  between 27 and 33--are going to get a raise by this bill. That didn't  happen in the tax bill. Some of the richest people in America got a  huge increase, but not the average working guy and gal.   In June, we marked 10 years since the last minimum wage increase went  into effect, the longest period without an increase since the minimum  wage was first introduced under Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal.    I was proud to bring legislation to the floor in 2007 to raise the  minimum wage the last time Congress did so, and I am proud to do it  again today. This is long overdue, something the previous Republican  majority should have made a priority but failed to accomplish.   Today, low-income workers in our economy are getting a bad deal with  a minimum wage that doesn't even allow many workers to get by, let  alone get ahead working 40 hours a week and living in poverty. That is  not a successful American economy, because 10 years have passed without  an increase.   Workers stuck earning the current minimum wage of just $7.25 an hour  have effectively received a 17 percent pay cut over the last 10 years.  That is why the House will vote today on the Raise the Wage Act, which  will gradually raise the Federal minimum wage  [[Page H7104]]  to $15 an hour by 2025, 6 years from now.   This bill also eliminates the subminimum wage for those with  disabilities, which will ensure their equal pay and the ability to live  with independence.   Many States and municipalities have already raised their minimum  wages to this level, and it has not caused the dire consequences that  some on the other side of the aisle have predicted. My home State of  Maryland took action earlier this year to raise the minimum wage to $15  an hour. I am proud of that fact.   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has determined that  raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour would lift 1.3 million  Americans directly out of poverty.   Isn't that a good thing to do? Doesn't that make you feel better that  we are helping to lift people out of poverty?   And the Economic Policy Institute says that doing so would cause  wages to go up for 33 million Americans. That is good for them.   What I suggest is, well, it is good for our economy and it is good  for all of us, because it will help grow the economy, make folks more  independent, and make them feel better about themselves and about what  they are doing.   We campaigned on a promise to raise wages and make sure that American  workers can access all the opportunities that make the American Dream  possible. That is what we are doing today.   I thank Chairman  Bobby Scott and Democrats on the Committee on  Education and Labor for their hard work on this legislation.   We said we were going to raise the wage. Today we are going to raise  the wage. It is the right thing to do. I urge every Member to support  it.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning- hour debate and 2 p.m. for legislative business, with votes postponed  until 6:30 p.m.   On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for  morning-hour debate and noon for legislative business.   On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business,  and last votes of the week would be expected no later than 3 p.m.   We will consider several bills, Madam Speaker, under suspension of  the rules. The complete list of suspension bills will be announced by  close of business tomorrow.   The House will also consider H.R. 397, the Rehabilitation for  Multiemployer Pensions Act, commonly referred to as the Butch Lewis  Act.   The 10 million Americans who have paid into multiemployer pensions  deserve to know they will receive the benefits they have earned when  they retire. The bill will help ensure a secure retirement for these  workers and retirees.   In addition, Madam Speaker, the House will consider H.R. 2203, the  Homeland Security Improvement Act. This legislation introduced by  Congresswoman Escobar will ensure that the Department of Homeland  Security addresses border issues in a responsible and humane manner.  The bill fosters greater accountability when it comes to the handling  of children and migrant families at all levels within the Department of  Homeland Security.   The House is also expected to consider additional legislation, Madam  Speaker, related to the current humanitarian crisis on the southern  border.   Members are advised that additional legislative items are expected.  As we know, it is the last week before we adjourn, and there is an  effort to try to get things done that can, in fact, be done within the  timeframe we have available to us.   It is my sincere hope that an agreement is reached to raise budget  caps and the debt limit. The Speaker and Secretary Mnuchin and others  have been working very hard on this objective, and I am hopeful that  they will reach an agreement that we can agree on as a House and as a  Senate. Assuming an agreement is reached, we will consider that as soon  as they reach it, and hopefully, that will be next week.    In response to my friend, Madam Speaker, I will tell him  that the committee did, in fact, mark up bills this past Wednesday,  yesterday, and those bills are being looked at to possibly move to the  floor.    Madam Speaker, again, I will tell my friend, as he has  articulated, that bill has not been marked up in committee. There are  two bills that were marked up in committee, and there is a possibility  that we will consider those, but the other bill was not marked up.     Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's comments.  Unfortunately, of course, three of the component parts of the bill, to  which the gentleman refers, we are strongly for. Unfortunately, they  were held up in the Senate, as the gentleman may know.   We want to see the MOU for Israel assistance package, which we  strongly support, which was negotiated by the Obama administration and  which we strongly support in terms of the amount of money, available  not only on a general basis, but also a specific basis, for support of  Israel's defense against rockets and other munitions that would be sent  into Israel.   We also support the Syria sanctions and the Jordan MOU, so we hope,  at some point, they will move. I will reiterate, however, there have  been two bills marked up, and the possibility of considering those for  next week is there.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   First of all, let me say two things:   We are confronting, in my view, an unprecedented refusal of an  administration to cooperate with the Congress in the exercise of its  constitutional duties. I refer specifically to the issuance of  subpoenas, either for testimony or for documentary evidence, so the  Congress can properly exercise its oversight responsibilities under the  Constitution.   I have been here for some almost four decades, and I have never seen  any administration, essentially, direct across the board no response to  the Congress of the United States or to its committees. So, yes, we are  pursuing.    The gentleman referred to the contempt citation dealing with Mr. Barr  and Mr. Ross. Now, the issue at the center of that, as the gentleman  knows, is the administration ultimately decided it would not pursue the  policies that were the subject of that investigation. However, it is  not about the specific, but it is about the general constitutional  responsibility that this Congress has to the American people.   We ask for information not on behalf of ourselves individually, but  on behalf of the American people, so they will know what their  government is doing, there will be a transparency to the operations of  government, and they will be able to determine whether or not any  administrative official, or the administration generally, is acting on  its behalf personally or whether it is acting on behalf of the American  people.   So, from that perspective, I think the resolutions that we have  offered, of which there, essentially, have been two dealing with this  issue, and maybe more, the refusal to cooperate with subpoenas has  continued.   I hope the gentleman will understand that we are trying to protect  the responsibilities and authority of the Congress of the United  States, the people's body, the article I body, to do its duty properly.   Secondly, yes, we did have a very difficult day yesterday. But I will  tell my friend from Louisiana that I think it is the absolute  responsibility of this body to respond if it sees things that are being  done by the administration or by others that it perceives to be  contrary to the ideas of this country, contrary to the declaration that  we believe that all men and, yes, all women are created equal; contrary  to the extraordinary wrenching war that we had among the States to  determine that all were equal. And a construction period.   And then, as I grew up in the 1950s and the 1960s, looking racism in  the face and saying, we reject it, that we reject racism, we reject  prejudices, we reject simplifying if people are a certain color, a  certain race, a certain nationality, or a certain gender, that somehow,  they are less than other Americans. I think it is our responsibility to  confront that.   That is what we did yesterday. It was difficult, I understand. I was  sorry that it was not a bipartisan vote, because I  [[Page H7131]]  don't believe that Members on your side of the aisle want to tolerate  racism any more than we want to tolerate racism. And if we see it, I  think we have a responsibility to speak out, to stand up, and to say  this is not right in America, this is not America.   So, yes, we had a resolution yesterday that the gentlemen refers to  in response to a tweet. It was not the tweet, it was what the tweet  said, what it implied, what it diminished in terms of America's sense  of decency and equality and tolerance and inclusion for our people.   Now, let me go to legislation. As the gentleman knows, we have passed  substantial pieces of legislation.   We passed H.R. 1. No Republicans voted for that, but it seeks to make  it easier for people to vote in America, make sure their vote is  protected and counted.   It made sure that we have transparency in the financing of campaigns.   It made sure that our redistricting was fair to our citizens and that  we politicians were not drawing the districts, but that the districts  are drawn in fairness to the American people.   It also demanded ethics performance.   But then we passed an anti-hate resolution. It was just words, but it  said no to hate: 173 Republicans voted for that. It overwhelming passed  bipartisan.   We passed a Land and Water Conservation Fund that made that fund  permanent, a very important bill for a State like Louisiana and, quite  frankly, my own State of Maryland, who are all surrounded by water,  have a lot of water. That bill got 133 Republicans. It languishes still  in the Senate.   We passed the SECURE Act, which makes it easier for people to get  retirement security. That was supported by 187 Republicans.   We passed the violence against women reauthorization. Unfortunately,  it didn't get overwhelming votes, but it got 33 Republicans voting for  it. It languishes in the Senate.   We passed a provision that said we want to protect preexisting  conditions in the Affordable Care Act. We got 8 Republicans. I would  have wished we had gotten more.   We passed disaster relief. The gentleman knows a lot about disaster  relief, important to his State. Unfortunately, we only got 34  Republicans, but it was a bipartisan bill.   We have also passed background checks, which are supported by 90  percent of the American people, to try to make gun violence lessened in  the United States of America. For that bill, we only got 8 Republicans.   But those two bills, supported by 90 percent of the American people,  languishes in the United States Senate, the majority leader not  bringing up that legislation.   We passed a national emergency resolution, which said, Mr. President,  you can't take money that we appropriated for X and just send it over  to Y. That was, I thought, a protection of our constitutional  authority. The Constitution says we raise, and we spend money and we  direct the executive--we direct the executive--how to do that. That got  13 Republicans supporting it, a major piece of legislation.   We passed a Dreamer legislation. We have been asking for that  legislation for almost a decade, or at least 6 years, I should say. And  that legislation got no vote over the last 5 years. It got a vote this  year. We got a number of Republicans--7 to be exact--to vote for that.   Now, I could go through a number of other pieces of legislation,  including, lastly, the minimum wage bill. This was about capitalism,  not socialism. We are capitalists over here. We believe in the free  market system over here. And any assertion to the contrary, Madam  Speaker, is absolutely false.   It is a good political tactic, it is a scare tactic, Madam Speaker,  but I reject it out of hand. We believe in the free market system. We  believe the free market system has been the system that has provided  the most benefits for the broadest number of people.                                time  1230    We believe that is one of the great facets of our democracy, our free  market system. And I will tell my friend, Madam Speaker, that it was  Democrats in the 1930s that saved the free market system. It was  Democrats in December of 2007 that came in and made sure that the free  market system did not crash after 8 years of Republican leadership.   I would hope that the gentleman would not make the assertion that  surely he knows is not true, Madam Speaker, that we on this side are  looking to support a socialist agenda. We are promoting and continue to  promote a socially sensitive agenda for the American people to make  sure that they have healthcare.   Medicare was called a socialist program, Madam Speaker, when it was  adopted. That is a program that millions and millions of Americans rely  on and have been brought out of poverty. Medicare was a called a  socialist program when it was adopted. That program, combined with  Social Security, has millions of Americans having a sense of security,  a sense of independence, a sense that they are not going to fall  through the cracks.   So we ought not to be debating, I say, Madam Speaker, this phony  shibboleth of socialism.   The minimum wage is simply saying, in America, we value people who  work, and we want to ensure that people who work are not living in  poverty and have some ability to support themselves and their families  in a decent way. We passed that bill today. We are proud of passing  that bill.   Very frankly, for 10 years of Republican control of the House of  Representatives, we pleaded with them to bring a minimum wage bill of  whatever number to the floor, and they didn't bring a single cent raise  in a decade, the longest time since the minimum wage was adopted in the  1930s, to make sure that Americans were lifted out of the deepest  recession that this country has ever had.   So I say to my friend, we have done a lot. I wish the Senate would  move it.   Let me close in terms of this response. I am very proud of this. We  have passed 10 appropriations bills out of 12, the most since 2006.   Now, in 2006, the Republicans were in charge. I don't refer to the  gentleman personally, but the Republicans were in charge, and they  didn't bring the Labor-Health bill to the floor. I am not sure why, but  I had offered a minimum wage increase in that bill, in the Labor-Health  Subcommittee, and they never brought it to the floor.   It passed in committee, even though the Republicans were in charge  and the majority of Members in the committee were Republicans. That  minimum wage increase passed, but they refused to bring it to the  floor. I can only conclude that they are not for increasing the minimum  wage.   We disagree with that position. We believe that in America, if you  are working, playing by the rules, and making our economy grow, then  you ought to be paid a wage that you can survive on and, better than  that, live on.   And so I am proud of the legislation that we passed, and I am proud  of the 10 appropriations bills, which, by the way, fund 96 percent of  the government.   Our colleagues in the Senate, Madam Speaker, have not passed a single  appropriations bill through committee, not one.   So we are doing our job, Madam Speaker, and we are addressing the  issues of the American people.   I agree 100 percent with the minority, with the Republican whip that  we need to deal with drug pricing. We have pledged to do that. We are  working together. The President says he wants to do that. Hopefully, we  can get to a consensus.   I agree with the gentleman from Louisiana, Madam Speaker, we haven't  gotten there yet. Hopefully, we can get there. Hopefully, we can  strengthen the Affordable Care Act so that people will have the  confidence that it will be available to them.   I know that was a relatively--maybe not relatively--a long answer,  but I think we have done a lot of work. I am very proud of the 6 months  that we have had.   We spent the first 35 days trying to open up the government. This is  the first Congress in the history of the United States in which the  government was shut down when the new Congress started. It has been  shut down before, but this was the first time when we started. It took  us 35 days to get it open. And when we did get it open, we started on  an agenda of which I am proud.  [[Page H7132]]    Do we have more work to do? We do. Madam Speaker, we intend to  continue on an agenda that does that work.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I want to go back to this free market and the minimum  wage.   The gentleman, Madam Speaker, projects that: Let the free market  operate.   We do not allow employers to hire people under a certain age because  we want to protect children. I suppose that is interfering with the  free market because we know that, throughout the world, we have 8-, 9-,  and 10-year-old children being asked to work 10-, 12-, 14-hour days at  rudimentary tasks.  [[Page H7133]]                                     time  1245    Perhaps he believes that we ought to have people work 80, 90 hours a  week trying to manage their families and their lives and not have a 40- hour week because of the free market. After all, individuals can decide  whether they are going to work 80 or 90 hours a week. We have known  that in our history.   Perhaps we ought to have a free market that doesn't worry about  whether workers are safe on the job. Whether it is in a mine or a  factory, we require places to be safe so that we can protect workers.   We don't believe that undermines the free market system. We think  that improves the free market system. So there are rules.    Madam Speaker, my point to the gentleman is, yes, we think  people ought to be paid a decent wage, and we know there are people in  our workplace and in our community who have no bargaining power  whatsoever. They don't have fancy college educations, and they don't  have fancy skills, but they are needed in our economy. They are needed  to do things that the community needs done. When you go to a hotel, you  hope that bed is made up. You hope the bathrooms are clean. When you go  to the grocery store, you hope that the peas and corn have been picked.   We believe that those folks are necessary for our community and need  to be paid a decent wage, just as we think they need to be safe. I am  glad the gentleman agrees on that. I thought he did.   But my point, Madam Speaker, is that there is an analogy here to  safety, to hours, to working conditions, and yes, to wages.   I don't know that the party that the gentleman represents has ever  offered an increase in the minimum wage. I am going to check on that. I  don't know. Since I have been here, they have not. It has always been  us offering the increase.   President George Bush, to his credit, signed the Fair Minimum Wage  Act in 2007, which was still less than it was in 1968. As a matter of  fact, it is 40 percent less today than it was in 1968. Workers are  being paid 40 percent less.   Lastly, I will say, Madam Speaker, one thing our party agrees with is  that men and women have a right to come together and bargain  collectively for their wages, their working conditions, and their  benefits. They need to be on some degree of parity because we know that  with big employers, and even small employers, individuals are not on  parity. They either do this or don't, and if there are no rules, then  people are subjected, in my view and in my observation, to unfair  tactics that they have no defense against other than us.   I say to my friend, I think he and I agree on hours, hopefully, the  age at which people can work certain hours, and on safety conditions in  workplaces. I am not sure about bargaining collectively in unions. I  think they are critical to the creation of a middle class and the  maintenance of a strong middle class. We also very strongly believe in  the free market system.   I could pick out one or two of your Members who may have some  differences of agreement. I won't mention any names, but I can think of  some names on the gentleman's side of the aisle. I am sure the  gentleman can as well and, in fact, does disagree, from his  perspective, with some people on my side of the aisle. But we intend to  continue to be very supportive of building jobs.   My friend knows that I have an agenda. I call it Make It In America.  It is about growing jobs, growing enterprises, helping entrepreneurs,  and making sure that people have good wages and a good future through  the free enterprise system.    Madam Speaker, we could go another many minutes, but I am  going to comment on one of the things the gentleman said about the  person who wanted to go to work for a company but didn't want to join  the union and right-to-work. The probability is the reason you wanted  to work for that company was because the wages were good, the benefits  were good, and safety conditions were good, which the union got, but he  or she doesn't want to pay dues to the union. They don't have to join  the union; they have to pay dues to the union.   I think it is somewhat ironic but demonstrative that when the  gentleman speaks of safety regulations, very frankly, Republicans spent  a lot of time, when they were in charge, passing reductions of  regulations that we think undermine the safety of consumers, workers,  and individuals.   We have a disagreement on that, Madam Speaker, but that is what we  believe, and that is the tension here. We represent, I think, an  attitude that we need to make sure that everybody plays by the rules so  that people are safe.   In any event, we will discuss that further, I am sure, in the coming  days, weeks, and maybe years.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House  adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9:30 a.m. tomorrow; and, further,  when the House adjourns on that day, it adjourn to meet on Tuesday,  July 23, 2019, when it shall convene at noon for morning-hour debate  and 2 p.m. for legislative business.    Madam Speaker, all of us who serve in this House are  deeply indebted to our hardworking staff who enable us to serve our  constituents and meet the rigorous demands of this job.   In particular, all of us are grateful for our district directors, as  we are for all of our staff. But our district directors are ``us'' for  so many instances, for so many constituents, and for so many different  events.   They represent us when we cannot be there, when we are here in  Washington. They are our eyes and ears on the ground when we are here.  They are the angels on our shoulders who remind us that everything we  do on a national level needs to benefit our constituents back home.   For the past 30 years, I have been blessed--the Fifth Congressional  District has been blessed--to be a colleague of Betsy Bossart.   I love Betsy Bossart, and my constituents love Betsy Bossart.   Before she served as my district director, she was my administrative  assistant, the jack of all trades who made sure my office ran smoothly,  and served as one of my chief advisers.   Betsy joined my staff on March 3, 1989, 30 years ago, and until she  retired--sadly, from my perspective--last month, she served me, the  people of the Fifth District, and our country every day.   With her departure, my office--and, indeed, this House--is diminished  by the end of her extraordinary service.   Betsy gave her time and energy selflessly for the people of the Fifth  District, working many, many late nights, many weekends, and long days.   She has taken meetings with every organization and visited nearly  every school and medical facility and government office in the counties  I represent.   Betsy Bossart has been so successful as my district director because  she is an excellent listener and has a deep wellspring of empathy for  people.   She has been a role model, Madam Speaker, for others on my staff and  a champion, an advocate for young people coming into public service and  waiting to make differences in their communities and in their country.   She has been an unsung hero of my team for three decades.   It is largely because of Betsy's hard work behind the scenes that we  are able to organize the Rebuilding Together program--formerly known as  Christmas in April--in all five counties in our district. It is a day  of service that brings people from all walks of life together to repair  homes, revitalize communities, and help our neighbors.   Because of Betsy's efforts, we have the annual Fifth District Women's  Luncheon, dedicated to advancing women's equality and raising awareness  of women leaders in the Fifth District and our country.   Because of her, we have robust support for the network of early  childhood centers in Maryland named in memory of my wife, Judy, who had  a wonderful relationship with Betsy as well.   Maryland's Judy Centers will always be a major part of Betsy's  legacy, and the thousands of children and families who benefited from  their services may not know Betsy or what she did to make the Judy  Centers possible, but they will always owe her and her colleagues who  partnered with her on that effort a debt of gratitude.   Along with her friend and my friend, Betty Richardson--another  longtime member of my team, who has since retired but remains very  active in my district--as partners, Betty and Betsy were also  instrumental in launching the annual Fifth District Black History  Breakfast, now in its 38th year.   All the young people who participate in the annual Greater Washington  Soap Box Derby have Betsy to thank for being able to use the Capitol  Grounds.   Madam Speaker, I will look back with many, many, many fond memories  of my time working with Betsy Bossart, my friend, my colleague, my  coworker, whom I had the opportunity to work with to advance the  interest of our district.   We traveled together to South Africa and met with Nelson Mandela,  discussing the important issue of racial justice and unity through  history and healing.   We have attended so many events together across Prince George's  County and southern Maryland, making sure that every one of our  constituent's voices is heard loudly and clearly in Congress.  [[Page H7136]]    As majority leader and Democratic whip over the past 16 years, I have  had to balance service to our district with my responsibilities to our  Caucus and to our country. Betsy has spent every single day of that  time making sure that our district always comes first.   I will miss Betsy. I expect to remain her friend throughout my life,  but I will miss her daily advice and expertise, though I am relieved  that she will always be just a phone call away.   As she retires, Madam Speaker, to spend more time with her husband  and their family in Pennsylvania, I hope my colleagues will join me in  thanking Betsy Bossart for 30 dedicated years, yes, to me, but, more  importantly, to our constituents, to our State, and to our country.   Madam Speaker, were I to speak another 2 hours--as some fear--I could  not thank Betsy Bossart enough.   God bless Betsy Bossart, a wonderful friend, a wonderful American.                            ____________________
