 Madam Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the veterans,  public schoolteachers, and seniors in my district. These are the  hostages the most extreme members of the Republican Conference have  bragged about.   We are on the verge of a Republican-led default because the people  calling the shots in this Chamber are the same people who want cuts to  veterans' healthcare and manufacturing jobs.   These draconian cuts will have a direct impact on my community in the  Inland Empire and the State of California.   In my district alone, approximately 6,900 jobs could be wiped out,  Social Security payments for 58,000 families will be jeopardized, and  the retirement savings for 81,500 people could disappear.   In the State of California, approximately 4 million people could lose  health insurance, and housing costs will increase for 83,200 people.   This is unacceptable, and Americans deserve better.   House Republicans need to drop their ransom note and come to their  senses so we can avoid a devastating default and put the American  people first.                            ____________________
