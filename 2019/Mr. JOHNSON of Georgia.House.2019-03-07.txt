 Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this  amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment is well  intentioned but riddled with inconsistencies that render it ineffective  and unnecessary.   Although judges should be held to high ethical standards, it is a  false equivalence to claim that Members of Congress and judges face the  same dilemmas. Judges do not accept campaign funds, do not represent  constituents, and have no term limits.   Every person who has the privilege to serve in our government should  be held to a code of conduct, yet it is a misstep to assume that all  branches of government have the same prerogatives and ethical pitfalls.   H.R. 1 already contains a reasonable approach to expanding ethics for  the United States Supreme Court, and this amendment would confuse the  clarity and enforcement of these standards.   The Judicial Conference of the United States is best suited to issue  a code of conduct for the courts of the United States. Judges know best  what predicaments judges face and how best to protect the integrity of  our courts from corruption and improper conduct.   We should pass H.R. 1 without this amendment so that we can create  effective, enforceable ethical standards for our courts.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
