 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the members from the  Air Force Research Laboratory Information Directorate, otherwise known  as Rome Lab.   Rome Lab has been recognized by the Federal Laboratory Consortium for  its superiority in technology transfer work. Technology transfer work  is a process by which existing knowledge or capabilities developed  under Federal funding are used to fulfill public and private needs.   The winners of this year's FLC high-profile award are Ralph Kohler,  Frank Hoke, Sean Patten, Joseph Mancini, David Canestrare, Daniel  Carpenter, Joshua Sterling, Richard Newkirk, Sam Davis, and Mark  Linderman.   This group of brilliant minds created the Android Team Awareness Kit,  or ATAK. This is a profoundly useful software collaboration that runs  on an android mobile operating system. It can  [[Page H3432]]  connect multiple people on the go, giving them a common operation  picture right on their handheld phone. It currently has 40,000  Department of Defense users and 32,000 non-Federal users. The winners  from Rome Lab created an easy access portal that allows the government  to provide ATAK to citizens, enabling better communication and  information sharing.   This technology transfer benefits Rome Lab, its mission, the  government, and all users. A great example of how ATAK was  extraordinarily beneficial was during the 2017 hurricanes. Because of  Rome Lab's work, civilian, State, and military teams were able to  communicate to rescue people and save lives.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to congratulate this group of brilliant  young people and thank them for continuing to make the Air Force  Research Lab, otherwise known as Rome Lab, a world leader in advanced  technology.                            ____________________
