 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of H.R. 2740  and its amendments.   The Overseas Private Investment Corporation is a self-sustaining  government agency that helps American businesses invest in emerging  markets. This October, it will become the U.S. International  Development Finance Corporation, the DFC, with increased capabilities  to invest and drive economic growth around the developing world.   Critically, the DFC will be able to compete with China on a global  stage, strengthening our relationship with nations around the world.   However, these agencies do not have specific national security  processes or reviews in place. They are entirely dependent on Federal  standards.   My bipartisan amendment, which I introduced with Republican  Congressman Chris Stewart, prohibits any agency from violating the  Export Controls Act, which lays out what goods, items, and knowledge  can be exported.   This amendment would ensure that an American business investing funds  and technology in foreign ventures are not inadvertently exporting  equipment that is, for example, Huawei supported.    It is essential that all government agencies,  particularly in times of transition and growth, are fully compliant  with national security requirements.    I strongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
