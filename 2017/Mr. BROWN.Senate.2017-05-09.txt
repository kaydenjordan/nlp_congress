 Mr. President, I particularly appreciate the comments of  my colleague from Maryland about the Affordable Care Act. The fact is,  they are taking insurance from 200,000 Ohioans right now who are  getting opioid treatment because of the Affordable Care Act, and the  vote in the House of Representatives would turn those 200,000 families  upside down. They should be ashamed of themselves. Then to go to the  White House and celebrate--that is just the ultimate despicable,  political act. I just can't imagine that in the 21st century people  would actually do that.   The FDA has incredible influence over Americans' lives, and the  Commissioner of the Federal Food and Drug Administration will lead the  agency dedicated to ensuring that our medicine and food supplies are  safe.   It is the job of the FDA Commissioner, and has been for decades, to  be an independent check on big pharmaceutical companies, to crack down  on Big Tobacco, and to oversee the safety and efficacy of new  prescription drugs, including, most essentially in the last few years,  opioid painkillers. Unfortunately, Dr. Scott Gottlieb's record gives me  serious concern, as Senator Markey has pointed out so well, that this  Commissioner will fall short on all of these measures.   We know the havoc that opioid painkillers have wreaked on communities  across the country. My State of Ohio has had more overdose deaths from  heroin, OxyContin, oxycodone, Percocet, opioids, morphine-based  opioids; we have had more deaths than any other State in the United  States of America. In my State and across this country, people die  because of the opioid epidemic; 91 Americans, including 12 Ohioans,  will die today--91 Americans, 12 Ohioans will die today--from opioid  overdoses.   The Commissioner will have a lot of tools to fight this epidemic that  is ravaging our families and our communities. We need all hands on deck  to fight this crisis. We need the FDA.   Unfortunately, Dr. Gottlieb's record indicates he would not take the  epidemic and the FDA's authority to rein in prescription painkillers  and other drugs seriously, which is why I cannot support his  nomination.   I don't want to point fingers, but there are a whole host of reasons  for this epidemic. One of them clearly is the proliferation of  prescriptions and the manufacture of so many of these opioids. They are  getting to market, and doctors are prescribing them, and pharmacists  are filling them.   I don't point fingers at individual people and even individual  industries; we are all at fault and not doing this right. But Dr.  Gottlieb has had a cozy relationship with big drug companies for  decades as an investor, as an adviser, and as a member of the board for  a number of these companies. He supported allowing those same companies  to rush their drugs, including potentially addictive opioid  painkillers, onto the market before we were sure they were safe--more  on that in a moment.   He has called into question the Drug Enforcement Administration's  authority to police opioids, despite the fact that these drugs are  often sold on the black market. He has defended industry's efforts to  market new drugs and devices with minimal safety oversight. He has  refused to answer questions about his previous work for pharmaceutical  companies that make the opioid fentanyl. We know he participated in a  meeting on their behalf at the time that the company was under FDA  investigation for pushing off-label uses of fentanyl.   Anyone who thinks we need more fentanyl on the market in many of  Ohio's 88 counties should visit the coroner's office. Imagine this: In  some counties, the coroner's office has had to bring in refrigerated  semitrailers to keep up with the growing body count from the lives lost  to overdoses. Think of that; just think of that picture bringing in  refrigerated semitrailers to keep up with the growing body count from  opioid deaths.   Let Mr. Gottlieb explain himself to the parents, the children, and  the friends who have lost loved ones to this deadly drug. A friend of  my wife's, a woman she knew growing up, lost her son to fentanyl. He  had a 2-year-old child. He was starting to come clean. My understanding  is that he relapsed, and he passed away just a few days ago.   We need a leader at the FDA who will step up the agency's efforts to  fight this addiction epidemic, which is tearing families upside down.  It rips up communities. We need a Commissioner who will fight the  addiction epidemic, not one who will roll over for his Big Pharma  friends. We need a strong public health advocate to address probably  the worst public health crisis of my lifetime, a public health advocate  who will continue to stand up to Big Tobacco with strong rules for all  tobacco products, including newer products like e-cigarettes, which are  particularly appealing to kids.   The opioid crisis is certainly a bigger health crisis that we face  right now, and tobacco is an ongoing public health crisis. We have made  huge victories; we have made huge strides and have had huge victories  in this country. Young people smoke in significantly lower numbers than  they used to. Tobacco companies don't much like that, so they have  introduced e-cigarettes. Tobacco companies are buying more and more of  the manufacturing capabilities of these e-cigarettes. The FDA hasn't  stepped up the way it should. I implore Dr. Gottlieb to do that, but  there is no evidence so far that he cares enough to.   Once again, his extensive business dealings call into doubt whether  he can seriously serve as the people's cop on the beat when it comes to  policing Big Tobacco. Dr. Gottlieb himself invested in an e-cigarette  company--the new FDA Commissioner. He probably will be confirmed today.  I accept that because for every Trump nominee, no matter their ethics,  no matter their background, no matter their inability to serve well, no  matter their lack of qualifications for a whole host of their  responsibilities, almost every Republican--it is sort of like when one  bird flies off a telephone wire, they all do, and they have voted for  almost every one of these nominees.   But think of this: Dr. Gottlieb's job is public health, his job is to  police Big Tobacco. His job is to stand between these multimillion- dollar marketing executives and the 15-year-old who is attracted to  these e-cigarettes with the flavors and the colors and the marketing,  and he has invested in the past in e-cigarette companies. What does  that tell you? Can we really trust him to impose tough rules on these  potentially dangerous products? Can we trust him to protect our  children?   Whoever is in charge of the FDA--whoever is in charge--must put the  people's safety over drug company profits, whether it is addictive  painkillers or e-cigarettes.   I don't think Dr. Gottlieb is the right person for this. I hope I am  wrong. I plan to vote no. I hope he proves me wrong. If he does, I will  come back to the floor and applaud him. But from his background, from  his statements, from his qualifications, from his investments, from his  business background, I don't think he fits the bill.   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.   Mr. President, I withdraw the suggestion.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. So noted.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  stand in recess as under the previous order.
