 Mr. Speaker, on December 21, 2018, I was absent from  the House and missed rollcall votes 474, 475, and 476.   Had I been present for rollcall 474, on Motion to Suspend the Rules  and Pass H. Res. 1063, Designating room H-226 of the United States  Capitol as the ``Lincoln Room'', I would have voted ``Yes.''   Had I been present for rollcall 475, on Motion to Suspend the Rules  and Pass H.R. 7318, To amend the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act  of 2016 to ensure that the Public Buildings Reform Board has adequate  time to carry out the responsibilities of the Board, and for other  purposes, I would have voted ``Yes.''   Had I been present for rollcall 476, on Motion to Suspend the Rules  and Pass H.R. 7319, To amend the Federal Assets Sale and Transfer Act  of 2016 to provide flexibility with respect to the leaseback of certain  Federal real property, and for other purposes, I would have voted  ``Yes.''                            ____________________
