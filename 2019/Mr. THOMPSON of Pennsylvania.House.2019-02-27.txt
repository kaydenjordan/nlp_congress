 Madam Speaker, in 2016, the  Environmental Protection Agency announced the New Source Performance  Standards for the oil and natural gas industry to further regulate  methane emissions. Thankfully, the EPA is revisiting this regulation in  an effort to provide flexibility and relief moving forward.   For many small oil and gas producers, these requirements contained in  the original regulation are simply unworkable and overly burdensome.   For example, the regulation would even apply to wells that produce  less than 15 barrels of oil and less than 90,000 cubic feet of natural  gas per day. Because these wells produce at low volumes, the profit  margin remains tight for the operators.   However, under the original rule, these low-volume producers would be  subject to expensive upgrades, additional reporting requirements and  administrative costs in order to comply with the regulation.   Madam Speaker, today I introduced H.R. 1391, the Methane Relief Act  of 2019, which would exempt these low-volume wells from the rule's  requirements. Doing so will allow for commonsense regulatory relief and  certainty for these smaller operators which account for an important  part of our domestic energy industry.                            ____________________
