 Mr. Speaker, the COVID-19 pandemic is raging; 1 million  cases in a single week; more than 100,000 cases each day since November  4.   Yet, as we head into the Thanksgiving holiday, I am so grateful for  the nonprofit community organizations that are helping to get us  through this: neighbors helping neighbors, serving meals, caring for  seniors, and those with disabilities, housing, and job assistance, and  more.   They are essential cords of our safety net, but that safety net is  fraying. Calls to Broward County's 211 helpline quadrupled when the  pandemic hit, and have seen a surge ever since.   With Federal assistance expiring, the calls get more desperate, and  now the helpers are calling for help. Congress must answer that call.  There is nothing more important in this body right now than getting  help out to our communities.   The House, the Senate, the White House must get that help through the  COVID-19 wave that is crashing across our country as we begin this  holiday season.   The American people are desperate--desperate, Mr. Speaker. We can  wait no longer.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I will speak to this bill in just a couple  of seconds, but I want to pause, if I may, just to reflect on the  Committee on Foreign Affairs bills that are on the floor today and what  they say about the chairman of our committee, Mr. Engel.   Mr. Engel, for more than three decades in the United States House of  Representatives, has led with American values representing human  rights, standing with our allies, and standing up against autocrats all  around the world. And since I don't know, because of the pandemic, how  much floor time we will have in the coming days and weeks, I wanted to  take this moment to express on behalf of not only myself but I know so  so many of his colleagues and friends around the country our deep  appreciation for his leadership for all these years.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased today that we are considering the Libya  Stabilization Act, a bipartisan bill that I introduced with my  colleague, Middle East Subcommittee Ranking Member   Joe Wilson.   As Mr. Yoho said, since we advanced this legislation out of committee  in July, Libya experienced a cease-fire and a burst of diplomacy that I  hope will bring increased security and, eventually, peace to all  Libyans.   The most recent round of U.N.-led talks yielded an agreement to hold  ``free and fair, inclusive and credible'' Presidential and  parliamentary elections next year.   These are important accomplishments, and credit should be given to  the Libyan representatives to the negotiations, as well as the U.N.,  the U.S. Embassy in Libya, and both the Tunisian and Egyptian  Governments for hosting recent political and military discussions.   However, hard work and difficult compromises lie ahead. Recent talks  failed to yield a transitional governmental administration. Public  services like electricity continue to be limited or nonexistent.   Moreover, progress on securing withdrawal of weapons, foreign forces,  and mercenaries from Libya remains elusive. And we should not forget  that previous diplomatic efforts in Libya repeatedly failed.   That is why it is so important that we pass this bill today. It calls  for a more active U.S. role in diplomacy, provides humanitarian  assistance, and supports future elections, measures that will reinforce  negotiations.   It also sanctions those who deploy mercenaries, support militias,  violate the U.N. arms embargo, and commit human rights violations in  Libya. The bill's punitive measures take effect if the cease-fire  collapses, which will incentivize the warring parties to remain at the  negotiating table rather than return to the battlefield.    Mr. Speaker, the bill that we will pass today  demonstrates this Congress' interest in deescalating the conflict and  that we support working with the U.N., our European allies, regional  states, and Libyans to end the war and to help rebuild Libya.   Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Wilson for his leadership on this  issue. I also thank both the majority and minority staffs of the  committee, and special thanks to Ryan Doherty of my staff for his  tireless efforts in bringing this bill to this floor today.
