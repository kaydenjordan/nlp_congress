 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 1551) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of  1986 to modify the credit for production from advanced nuclear power  facilities, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1551         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and  extend their remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1551,  currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I stand in strong support of H.R. 1551, a bill I have  sponsored that modifies the advanced nuclear production tax credit.   The nuclear production tax credit has been a vital incentive to jump- start a nuclear industry that has been dormant for almost 40 years.  Unfortunately, due to overregulation, ambiguities in the law, and other  unanticipated events, the first-in-a-generation nuclear plants that  began construction because of this tax credit are in danger of being  shut down midconstruction.   Without certainty that these facilities will have full access to the  allocation of their tax credits, it may be another 30 or 40 years  before this country builds another cutting-edge nuclear facility.  Thankfully, the legislation we are considering today provides these  facilities the certainty they so desperately need to move forward.                                time  1630    Almost 12 years ago, Congress established the nuclear production tax  credit as part of a broader package designed to ensure our energy  independence. Not wanting to oversubsidize the nuclear industry,  Congress set out to limit the credit in a number of ways, including a  national production capacity that effectively capped the amount of this  credit available.   South Carolina and Georgia responded to this incentive, making large  investments in nuclear facilities that represented the pinnacle of  safety and innovation in the industry. After years of applications,  planning, and rigorous oversight by multiple regulatory authorities,  these plants began construction in 2013, receiving sizable allocations  of the nuclear production tax credit's national capacity.   Yet, it quickly became clear changes to the underlying provision were  necessary in order for these plants to fulfill the capacity allocation  as Congress originally intended. For example, right now, not-for-profit  entities like public utilities are unable to utilize or transfer their  share of the credits, leaving the majority of the tax credits allocated  to these two plants unusable.  [[Page H4959]]    Additionally, strict placed-in-service date rules would force these  plants to make decisions between finishing before a deadline or making  sure they are constructed in the safest way possible.   Recently, to make matters worse, a third-party contractor for both  plants unexpectedly filed for bankruptcy, putting the projects in  jeopardy of finishing before the placed-in-service date, if at all.   In the coming weeks, both plants must go before State regulators and  provide a plan for how they will continue construction. The full  availability of the $2 billion in tax credits will be a key factor in  the regulators' assessment of whether to approve the plans to continue  with the facilities or shut down the construction completely.   Taking a step back for a second, I think it is important to note that  one of my top priorities in Congress is to help restore our country's  competitiveness through a comprehensive overhaul of our Tax Code. An  ideal tax system promotes parity between different energy sources and  gets the government out of the business of picking winners and losers.   Before we get to that ideal tax system, we must create a smooth  transition from our current system to the new system. This legislation  is an important part of that transition. As Ways and Means Committee  Chairman Brady said at our markup last week: ``Nuclear power is a  critical component of an all-of-the-above strategy for energy  independence and national security.''   Without this legislation, the nuclear power industry may cease to  exist as we know it today in this country, which is exactly why passing  this legislation today is more important now than ever. Nuclear power  is crucial to our energy independence.   Additionally, if these facilities shut down tomorrow, it will  immediately cost 12,000 jobs in South Carolina and Georgia. It will  cost the ratepayers hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars in increases  in their annual utility bills. And most alarming, our national security  will be jeopardized, as countries like China and Russia continue to  make massive investments in nuclear power production.   We need to give these plants the certainty of the tax credits as  Congress originally intended, not just for South Carolina and Georgia,  but for the continued innovation of nuclear energy and the security of  our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Jody B. Hice).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), the chairman of the Ways and Means  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Sanford).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I cannot overstate the importance this  legislation represents to the future of nuclear energy production in  the United States.   As the Ways and Means Committee noted when it approved this same  measure last year, while the committee continues to work on  comprehensive tax reform as a critical means of promoting economic  growth and job creation, it is important to provide immediate clarity  and certainty on tax issues affecting American businesses, and this  legislation will provide just that.  [[Page H4963]]    I would also like to thank Chairman Brady for his continued support  of H.R. 1551, as well as the bipartisan support we received when this  bill was voted out of committee by voice vote last week.   Mr. Speaker, I ask for continued bipartisan support from my  colleagues here in the House in passing this legislation, not just  because it makes commonsense changes to the credit but because of the  extreme sense of urgency to provide certainty for our nuclear industry.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
