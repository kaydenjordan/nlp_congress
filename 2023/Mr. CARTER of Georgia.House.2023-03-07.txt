 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor George  Schwarz, who was chosen to be the grand marshal for this year's  Savannah St. Patrick's Day Parade.  [[Page H1133]]    Mr. Schwarz, a graduate of Jenkins High School, has spent his entire  life living in and serving Savannah. His dedication to his hometown is  matched by his pride in his Irish heritage.   Mr. Schwarz has served on the parade council for almost 40 years; a  council that his father and grandfather served on as well.   Being chosen to be the grand marshal for this parade is the highest  honor for any Savannahian with Irish blood, and I cannot think of  anyone more deserving than Mr. Schwarz.   To be a grand marshal is no small honor. It is a recognition of years  of hard work. He knows this parade so well that I have even heard that  if he is given a random parade float number, he can tell you exactly  what floats will come before and after that one.   I know that Mr. Schwarz will make a great grand marshal, and I look  forward to seeing the parade he puts on.                            ____________________
