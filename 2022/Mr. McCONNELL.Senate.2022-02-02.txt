 Madam President, first, the entire Senate is praying  for and pulling for our colleague Senator Lujan. We learned yesterday  that our colleague suffered a stroke late last week and has been  hospitalized in New Mexico as he recovers. It is certainly encouraging  to read that our friend and colleague is expected to make a full  recovery.   I know that all 99 of his colleagues are thinking of him every day,  rooting for a swift and smooth recovery, and already looking forward to  the next time we see him.
