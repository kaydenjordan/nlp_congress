 Mr. President, I would like to acknowledge the  contributions and legacy of Norman W. Deschampe, the longtime chairman  of the Grand Portage Band of the Lake Superior Chippewa, who recently  passed away on February 9, 2019.   Norman Deschampe was born on February 26, 1953, and lived with a  commitment to improving the lives of the people of the Grand Portage  Band of Lake Superior Chippewa. For more than 40 years, Norman  Deschampe served the people of the Grand Portage Band, first as a  Tribal council member and later as secretary-treasurer and, for 27  years, as chairman. He also served for 6 years as vice president and 22  years as president of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe.   Norman Deschampe's legacy includes a longstanding commitment to  supporting the health, education, and economic development of the Grand  Portage Band. He promoted environmental stewardship and fostered  relationships with local, State, and Federal governments to encourage  conservation on the reservation and beyond. Norman Deschampe encouraged  the appreciation and preservation of the traditions and customs of the  Grand Portage Band and is remembered by many for his kindness and  generosity.   Norman Deschampe made a lasting contribution to the Grand Portage  Band and the State of Minnesota, and I am proud to recognize his legacy  as Minnesota celebrated Norman Deschampe Day on Tuesday, February 26,  2019.                            ____________________
