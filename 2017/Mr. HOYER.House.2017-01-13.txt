 Mr. Speaker, I absolutely disagree with the previous  speaker. He is wrong. He is wrong on the facts. The fact is, the  Affordable Care Act was on the table longer than any bill since I have  been in Congress--which is 36 years--to read, to review, to analyze,  and to make a decision.  [[Page H476]]    Every American will be adversely affected if we repeal the Affordable  Care Act. Millions of Americans with disabilities depend on access to  quality, affordable health care and deserve to have their voices heard  in the debate over our healthcare system.   In fact, only one in five Americans, when polled, think we ought to  repeal the Affordable Care Act without having a replacement. There is  no replacement. Sixty-four times they voted to repeal the Affordable  Care Act. They still do not have a replacement.   According to the CDC, 53 million Americans live with some form of  disability. Were the Affordable Care Act to be repealed, insurers would  again be permitted to discriminate against them, denying coverage for  increasing premiums based on their disabilities. Repeal would also  allow insurance companies again to impose annual and lifetime limits on  coverage for every American.   Do not repeal the Affordable Care Act. Show us the beef. Show us the  alternative.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, every American will be affected by this  vote, not just the 20 million people who will lose their insurance  immediately. Thirty million, in total, will lose their insurance.  Everybody's premium will ultimately go up. Preexisting conditions will  not be available. Seniors will pay more for prescription drugs. 25-,  24-, 23-year-olds will be dropped from the insurance of their families.   The fact of the matter is--the gentleman from Florida that just  spoke--there is not a better way that has been proposed. There is some  discussion about across State lines. There is some other discussion  about health savings accounts, which is great if you have the kind of  salaries we have; but if you are an average American trying to support  your family, getting additional funds to put into a health savings  account is not available to you.   Mr. Chairman, this budget resolution is an abdication of  responsibility and duty. Rather than showing Republican spending and  revenue priorities, it is nothing more than a vehicle for expediting a  repeal of the Affordable Care Act and taking insurance coverage away  from 30 million people.                                time  1200    Again, let me remind you it is hundreds of millions of people that  will be adversely affected.   Since taking the House majority, Republicans have held 65 votes on  this floor to undo healthcare reforms that have brought the uninsured  rate to its lowest in recorded history and banned discrimination and  discriminatory practices, such as denying coverage to Americans with  preexisting conditions or charging women higher rates than men simply  because of their gender.   Now our Republican colleagues want to repeal the Affordable Care Act  without immediately replacing it, contrary to at least 12 of their  colleagues in the United States Senate--Republicans--saying that is not  the right way to go. That is what this resolution would do.   By the way, they should have adopted this resolution last Congress by  April 15. They didn't do so.   This is not a real budget resolution. This is simply a device so that  they can jam through repeal of the Affordable Care Act in the United  States Senate contrary to the existing rules. It would come at a severe  cost to our economy and our budget sustainability.   In addition to the 30 million who would lose their insurance, tens of  millions more, as I have said, would see their costs go up. A report by  the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund and Milken Institute found that the  repeal would lead to the loss of 3 million jobs, and the Committee for  a Responsible Federal Budget found it would add $350 billion to  deficits over the next 10 years.   Let us be clear, Mr. Chairman, a vote for this budget resolution is a  vote to take health insurance away from 30 million Americans and  adversely impact the health care of millions more.   I urge my Republican colleagues who have serious concerns about our  fiscal path and misgivings about repealing the Affordable Care Act  without replacing it: let's lay down a marker that Congress should not  rush headlong into this costly repeal not only in terms of dollars, but  in terms of health security consequences for the American people.   Mr. Chairman, I urge the House to vote ``no'' on this dangerous and  destructive resolution.    Mr. Speaker, every one of us who serves in this House  relies on the talented and hardworking staff of ours and of the House  itself. We couldn't do what we do without them. They not only serve us  faithfully, but serve our constituents as well, and they often do so  without recognition.   Today my colleagues and I want to recognize someone who has been  serving the people of Maryland's Fifth District and our country as a  senior member of my staff for a decade and, indeed, before that, on the  Senate side for close to a decade as well.   Many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have come to know  Mary Frances Repko. If you have dealt with the environment, if you have  dealt with energy, or if you have dealt with the history of the Senate  and the House on energy legislation and environmental legislation over  the last 20 years, you know Mary Frances Repko.   Mr. Speaker, many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle know  Mary Frances well and respect her deep intellect, her professionalism,  and her sage counsel. When it comes to energy policy and environmental  issues, there are few on this Hill who know more of the intricacies and  complexities of the issues than she does.   I am very proud of Mary Frances because the leadership staffs on both  the Democratic and Republican side engage her in order to ensure that  all the facts and ramifications of energy and environmental legislation  are known and considered.   Mary Frances has been integrally involved in every major energy and  environmental legislative debate over the past 10 years.   I know Leader Pelosi is also a great admirer of Mary Frances Repko.  Her staff and Mary Frances have worked very closely together, including  on the Recovery Act, the American Clean Energy and Security Act, the  Energy Independence and Security Act, the EPA Act of 2005, the  Renewable Fuel Standard, the BP oil spill, flood insurance, Hurricane  Sandy relief, the Water Resources Development Act, the Flint water  crisis, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Land and Water  Conservation Fund, land conservation bills, transportation bills, and  fighting partisan antienvironmental riders--an extraordinary history of  deep and effective involvement on the issues.                                time  1545    She has also been my lead staff on Puerto Rico, working closely with  the Resident Commissioner's staff to help the people of the island  through a debt crisis and Zika. For the past 4 years, she has also been  the lead staffer for House Democrats' Make It In America plan for  investing in job creation and making opportunities more accessible to  American workers.   When Mary Frances first came to the whip's office in 2007, I felt  fortunate to have enticed her to leave the United States Senate, where  she had served as a senior policy adviser for the Committee on the  Environment and Public Works. Earlier, she had served as Senator  Cantwell's legislative director, and as legislative staffer for former  Senator Russ Feingold.   Now it is with a great sadness that we must wish her farewell and  send her back to the Senate, where she will return to the Environment  and Public Works Committee as its new deputy staff director.    I yield to the gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Speaker, I know that Mary Frances very much  appreciates the words of Leader Pelosi. I know that the leader is  absolutely correct: we are not sending her. She is going.   But I want to tell the leader and tell this House that I talked to  Senator Carper, who is the chairman of the committee, and I said: Tom,  I will not stand in the schoolhouse door, if you will, and not let her  out of our office; but you must pledge that she will be available for  our calls and for our questions on a regular basis.   Madam Leader, he assures me that that is the case. I thank the  gentlewoman for the comments.   Mr. Speaker, our loss, though, is the Senate's gain. I have no doubt  that Mary Frances will bring her talents, her wisdom, and her Michigan- bred can-do attitude to the important work the committee will undertake  this Congress and in the years ahead.   I hope all of my colleagues and, indeed, the American people we serve  will join me in thanking Mary Frances Repko for her contributions to  the work of this House and to the service she has given to our country  during her time as a member of the staff of the Senate and the House.   I hope you will all join me in wishing her great success in her new  position, in which I can assure you she will not be a stranger to us in  the House, but a crucial liaison to the work of the Environment and  Public Works Committee just across the hall.   Thank you, Mary Frances. Thank you for a job well done and for your  service and wise counsel.  [[Page H534]]                                ____________________
