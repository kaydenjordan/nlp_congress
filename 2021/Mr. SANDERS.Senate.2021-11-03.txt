 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the  Community Health Centers of Burlington for 50 years of extraordinary  service.   Today, the Community Health Centers of Burlington--CHCB--is the  second largest federally qualified health center--FQHC--in Vermont,  serving over 30,000 patients at eight locations. Fifty years ago, when  they opened their doors in 1971 as the People's Free Clinic in a small  storefront in Burlington's Old North End, the center was run by  volunteers and served just 50 patients each week. And while they have  grown tremendously since those early days, CHCB has maintained a  commitment to what the founders of the clinic at the time described as  ``a new kind of health care,'' rooted in the understanding that people  from all walks of life deserves high quality, affordable healthcare.   In 1989, CHCB was designated as a federal Healthcare for the Homeless  site and, in 1993, officially became an FQHC. Becoming an FQHC meant  CHCB was able to access important grants from the Federal Government,  improvement reimbursement rate for care, and offer a sliding fee scale,  so no one would be turned away because they could not afford the care  they needed. But let me be clear: Health centers like CHCB are not  exclusively for those who have nowhere else to go. For many people  living in the Burlington area and across Vermont, community health  centers like CHCB are the provider of choice because they provide  timely access to high-quality care in community-centered clinics. In  fact, today, approximately one-third of all CHCB patients are covered  by private health insurance. Another reason that FQHCs are so popular  and used by so many people in Vermont and across the country is that  they also offer dental care. CHCB first added dental services into its  main site in 2004, and today, 7000 patients receive dental care at one  of three CHCB locations. Further, in addition to offering primary care  and oral healthcare, FQHCs also offer mental healthcare and substance  use disorder treatment, as well as low-cost prescription drugs. It is  clear why nearly one-in-three Vermonters rely on FQHCs like CHCB for  their care.   In 2012, the Community Health Centers of Burlington was able to  utilize funding from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to  renovate its main location, known as the Riverside Health Center,  allowing for updated patient care rooms; laboratory space; dental  operatories; and integrated psychiatry, counseling, and substance use  [[Page S7717]]  disorder treatment. Understanding that many Vermonters outside of the  Burlington area struggled to access affordable care, CHCB established a  rural practice in the Champlain Islands. The health center also  expanded into Winooski in 2017, in partnership with Winooski Family  Health. But CHCB's expansion is not simply about growing the number of  locations. They have also continued to expand the services offered,  including ensuring they can offer culturally competent care to the  growing New American community. Today, CHCB offers translation services  to over 45 languages at their sites, making care not just affordable  but understandable to all who need it.   The Community Health Centers of Burlington is an excellent example of  why federally qualified health centers are so important. To my mind,  there is no question that healthcare is a human right and health  centers like CHCB play an enormously important role in making sure that  no one is denied care because of their income. That is why I have  continually fought to protect and expand Federal funding for community  health centers throughout my time in Congress. I am proud that during  the negotiations of the Affordable Care Act, I was successful in  securing mandatory funding for these health centers, knowing that they  would be better served by knowing that they could rely on funding for  the Federal Government for years to come. I have continued to fight for  funding for FHQCs during the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, knowing  how critical they are to keeping patients healthy and connected to  their communities during these extremely challenging times. I am  grateful to all of my colleagues here in the Senate and in the House of  Representatives who have joined me in this effort throughout the years.   To the staff of CHCB, I want to say that I know that your hard work  and dedication is at the heart of CHCB's success. I know it is not  always easy to work in primary care, and I am grateful for your  efforts. And to the patients who rely on CHCB each year, know that I am  glad you have entrusted your care to them and that I will do everything  in my power to ensure they are there to care for you for decades to  come. And as you take time to celebrate your many successes over the  past 50 years, I know you are also looking toward the opportunities and  challenges that lay ahead for the future. I look forward to continuing  to work with you to tackle the challenges, like further expanding  access and care, reducing costs, and recruiting and retaining a  talented workforce dedicated to primary care. I will also stand with  you as you find new opportunities for success and growth. While the  issues we face are enormous, I know that community health centers like  CHCB are a key to solving them.   I sincerely congratulate the entire Community Health Centers of  Burlington family on this momentous occasion and wish you another 50  years of delivering compassionate, professional, and innovative  healthcare services to your fellow Vermonters.                            ____________________
