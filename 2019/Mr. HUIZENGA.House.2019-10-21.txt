 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate three west  Michigan schools that have recently been recognized for their academic  excellence and high student achievement.   It is an honor to represent Lakewood Elementary School and Eagle  Crest Charter Academy in Holland, Michigan, and Peach Plains Elementary  School in Grand Haven, which were each awarded the prestigious Blue  Ribbon Award by the Department of Education.   Each year, this esteemed recognition is presented to K-12 schools  across the Nation that show outstanding gains in student achievement or  demonstrate academic excellence that goes above and beyond.   In west Michigan, we have a legacy of offering our children excellent  educational opportunities. These three schools in Ottawa County join a  wonderful group of west Michigan schools that have already earned this  distinction in the past.   This award affirms the hard work of students, educators, families,  and entire communities that have dedicated themselves to creating a  learning environment where students can thrive and achieve academic  success.   Congratulations to the Eagle Crest Charter Academy, Lakewood  Elementary School, and Peach Plains Elementary, and the students,  parents, and staff for their hard work, dedication, and commitment to  improving educational outcomes in our communities.                            ____________________
