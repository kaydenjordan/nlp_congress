 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1108) to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to extend the  authority of the Federal Communications Commission to grant a license  or construction permit through a system of competitive bidding.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1108         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF FCC AUCTION AUTHORITY.         Section 309(j)(11) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47       U.S.C. 309(j)(11)) is amended by striking ``March 9, 2023''       and inserting ``May 19, 2023''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is important today that we consider H.R. 1108. This  bill would extend the Federal Communications Commission's general  authority to auction spectrum and provide licenses and construction  permits for the use of radio spectrum.   This piece of legislation is sponsored by the gentlewoman from  Washington who is the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee and  also by the ranking member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, the  gentleman from New Jersey.   Without congressional action, the FCC's authority to issue spectrum  licenses expires on March 9. Auction authority is a key tool for making  frequencies available for commercial uses that enable U.S.  technological leadership.   This bill will also ensure that FCC has the authority it needs to  continue issuing licenses for a spectrum band that will be used to  provide better coverage and wireless speeds across the United States.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Washington State (Mrs. Rodgers), the chair of the Energy and Commerce  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Dunn).    Mr. Speaker, I also urge support of H.R. 1108. In the  report that just came out from the Congressional Budget Office this  past week for the budget outlook for 2023 to 2033, it is important to  note that, on page 13, it cites that the FCC conducted several auctions  in 2021 and 2022, which boosted net receipts in 2022 to $104 billion.   Mr. Speaker, it is absolutely essential that this piece of  legislation is passed, and I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R.  1108.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
