 Madam Speaker, there is no denying that the crisis at our  southern border was caused by President Biden and his administration's  open-border policies.   Since President Biden took office, more than 3.8 million illegal  immigrants have been apprehended at our southern border. Meanwhile, the  commissioner of Customs and Border Protection was falling asleep during  meetings while this crisis continued on his watch.   This is exactly why, around 2 weeks ago, I joined 15 of my fellow  House Republicans, led by Congressman Hice, in calling on CBP  Commissioner Magnus to resign. Thankfully, he did, and now our country  and its national security are better off.   Already, before Republicans even officially take the majority, we are  holding the Biden administration accountable.   I promise that come January 3, when the new Congress is sworn in, you  can expect more accountability where that came from.              President Biden's Student Loan Forgiveness Handout     Madam Speaker, the Congressional Budget Office has  confirmed what most Tennesseans already knew. President Biden's plan to  give a handout to millions of college-educated Americans will be paid  for with even more deficit spending than anticipated, around $400  billion in deficit spending to be exact.   This is just as shocking: The President thinks it is acceptable and  legal to spend this kind of money without congressional approval. But  it is neither.   We hear $10,000 per borrower thrown around a lot, but the CBO says 24  million people would receive $20,000 in debt forgiveness under the  plan. That is basically a 2022 Hyundai Elantra or a Kia Soul or a  brand-new Nissan Sentra.   I ask my Democrat colleagues: How are you okay with giving away the  equivalent of a new car to 24 million people and asking those without  student debt to foot the bill, asking Tennessee plumbers to foot the  bill for Harvard-educated lawyers, asking America's blue-collar workers  to give a subsidy to some of the best-educated people and best-paid  people in this country?   This administration must reverse course on this wrong-headed,  regressive policy.                            ____________________
