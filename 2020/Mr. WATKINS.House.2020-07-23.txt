 Madam Speaker, today I rise in support of President  Trump and fellow Kansan, Secretary Mike Pompeo, in their dealings with  China. This includes closing the consulate in Houston.   The CCP has for decades been using meticulous multidimensional  strategies to degrade and undermine American hegemony and democracies  around the world.   Chairman Ghee has accelerated these efforts. That is clearly apparent  in the CCP's dealings with COVID-19, their mass detention of more than  a million Uighurs, and their violation of Hong Kong's sovereignty.   Every action that China takes affects the global economy and security  and, more importantly, the lives of Americans.   China's repeated aggression and nefarious actions have proven China  cannot be trusted.   Thankfully, we now have an American President and a Secretary of  State who won't be treating China with kid gloves and a President  unlike any other in history who will be tough on China.                            ____________________
