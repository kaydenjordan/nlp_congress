 Madam Speaker, the people of Louisiana recently lost a  respected political leader, a businessman, a war veteran, and a civil  rights leader, Mr. Willie Belton.   Mr. Belton had a life of a service to others. He was awarded the  Bronze Star and the Purple Heart under fire, heroically, during the  Korean war.   He marched with Dr. Martin Luther King in Washington, Alabama,  Tennessee, and Mississippi. Like Dr. King, Mr. Belton always advocated  Christian values and nonviolent protests. He also led his local NAACP  chapter in Louisiana. In February 2019, he was awarded the Louisiana  Medal of Honor.   Madam Speaker, please join me in honoring his lifetime of service to  Louisiana and a Louisiana treasure, Mr. Willie Belton, whose memory  will, fortunately, live with us forever.                            ____________________
