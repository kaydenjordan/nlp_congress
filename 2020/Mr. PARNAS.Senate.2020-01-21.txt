 That was the only motivation.         There was no other motivation.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. These are just some of the email communications  that we know to exist, but there are undoubtedly more, including, for  example, Ambassador Yovanovitch's request for the State Department to  issue a statement of support of her around the time that Mr. Giuliani  was speaking directly with Secretary Pompeo, but that statement never  came.   The State Department has gathered these records, and they are ready  to be turned over pursuant to a subpoena from the Senate. It would not  be a time-consuming or lengthy process to obtain them, and there are  clearly--clearly--important and relevant documents to the President's  scheme. If we want the full and complete truth, then we need to see  those emails.   The Senate should also seek a third item that the State Department  has refused to provide, and that is Ambassador Taylor's extraordinary  first-person diplomatic cable to Secretary Pompeo, dated August 29 and  sent at the recommendation of the National Security Advisor, John  Bolton, in which Ambassador Taylor strenuously objected to the  withholding of military aid from Ukraine, as Ambassador Taylor  recounted in his deposition.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Ambassador TAYLOR. Near the end of Ambassador Bolton's       visit, I asked to meet him privately, during which I       expressed to him my serious concern about the withholding of       military assistance to Ukraine while the Ukrainians were       defending their country from Russian aggression. Ambassador       Bolton recommended that I send a first-person cable to       Secretary Pompeo directly relaying my concerns.        I wrote and transmitted such a cable on August 29th,       describing the folly I saw in withholding military aid to       Ukraine at a time when hostilities were still active in the       east and when Russia was watching closely to gauge the level       of American support for  [[Page S398]]       the Ukrainian Government. The Russians, as I said at my       deposition, would love to see the humiliation of President       Zelensky at the hands of the Americans. I told the Secretary       that I could not and would not defend such a policy.        Although I received no specific response, I heard that soon       thereafter the Secretary carried the cable with him to a       meeting at the White House focused on security assistance for       Ukraine.    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. While we know from Ambassador Taylor and Deputy  Assistant Secretary Kent that the cable was received, we do not know  whether or how the State Department responded, nor do we know if the  State Department possesses any other internal records relating to this  cable.   This cable is vital for three reasons. First, it demonstrates the  harm that President Trump did to our national security when he used  foreign policy as an instrument of his own personal, political gain.  Second, on the same day the cable was sent, President Zelensky's senior  aide told Ambassador Taylor that he was ``very concerned'' about the  hold on military assistance. He added that the Ukrainians were ``just  desperate'' for it to be released. In other words, President Trump's  effort to use military aid to apply additional pressure on Ukraine was  working.   Finally, based on reporting by the New York Times, we now know that  within days of Ambassador Taylor sending this cable, President Trump  discussed Ukrainian security assistance with Secretary Pompeo, Defense  Secretary Esper, and National Security Advisor Bolton. The  investigation uncovered testimony that Secretary Pompeo brought  Ambassador Taylor's cable to the White House; perhaps it was during  this meeting. There, perhaps prodded by Ambassador Taylor's cable, all  three of them pleaded--pleaded--with the President to resume the  crucial military aid. Yet the President refused.   This body has a right to see Ambassador Taylor's cable, as well as  the other State Department records addressing the official response to  it. Although it may have been classified at the time, the State  Department could no longer claim that the topic of security assistance  remains classified today in light of the President's decision to  declassify his two telephone calls with President Zelensky and Mr.  Mulvaney's public statements about security assistance.   The fourth category of documents that the Senate should subpoena are  contemporaneous, first-person accounts from State Department officials  who were caught up in President Trump's corrupt scheme. These  documents, which were described in detail by Deputy Assistant Secretary  Kent, Ambassador Taylor, and political officer David Holmes, would help  complete the record and clarify how the President's scheme unfolded in  realtime and how the Ukrainians reacted.   Mr. Kent wrote notes or memos to file at least four times, according  to his testimony. Ambassador Taylor took extensive notes of nearly  every conversation he had--some in a little notebook. David Holmes, the  Embassy official in Ukraine, was a consistent notetaker of important  meetings with Ukrainian officials.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)
