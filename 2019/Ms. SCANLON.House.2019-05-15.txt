 Madam Speaker, yesterday the House passed H.R. 299, the  Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act of 2019. This long overdue  legislation would finally provide disability benefits to veterans who  served in the territorial seas surrounding Vietnam during the Vietnam  war and were exposed to Agent Orange.   This change is long overdue but, sadly, thousands of brave Vietnam  veterans have already suffered the consequences of Agent Orange-related  illnesses.   A longtime resident of Media, Pennsylvania, John Bury, was a 22-year  veteran of the Navy and a legendary advocate for sailors sickened by  Agent Orange. He, himself, survived cancer six times related to Agent  Orange, and knew firsthand the challenges of navigating the VA due to  his service being on ships, rather than land.   John passed away in late 2016, but his memory and service will live  on. Sailors like John are heroes and deserve to be treated as such by  the VA.   I urge the Senate to quickly take up this legislation and send it to  the President's desk so that thousands of others like John can get the  care they deserve.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 377 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 377         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 5) to       prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex, gender identity,       and sexual orientation, and for other purposes. All points of       order against consideration of the bill are waived. The       amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by the       Committee on the Judiciary now printed in the bill shall be       considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill, as amended, are waived.

Sec. 3.  At any time after adoption of this resolution the       Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       987) to amend the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act       to provide for Federal Exchange outreach and educational       activities.

All points of order against such       further amendments are waived. At the conclusion of       consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee shall       rise and report the bill, as amended, to the House with such       further amendments as may have been adopted. The previous       question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as       amended, and on any further amendment thereto to final       passage without intervening motion except one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.     Madam Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield  the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole),  pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During  consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose  of debate only.                                General Leave     Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  be given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and  reported a rule, House Resolution 377, providing for consideration of  H.R. 5 under a closed rule, with 90 minutes of debate equally divided  and controlled by the Chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on the Judiciary.   The resolution also provides for consideration of H.R. 312 under a  closed rule, with 1 hour of general debate equally divided and  controlled by the Chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on  Natural Resources.   Lastly, this resolution provides for consideration of H.R. 987 under  a structured rule, with 90 minutes of general debate, 60 minutes  equally divided and controlled by the Chair and ranking minority member  of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and 30 minutes equally divided  and controlled by the Chair and ranking minority member of the  Committee on Education and Labor. Twenty-seven amendments are made in  order.   Madam Speaker, we are here today to debate the rule for three  important pieces of legislation: H.R. 987, H.R. 312, and H.R. 5.   H.R. 987 is the Strengthening Health Care and Lowering Prescription  Drug Costs Act, a package of several bills, many of them bipartisan,  that went through the House Energy and Commerce Committee under regular  order. This bill combines three key bills to lower drug costs by  promoting generic competition and four key bills to strengthen  healthcare, reverse the sabotage of the ACA by this administration with  respect to marketing and outreach, and rescind the Trump  administration's efforts to promote junk plans that lack the  protections of the Affordable Care Act.   The American people are justifiably demanding action by Congress to  make prescription drugs more affordable. Prices are so high that recent  data show 24 percent of Americans didn't fill a prescription in the  past year due to high costs.   My constituents have been vocal in demanding action on drug pricing,  patients like Bill, a senior with diabetes who attends my church,  parents like Sarah with children who have special health needs. Folks  like these need help now.   This package would lower costs by banning anticompetitive practices  that large drug companies employ to keep generics off the market.   This bill will also tackle many of the reasons we have seen  enrollment  [[Page H3802]]  through the Affordable Care Act decline in recent years.   Since coming into office, President Trump has cut paid advertising  and outreach efforts for healthcare exchanges by 90 percent. This  wanton political decision to cut these efforts is but one part of the  administration's attempts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act.   Furthermore, lack of transparency on the part of Health and Human  Services around funding levels for outreach plan enrollment rates and  other vital statistics has created an information vacuum on the  performance of the ACA.   Greater transparency is required in order for Congress to hold the  administration accountable for its efforts to defund education and  outreach for the Affordable Care Act.   Second, we have H.R. 312, the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe Reservation  Reaffirmation Act. This important bill recognizes and respects the  Tribal sovereignty of the Mashpee Wampanoag, a Tribe that has inhabited  New England for over 12,000 years and, in fact, welcomed the Pilgrims  to the new world.   This legislation has strong bipartisan support in Massachusetts among  other Tribal nations and with Tribal allies in Congress. Had President  Trump not tweeted about this bill last week, it would have likely  passed on suspension and been sent to the Senate for consideration. The  members of this Tribe cannot wait any longer for recognition, and we  need to pass this critical legislation without further delay.   Finally, Madam Speaker, this is a week that will be remembered in our  history books because, at long last, this body is taking up  consideration of the Equality Act. Forty-five years ago this week, the  legendary Congresswoman Bella Abzug introduced the first version of the  Equality Act, a bill that will give full legal protections to LGBTQ  people all across our country.   This version of the Equality Act that we consider today is the result  of years of careful legislative drafting and amends existing civil  rights laws to provide protections from discrimination based on sexual  orientation and gender identity in key areas of public life:  employment, housing, credit, education, public spaces and services,  federally funded programs, and jury service.   Additionally, the Equality Act updates the public spaces and services  covered in current law to include retail stores, services such as  banks, legal services, and transportation services. These important  updates will strengthen existing protections for everyone.   The journey to this final version of the Equality Act was led by a  man who is a history maker in his own right, co-chair of the LGBTQ  Equality Caucus and my colleague on the Judiciary Committee,  Congressman   David Cicilline from Rhode Island.                                time  1230    Congressman Cicilline worked with lawyers and advocates from the left  and the right, religious groups, and myriad civil rights groups to make  sure that the language of the Equality Act achieved full legal equality  while doing nothing to undermine existing civil rights protections for  other marginalized groups.   The resulting bill is supported by 130 of the largest employers in  the country, our largest labor unions, and hundreds of organizations,  including, to name just a few, the Leadership Conference for Civil and  Human Rights, the NAACP, the National Women's Law Center, the Episcopal  Church, the Union for Reform Judaism, and the United Church of Christ.   Most importantly, it is supported by a clear and overwhelming  majority of the American people. Seventy-one percent of Americans  support legislation like the Equality Act to protect LGBTQ people  against discrimination in employment, housing, and public  accommodations.   Rarely does Congress have the chance to take up legislation so  clearly supported by our constituents. That is probably why, since the  day that Congressman Cicilline first introduced this version of the  Equality Act in 2015, it has always earned bipartisan support and  currently has Republican cosponsors in both the House and the Senate.   The clear majority of both this Chamber and the American people  recognize that, for far too long, LGBTQ people have faced  discrimination with no Federal legal recourse. It is beyond dispute  that LGBTQ people, especially transgender people and especially  transgender women of color, face discrimination across this country.   This is a personal issue for me. It has been personal since my baby  sister came out to me about 40 years ago.   For many people in this country, that is when the fight hits home. It  gets personal when someone you love says, ``This is who I am,'' and you  know and value that person, and you will do whatever you can to make  sure that your loved one can live life to the fullest, free from hate  and discrimination.   I am sad to say that my home in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is  one of the 30 States that defies the will of its people by not having  legal protections for LGBTQ people. The idea that my sister, someone  who put her life on the line for our country when she served in the  armed forces, could drive across State lines and lose protections is  heartbreaking.   The Equality Act ends the patchwork of State laws and creates uniform  nationwide protections. LGBTQ people won't have to worry that being  transferred to another State by their employer or needing to move home  to take care of ailing parents will cause them to lose civil rights  protections. From sea to shining sea, LGBTQ people will have the  security and stability that comes from knowing that if they face  discrimination, they have legal recourse.   It is also important to note what the Equality Act does not do. The  Equality Act does not impinge on religious liberty. Religious liberty  is a cornerstone value of our Constitution and our country. Religious  organizations are able to prefer their own members and their version of  morality in hiring for religious positions such as ministers, rabbis,  or schoolteachers. The Equality Act does nothing to change that.   The Equality Act clarifies what has long been held, though, that  religious freedom laws do not create an exemption to civil rights laws.  Just like a person can't use a claim of religious freedom to refuse to  sell a house to an interracial couple, under the Equality Act, LGBTQ  families will be protected from discrimination, regardless of its  motivation.   Consider the stakes facing LGBTQ people too often across this  country. A same-sex couple walks into a restaurant. They hired a  babysitter to look after their young children and are hoping to have a  relaxing night out. They are seated and looking at the menu when the  manager comes over and tells them they have to leave. They are not  welcome there.   This kind of insecurity and humiliation occurs on a daily basis  across this country. In 30 States, the couple would have no legal  recourse. Often, humiliation is just the tip of the iceberg.   Same-sex couples are far more likely to be denied housing. Qualified  and high-performing transgender people are more likely to be fired from  their jobs. LGBTQ young people face rejection, homelessness, and  discrimination in school, denying them an education. These injuries  compound and lead to poverty, homelessness, and violence.   The impact is felt hardest by transgender women of color, who  confront racial discrimination, sex discrimination, and gender-identity  discrimination. The intersection of these forms of discrimination can  even be deadly, as it was for Shantee Tucker, a transgender woman of  color from Philadelphia who was murdered last fall.   The protections provided by the Equality Act give LGBTQ people an  equal chance at the American Dream. While discrimination and rejection  have ended the lives of too many transgender people, many are  succeeding, despite discrimination.   In Pennsylvania, Dr. Rachel Levine, a transgender woman, serves in  the Governor's cabinet as secretary for health. Mara Keisling, a  Pennsylvania native, is the founder and executive director of the  National Center for Transgender Equality and a pioneer for civil rights  protections. Danica Roem, the first transgender State legislator,  serves in the Virginia House of Delegates. LaLa Zannell is fighting  violence in New York City. Raffi Freedman-Gurspan was the first openly  transgender White House staffer. Miss Major Griffin-Gracy, who was at  Stonewall, has spent her life fighting to end  [[Page H3803]]  the over-incarceration of transgender people. The list goes on and on.   I am proud that the House will finally act to provide Federal  protections to LGBTQ people with passage of the Equality Act. The fight  for equal rights is far from over, but I am proud to be part of a  majority that prioritizes equal treatment for all of its  citizens, regardless of whom they love.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I would just note that, with respect to  H.R. 5, we had regular order. H.R. 5, the Equality Act, went through  the Committee on the Judiciary. It had a hearing, and then we also had  a markup. This is a new process, apparently, since the last Congress.  And then, of course, we had the Rules hearing last night.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Speier).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the distinguished chairman of the  Committee on Rules.    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Massachusetts  an additional 1 minute.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts (Mrs. Trahan).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record four letters, first, a letter  from the National Partnership for Women & Families urging support;  second, a letter from the Human Rights Campaign, also urging support  for H.R. 5; third, a letter from the American Federation of Government  Employees; and finally, a letter from several civil rights groups, all  urging support for H.R. 5.                                                National Partnership                                            for Women & Families,                                       Washington, DC, May 14, 2019.        Dear Representative: The National Partnership for Women &       Families is a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that has       fought for decades to advance the rights and well-being of       America's women and families. We work to foster a society in       which workplaces are fair, equitable and family friendly;       where everyone has access to quality, affordable health care,       including reproductive health care; and where every person       has the opportunity to achieve economic security and live       with dignity.        We write to voice our strong support for the Equality Act       (H.R. 5) and to urge you to vote YES on this groundbreaking       legislation. We also urge you to vote NO on any motion to       recommit that may be offered to undermine or alter the       Equality Act or otherwise harm civil liberties.        Despite significant progress, lesbian, gay, bisexual,       transgender and queer (LGBTQ) people still face considerable       discrimination and lack necessary protections across the       country. While some states have enacted laws that protect       against discrimination, the patchwork nature of these       protections means that millions of people continue to face       harassment, exclusion and uncertainty that negatively impact       their safety, their day-to-day lives, their families and       their ability to participate fully in society.        Part of achieving our nation's promise of equality, dignity       and fairness is ensuring that all people, regardless of       sexual orientation or gender identity, have equal opportunity       to succeed. No one should have access to services or doors to       opportunity closed because of outdated gender stereotypes       about how people should act, look or behave. This requires       stronger national nondiscrimination protections based on sex,       sexual orientation and gender identity.        The Equality Act is historic civil rights legislation that       would amend and supplement the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and       other key federal nondiscrimination laws that provide       protection from discrimination on the basis of race, color,       national origin or religion. This legislation would       strengthen protections from discrimination on the basis of       sex, and add critical new protections from discrimination on       the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity.       Specifically, it would provide clear, explicit protection       against discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender       identity in education, employment, housing, credit, federally       funded programs and federal jury services. These protections       are essential in ensuring that LGBTQ people have the right to       live with dignity and equality.        While the primary focus of the Equality Act is on LGBTQ       people, the Act would also close longstanding gaps in federal       law and provide important new legal protections for all women       by, for the first time, prohibiting discrimination on the       basis of sex in public spaces and services and in all       federally-funded activities. This means that, for example,       when women experience harassment as customers in restaurants,       stores, hotels, taxis or airports, there will now be a       remedy. The law will also ensure that breastfeeding parents       aren't excluded from or treated less favorably in public       places just for feeding their children, and it will make       clear that pharmacies can't refuse to fill a woman's birth       control prescription.        The bill's provisions that would ensure that sex does not       stand as a barrier to full participation in federally funded       programs or activities will mean, for example, that a       developer with a federal grant couldn't discriminate against       women-owned businesses in its contracting. Women would also       have new tools to challenge a police department's       systematically inadequate response to sexual violence and       intimate partner violence, if the police department received       federal funds; and would be able to challenge denials of       reproductive health care where a federally-funded entity       otherwise provides comparable or comprehensive health care.        These protections against sex discrimination are a critical       step forward in advancing women's equality in this country.        As a leading national women's rights organization we also       feel compelled to state emphatically that the Equality Act's       protections for transgender and gender nonconforming people       in no way undermine the rights or protections afforded to       women and do not jeopardize women's safety or their ability       to participate fully or equally in sport or in any other       aspect of our society. Transgender women are women, and any       attempt to mischaracterize their gender identity or suggest       that they are trying to ``take advantage'' of protected class       status fundamentally misunderstands the reality of       transgender people's lives and experiences. Furthermore, it       causes real harm to the more than one million Americans who       identify as transgender, a population already subject to high       rates of violence and abuse, negative mental and physical       health outcomes, and experiences with discrimination and       stigmatization.        The Equality Act is a long-overdue step forward in       extending civil rights protections to millions of women and       LGBTQ people. Establishing clear protections is critical at a       time when vulnerable communities are  [[Page H3807]]       under attack. The Equality Act would provide a consistent,       national standard and ensure that everyone has the       opportunity to live safely and with dignity, to advance at       work, to provide for one's family and to thrive economically.            Sincerely,      National Partnership for Women & Families.                                   ____                                            Human Rights Campaign,                                       Washington, DC, May 14, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the Human Rights       Campaign, the nation's largest civil rights organization       working to achieve lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and       queer (LGBTQ) equality, I write to urge you to vote in favor       of H.R. 5, the Equality Act, and against any Motion to       Recommit. We will consider both key votes.        Everyone--including LGBTQ people--should have an       opportunity to earn a living and provide a home for their       families without fear of constant harassment or       discrimination. The Equality Act would update our nation's       existing civil rights laws to explicitly include sexual       orientation and gender identity, which would finally provide       consistent non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ people       across key areas of life, including employment, housing,       credit, education, public spaces and services, federally       funded programs, and jury service. This would ensure LGBTQ       people have access to the exact same protections as are       currently provided under federal law based on other protected       characteristics.        Currently, 30 states lack non-discrimination protections       for LGBTQ people. The patchwork nature of current laws leaves       millions of people subject to uncertainty and potential       discrimination that impacts their safety, their families, and       their day-to-day lives. In fact, two-thirds of LGBTQ       Americans report having experienced discrimination. The       Equality Act would provide a nationwide standard for non-      discrimination protections.        The Equality Act has unprecedented support. More than 200       major corporations have endorsed the legislation, as well as       more than 40 trade associations including U.S. Chamber of       Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers.       Recent polling finds that a growing majority of Americans--      including Republicans, Democrats and Independents--support       LGBTQ non-discrimination protections and LGBTQ equality. A       recent survey by PRRI found that nearly seven in 10 Americans       support laws like the Equality Act. More than 500 national,       state, and local organizations have endorsed the legislation,       including social justice, religious, medical, and child       welfare organizations.        Again, I urge you to vote in favor of the Equality Act and       against any Motion to Recommit.        Thank you for your consideration. If you have any questions       or need more information, please do not hesitate to reach out       to me.            Sincerely,                                                    David Stacy,                                        Government Affairs Director,      Human Rights Campaign.                                   ____                                              American Federation of                                   Government Employees, AFL-CIO,                                       Washington, DC, May 14, 2019.      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the 700,000 federal and       District of Columbia government employees represented by the       American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO (AFGE) I       write to urge you to vote yes on H.R. 5, the Equality Act.       The Equality Act is long overdue legislation with bipartisan       support that affirms in the United States all people should       be treated equally.        Currently, it is not a violation of federal civil rights       law for employers to fire, landlords to deny housing, or for       schools to withhold educational opportunities from people       solely because they are a member of the LGBTQ community.       While some jurisdictions provide protections to the LGBTQ       community, the federal government cannot remain silent in the       face of continued discrimination. The Equality Act extends       protections against discrimination based on sexual       orientation or gender identity in employment, housing, access       to public places, federal funding, credit education, and jury       service. Federal workers provide services to all members of       the public without discrimination and expect our nation's       laws to protect all individuals in the same manner.        The Equality Act is endorsed by civil and human rights       advocates, educators, the business community, and labor       unions because the United States can only move forward       together when all, including citizens who are LGBTQ, have       full protection under the law from discrimination. Again, I       urge you to vote in support of H.R. 5, the Equality Act.            Sincerely,                                                  Alethea Predeoux,      Director, Legislative Department.                                   ____                                                     March 12, 2019.      Charles E. Schumer,      Senate Minority Leader,      Washington, DC.      Nancy Pelosi,      Speaker of U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi: We write today to       memorialize the shared agreement of African American civil       rights groups regarding the importance of ensuring the       protection of the provisions of core civil rights statutes       e.g. the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Housing Act, the       Equal Credit Opportunity Act, etc., even as legislators       pursue amendments to those statutes to add additional       protections against discrimination. We stand in solidarity       and support with our partners and colleagues in a shared       commitment to ensuring that these protections are extended.       But we have also collectively agreed that these efforts must       not result in a weakening of the provisions and protections       of our bedrock civil rights statutes, each of which       represents the powerful and unrelenting demand of civil       rights activists and leaders--often at risk to their own       lives. While we have been gratified during our conversations       with House and Senate committee leaders and bill sponsors, we       regard this matter as one of such importance that we are       memorializing by this letter the understanding we have shared       in our conversations for efforts that may arise by individual       legislators or groups during the process of advancing these       bills.        The reasons for our caution and concern are, no doubt,       evident to you. The current environment is one in which we       have seen alarming animus and hostility to various ethnic and       minority groups, as well as legal challenges to what were       once regarded as unassailable civil rights legal standards.       Without question we are confronting a concerted and       unrelenting effort to chip away and eviscerate existing civil       rights protections. This means that there are inherent       dangers in opening any civil rights statutes to legislative       debate and review. Thus, the efforts currently underway to       extend anti-discrimination protection in our core civil       rights statutes, must not be advanced without the clear and       explicit agreement among sponsors, committee leadership and       party leadership that proposed amendments to our civil rights       statutes will be withdrawn should efforts be introduced to       weaken or diminish the existing provisions of those statutes.        Bills which are of immediate concern include, The Equality       Act and the American Housing and Mobility Act; however, it is       our understanding that there may be others. Below is a list       of some of the safeguards/guardrails we feel must be in place       if/when legislation proposing to amend civil rights statutes       is introduced. Each of these have been discussed and agreed       to by civil rights groups, as well as the current sponsors of       the Equality Act. They include:        Establish a strong legislative record for any proposed       changes to core Civil Rights statutes. This standard must be       maintained; Hearings, reports, testimony, etc.        Written assurances from Party Leadership that existing       protections will be preserved.        Written assurances from Sponsors that existing protections       will be preserved.        Written assurances from Party Leadership that if an       amendment(s) to existing protections or amendment(s) creating       restrictions on any of the existing protections is advanced       the bill will be pulled and no vote(s) will be taken.        Written assurances from Sponsors that if an amendment(s) to       existing protections or amendment(s) creating restrictions on       any of the existing protections is advanced* they will       withdraw their introduction of the bill and work to have the       bill pulled and no vote(s) will be taken.        A demonstrated and shared understanding from party       leadership and legislative sponsors of the ability to impact       the process once legislation is introduced given current       political dynamics, including an explanation of the       procedural path forward and the procedural path for       withdrawal if that becomes necessary.        Inclusion of Congressional Findings section in every bill.        Rollout strategies which include explicit statement(s)       about need to preserve existing protections and intent to       withdraw the bill if existing protections are threatened in       any manner.        Continue to explore standalone legislation that does not       amend the existing statute(s), should this prove to be the       safer course.        The history of civil rights in this country is one fraught       with violence, hostility and long suffering. The fight to       enforce those rights continues to this day with resistance       and opposition morphing and growing. As stewards of these       critical laws, we all have a responsibility and obligation to       ensure that the protections they embody are preserved. We       therefore want to be clear and direct in expressing our       insistence that any legislation proposing to amend legacy       civil rights statutes which is permitted to move forward, do       so ONLY when there is a commitment and agreement to do no       harm to the existing statutes and where the safeguards/      guardrails outlined in this letter are put in place.

Madam Speaker, today we will move forward on three  pieces of legislation whose timely consideration is long overdue. We  will move to protect Americans' access to health insurance; provide  much-needed relief on prescription drug prices; provide Federal  recognition to a Native American community; and at long last, pass the  Equality Act, to remove the burden of discrimination and move us closer  to a country where members of the LGBTQ community have an equal  opportunity to achieve the American Dream.   The Equality Act will not be the end of our long journey towards full  LGBTQ equality, but it will finally get  [[Page H3811]]  our laws in line with the values our country was founded upon. As was  recognized in our founding documents, we must continually take steps to  make our country more perfect.   Acknowledging in law the challenges facing LGBTQ people, and taking  concrete action to correct them, brings us one step closer to that  perfect union.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule and the previous  question.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and  I move the previous question on the resolution.
