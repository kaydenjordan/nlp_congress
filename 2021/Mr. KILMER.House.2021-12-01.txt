 Madam Speaker, 100 years ago today a group of Dutch  Americans, including future President Franklin Delano Roosevelt,  established the Netherland-America Foundation to strengthen ties  between our two great countries. Over the past 100 years the  Netherland-America Foundation has accomplished this mission through  organizing and sponsoring cultural exchange programs on topics as  varied as art and science to business, public affairs, and historic  preservation.   As the son of a Dutch immigrant, I am honored to cochair, with my  colleague Representative Huizenga, the bipartisan Dutch Caucus which  shares NAF's goals of growing and deepening the exchange of ideas and  culture between America and Holland.   A similar message of friendship and goodwill is being delivered to  the Dutch Parliament today, speaking to the ever-deepening bond between  our two countries and great democracies.   I know I speak on behalf of all members of the Dutch Caucus when I  congratulate the foundation on their achievements over the past 100  years and the lasting impact they have had in encouraging the unique  friendship between our two countries. I look forward to another century  of the U.S. and Netherlands sharing, growing, and working together.                            ____________________
