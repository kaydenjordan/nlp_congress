 Madam Speaker, if I might, I thank the  gentleman for yielding me time. This is probably his last time managing  a bill, and I thank him for his dedication and diligence as ranking  member.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this bill. I  think it is one of the most unnecessarily divisive efforts in modern  history. It has been rushed to the floor with no notice, no hearing, no  markup, and certainly no opportunity to amend it.   We are only here as an excuse for Democrats' last-minute rush to  weaponize private taxpayer information against their opponents. Much of  the oversight of the Presidential audit program Democrats claim to have  been seeking could have been conducted without accessing or releasing  anyone's confidential tax information.   The Inspector General and the Joint Committee on Taxation could have  provided an analysis of the start and completion dates of Presidential  audits without Democrats obtaining or releasing confidential tax  information.   The JCT could have provided us an analysis of the efficacy of  Presidential audits without Democrats obtaining or releasing the  private tax returns.   Instead, we are debating a bill which will never be considered in the  Senate or become law, but solely to paper over the bad decision that  Democrats made only two nights ago.   Let's defeat this bill today and start over in January with a  bipartisan effort to ensure the Presidential audit program is working  as intended, making sure the President and his family are following the  law, without rushing to cancel anyone's 6103 protections.
