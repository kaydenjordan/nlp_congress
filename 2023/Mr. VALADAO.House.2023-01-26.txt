 Mr. Speaker, over the last few weeks, California has  experienced severe storms that brought much-needed water to our State.  If you thought that meant water shortages in California were over, you  would be wrong.   Since October of last year, California has flushed over 6.4 million  acre-feet of water out to the ocean. That is 2 trillion gallons. This  is extremely frustrating for the Central Valley farmers who are  fallowing their fields and the communities that are running out of  water for daily use in their homes and businesses.   The pumps that are in place to deliver water to farms, homes, and  businesses aren't allowed to run at their full capacity due to  environmental regulations. If we had increased flexibility on these  pumping regulations to account for real-time conditions, we could have  captured 84,000 more acre-feet of water during the 2 weeks of storms.   Increasing flexibility in how we operate these pumps, as well as  investing in critical water storage infrastructure and conveyance  projects, will allow us to maximize what can be stored for these flow  events and make us more resilient for drought.   Every drop of water is critical to my constituents in Central Valley.                            ____________________
