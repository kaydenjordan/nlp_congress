 Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Suozzi for his  leadership on this bill and for working with me on this fight for  justice. I also want to thank Chairwoman Waters and Ranking Member  McHenry for working with us to get this bill out of the committee.   Today, I rise in support of this bill to honor a group of brave men  who have yet to receive their due commendation: the Harlem  Hellfighters.   This distinguished group of African-American and Puerto Rican men  were patriots of the highest valor. Their bravery, dedication,  perseverance, and  [[Page H2784]]  service helped the United States and our Allied forces in our fight to  secure victory. But, Madam Speaker, these fighters weren't even  permitted to serve alongside their fellow White soldiers. Our  government threw them to the side--assigning them to a unit of the  French Government rather than our own.   They put their lives on the line for the freedoms enshrined in our  Constitution, despite doing so at a time when many like them did not  enjoy the very freedoms they fought to protect.    Madam Speaker, these men spent 191 days in combat and  were the most active regiment throughout the entire First World War.  Under constant enemy fire and cast away from the nation they swore an  oath to protect, they still persevered, fighting until the end.   There is no doubt that their heroism impacted the outcome of the war  and, undoubtedly, American history as well.   This bill is a necessary first step to righting the decades-old  injustice. It is about time the Harlem Hellfighters' invaluable  contributions be commended and commemorated, and their service be  formally recognized by our government. Let's finally give these men the  Congressional Gold Medal they deserve.                                time  1515
