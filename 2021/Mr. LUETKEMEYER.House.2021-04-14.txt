 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume, and I rise in support of H.R. 1502, the Microloan Improvement  Act of 2021.   Before I begin, I would like to thank the chairwoman for working in a  bipartisan manner on behalf of our Nation's small businesses.   The bills before us today were developed in the 116th Congress and  have been updated and reintroduced in this Congress. They focus on the  Small Business Administration's existing government guaranteed loan  programs. These programs are important resources and tools for the  Nation's smallest businesses as they seek out financing.   Now, more than ever, these programs need to be ready for small  businesses as they begin and continue to recover from the COVID-19  pandemic. As ranking member of the Committee on Small Business, I want  to make sure we focus, or continue to focus on these programs that  assist the Nation's small businesses, entrepreneurs, and start-ups.   The first bill is the Microloan Improvement Act. This legislation  enhances and expands SBA's microloan program which provides loans of  $50,000 or less. This program, which is delivered to small businesses  through a partnership with microloan intermediaries, concentrates on  low-dollar loans and technical assistance.   When a small business is starting out, counseling and capital  assistance are true drivers of continued and prolonged success. H.R.  1502 further enhances the program for micro-borrowers by expanding the  repayment terms of the program and providing additional tools in their  toolbox.   Additionally, the bill removes the burdensome 1/55th rule that delays  dollars from flowing to microloan intermediaries within the first two  fiscal quarters of the year and replaces it with an allocation  mechanism that will provide more equitable access to all States across  the Nation.   I would like to thank Mr. Kim, Mr. Garbarino, Ms. Newman, and Mr.  Burchett for concentrating their efforts on this legislation.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1502, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Burchett), who has been a leader  in small business issues.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Madam Speaker, 2020 was a difficult year for small businesses. The  COVID-19 pandemic hit small businesses hard. This is especially true  for small businesses that were just starting out.   As our country continues to recover, the SBA's programs and resources  must be ready to assist the Nation's job creators along the way.   The microloan program is a key tool for many small business owners.  The reforms in H.R. 1502 are commonsense improvements that will  continue to provide assistance and resources to America's Main Street  businesses.   Madam Speaker, I urge and recommend my colleagues to support H.R.  1502, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1430     Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1487, the Microloan  Transparency and Accountability Act of 2021.   I thank the chair for moving these bills quickly to the House floor.  I also want to commend the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Burchett), the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Fitzgerald), the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Kim), and the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Newman) for  working diligently and in a bipartisan fashion on behalf of America's  small businesses.   It is important to note that once Congress creates a Federal  Government program, tool, or resource, the work is not done. Members of  Congress must examine and determine the effectiveness and efficiency of  the programs in practice to ensure that they are meeting congressional  intent.   H.R. 1487 does just this for the microloan program, which delivers  capital assistance and counseling to our Nation's smallest businesses.  Oftentimes, businesses that are just starting out and taking their  first steps as a company are participants in the microloan program.   On an annual basis, the Small Business Administration will be  required to report to Congress on the microloan program's default  rates, an analysis of credit requirements, the extent and reach of the  program in rural areas, and so on.   H.R. 1487 will also increase transparency and provide Congress with  tools to ensure it is working on behalf of small businesses across the  Nation.   I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense and straightforward  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Burchett), a distinguished  gentleman who has worked hard on a lot of small business issues.    Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Fitzgerald), a huge  supporter of small businesses and all their issues.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   The microloan program, which delivers capital assistance to the  Nation's smallest businesses, is an important lending tool at the SBA.  H.R. 1487, the Microloan Transparency and Accountability Act of 2021,  will deliver comprehensive data and information on the effectiveness of  the program.   I applaud all of the Members working on this important legislation in  an effort to shine more light on how well the program is working.   From my State of Missouri to both of the Nation's coasts, accessing  capital remains a top challenge facing all small businesses. Tools and  resources like the microloan program can make a huge difference to  small business owners in the early stages of their businesses. We must  ensure these programs and tools are operating at a high level and  delivering on the goals that Congress set for them. That is why this  bill is so important.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1487, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1490, the 504 Modernization  and Small Manufacturer Enhancement Act of 2021.   When capital options are limited for a small business, the SBA offers  numerous lending programs, including the 504/Certified Development  Company Loan Program. Also known as a 504/CDC loan, the program  provides long-term and fixed-rate financing that primarily supports  purchases of real estate and machinery.   Due to the program's unique cost structure that includes a small  business, a lender, and a certified development company, the process is  often lengthy and cumbersome. H.R. 1490 takes important steps to  streamline the closing process and ensures the Nation's job creators  move through the program in a smooth and efficient manner.   Additionally, H.R. 1490 enhances the 504/CDC loan program for  America's small manufacturers. By increasing the maximum loan amount  for small manufacturers, H.R. 1490 ensures these small businesses have  the capital to expand and create jobs in Missouri and beyond.   Enhancements to lending resources and tools, such as those outlined  in H.R. 1490, is exactly what our small businesses, entrepreneurs, and  startups need.   I want to highlight the work of Ms. Craig from Minnesota, Mrs. Kim  from California, Mr. Chabot from Ohio, and Ms. Davids from Kansas on  this important matter. I would also like to thank the chairwoman for  her efforts as well.   The changes in H.R. 1490 will improve delivery of the 504/CDC loan  program for all of America's small businesses. I urge all my colleagues  to support H.R. 1490.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume  to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim), someone who believes in  cutting red tape to help ease the regulatory burden on all our small  businesses.     Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume  to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney), a small business owner  herself who knows the importance of cutting red tape and how it can be  linked to success of a small business.    Madam Speaker, we have one more gentleman coming,  but there is a long path between his office and here. Apparently he is  not here on time, so I am prepared to close.   Madam Speaker, as our economy continues to recover and as our small  businesses rebuild, existing Federal Government programs, tools, and  resources need to be ready to provide assistance. Processes that are  slow and unwieldy must be examined and retooled to ensure they are  working on behalf of small businesses and the American public.   H.R. 1490, the 504 Modernization and Small Manufacturer Enhancement  Act of 2021, takes these steps to streamline the program while ensuring  it is a viable option for small businesses as they recover and grow.   Additionally, H.R. 1490 places a direct focus on our Nation's small  manufacturers. We must continue to work in a bipartisan manner to  ensure these programs are ready for recovery.   With that, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1490.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 1482, the 504 Credit Risk Management  Improvement Act of 2021.   I thank the chair again for advancing all these bills that are meant  to assist small businesses across the Nation. I also thank the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Bishop), the gentlewoman from  California (Mrs. Kim), the gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. Davids), the  gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Craig), as well as the gentleman from  Ohio (Mr. Chabot) for working in a bipartisan manner to strengthen the  504/CDC loan program.   Government programs, especially government guaranteed loan programs,  are only as strong as the oversight that is required.   In order to protect and safeguard American tax dollars, executive  branch agencies must have a watchful eye focused on these programs.   The Office of Credit Risk Management is a division at the Small  Business Administration that is charged with overseeing many of the  government guaranteed lending programs that the SBA offers to small  businesses. H.R. 1482 ensures the Office of Credit Risk Management has  a trained eye focused on the 504/CDC loan program.   Specifically, the legislation outlines how the office should conduct  reviews under the lending program.   Additionally, H.R. 1482 details the enforcement authority of the  Office of Credit Risk Management. These enhancements will ensure the  program operates effectively and efficiently into the future.   Lastly, the bill requires the SBA to clearly and concisely define how  the 504/CDC loan program operates in conjunction with the Nation's  environmental laws and rules. Unfortunately, this process currently  lacks certainty by the SBA.   Simply put, Federal Government programs require robust oversight and  the  [[Page H1774]]  programs must have clear rules for small businesses. H.R. 1482  addresses both of these issues head on.   Madam Speaker, I urge and recommend all my colleagues to support H.R.  1482, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), the former chairman of the  Small Business Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume  to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Kim), a really hard worker and  a big supporter of small businesses around this country.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume  to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Bishop).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my  time.   Oversight of Federal Government programs is paramount to ensure  American taxpayer dollars are used wisely. H.R. 1482 not only increases  the oversight capabilities of the SBA over the 504/CDC loan program,  but also requires clear and concise guidance for small business owners  moving forward. There are sound changes that will improve the program  for future 504/CDC borrowers.  [[Page H1775]]    I applaud all Members for working on this legislation and all of the  small business bills before us today. We must continue to put our  Nation's job creators at the forefront of this economic recovery.   Madam Speaker, I would like to take a few moments to make a couple  comments here with regard to all the bills that we have offered here  today. All these bills dealt with things that deal with oversight.    We, as legislators in this body, have two jobs. One is to provide  legislation to improve the lives of our businesses and the people in  this country, protect our country. Second is to provide oversight over  all of the activities that go on within the executive branch, as well  as the judicial branch, to whatever extent we can.   In our committee, we oversee the legislation with regard to the Small  Business Administration, as well as oversight of their activities. We  have come to find over the last several weeks here that the inspector  general reports that the SBA is not being run as well as it should.  There is fraud rampant in some of the programs, which is verified by  the AG reports. We have a new Administrator who has got her hands full  because of the lack of knowledge of what goes on with all the brand-new  things going on.   So we have got a real problem and we, as legislators, have got to  step up. These bills today are just one step in the process of  providing the kind of oversight that it takes. We will continue to  provide oversight, I can assure you. And those listening and watching  today need to take heart in the fact that we are going to continue to  provide the kind of oversight over the Small Business Administration  and all of its programs that we have been tasked with and are  responsible for.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1482, the last  bill we will discuss today, and I yield back the balance of my time.
