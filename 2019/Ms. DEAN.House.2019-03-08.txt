 Mr. Speaker, last weekend Members of Congress traveled to  Alabama for a civil rights pilgrimage. In Selma we marched across the  Edmund Pettus Bridge alongside Congressman   John Lewis.   Mr. Speaker, 54 years ago yesterday, Congressman Lewis was on that  same bridge with hundreds of other brave Americans young and old. They  were marching for the right to vote, and they were met with a wave of  teargas and billy clubs. Representative Lewis was beaten unconscious.   The trip for me was a powerful and terrible history lesson.   Today States no longer use terror to prevent citizens from voting,  but they do use other means. Since the Supreme Court's 2013 Shelby  decision, nearly two dozen States have implemented restrictive voter ID  laws, closed polling places, and used other means to suppress minority  voting.   H.R. 4, the Voting Rights Advancement Act, will erase these trends,  and H.R. 1, which we passed today, strengthens democracy by ensuring  clean, fair elections, prohibiting voter roll purges, and ending  gerrymandering. Democracy means government by the people for the  people. It lives up to the legacy of those marchers 54 years ago.  Ultimately, it means making voting easier, not harder.    Let's keep our eye on the prize.                            ____________________
