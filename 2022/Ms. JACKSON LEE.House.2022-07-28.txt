 Sadly, though, this is called the CHIPS and Science  Act, it left out the calculation of math for my colleagues on the other  side of the aisle.   America is applauding. For once they will not be stopped and stymied  by a supply chain that says: no technology, no cars, stay forever  without wheels when you have a driving business.   This bill is expected to create 100,000 jobs. I am excited, in  particular, about the addition of NASA's reauthorization and to  specifically note that NASA's Johnson Space Center will be doing the  Orion program funded, Gateway program funded, Extravehicular Activity  in Human Surface Mobility funded. Orion, Gateway and EHP funded. These  are individual programs that we funded for one of the most prominent  centers there.   In addition, we are going to move to manufacturing chips in this  Nation, including Houston.   The Democratic Republic of the Congo has precious metals. Where do  they want to send them?   To the United States of America.   They want us to produce. They want us to be able to transport.   Out of this bill with the amazing amount of research coming forward  in science it is going to be a testimony.   I want to pay tribute to Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, the  chairwoman who guided this with the kind of calm and expertise that has  brought us to this point.   Texas is proud, the Nation is proud, and 100,000 jobs and over $3  billion that will be provided in energy alone, $10.9 billion for the  Office of Science, $7.5 billion for FY22, a 6 percent annual increase.   This is a jobs bill.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4346, the CHIPS and  Science Act, which comes as a result of bipartisan bicameral work  following the passage of the Competes Act and the William M. (Mac)  Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021.   CHIPS' authorization was part of the William M. (Mac) Thornberry  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. Which  authorized the Department of Commerce (DOC), Department of Defense  (DoD), and Department of State (DOS) to engage in activities to develop  onshore domestic manufacturing of semiconductors critical to U.S.  competitiveness and national security.   This bill is expected to create nearly 100,000 new American jobs.   And provisions in the Bill are reflecting my legislation.   I am proud to say that many of those jobs would be housed in Texas.   Currently, more than 30,000 Texans work in the manufacturing of  semiconductor chips. In fact, for the last 11 years, my state has been  the country's number one top exporter of this product.   There are opportunities in addressing the necessity of finding and  refining of rare earth-critical mineral elements that are needed to  manufacture technology in every aspect of the economy.   I will be hosting a major energy discussion and a series of meetings  in September and October to focus on closing the gap between U.S.  demand for these materials and the supply available to us in the global  marketplace.   I believe that our nation's independence and competitiveness is on  the line if we do not solve this problem.   On September 12, 1962, President Kennedy gave a speech at Rice  University that outlined the task he was given to the nation's best and  brightest scientists by saying:   ``We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things  not because they are easy, but because they are hard. Because that goal  will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills  because that challenge is one that we're willing to accept. One we are  unwilling to postpone.''   Our nation has never measured itself by the progress of other  nations, but by the boundlessness of our imagination that we work to  make real.   Before the race to the moon, the United States had conquered other  science, engineering, and technological challenges like the building of  the Panama Canal and human flight.   We know the fruit of this labor is greater knowledge, innovations,  the unlocking of new knowledge, and the dispelling or confirmation of  scientific proofs.   As a member of the Bipartisan Space and Aeronautics Caucus, I am in  support of the NASA Authorization that is included in this bill.   I am a sponsor H.R. 5260, the Advancing Human Spaceflight Act of  2021, a bill establishing programs and policies pertaining to human  presence in space.   This bill would establish a program to develop next-generation space  suits and associated technologies, establish an outpost in orbit around  the Moon as described in this bill, and submit a plan for achieving a  power supply on the Moon.   The bill declares that it is U.S. policy to continuously maintain the  capability for a continuous human presence in low-Earth orbit through  and beyond the useful life of the International Space Station (ISS) and  that such capability shall maintain U.S. global leadership and  relations with partners and allies, contribute to the general welfare  of the United States, and leverage commercial capabilities to promote  affordability so as not to preclude a robust portfolio of other human  space exploration activities.   I am also a cosponsor of H.R. 869, the Research Investment to Spark  the Economy Act of 2021 or the RISE Act of 2021, a bill that authorizes  the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Education, Energy,  the Interior, Health and Human Services, and Transportation, National  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), National Science  Foundation, and Environmental Protection Agency to provide support for  research regarding COVID-19 (i.e., coronavirus disease 2019) or  research disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic.   The bill provides supplemental funding to extend the duration of a  grant to a research institution, national laboratory, or individual  that was awarded prior to the enactment of this bill, or to expand the  purposes of such a grant as specified; issue awards to research the  effects of the current pandemic and potential future pandemics; and  provide flexibility on awards to account for facility closures or other  limitations during the COVID-19 public health emergency.   H.R. 4346, the CHIPS and Science Act bill before us today, includes  National Aeronautics and Space Administration authorization for the:   Artemis Moon Program;   Moon-to-Mars Exploration Campaign, including the Artemis program to  return America to the Moon;   Maintenance of the International Space Station.   Extension of authorization for the International Space Station  through 2030 and establishes priorities for research, as required to  bring Americans to Mars;   Extend NASA Enhanced Use Lease Authority. Enables NASA to lease  underutilized;   Prioritization through 2032, and to use lease revenues to address  facility maintenance while reducing taxpayer costs;   goal of including Earth science observations and the search for life  beyond Earth;   Advancement of U.S. Aeronautics Leadership   Enhancement of NASA Technology, Infrastructure, and Workforce; and   Focused attention that ensures Planetary Defense against meteors and  large asteroids.   I have long held an intense interest in the Nation's premier space  exploration agency, first as a member of the House Science Committee  and now as a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security.  [[Page H7383]]    From space exploration to climate change the work of Congress is  needed now more than ever before.   I have for several Congresses offered an amendment to the NDAA to  provide Congress with a report on the issue of space debris, which  jeopardizes human space exploration.   These objects are a product of earlier space exploration when there  were only a few nations capable of low earth orbit space flight.   Today, public-private partnerships and collaboration is bringing the  commercial sector into space exploration.   The space debris amendment brings valuable insight into the  challenges, dangers, and opportunities present by addressing space  debris moving over 17,000 miles an hour and the real changes of debris  disabling or damaging manmade space exploration or development efforts.   President Kennedy knew what was on the line if our nation did not  dominate the space race.   Because he understood what was at stake he set the nation's sights on  people walking on the surface of the moon, and to safely return home  required technology, materials, metals, food preservation, clothing,  and instruments that had not been invented at the time of his speech  this was a monumental challenge that captivated and motivated  Americans--All Americans to find within themselves the talent, courage,  and fortitude needed to make his words our nation's greatest scientific  accomplishment.   He said his challenge was an act of faith and vision because no one  know what would come from the effort of accomplishing the challenge of  conquering space.   The speech at Rice University is located in the city of Houston  because of the concentration of engineering, researchers, and academic  institutions doing cutting-edge work in the energy sector of the  economy.   First established as the Manned Spacecraft Center (MSC) in 1961, it  was later named the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center (JSC) in honor of  the late President.   The JSC is responsible for the design, development, and operation of  human space flight.   For more than four decades, JSC has been the world leader in human  space flight operations for NASA.   The critical thing to understand about what JSC means to human space  flight is to understand the importance of a critical mass of experts  that are working collaboratively from the training of astronauts to all  aspects of the support during missions.   The Center's famed Mission Control Center, or MCC, has been the  operational hub of every American human space mission for over 40 years  since Gemini IV.   The MCC manages all activity onboard the space station and directs  all space shuttle missions, including station assembly flights and  Hubble Space Telescope servicing. Construction of the control center  began in late 1962.   In addition to conducting mission simulations and operations with  flight controllers, space was allocated for key NASA engineering and  scientific personnel along with representatives of the major  contractors to support each mission.   This increased presence strengthened the problem-solving capabilities  of the MCC team.   Today, JCS is comprised of a complex of 100 buildings constructed on  1,620 acres that is known as Space City.   Houston is where the Johnson Space Center was born and remains to  this day--a place of boundless imagination in the pursuit of new  horizons in space exploration.   There are approximately 3,200 civil servants, including 110  astronauts, employed at Johnson Space Center, and a contract workforce  of over 15,000 are the people who prepare people for space missions.   This bill is a matter of national pride, national economic  innovation, and most importantly, national security.   I want to note for Congress and the nation that the JSC with  continuing to serve a vital role in the next chapter of space  exploration for our nation.   Several essential NASA programs are authorized and fully funded  separately under this authorization bill.   The bill provides funding for each of the essential tasks that NASA  has for the JSC:   the Orion Gateway Program is funded separately,   Extravehicular Activity is funded separately, and   Human Surface Mobility (EHP) Program is funded separately.   The authorization language in this bill makes clear that the Orion  Gateway Program, Extravehicular Activity, and Human Surface Mobility  (EHP) Program are assigned to the Johnson Space Center.   Language in this bill also provides clarity that all new lunar and  Mars samples are under the purview of the JSC.   This is a wise decision given that the JSC maintains over 5 decades  of experience and expertise in the stewardship and curation of all  current collections of NASA-held Astro-materials.   All U.S. government or U.S. government contracted services involving  extraterrestrial material or Astro-materials such as, but not limited  to rocks, dust, minerals, meteorites, regolith, ices, organic matter,  gasses, and atoms, and including samples collected in space, on other  solar system bodies, and on earth will be curated and managed by  Johnson Space Center.   NASA's Johnson Space Center shall curate and manage all NASA-held  Astro-material sample collections, including providing loans of Astro- material specimens, review of the proposed use, approval of research  investigations, education, and public display.   These are NASA Johnson Space Center Human Exploration Programs that  are a part of Moon to Mars or Artemis, all funded separately in this  bill. They are:   Orion Program;   Gateway Program--Referred to in the bill as ``an outpost in orbit  around the moon'';   Extravehicular Activity and Human Surface Mobility (EHP) Program--in  the bill ``Spacesuits'' are called out and state any other elements  needed to meet the requirement of the Moon to Mars Program; and   Orion, Gateway, and EHP (suits and Mobile systems, rovers), all are  critical Programs.   Just as the moon project was a massive endeavor that would touch  nearly every aspect of our nation's scientific community and efforts so  will the work outlined by this legislation.   The CHIPS Act would invest $52 billion in domestic semiconductor chip  manufacturing, and various vital science initiatives to return the  United States to its role as the preeminent leader in science and  modernization.   These initiatives include efforts to expand diversity and equity in  STEM fields by combatting sexual harassment in science workplaces,  investing in minority-serving institutions, and expanding fellowship  and scholarship opportunities for women in STEM.   It would also focus on scientific initiatives for biological and  environmental research that would accelerate the growth of clean energy  commercialization and development across the country.   Everything from helium conservation to nuclear physics, to biological  threat preparedness, is included in this bill.   Additionally, the CHIPS and Science Act are authorizations for  incredibly important innovations happening at NASA.   It would authorize the Artemis Moon Program to work towards the goal  of returning American astronauts to the moon, including sending the  first woman and person of color.   In addition to resuming goals of lunar landings, the CHIPS and  Science Act would prioritize the research necessary to continue the  Orion program and bring Americans to Mars.   Several essential NASA programs are authorized and fully funded  separately under this authorization bill.   The Orion Program gateway program is funded separately;  Extravehicular Activity is funded separately and Human Surface Mobility  (EHP) Program is funded separately. The authorization language in this  bill makes clear that the Orion Gateway Program, Extravehicular  Activity, and Human Surface Mobility (EHP) Program are assigned to the  Johnson Space Center.   Language in this bill also provides clarification that all new lunar  and Mars samples are the responsibility of the Johnson Space Center.   The other priority I believe should have been included in this bill  is a clarification that NASA's Johnson Space Center with over 5 decades  of experience and expertise in the stewardship and curation of all  current collections of NASA-held Astro-materials should continue in  this role for the materials that will be brought back from the moon and  Mars to earth for study.   Further, it would have served the mission to make sure that all U.S.  government or U.S. government contracted services involving  extraterrestrial material or Astro-materials such as but not limited to  rocks, dust, minerals, meteorites, regolith, ices, organic matter,  gasses, and atoms and including samples collected in space, on other  solar systems bodies and earth should be curated and managed by Johnson  Space Center.   NASA's Johnson Space Center should be charged with the management of  all NASA-held Astro-material sample collections, including providing  loans of Astro-material specimens, review of the proposed use, approval  of research investigations, education, and public display.   I will support the bill, and pledge to continue to work with my  colleagues in the House and Members of the Senate to make sure that the  JSC's role in the next chapter of our nation's space exploration  includes management of materials returned to earth for study.  [[Page H7384]]    In addition to its many improvements to STEM workforce growth and  scientific research and development, this bill has a particular focus  on America's need for a robust push in semiconductor chip  manufacturing.   Much of the funding in H.R. 4346 would be dedicated to building the  capacity of the American semiconductor chip industry.   This bill would set aside resources designed to incentivize the  construction of potentially 7 to 10 domestic semiconductor fabrication  plants.   These plants would be responsible for manufacturing the core of all  our modern electronics.   Cars, cell phones, air conditioning units, microwave ovens, medical  tools, and laptops all rely on semiconductor chips to transport,  connect, feed, and support the American public.   The CHIPS Act would ensure that American consumers retain access to  these products during times of international instability.   The United States' ability to manufacture semiconductor chips has  been on a steady decline for decades.   In 1990, the U.S. met roughly 40 percent of the world's semiconductor  chip capacity.   In 2020, that fell to just 12 percent.   East Asian countries like China, Taiwan, Korea, and Japan are now  home to nearly 80 percent of global chip fabrication.   Some of America's largest tech firms, including Google, Apple, and  Amazon, rely on a single Taiwanese manufacturer, TSMC, for nearly 90  percent of their chip production.   I have long advanced that chip manufacturing should be domestic  because of the critical importance to telecommunication, medical,  transportation, national defense, industrial control systems, and  financial systems.   The COVID-19 pandemic made evident the limitations of domestic  manufacturing capacity in the United States and vulnerabilities in  global supply chains.   During the pandemic, our healthcare centers, schools, and other vital  industries struggled to import the technological goods they needed to  battle the virus, educate our children, and keep our economy running.   Thousands of American people died in hospital beds while hospitals  struggled to obtain additional ventilators, oxygen monitors and other  necessary medical equipment--medical equipment that rely on  semiconductor chips to work.   Delays in supply chains and manufacturing capabilities undoubtedly  wasted time and cost countless lives.   This cannot happen again.   The 21st-century world is only able to stay upright through a careful  scaffolding of electronic and computer products.   There are some products that we must maintain the ability to produce  upon demand to meet domestic need.   With Russia at war with Ukraine and an uncertain future for Chinese  and Taiwanese relations, it is more imperative than ever that the  manufacturing of semiconductor chips returns to American soil, American  businesses, and American control.   With the passage of the CHIPS Act, the United States would rise again  to its status as a world leader in the manufacturing of semiconductor  chips.   Doing so is an economic and national security necessity.   For years, the United States has neglected to invest in semiconductor  manufacturing. Meanwhile, China has invested $150 billion to build its  domestic capacity.   If we do not invest in the future of American innovation and  excellence now, we are sure to fall behind our East Asian competitors  in the future--at the expense of the American people.   In addition to the provision of funding for manufacturing facilities,  the CHIPS Act includes about $100 billion for the research and  development of secure semiconductors and secure microelectronic supply  chains.   This would include the creation of a Subcommittee on Microelectronics  Leadership which would be tasked with developing a national strategy  for the creation of a robust microelectronics industry in the United  States and setting priorities for the maintenance of American  leadership in advanced chip design and production.   This is our opportunity to secure the economic and national security  of our nation.   It is our opportunity to provide much-needed jobs and industry.   It is our opportunity to return the United States of America to its  position of prominence and example as a world leader in innovation and  manufacturing.   Made in America is good for business, it's good for security, and  it's good for our people.   That is why I wholeheartedly support the passage of the CHIPS and  Science Act of 2022.   I include in the Record a list of NASA bills I have sponsored and  cosponsored.         1. H.R. 5250--117th Congress (2021-2022) Advancing Human       Spaceflight Act of 2021 Sponsor: Rep.
