 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, many artists and entertainers have  staked their claim to fame by bending the rules and changing the  conventional wisdom that defines their craft. But not many can claim to  have made an impact on American culture that is at once musical,  political, and spiritual.   This month, my friend and fellow Tennessean Lee Greenwood is enjoying  some well-deserved recognition for doing just that. Next week, he will  celebrate the 40th year of one of the most significant and successful  careers in country music history.   On behalf of the entire Tennessee delegation, I want to thank Lee for  his artistry, his patriotism, and his belief in the power of a song to  heal our deepest wounds.   We thank him for his friendship, for his commitment to our great  State of Tennessee, and we wish him even greater successes in his  career.                              Government Funding    Madam President, over the weekend, my Democratic colleagues put on a  terrific show for the American people, arguing over which  multitrillion-dollar spending bill they wanted to pass first--not if  they were going to pass one, but which one they wanted to pass first.  And from what I am hearing in Tennessee, they are saying: We don't want  either of these. None of this should ever be passed and signed into  law.   Those that I spoke with also wanted me to pass on a message. It  doesn't matter if they were Democrat, Republican, Independent,  Libertarian. They said what happened here in Washington over the  weekend was just about the most tone-deaf and disrespectful thing that  they had seen take place in Washington in a long time.   All year, Tennesseans have been asking themselves why is it that the  Democrats are pushing so hard to spend more than a trillion dollars on  a so-called infrastructure package that really isn't about  infrastructure? Why are they fighting so hard for a multitrillion- dollar social spending package that prioritizes all the wrong things?   Tennesseans have caught on to this insanity. They know with absolute  certainty that every time Joe Biden's government steps in to take  control over an aspect of their lives, the goal is not to make their  lives easier. The goal is to complicate their lives. The goal is to  take away some of their individual freedom, some of their choice.   There is no other explanation as to why they would do this in the  face of some of the issues that we have, like serious supply chain  vulnerabilities, unsustainable inflation--no, it is not temporary--and  levels of divisiveness and mistrust that have made even the most  unplugged, apolitical people that I know sit up and speak out.   The fact that more people are paying attention is really a problem  for my Democratic colleagues. They know that there is no chance that  the majority of the American people will just go along with what it is  that they are proposing.   As I said, it doesn't matter if they are Democrat, Republican,  Independent, Libertarian. They are looking at this and they are saying:  Hey, wait a minute. These guys that are over there, every one of them-- what are they trying to do? They are trying to drive this socialist  agenda, tear down our institutions, and build it back as a socialist  state--which is exactly why the Democrats are opting for a power grab  rather than an honest debate.   By seizing that control and taking away that freedom, they are slowly  but surely setting themselves up to redefine the relationship between  the people and the government. Eventually, this will allow the  Democrats to destroy our most important institutions and remake them in  the image of the grand socialist future that they are so desperate to  build.   If you can't beat them--and the Democrats haven't been able to beat  the people--then what do you do? They go about--the Democrats--and they  just move the goalpost.   They have shown this intent time and again over the course of  decades, but let's start with more recent events. The Federal  healthcare takeover destroyed the concept of the doctor-patient  relationship and replaced it with layers of bureaucracy and, now,  rationing.   Over the past 3 years, my Democratic colleagues have tried multiple  times to force through an election takeover bill that would federalize  voting. That is right--not local control like we have had but  federalizing elections, intentionally exposing conservative voters to  an unhinged and violent opposition and making the ballot box vulnerable  to fraud. That is what they are trying to do.   Earlier this year, we discovered that the Democrats thought that  opening up everyone's pocketbook for scrutiny by the IRS would be an  acceptable way to pay for their so-called infrastructure package. It is  a neat trick. It is also completely and utterly despicable, and people  are not buying what the Democrats are selling. They do not want  socialism ruling their life. They do not want the United States of  America to be a socialist nation.   The majority in this Chamber have accused the Republicans in this  Chamber of many things, and most of them untrue. But what is true is  that we are indeed getting in the way of this reckless, destructive  agenda. That is because it is our duty to protect this country and to  protect our freedoms.   Joe Biden and the Democratic Party control the entire U.S.  Government. That is right. We had an election, and you are in charge.  That government has already made it clear that--mandate or no mandate-- they have their eye on the prize. And that prize is to take away your  freedom, give that over to the government, and leave you living in a  socialist nation. All it would cost is all of your money, all of your  principles, all of your freedom. That is right.   That is the future that they, the Democratic Party, envision for you  and your family--they, the Democratic Party, making all the decisions;  they, the Democratic Party, winning all the elections because they  federalize them and they let the Federal Government decide who wins,  with them in charge.   If the Democrats wish to make those sacrifices, they are more than  welcome to go about trying to do it, because the American people are  not buying the agenda that they are pushing.  [[Page S6886]]    Every day I talk to Tennesseans. What do they want? Freedom--balanced  freedom that allows them to experience their version of the American  dream, that allows their children to dream big dreams and then live in  a country where they can work to make those dreams come true.  Preserving that is a worthy fight.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I  take these next few moments to honor the life and legacy of and my  personal friendship with Justice Cornelia A. ``Connie'' Clark. We lost  Connie last month to a short battle with cancer.   Justice Clark was a trailblazer in the Tennessee judiciary. Her  public service spanned more than four decades and culminated in a long  and happy tenure on the Tennessee Supreme Court, where she served as  chief justice from 2010-2012. In the days since we lost Connie, her  friends on the bench have shared fond memories of a woman who was  cheerful, humble, diligent, and strong in her faith, and who approached  her role as a jurist with grace and equanimity.   Over the course of her distinguished career, Justice Clark  prioritized ensuring access to justice. As a result of her  compassionate advocacy, the once-cluttered path to the courthouse is  clear for the thousands of men and women who climb its steps each year.  She was an early and fierce advocate for women in the legal profession,  throwing open doors for her peers and serving as a powerful role model  for young women and girls. In 2005, she helped usher in a new era for  the bench when she became the fourth woman to serve on the Tennessee  Supreme Court. Since 2008, the Court has boasted a female-majority  bench.   On behalf of the entire Tennessee congressional delegation, I offer  prayers and condolences to Connie's family and friends.   Rest in peace, Connie, and thank you for dedicating your life to the  relentless pursuit of justice for all Tennesseans.                            ____________________
