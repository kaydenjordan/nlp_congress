 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the  SAFE Act.   No matter what my colleagues conclude about the Mueller report, I  think we can all agree it shows our elections are under foreign attack.   What would happen if a foreign government actually succeeded in  changing the results of a Federal election?   All bad actors have to do is break through the defenses of even one-- even one--of the over 10,000 election administration jurisdictions in  our country.   As we all know, questionable results in just one county can derail an  entire Presidential election and throw our country into a tailspin.   Election security is national security. Election machinery is the  machinery of democracy.   The SAFE Act gives States what they need to upgrade and maintain safe  and resilient election infrastructure.   In the House Administration Committee, we debated whether paper  ballots are the safest way to go. It does seem ironic that our answer  to cybersecurity, in fact, is old school, but we know what works.   As Oregon's Secretary of State Dennis Richardson said, ``You can't  hack paper.'' We can recount and audit paper ballots with a certainty  that we just don't have with machines.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  the Committee on Armed Services be authorized to file a supplemental  report on the bill, H.R. 2500.
