 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  ``Battleship Iowa National Museum of the Surface Navy Act,'' which I  introduced today.   This simple bill would designate the Battleship USS Iowa Museum  located in Los Angeles, California, as the ``National Museum of the  Surface Navy.''   The Battleship, USS Iowa Museum, would be the official museum to  honor the millions of Americans who have proudly served and continue to  serve in the United States Surface Navy since the founding of the Navy  on October 13, 1775.   The Battleship USS Iowa is an iconic ship that served as a home to  hundreds of thousands of sailors from all 50 states. Commissioned in  1943, the Battleship Iowa has received accolades as the ``World's  Greatest Navy Ship'' and had several namesakes, including the ``Mighty  I'' and the ``Big Stick,'' which referred to President Teddy  Roosevelt's famous adage: ``Speak softly and carry a big stick.''   The USS Iowa was also known as the ``Battleship of Presidents.'' In  1943, President Franklin D. Roosevelt used the ship for meetings with  British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Soviet Primer Joseph  Stalin. President George H.W. Bush re-commissioned the USS Iowa in 1984  while serving as Vice President of the United States. Prior to the USS  Iowa's decommissioning in 1990, President Ronald Reagan used the ship  for our nation's Celebration of Liberty in New York City on July 4,  1986.   The USS Iowa earned nine battle stars for service in World War II and  two for service during the Korean War. The ship was also awarded the  Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation, the Navy Occupation Service Medal,  the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, and the Navy ``E'' Ribbon--four  times.   In 2012, the Navy donated the Battleship Iowa to the Pacific  Battleship Center, which established the Battleship USS Iowa Museum at  the Port of Los Angeles. Since its opening, the Museum has welcomed  millions of visitors.   The Museum also hosts numerous military activities, including  enlistments, re-enlistments, commissionings, promotions, and community  service days. The museum also provides on-site training for federal,  state, and local law enforcement personnel.   Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the museum has closed all of its  indoor exhibits and has struggled to attract visitors. As a non-profit  organization, the museum is supported solely by admissions, donations,  event space rentals, and gift shops.                           How the bill would help    Our bill would designate the USS Battleship Iowa Museum as the  ``National Museum of the Surface Navy'' to raise awareness and educate  the public on the important role of the United States Surface Navy.   The ``National Museum of the Surface Navy'' would build on the  success of the Battleship USS Iowa Museum by introducing new exhibits  and programs with a focus on education, veterans, and community.                                  Conclusion    It is imperative that we preserve the legacy of those who have served  on the Battleship USS Iowa and all Surface Navy ships.   I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill. Thank you,  Mr. President. I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Cassidy, Mr. Grassley, Ms.          Hirono, Mr. Coons, and Mr. Tillis):  [[Page S1712]]    S. 936. A bill to require online marketplaces to collect, verify, and  disclose certain information regarding high-volume third party sellers  of consumer products to inform consumers; to the Committee on Commerce,  Science, and Transportation.
