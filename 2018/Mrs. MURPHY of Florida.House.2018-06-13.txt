 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be the Democratic  lead of this bipartisan bill, and I want to thank Mr. Garrett of  Virginia for working with me on this legislation.   The purpose of our bill is to ensure that States have effective plans  in place to protect infants who are innocent victims of the opioid  epidemic. The bill aims to help Florida and other States develop  evidence-based policies and procedures to properly care for babies born  dependent on drugs.                                time  1515    Too many Americans and too many Floridians battle opioid addiction.  As a mother, it breaks my heart to see innocent children suffer the  consequences of adult addiction. We must do everything possible to  ensure that drug-dependent babies receive proper care at the hospital  and proper family, community, and medical support once they are  discharged.   There are an estimated 2.1 million Americans addicted to opioids,  typically, to prescription painkillers. Babies born to mothers who used  opioids during pregnancy are at risk of an opioid withdrawal condition  called neonatal abstinence syndrome. While there are common and  effective ways to treat this syndrome, there are no uniform protocols.   Under Federal law, States are required to develop a plan to safely  care for infants exposed to substance abuse. However, a 2015  investigation by Reuters indicated that very few States have plans in  place that fulfill this Federal requirement. As a result, too many  infants exposed to substance abuse and their caregivers are not  receiving the comprehensive support they need.   Our bill seeks to address this problem. It would require HHS to  provide guidance to States on how to implement safe and effective plans  to care for infants born dependent on drugs. It would ensure this  guidance promotes evidence-based practices and encourages State  governments to collaborate with healthcare providers, social service  agencies, and other community stakeholders, and it would ensure that  HHS' guidance promotes family-centered treatment that seeks to keep  families intact whenever possible.   Each year, thousands of babies in this country are born addicted to  opioids, including about 4,000 in Florida alone. These babies need our  support. This bill seeks to provide it. I respectfully ask my  colleagues to vote ``yes.''
