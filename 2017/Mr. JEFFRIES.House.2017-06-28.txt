 Mr. Chairman, let's be clear: this bill has nothing to  do with litigation reform. It has nothing to do with a good faith  attempt to improve our healthcare system.   In fact, this bill was described as phase 3 of an effort to improve  our healthcare by the majority leader on the other side of the aisle. I  put out a search committee. I still can't find phase 1 or phase 2. It  has nothing to do with reforming our healthcare system.   This bill is an unprecedented attack on States' rights. It is a wolf  in sheep's clothing. It is a solution in search of a problem. It is  nothing more than a reckless legislative joyride guaranteed to crash  and burn on the American people.  [[Page H5271]]    This bill, if enacted, will hurt working families, middle class  people, senior citizens, the poor, the sick, the afflicted, veterans,  and nursing home residents.   The American people deserve a litigation system that works for  everyone, not simply the wealthy and the well-off. The American people  deserve a litigation system that puts the public's interest ahead of  special interests. The American people deserve a litigation system that  promotes public health, not just excessive wealth.   This bill fails on all of those counts. It is mean-spirited, it is  cruel, it is heartless. Mr. Chairman, that is why it must be defeated.
