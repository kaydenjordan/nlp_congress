 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise in opposition to the bill. At the outset, though, I want to  congratulate our subcommittee chair on shepherding her very first bill  to the House floor. The bill before us provides $62.2 billion for the  Department of State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs. That is  a 12 percent increase, Mr. Speaker, over the fiscal year 2021 enacted  level.   The bill provides important funding for our national security,  including $3.3 billion for Israel. The recent conflict between Israel  and Hamas, and the looming shadow of Hezbollah and Iran, remind us all  of the threats Israel faces to its security every day.   The fighting in Gaza stopped when it did, in part, due to the  diplomatic efforts of Egypt. As Secretary of State Blinken told the  committee, Egypt was vital to helping arrange the cease-fire and  remains an essential partner for the United States in the region-- Egypt.   While the bill maintains funding for Egypt at the current level, I  strongly disagree with the additional conditions that this bill places  on Egypt.   The bill continues critical funding for Jordan, supports countries  facing Russian aggression, and provides resources to meet our  commitments in the Indo-Pacific, including $300 million for the  Countering Chinese Influence Fund.   The bill provides funding for Colombia, our good ally and friend, at  last year's level. This is a critical moment for that country, and we  should be doing all we can to support them. However, I regret that new  conditions that this bill places could undermine our counternarcotics  efforts, which are critical in Colombia.   Our programs there are in our own self-interest, especially given the  amount of cocaine that still floods American streets and causes so much  destruction in our communities back home.   Another drug problem sowing chaos back home is the opioid epidemic.  The bill includes new language that directs the State Department to  expand their current efforts to tackle the opioid crisis and better  address this terrible problem.   Mr. Speaker, I wish I could stop there and say this is a good bill.  Unfortunately, the spending increases outside of these critical areas  are just too great, and the policy riders are too extreme.   First and foremost are changes made to the longstanding measures that  protect the sanctity of life. These are commonsense provisions that  have enjoyed bipartisan support for decades. Of greatest concern is the  removal of the most important condition in any State-Foreign Operations  bill, that no funds can be used to pay for abortion. The removal of  that language is unprecedented, but it doesn't stop there.   The bill also includes a permanent prohibition of the Mexico City  policy, weakens the Kemp-Kasten restrictions on coercive abortion, and  increases funding to the U.N., among many other controversial changes.   Another tough pill for the American taxpayer to swallow is the more  than $3 billion included in this bill for environmental programs that  bring a high potential for duplication, wasteful complexity, and  substantial oversight challenges.   The bill also increases funding for the United Nations and other  international organizations while ignoring the need for long-overdue  and desperately needed reforms.   The absence of conditions on the World Health Organization is  particularly concerning, given what we all know about their complicity  in covering up the COVID-19 outbreak.   Despite some areas of agreement, the unrestrained spending and  unprecedented partisan riders require that I oppose this legislation.  I, therefore, urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Granger), the ranking member of the  Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute  to the gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the Republican whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith).    Mr. Speaker, I urge a rejection of the bill,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I claim time in support of the  amendments, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   This amendments en bloc contains a number of good proposals by both  sides of the aisle. I want to highlight just a few.   It includes language offered by the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr.  Hill) and the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch) to increase funding  for the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs.  This will help ensure that this office has resources we need to ensure  that U.S. citizens unlawfully or wrongfully detained abroad receive  priority attention from our government.   It also includes a provision supported by the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany) that is in support of our close friend and  partner Taiwan. At a time when the Chinese Communist Party has Taiwan  in its crosshairs, we need to do all we can to support our democratic  friends on that island. I, therefore, urge Members to support the  amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Tiffany).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I urge support of the  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume. I rise in support of the amendments en bloc. Madam  Speaker, the amendments en bloc before us includes seven amendments  that would significantly improve the quality of this bill.   It includes an amendment that would prohibit funding to the U.N.  Population Fund and strike funding for family planning and reproductive  health. I am gravely concerned about the longstanding pro-life  provisions that were stripped from the bill this fiscal year, all of  them. Allowing the bill to proceed without protections for the unborn,  like those in this amendment, is unprecedented and a direct hit to the  sanctity of life around the world.   Also included in this en bloc is an amendment that would prohibit  contributions to various climate organizations, such as the Green  Climate Fund. The underlying bill provides over $3 billion for climate  change programs, including nearly $2 billion for ill-advised  contributions to international climate funds. At a time when American  families continue to struggle to make ends meet and foreign aid is  under great scrutiny, proposing such politically motivated misuses of  taxpayer funding adds insult to injury.   The en bloc also includes an amendment that would prohibit funds for  U.S. membership and/or contributions to the World Health Organization.  The underlying bill, as currently written, includes no reforms of the  WHO, even though they are complicit in covering up the COVID-19  pandemic. Without necessary safeguards in place to improve WHO  transparency, American taxpayer funds should not be used for this  organization.   Similarly, the amendments en bloc includes a proposal to reduce  funding for the Contributions to International Organizations account.  The base bill includes an increase for international organizations, but  without conditions or requirements for reform, this is simply too much  funding.   The amendments included in this amendment give the bill a far greater  chance of being signed into law. It includes longstanding pro-life  provisions that enjoy support from the majority of the American public  and commonsense safeguards to ensure taxpayer dollars are used in the  most efficient manner.   Madam Speaker, I urge support for the amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                   Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore     Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Tony Gonzales).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1515     Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.    Madam Speaker, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, this amendments en bloc contains several measures that  could have enjoyed broad support. Unfortunately, it also includes  several amendments that some on our side are unable to accept. One is  by the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. Omar), which would transfer  funds from foreign military financing to the development assistance  account.   At a time when the United States is facing serious national security  challenges around the globe, including from China and Russia, we should  be increasing U.S. security assistance rather than holding it flat or,  worse yet, reducing it to increase an account that this bill already  increases by 15 percent.   We simply face too many challenges to be cutting national security  funding at this time.   Madam Speaker, finally, I also need to mention the self-executing  manager's amendment offered by our distinguished subcommittee chair  relating to the expansion of global currency reserves by the  International Monetary Fund. This amendment would require the Secretary  of the Treasury to support the issuance of an additional $2.1 trillion  of special drawing rights, an IMF reserve asset, to all member  countries of the fund. This is in addition to a whopping $650 billion  that was already issued earlier this year.   This is a highly controversial proposal that appears to run counter  to other administration policies, including claims of prioritizing  efforts to counter the maligned influence of Russia and China.   This plan could result in many billions in additional reserves being  sent to the world's most notorious dictatorships and state sponsors of  terror, such as Iran, Venezuela, Russia, and China.   Not only does this unwise scheme go against the stated goals and  objectives of the White House, but it also could hinder Treasury's  efforts to penalize and pressure these malign state actors through  extensive U.S. sanction regimes.   Why go to all the trouble of putting in place and enforcing these  sanctions when this proposal for the IMF to issue trillions in  additional liquidity could significantly undercut years of pressure  carefully designed to advance our national interest?   Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  amendments en bloc, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart).    Madam Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote on the  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and  nays.
