 Madam Speaker, I rise today in recognition and  celebration of Yom Ha'atzmaut, Israel's Independence Day.   On this day 73 years ago, the Israeli Declaration of Independence was  signed, marking a long-awaited historic day, the formation of the  world's only Jewish state in its modern form.   As a proud American Jew and a proud supporter of Israel, it is a  privilege to recognize Israel and its contributions to the  international community.   Israeli innovation in areas like water, technology, and agriculture  have yielded dramatic advancements with global impact.   I am proud the bills passed in this Chamber, including legislation to  affirm Congress' overwhelming support for Israel and strengthen the  U.S.-Israel relationship.   We are witnessing a new era as Arab States normalize their relations  with Israel, which will create incredible opportunities for cooperation  in the Middle East. I look forward to supporting those growing ties.   I am proud to stand here today in strong support of Israel and the  U.S.-Israel relationship on this 73rd Yom Ha'atzmaut.                            ____________________
