 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Debi Butler  with Brain Health Now. Debi is leading an effort to end the stigma  surrounding mental illness by shifting the conversation to brain  health.   As a parent and former educator, I know how important it is to pay  close attention to brain health. Today, one in five Americans suffer  from behavioral health conditions, such as depression and PTSD. The  majority of these people will not seek treatment, partly due to the  stigma that surrounds brain health. Tragically, this leads to suicides  being up and the second leading cause of death amongst people aged 10  to 34.   Brain health should be treated the same way as physical health, and  while I am glad to have seen many strides in this session, we have more  work to do.   I am grateful for Debi, and I look forward to working together on  this critical issue that we can all call things brain health.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I rise today as the United States  Supreme Court is considering one of the most consequential cases of my  lifetime. The case, Dobbs v. Jackson, will have enormous implications  for the future. Simply put, it will determine whether abortions  performed before a baby is considered viable are lawful.   Here is why this is so important. As early as 5 weeks, unborn babies  are forming blood vessels. By 10 weeks, pain receptors have start  developing. At 15 weeks, babies have developed hearts and pump 17  quarts of blood per day.   With its potential to overturn the 50-year-old law, Roe v. Wade, and  save millions of unborn children, Dobbs v. Jackson is a beacon of hope  for innocent life. This is why earlier this year I joined dozens of my  pro-life colleagues in signing a brief urging the Supreme Court to  uphold the Mississippi law in question that outlaws abortions after 15  weeks.   There is nothing more fundamental and sacred in our Constitution than  the right to life. I humbly ask that you join me in praying for the  Supreme Court to uphold the previability restrictions on abortions.
