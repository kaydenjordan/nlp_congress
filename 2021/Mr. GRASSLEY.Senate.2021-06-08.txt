 Madam President, in January of 2020, when reports began  to circulate about the coronavirus, I instructed my oversight and  investigations staff to get a classified briefing from the Department  of Health and Human Services' Office of National Security. Around that  same time, I publicly said that there were signs that the virus could  develop into a worldwide threat. I also noted at that time my concern  that China may not be accurately reflecting the scale or scope of the  problem and that China was failing to share information with global  health organizations. Unfortunately, my concerns proved to be true.   From the beginning, my goal has been to ensure a robust Federal  response to the threat and to better understand the origins of the  virus.   Today, as we emerge from the pandemic, the focus has rightly shifted  to understanding how the virus originated. We lost over 500,000 of our  fellow Americans, and this body has spent trillions of dollars to  support the U.S. economy during the pandemic.   We the people have an absolute right to know everything that the U.S.  Government knows about the origins of the coronavirus. On March 8,  2021, I wrote to the Director of National Intelligence and the  Secretary of Health and Human Services requesting all intelligence,  among other requests, relating to what the government knows about the  origin of the coronavirus. I received some intelligence product, and  that product causes very serious concern and further supports my belief  that the ongoing review of its origin can't leave any stone unturned.  The effort must be a whole-of-government approach.   In response to my letter, the National Institutes of Health, an  Agency within the Department of Health and Human Services, stated that  it hasn't funded gain-of-function research on the coronavirus. Recent  reports have cast doubts on that position.   Dr. Fauci's unit provided $3.4 million in taxpayer grants to a  research organization called EcoHealth Alliance. That group then issued  subgrants to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. It has been reported that  from this $3.4 million, somewhere between $600,000 and $826,000 was  sent to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. That money, by the way, is  U.S. taxpayer money. It was spent on researching bat coronaviruses.   As the Wall Street Journal noted last week, it is likely that the  Wuhan Institute of Virology was doing gain-of-function research. If  true, that research could have strengthened the virus to the version  that caused the global pandemic.   Dr. Fauci has said that Chinese scientists are trustworthy, that ``we  generally always trust the grantee to do what they say,'' and that ``I  can't guarantee that a grantee hasn't lied to us because you never  know.'' He also said, ``I can't guarantee everything that is going on  in the Wuhan lab, we can't do that.'' What complete nonsense and a mess  that it is.   Well, Dr. Fauci, why can't you know what is going on inside the Wuhan  plant if you are going to send taxpayers' money to do it? For crying  out loud, be aggressive and be accountable.   We know the Chinese Government can't be trusted. We know the Chinese  Government is involved in risky and deadly viral research. We know that  sending money to any entity affiliated with the Chinese Government is a  risky proposition, which is why any sign of any taxpayer money sent to  the Chinese Government should be subject to the most rigorous and  comprehensive oversight.   If Dr. Fauci and his team know that taxpayer money is going to the  Chinese Government, what steps did he and they take to oversee how that  money was used? Well, that question is exactly what I asked in my March  8, 2021, letter to the Department of Health and Human Services. HHS  failed to answer what, if any, oversight was done.   In my followup letter to the Department of Health and Human Services  on May 26 of this year, I stated the following:         Your letter failed to describe the steps the Department of       Health and Human Services took to oversee the research done       at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in light of it being       funded by the taxpayer.    The taxpayers expect the Federal Government to, at a minimum, know  what their money is buying.   Congress expects the Federal Government to perform aggressive  oversight, especially when the funded research involves highly  infectious and deadly viruses. Furthermore, if no oversight were  performed, then that would call into question the government's  confidence that no gain-of-function research was supported by  taxpayers' dollars, because that is what I was told by the HHS.   The people have a right to know what the government knows about the  origins of the coronavirus. The people have a right to know if Dr.  Fauci and other government officials were derelict in their duty to  conduct oversight of the money that they knew would end up with the  Communist Chinese Government.   Dr. Fauci is constantly going on television to talk about anything  that he wants to talk about. He should start talking about what, if  any, oversight he did with respect to the taxpayers' money that he knew  was going to the Communist Chinese Government.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
