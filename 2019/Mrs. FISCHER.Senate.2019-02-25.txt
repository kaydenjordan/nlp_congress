 Madam President, I rise to voice my full support for  the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, offered by my  colleague from Nebraska.   Today's vote on this important bill is going to give every Member of  the Senate a chance to show America where one stands on the basic right  of care for newborn babies.   Throughout my career in public service, I have been a strong  supporter of pro-life policies that show compassion to women and  children. During my time in the Nebraska Legislature, we passed the  first statewide ban on abortion procedures after 20 weeks. Members from  all points of the political spectrum--Republican, Democratic, pro-life,  and pro-choice--came together to support that bill. We have the  opportunity today to come together--Republicans and Democrats--to stand  up for the lives of newborn infants in the U.S. Senate.   The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act protects the lives  of children who survive attempted abortions. Simply put, if a baby  survives an abortion, he or she deserves the same medical care as any  other child who is born prematurely. Without question, newborns deserve  care, attention, and love. This should not be a divisive issue. This is  an issue that is fundamental to what it means to be an American citizen  and, more so, what it means to be a human being. Our Founding Fathers  believed, unequivocally, that every person born in the United States  has a right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The Born- Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act should be, without any doubt, a  measure that is passed in the Senate.   Like most Nebraskans, I have been deeply disturbed by the actions in  Virginia, New York, and the new extremes that have been pushed in the  ensuing national debate that it is OK to deny newborn abortion  survivors medical  [[Page S1417]]  care. As we all know, a bill was introduced in the Virginia House of  Delegates that would make it easier to get a third-term abortion. When  discussing this legislation, the Governor of Virginia recently made  extremely disturbing comments in defending the bill and promoting  infanticide when he described the process of an abortion procedure  taking place while a mother was in labor. These policies and lines of  thought fly in the face of our core values, and they have to end.   In leading up to the vote today, critics across the aisle have  mounted a campaign of misinformation to try to knock this bill off  course. To be clear, this legislation does not set any limits on the  rights of one to obtain an abortion or abortion procedures or methods.  The Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act would ensure that if  newborns survive abortions, then they would receive the same care and  the same attention to their health as would any other newborn. Newborn  children should never be treated without basic human rights or the full  protection of our laws because they are not wanted, especially when  reports have estimated that nearly 2 million couples in the United  States are currently waiting to adopt children--2 million.   There is simply no excuse for an infant not to receive lifesaving  care. We live in a nation that was founded upon the basic rights of  dignity, self-worth, and equality for every human being. In 2002, the  Born-Alive Infants Protection Act passed the House of Representatives  by a voice vote; it passed the Senate by unanimous consent; and it was  signed into law by President Bush. We have the chance right now to  build upon that 2002 consensus that those who survive abortions are, in  fact, people and to clarify that they deserve medical care. We can come  together today to support this sound policy once more. We can clarify,  in light of the extremism we have seen displayed recently, that newborn  abortion survivors deserve medical care.   I thank my fellow Nebraskan for his good work on this bill, and I  will be voting to affirm that children deserve protection at every  stage of life.   I ask all of my colleagues in the Senate to support this measure and  to vote in favor of this important bill that is before us.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I have a request for one committee to  meet during today's session of the Senate. It has the approval of the  Majority and Minority leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committee is authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                        Committee on Foreign Relations    The Committee on Foreign Relations is authorized to meet during the  session of the Senate on Monday, February 25, 2019, at 5 p.m., to  conduct a closed hearing.                            ____________________
