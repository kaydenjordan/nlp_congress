 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor the career and  service of retiring Anaheim Police Chief Jorge Cisneros.   Chief Cisneros is a 33-year law enforcement veteran and has served as  police chief for the past 13 years for various southern California  cities. He started his career way back in 1990 at the Long Beach Police  Department, where he worked his way up through the ranks to become a  commander.   At Long Beach, Chief Cisneros developed and administered a 15-week  Spanish Community Academy for officers to enhance trust and partnership  with the Latino community that then made up 40 percent of the residents  of Long Beach.   In 2018, Chief Cisneros was selected as Anaheim's police chief,  leading 600 employees in that department.   Chief Cisneros holds a master's degree in criminal justice from  Chapman University in the city of Orange and has served as a member and  current vice president of the Orange County Chiefs and Sheriffs  Association.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to call Jorge a good friend and mentor. I ask  my colleagues to join me in honoring and  [[Page H2182]]  celebrating the career of Chief Jorge Cisneros and congratulate him on  his well-deserved retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, to my colleague from Texas, I say that this  bill, this set of bills, criminalizes California's and the United  States' private sector.   Why do you make small businesses and large businesses criminals? We  have a 3.6 percent unemployment rate in this country. Every time I have  businesses in my office, they say: We need workers. We need more  immigrants. This is not what this set of bills is doing.   Let's start out by recognizing the reality that we are living in the  greatest country in the world, the strongest economy in the world. We  need workers, and these bills fail to recognize that reality.   Let's go back and work across the aisle. I say to my colleagues on  the other side, let's come up with comprehensive immigration reform and  a way to keep America as the greatest economy in the world. These bills  do not do that.    Mr. Speaker, I just want to say that most of my life I  have lived on both sides of the border, and since taking over my  subcommittee this year, in the last 4 months, I have gone to Laredo,  Brownsville, Yuma, El Centro, San Ysidro, Otay; and just Monday, Otay,  Tijuana, Mexico.   I am doing this because I think it is important that we leave  Washington and go and ask the border agents, go ask the port  authorities what is going on, tell me what they need.   I saw these men and women in blue uniforms at our ports of entry.  They are very proud of their work. They said: Lou, look, this is 99  percent of the trade we have, the integration of the North American  markets. We are making it happen thanks to the investments by Congress  in personnel, technology, and infrastructure.   Then they said: But we have to keep out that 1 percent, that  fentanyl, those narcotics. They proudly said: We here at the ports of  entry are responsible for stopping over 90 percent of the fentanyl that  comes into this country.   I asked them, of course: What do you need to do your job better?   They said: We are looking to you in Washington for more support. We  are 2,400 personnel down, CBP agents. They said the proposals here by  my colleagues on the other side do nothing to support the additional  hiring of men and women in blue uniforms. Those blue uniforms are  responsible for stopping over 90 percent of the fentanyl that is coming  across the border.   I proposed amendments to this legislation for better pay, retention,  childcare for those workers that have to do forced overtime. All of my  amendments were turned down.   If we are serious about stopping fentanyl, we have to invest more in  those blue uniforms, and this legislation does absolutely nothing to do  that.   Let's be frank here. I have also gone to farmers and small businesses  in my district, and they are also very scared. They are scared of  becoming criminals. You put in a mandatory E-Verify, and every one of  those farmers who employ undocumented farmworkers is going to be  criminalized. Every one of those small businesses in my district that  are calling me and saying, ``Lou, we need immigration reform,'' will  also become criminals because they employ undocumented.   We seem to forget we have a 3.6 percent unemployment rate in this  country. Those folks that are coming across the border are disappearing  into the fabric of our economic society. They are getting jobs. They  are working. They are part of our fabric.   Unless we have immigration reform, unless we have a way to get  workers into this country that is teamed up with some of these  proposals, it is not going to work. At the end of the day, the private  sector that needs workers, folks that need a job will figure out how to  make it work.    Mr. Speaker, this bill is not enough. This bill is not  about creating a solution. It is simply messaging.   This bill is not addressing the fentanyl problem. The best  investments are where it will be stopped at the border.   The bill is not addressing the employment issue. In every sector of  our economy, in every State of our Union, we need workers. We don't  need to criminalize, make employers criminals for trying to hire  somebody to harvest this crop.
