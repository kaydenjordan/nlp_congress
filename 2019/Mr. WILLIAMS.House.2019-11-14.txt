 Mr. Speaker, it is my greatest privilege to represent  our military servicemembers and their families in the 25th District of  Texas, and I am humbled to be their voice in Washington.  [[Page H8836]]    During the month of November, we honor the dedication, the  commitment, and daily sacrifices of 2.6 million military family members  in the United States. These men and women may not take an oath to  defend our liberty, but they are the forces behind our frontlines. They  are the faces of courage and the steadfast models of resolve right here  at home.   Their contributions to our national security are indisputable, and  because of them, America continues to shine as a beacon of hope  throughout this world.   I salute all our military families in the 25th District and across  our Nation and thank them for the sacrifices they have made.   May God bless all these families. May God continue to bless the  United States of America. Most importantly, in God we trust.                            ____________________
