 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  5378, the Lower Costs, More Transparency Act.   This bill, which was a product of thorough bipartisan work across  three committees, is one of the strongest healthcare bills I can  remember voting on since coming to Congress in 2011. Honestly, it  really is. I want to say that again: It is one of the strongest  healthcare bills I can remember voting on since coming to Congress.   I thank Chair Rodgers, Ranking Member Pallone, and the members of the  other two committees for their hard work on getting this bill to the  floor.   At nearly $13,000 per person, or about 18 percent of the GDP, U.S.  national health expenditures far exceed other high-income countries,  and they continue to rise at unsustainable rates.   Congress must enact serious reforms that spur competition and show  taxpayers where all of these healthcare dollars are going. They are  certainly not always going to them.                                time  1630    The problem is not limited to one part of our healthcare system, and  so  [[Page H6789]]  the solution must also reach across the entire system. This legislation  seeks to increase transparency and lower costs related to hospital  care, outpatient services, and prescription drugs, among other things.  It also reauthorizes community health centers and supports  disproportionate share hospitals.   Finally, we cannot get control of our national debt and deficit  unless we first have transparency in our healthcare system, one of the  largest expenditures that the Federal Government has. This bill is a  tremendous step in that direction.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this legislation, and I urge all  my colleagues to support it.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in favor of H.R. 4531, the  Support for Patients and Communities Reauthorization Act.   I was exceedingly proud to work on the SUPPORT Act when it was first  passed in 2018 in response to the opioid crisis.   The legislation brought about many positive changes, but substance  abuse and addiction continue to threaten individuals and communities in  every congressional district across the country and across all  socioeconomic classes.   With over 100,000 drug overdose deaths in the U.S. last year alone,  we must continue working to increase access to, and availability of,  lifesaving treatments and recovery services.   I am particularly happy to be reauthorizing the CORC, or  Comprehensive Opioid Recovery Centers program, which will directly  affect my home State of Indiana.   Regrettably, per capita rates of drug overdose deaths in the Hoosier  State are higher than the national average. The CORC program helps  coordinate the targeted resources available for those who need help  overcoming opioid use disorder.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  critical piece of legislation.
