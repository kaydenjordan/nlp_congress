 Today, I would like to recognize the kindness and  generosity of one of my constituents, High Springs firefighter Doug  Hope.   Last week, Doug responded to a Life Alert emergency call for an  elderly woman who lives alone.   Thankfully, the alert was a false alarm, but while assessing the  woman, Doug noticed that her microwave wasn't working, so she was  unable to heat up the Meals on Wheels food that she relies on to get  by. When he realized how long it had been since she had eaten a warm  meal, Doug decided to go out and buy her a new microwave.   The High Springs Fire Department shared the story on Facebook, and it  has since been viewed by more than a million people.   Despite this attention, Doug has remained humble. He says he just  hopes people who hear about this story are inspired to pay attention to  one another and do something for someone else.   Well done, Doug. Your compassion and selflessness are an inspiration  to all. And, Doug, thanks for being a great example of passing it  forward.                            ____________________
