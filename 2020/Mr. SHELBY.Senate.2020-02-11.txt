 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that before we  recess, I be allowed to finish my remarks.    Mr. President, I rise today in the U.S. Senate in support  of Andrew Brasher of Montgomery, AL, whom I recommended and was later  nominated by President Trump to sit on the U.S. Court of Appeals for  the Eleventh Circuit, a very important post.   I believe Judge Brasher to be an esteemed choice for this high honor.  Formerly Alabama's solicitor general and currently a U.S. district  judge for the Middle District of Alabama, Judge Brasher is no stranger  to the courtroom. I have the utmost regard for his vast legal ability  and his commitment to the rule of law, and I believe he is well suited  for this respected position.   Judge Brasher excelled academically from a young age. He earned his  bachelor of arts with honors from Samford University in Birmingham, AL,  where he graduated summa cum laude and met his wife Julia there. He  currently serves on the school's board of overseers.   Judge Brasher went on from Samford University in Birmingham to  graduate cum laude from Harvard Law School and was the first in his  family to receive his juris doctorate. While in law school at Harvard,  he was a member of the Harvard Law Review and received the Victor  Brudney Prize. The Presiding Officer probably recalls this, but this is  a high honor at Harvard granted annually at the law school to the best  student paper on a subject associated with corporate governance. This  is a very high honor.   Upon graduation, Judge Brasher served as a law clerk to Judge William  H. Pryor, Jr., of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit,  making him neither a stranger to the courtroom nor to the Eleventh  Circuit. Following his clerkship with Judge Pryor, Andrew Brasher  practiced law in Birmingham, AL, with the law firm Bradley Arant Boult  Cummings. During his time with Bradley Arant, he worked in the firm's  litigation and white-collar criminal defense practice groups. He  eventually joined the Alabama attorney general's office, serving for  several years as the deputy solicitor general and then went on to  become the solicitor general for the State of Alabama.   Judge Brasher's experience speaks for itself. He has argued and won  cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  Eleventh Circuit, and the Supreme Court of Alabama. While serving as  solicitor general of the State of Alabama, Judge Brasher won two Best  Brief Award honors from the National Association of Attorneys General.  This accomplishment, as the Presiding Officer knows,  [[Page S978]]  is no easy feat. He proved to be an exceptionally skilled attorney, but  his ambitions did not stop there.   In 2018, the Presiding Officer probably will remember, I recommended  and President Trump nominated Andrew Brasher to serve on the U.S.  District Court for the Middle District of Alabama. Last year, he was  confirmed by the full Senate to sit on the court as a Federal district  judge.   Since his confirmation, Judge Brasher has served the State of Alabama  and the Nation with integrity and purpose. I am confident that in his  new capacity, he will continue to do so. I believe Judge Brasher is  very worthy of this nomination. His judicial temperament and respect  for the law, as it is written, will help him exhibit, I believe,  impartiality and fairness with tact.   President Trump, I believe, has made the right decision in selecting  Judge Brasher for this important job. I believe he will be an asset to  our judicial branch on the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.   I am hopeful that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will vote  to confirm Andrew Brasher without reservation later today. I remain  confident that his dedication to justice will contribute to the  respected standards of our Nation's judicial system. I wish Judge  Brasher and his wife Julia--along with their two boys, Hank and Drew-- all the best as they take on this new opportunity and responsibility.   I yield the floor.                             judicial nominations
