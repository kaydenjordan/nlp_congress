 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4254) to amend the National Science Foundation Authorization  Act of 2002 to strengthen the aerospace workforce pipeline by the  promotion of Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program and National  Aeronautics and Space Administration internship and fellowship  opportunities to women, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4254         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Women in Aerospace Education       Act''.       SEC. 2. ROBERT NOYCE TEACHER SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM FELLOWSHIP                     OPPORTUNITIES.         (a) In General.--The National Science Foundation       Authorization Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-368; 42 U.S.C.       1862n et seq.) is amended--        (1) in section 10(a)(3)(A)(iv), by inserting ``, including       research experiences at national laboratories and NASA       centers'' before the semicolon; and        (2) in section 10A(c)(4)--        (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``and'' at the end;        (B) in subparagraph (B), by striking the period at the end       and inserting ``; and''; and        (C) by adding at the end the following:        ``(C) providing internship opportunities for fellows,       including research experiences at national laboratories and       NASA Centers.''.        (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a)       shall apply with respect to grants awarded on or after       October 1, 2018.       SEC. 3. NASA INTERNSHIP AND FELLOWSHIP OPPORTUNITIES.         Not later than October 1, 2018, the Administrator of the       National Aeronautics and Space Administration (in this       section referred to as ``NASA'') shall institute a process to       prioritize the recruitment of qualified candidates who are       women or individuals who are historically underrepresented in       the fields of science, technology, engineering, and       mathematics (STEM) and computer science for internships and       fellowships at NASA with relevance to the aerospace sector       and related fields.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 4254, the bill now under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am taking this opportunity to speak on an important  initiative to strengthen our aerospace workforce. H.R. 4254, the Women  in Aerospace Education Act, directs the National Science Foundation  through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program and NASA, to shape  their fellowship and internship opportunities to encourage more women  to get aerospace expertise while they are training to be teachers.   Female aerospace professionals must be placed in the classroom in  greater numbers. A full fifth of U.S. aerospace engineers are of  retirement age today. They are beginning to exit our workforce, which  will create an enormous shortfall in our national security  preparedness.   Meanwhile, women represent only one-quarter of all STEM workers and  represent only about 15 percent of all aerospace engineers. We need to  improve our STEM education pipeline--from ensuring STEM classes are  available to students at a young age to encouraging young Americans to  pursue STEM education all the way through to completing their degree.   But the gender gap that is so prevalent in this industry will persist  until we make STEM and aerospace more inclusive of women and encourage  women at a young age to pursue these fields.   Attitudes about career paths are formed at a very young age. The role  models and leaders from which young women learn have an enormous impact  on the decisions they make throughout their formal education as they  enter the workforce.   I introduced the Women in Aerospace Education Act to make better use  of some of the Federal Government's best teacher training programs to  increase the number of women teachers who have seen, worked on, and can  relate to the Nation's leading aerospace programs to young female  students.   Robert Noyce scholars, who get teacher certification assistance from  the National Science Foundation, are already, in small numbers, getting  experience in NASA centers and the national labs.   Once they become certified and go teach in the K-12 system, they draw  upon the work they did on major public initiatives in science and  technology. Schools love having Noyce program teachers because their  strong positive attitudes about STEM are cultivated in the students. It  will strengthen our STEM pipeline to enhance the connection between the  Noyce scholarship program and our schools.   The second provision of this bill directs NASA to more actively  promote its internship and fellowship opportunities to women or members  of other historically underrepresented groups.   Together, the two provisions of this bill will help a necessary and  fundamental shift in our education system in aerospace workforce.   I would like to thank Ms. Esty for her help on this bill, and I  encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. I continue to  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I think Members can hear that we have got  passion here, and Ms. Johnson, Ms. Esty, and I believe that talk is  cheap, and this is actually going to do something. If we are going to  talk about STEM continually, and we are going to try and push this  maybe into an arena that hasn't been pushed before, then let's do  something. That is exactly what this is doing.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
