 Mr. Speaker, first of all, let me thank  Congressman Green who is a lifelong warrior for racial justice, for his  tremendous leadership, and for the time to speak this morning.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2543, and I thank  Chairwoman Waters and the full committee and the Speaker for bringing  this important bill to the floor.   America's racial wealth gap divide directly results from generations  of slavery, segregation, and institutional racism. Black and Brown  communities have never had--I mean, never have had--the same  opportunities to build wealth as White communities. The gap has only  increased and widened in recent decades. This is a fact.   This bill will ensure that Federal monetary policy focuses on  reducing racial and ethnic disparities. It will reorient our financial  systems to support wealth creation in historically underserved  communities. It will support a more level playing field for Black and  Brown families--whether they are buying a home or building equity.    Mr. Speaker, to close the racial wealth gap,  we must confront the systemic and institutional racism that has long  stunted wealth creation in communities of color. In California, my home  State, we didn't even have a fair housing law until I believe it was  1964. Come on. That is generations of my family who weren't even able  to buy a house. They didn't acquire equity to be able to live the life  that White people live in this country.   Come on, please. H.R. 2543 is an important step in the direction to  close these racial gaps. I urge my colleagues to support it.
