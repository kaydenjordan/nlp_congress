The estimated total cost is $2.3 billion.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security of the United States by helping to improve       the security of a friendly country that continues to be an       important strategic partner in the Middle East.        Egypt intends to use these refurbished AH-64 helicopters to       modernize its armed forces to address the shared U.S.-      Egyptian interest in countering terrorist activities       emanating from the Sinai Peninsula, which threaten Egyptian       and Israeli security and undermine regional stability. This       sale will contribute to Egypt's military goal to update its       capability while further enhancing greater interoperability       between Egypt, the U.S., and other allies. Egypt will have no       difficulty sustaining these refurbished aircraft.        The proposed sale will not alter the basic military balance       in the region.        The principal contractors involved in this program are the       Boeing Company, Meza, AZ, and Lockheed Martin Corporation,       Orlando, FL. There are no known offset agreements proposed in       connection with this potential sale.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to Egypt.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 19-74       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(l) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The highest classification of the AH-64 Apache Attack       Helicopter AH-64 Apache helicopter is CONFIDENTIAL and the       highest classification of data and information is SECRET. The       AH-64 Apache helicopter weapon system contains communications       and target identification equipment, navigation equipment,       aircraft survivability equipment, displays, and sensors. The       airframe itself does not contain sensitive technology;       however, the pertinent equipment listed below will be either       installed on the aircraft or included in the sale:        a. The AN/ASQ-170 Modernized Target Acquisition and       Designation Sight/AN/AAQ-11 Pilot Night Vision Sensor (MT       ADS/PNVS) provides day, night, and limited adverse weather       target information, as well as night navigation capabilities.       The PNVS provides thermal imaging that permits nap-of-the-      earth flight to, from, and within the battle area, while TADS       provides the co-pilot gunner with search, detection,       recognition, and designation by means of Direct View Optics       (DVO), EI(2) television, and Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR)       sighting systems that may be used singularly or in       combinations.        b. The AAR-57 Common Missile Warning System (CMWS) detects       energy emitted by threat missiles in-flight, evaluates       potential false alarm emitters in the environment, declares       validity of threat and selects appropriate countermeasures.       The CMWS consists of an Electronic Control Unit (ECU),       Electro-Optic Missile Sensors (EOMSs), and Sequencer and       Improved Countermeasures Dispenser (ICMD).        c. The AN/APR-39 Radar Signal Detecting Set is a system       that provides warnings of radar-directed air defense threats       and allows appropriate countermeasures. This is the 1553       databus-compatible configuration.        d. The AN/AVR-2B Laser Warning Set is a passive laser       warning system that receives,  [[Page S2340]]       processes, and displays threat information resulting from       aircraft illumination by lasers on the multi-functional       display.        e. The Embedded Global Positioning System/Inertial       Navigation System plus Multi-Mode Receiver (EGI+MMR). The       aircraft has two EGIs which use internal accelerometers, rate       gyro measurements, and external sensor measurements to       estimate the aircraft state, provides aircraft flight and       position data to aircraft systems. The EGI is a velocity-      aided, strap down, ring laser gyro based inertial unit. The       EGI unit also houses a GPS receiver.        2. If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        3. A determination has been made that Egypt can provide       substantially the same degree of protection of this       technology as the U.S. Government. This proposed sale is       necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification. Moreover, the benefits to be derived from this       sale, as outlined in the Policy Justification, outweigh the       potential damage that could result if the sensitive       technology were revealed to unauthorized persons.        4. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal has been authorized for release and export to       Egypt.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

The       estimated total program cost is $556 million.        The proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States by helping       to improve the security of an important regional partner. The       UAE has been, and continues to be, a vital U.S. partner for       political stability and economic progress in the Middle East.       This sale is consistent with U.S. initiatives to provide key       allies in the region with modern systems that will enhance       interoperability with U.S. forces and increase security.        The UAE intends to utilize the MRAP vehicles to increase       force protection, to conduct humanitarian assistance       operations, and to protect critical infrastructure.       Additionally, these MRAPs will enhance the UAE's burden       sharing capacity and defensive capabilities. The UAE will       have no difficulty absorbing this equipment and support into       its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       affect the basic military balance in the region.        These vehicles will be coming from U.S. Army stocks as EDA;       the required EDA Congressional Notifications were made August       6, 2014. There are no known offset agreements proposed in       conjunction with this proposed sale.        Implementation of this sale will not require the assignment       of U.S. Government or contractor representatives to the UAE.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 19-68       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(l) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle is an       armored, multipurpose combat vehicle intended to support       mounted urban operations to include convoy security support       and dismounted patrols. It is designed to increase crew       survivability. The vehicle has a blast-resistant underbody       designed to protect the crew from mine blasts, fragmentation,       and direct fire weapons.        2. All MRAP vehicle information needed to operate, train,       and maintain the vehicles are UNCLASSIFIED. Some design and       test data, design performance parameters, armoring       methodology, vulnerabilities, armor types, and configuration       can be classified up to SECRET.        3. Loss of this hardware, software, documentation, and/or       data could permit development of information which may lead       to a significant threat to future U.S. military operations.       If a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures or       equivalent systems which might reduce weapon system       effectiveness or be used in the development of a system with       similar or advanced capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that the UAE can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for this       technology as the U.S. Government. This proposed sale is       necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        5. All of the defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the UAE.                            ____________________
