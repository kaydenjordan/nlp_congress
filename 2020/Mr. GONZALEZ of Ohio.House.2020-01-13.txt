 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4841,  the Prudential Regulator Oversight Act. I was pleased to cosponsor this  bill introduced by my good friend and colleague, Mr. Dean Phillips.   The Federal Reserve, NCUA, FDIC, and OCC play a vital role in  developing a regulatory framework that promotes economic growth and  sound regulator policies in all of our communities.   It is important that these regulator bodies hear from Members on both  sides of the aisle on how different policy decisions will impact our  constituents. It is also important that Members of Congress ask  questions and provide oversight on the regulators' activities.   H.R. 4841 will require the prudential regulators to come before the  Financial Services Committee and Senate Banking Committee on an annual  basis. They will also support various reports to the committees of  jurisdiction twice a year.                                time  1715    This includes reports on issues like soundness of depository  institutions, compliance with anti-money laundering, and the  utilization of fintech at financial institutions. This will help  lawmakers better understand trends in the financial industry and  identify potential policy proposals in response to issues facing our  country.   Again, I want to thank Congressman Phillips for his hard work on this  bill and thank Chairwoman Waters and Ranking Member McHenry for  bringing it to the floor today. I encourage my colleagues to support  this legislation.
