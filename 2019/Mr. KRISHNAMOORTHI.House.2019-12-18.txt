 Madam Speaker, like many of my colleagues, I  never ran for Congress wanting or expecting to impeach anybody, let  alone the President of the United States.   However, given the facts, here we are.   While some questions remain unanswered, two key facts are clear and  compel me to support the Articles of Impeachment.   First, President Trump attempted to pressure a foreign government to  help his reelection campaign.   And second, the President used the powers of his office to obstruct a  congressional investigation into that wrongdoing.   The President has falsely claimed he has been denied the chance to  defend himself, but at the same time, he is preventing the testimony of  witnesses with direct knowledge of the events under investigation.   If the President were innocent, as he claims, surely these witnesses  would be able to testify to that. If there had been no quid pro quo,  these witnesses could say that. If aid to Ukraine were not  intentionally delayed for improper purposes, they could surely testify  to that also.   But rather than giving these witnesses the chance to speak, the  President has silenced them. The President has silenced witnesses at  the Defense Department. The President has silenced witnesses at the  State Department. The President has silenced witnesses at the White  House. He even silenced the loquacious Mick Mulvaney, who uttered at a  press conference that there was a quid pro quo and ``get over it.''   By choosing to block this testimony, the President is not proving his  innocence; he is just proving he is afraid of what they have to say.   As a wise man once said, the truth will come to light. And it has. It  is our duty to act on it.                                time  1800
