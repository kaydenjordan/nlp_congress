 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize today a teacher  in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, who was recently honored for her service  in the nonprofit sector in addition to the classroom.   Mary Pellegrino, a special education teacher at Tohickon Middle  School and a resident of Warrington, recently received the Pennsylvania  State Education Association's Human and Civil Rights Award for her  service to our community.   With her husband, Greg, she is the cofounder of the BennettStrong  Foundation, which was named after her son, Bennett, who was born  weighing a mere 1 pound 2 ounces in 2013. He was later diagnosed with  hepatoblastoma, a form of liver cancer.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud of the work of the BennettStrong Foundation,  whose mission is to provide support to families of children born  prematurely and facing complex medical issues.   I would like to congratulate Mary Pellegrino on this well-deserved  award, and I am proud to report Bennett's cancer is in remission. Our  entire team wish him all the best on the road to recovery.   Lastly, I would like to thank Dolores McCracken, the president of the  Pennsylvania State Education Association for all of her work in  recognizing our community's heroes.                      Honoring Sergeant Thelma Williams     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a Doylestown  resident and Army veteran, Sergeant Thelma Williams. This past Memorial  Day, Thelma made her 25th and final appearance in the Doylestown  Memorial Day Parade.   Thelma answered the call to serve during World War II when she was 24  years old. Initially, she wanted to enlist in the Navy. Later, Thelma  joined the Women's Army Corps and finished her tenure in Japan, where  she served under General Douglas MacArthur.   It should come as no surprise that Thelma's spirit remains as lively  as ever, even as she approaches her 100th birthday this year. She hopes  that children observing the parade will be inspired to serve our  community as well.   Mr. Speaker, Sergeant Thelma Williams has made immense contributions  not just to Bucks County, but to our entire Nation. I commend Thelma  for her heroism, and I encourage our constituents to aspire to her  standards of excellence.                               Food Insecurity     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  issue of food insecurity in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.   As public officials, it is incumbent upon all of us to increase  access to food resources for all of our constituents. In our community,  I applaud the United Way of Bucks County for their work in combating  hunger.   Later this month, nearly 600 volunteers will gather at Delaware  Valley University for the sixth annual Bucks  [[Page H4855]]  Knocks Out Hunger event. This year, volunteers plan on packing over  100,000 nonperishable meals for seniors and food pantries throughout  Bucks County.   I would also like to recognize other worthy organizations that are  vital partners of Bucks Knocks Out Hunger, including Rolling Harvest  Food Rescue, the Bucks County Opportunity Council, and the newest  addition, Fresh Connect Bucks County, which will play a vital role in  providing fresh fruits and vegetables to local families.   Mr. Speaker, by working together, we can make sure that all of our  children and our families in our communities can have access to the  resources they need to succeed.                            ____________________
