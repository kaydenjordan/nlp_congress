 Mr. Speaker, I rise to sound the alarm about an ominous  trend that seems to be taking hold in our Nation.   In June, a self-avowed democratic socialist jumped into the national  spotlight in her quest to join this body. Many view her as carrying the  mantle for a new socialist trend among some in the United States.   So, I ask, what would socialist policies mean for our country's  future?   I have come to realize that a whole generation of Americans have  grown up for whom the Soviet Union is just a distant historical memory.  Many have no personal memory of when the Soviet Union came crashing  down in 1991, which was dramatic proof that its socialist system was a  dismal failure. Many can't recall the feeling of national pride over  the fact that, in contrast, the free economy of the United States had  succeeded in producing the highest standard of living in world history.   So perhaps it is understandable that, for a new generation, the old,  empty promises of socialism seem to carry a new allure.   Socialism, by definition, is the political and economic theory of  social organization whereby production, distribution, and exchange  should be owned and regulated by the community as a whole. In other  words, what is mine is yours, and what is yours is mine.   Usually, it is the latter that gets people to buy in. That is, what  is yours is mine. This concept holds a strong appeal for many people  because it addresses legitimate concerns over inequity and injustice.   The problem is that, for all its high-minded fairness, socialism  doesn't work. It is not just a castle in the air; it is the promise of  a palace that is really built on quicksand. You don't have to look back  to the Soviet Union to see this.   Venezuela is just the latest tragic example of socialism's  devastation. At the beginning of the 21st century, Venezuela was one of  the top 20 richest countries in the world. Today, its poverty rate is  87 percent, and its inflation rate is predicted to be approaching 1  million percent--yes, 1 million.   Once, Venezuela's capital was a tourist destination with a thriving  culture. Today, it is the crime capital of the world.   This crisis is the result of the redistributive policies and the  systematic destruction of economic freedom by a corrupt and elitist  administration.   As President Trump said in his first speech to the United Nations  General Assembly: ``The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has  been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully  implemented.''   It is a sobering reminder that while socialism's torchbearers may  change, the havoc it wreaks with its hollow promises remains the same.  What we must remember is that America is not immune.   As President Ronald Reagan famously said: ``Freedom is never more  than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it on to our  children in the bloodstream.''   Socialism, faithfully implemented, could cripple our Nation's peace  and prosperity over time, just as it did in Venezuela.   It is easy to see the allure of socialism. Socialists say that they  desire an equitable distribution of wealth and then characterize  capitalism as rampant greed and materialism.   Ironically, it is typically the advocates of socialism who display  the excess desire for material goods. There is the obsession with  making things free, from phones, to internet access, to a college  education. Theirs is the obsession with disparities in income, rather  than a concern with job opportunities.   Socialism holds a strong appeal for many because it legitimizes  coveting your neighbor's possessions, which was once commonly  understood as against the Tenth Commandment. And the premises of  socialism, all under the high-minded guise of fairness, are anything  but fair.   Capitalism, on the other hand, is responsible for the enormous levels  of philanthropic giving that we see in the United States of America,  the most generous Nation ever known to mankind.   We must continue to speak out boldly, not based on fear, but based on  facts. We must continue to tell the truth, regardless of its  popularity. We must continue to implement policies that unleash the  power of our free economy and create more opportunities for all  Americans, like the recently passed Tax Cuts and Jobs Act with its  bipartisan opportunity zones.   It is my firm belief that, in the marketplace of ideas, freedom will  always win out over socialism on the bases of merit, evidence, and  facts. But it cannot win if no one is making the case.   Mr. Speaker, let's continue to stand up and speak out. Let's make the  case for freedom and opportunity for all Americans.                            ____________________
