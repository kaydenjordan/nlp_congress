 Mr. President, I just heard that our friend and  colleague from North Carolina has collapsed during a race in DC and is  receiving medical attention. Until we hear further news, our hearts  will be in our mouths, hoping for the best. Our thoughts and prayers,  as a Senate family, are with the junior Senator from North Carolina and  his family.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time  during the quorum call be charged equally to both sides.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
