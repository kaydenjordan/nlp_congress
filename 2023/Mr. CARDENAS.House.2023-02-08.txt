 Mr. Speaker, I am very honored to be a Member in this  Chamber of the House of Representatives, very proud to have been  blessed to be born an American citizen, and very proud to be raised by  my immigrant parents in this great country in a community called  Pacoima.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in celebration of Black History Month.   My neighborhood of Pacoima has a long and rich history of wonderful,  beautiful, amazing Black Americans, untold stories and uncelebrated  heroes who have shaped the San Fernando Valley and my neighborhood of  Pacoima, the community I call home, the community in which my immigrant  parents raised my 10 brothers and sisters and me.   This is the community that gave us our first Latino United States  Senator to represent the great State of California, Senator Alex  Padilla.   A little-known fact is that the first Congressmember from Pacoima and  San Fernando High School is my esteemed colleague, the Honorable  Barbara Lee. As a teenager, Congresswoman Barbara Lee began her  activism when she refused to accept the segregation of her high school  cheerleading squad.   Rather than accept this injustice, she challenged the White majority  school and turned to the local chapter of the  [[Page H773]]  NAACP to advocate to allow minorities the opportunity to be  cheerleaders.   Congresswoman Lee was victorious and won the right to cheer for her  school. She was the first African-American cheerleader in the history  of our high school, San Fernando High School. She is now a champion for  justice as a United States Congresswoman.   The history of Black Americans in Pacoima dates back to World War II.  Following the war, due to racist redline policies, African-American  families were only able to purchase homes in communities such as  Compton in South Los Angeles, Sun Village in the high desert, and  Pacoima in the San Fernando Valley.   By 1960, almost all of the 10,000 African Americans in the San  Fernando Valley lived in Pacoima. This community became the center of  African-American life in the San Fernando Valley. Pacoima was known as  California's first Black suburb.   One of the examples was the development of the Joe Louis Homes. These  homes were the only hope and opportunity for African Americans to have  home ownership. These homes were named after the former heavyweight  boxing champion whose name was used as a ruse to steer Black buyers to  Pacoima. Joe Louis had little or nothing to do with these real estate  developments. But from this, African Americans living in Pacoima set  the foundation of the beautiful community that I call home.   It is a history filled with heartbreak and tragedy, hope and  inspiration. Pacoima's Black history is a thread that keeps our  community together.   I will use this opportunity to spotlight community leaders that are  the cornerstone of our history of Pacoima, religious leaders like the  Broadous family.   The Broadous name is embedded in Pacoima history through the  countless contributions made by Reverend Broadous and his family.   Reverend Hillery T. Broadous was the founder of Pacoima's Calvary  Baptist Church and served the community faithfully. He helped organize  the San Fernando Valley chapter of the NAACP and led efforts to build  the Hubert H. Humphrey Memorial Recreation Center.   Reverend Broadous was a World War II veteran. He owned and operated a  successful barbershop before he turned to the ministry in 1952. In May  of 1955, he founded Calvary Baptist Church of Pacoima.   Through Calvary Baptist Church, he played a fundamental role in  bringing healthcare, educational, and recreational opportunities to our  community.   The former Filmore Street School is now named in honor of Reverend  Hillery T. Broadous.   In 2022, Hillery T. Broadous Elementary School administration,  parents, and students, along with local artist Juan Reyes, painted the  largest mural in the Los Angeles Unified School District in honor of  the contributions he and his family made to the Pacoima community.   Mother Rosa Lee Broadous co-founded Calvary Baptist Church with her  husband Hillery in 1955 and served as vice president of the first board  of directors of the Pacoima NAACP.   Her legendary involvement in community organizations included Church  Women United, Braille Institute, Fair Housing Council, Pacoima  Coordinating Council, Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, PTA, Los Angeles Public  Library, and the YWCA.   She was also the first to organize Negro History Week programs in the  San Fernando Valley. She served as a board member of Valley Interfaith  Council, charged with overseeing local senior citizen centers.   Reverend Hillery and Mother Rosa Lee Broadous raised 10 amazing  children, six of them pursuing religious and community causes.  Unfortunately, three of the Broadouses are no longer with us.   The Broadous children include Reverend Alicia Broadous-Duncan, the  oldest of 10 children. In the late 1970s, she became a minister. She  was a fierce advocate for seniors and served as the executive director  of the Northeast Valley Multipurpose Senior Center. In 1990, she was  tapped to head the merger of what had been two senior centers into one  large facility, serving the diverse northeast San Fernando Valley with  a team of over 80 staffers.   The services provided at the senior centers are critical to the  thousands of seniors living in our community. They provide instrumental  resources on nutrition programs, arts programming, socializing  activities, and transportation.   After her unfortunate passing, the center was renamed in honor of  her, the Alicia Broadous-Duncan Multipurpose Senior Center. The center  continues to serve as a community hub for our entire neighborhood.    Apostle William T. Broadous was the leader of Calvary Baptist  following his father's legacy, where he established the Children's  Church at Calvary, the Calvary Baptist Church Social Service Ministry,  and the Calvary Baptist Koinonia Bookstore.   Apostle Broadous led ministry trips to Africa, campaigned against  street violence, set up a Latino ministry, and advocated for formerly  incarcerated individuals and for economic development in the northeast  Valley.   The city of Los Angeles dedicated the intersection of Vaughn Street  and Dronfield Avenue in honor of Apostle William T. Broadous.   Reverend Arthur Lee Broadous. Reverend Arthur was the musical soul of  the Broadous family. He was the choir leader and former director of the  Pacoima Community Youth Cultural Center Choir. Reverend Arthur served  as the San Fernando Valley field representative for Los Angeles Mayor  Tom Bradley.   During the 1992 riots, in an effort to calm any potential violence,  he dispatched ministers to hotspots throughout the Valley. He was a  mover and a shaker of the community and always looked to unify the  neighborhood.   All the Broadous children including, Marie Broadous Neloms, Rosita  Furaha Broadous, Hillery L. ``Abdullah'' Broadous, Reverend Zedar E.  Broadous, Reverend Pamela J. Broadous, Reverend M. Cecilia Broadous,  and Francine Broadous Oputa are the definition of community service,  and their work is seen every day in the streets of Pacoima and beyond.   When it comes to empowerment, Marie Harris, community activist and  honorary mayor of Pacoima, was born on October 10, 1922, in Houston,  Texas. She attended schools in Pittsburgh and married Alvin Harris soon  after her high school graduation.   She led efforts to develop the first new major shopping center,  called Pacoima Plaza for the Stars.   Marie, a Pacoima resident since 1960, was a devoted mother of three  children and known for organizing local fashion show fundraisers.   Marie was an amazing fashion designer. She spurred the Pacoima  Property Owners Association to produce the Back to Pacoima Expo, a  long-running reunion for expatriate residents of Pacoima at Hansen Dam.   She was a fierce advocate for the San Fernando Valley and was one of  the three original signatories to begin the process for the San  Fernando Valley to secede from the city of Los Angeles. She did this to  spark debate and ensure that San Fernando Valley residents received  their fair share of city services.   She was a true community leader advocating to get streets paved,  sidewalks cleaned, trees trimmed, and much more.   Harris is survived by her three children: Sidney, Rolene, and Alton;  five grandchildren; and many, many great-grandchildren.   In honor of Pacoima's late honorary mayor, Marie Harris, the city of  Los Angeles proclaimed the center of Glenoaks Boulevard and Van Nuys  Boulevard ``Marie Harris Square.''   When it comes to civic duty, Jose DeSosa, former president of the San  Fernando Valley NAACP and active civic rights leader, is the epitome of  civic duty.   In 1988, he was elected as the first statewide president of the  NAACP. He was born in Panama City, Republic of Panama, and later  migrated to New York City. He enlisted in the United States Air Force  and served our country for nearly 10 years.   DeSosa worked for the Pacific Telephone and Telegraph Company. Soon  after the company merged with AT&T, he and his wife Juanita moved to  Pacoima.   As president of the NAACP, he used his Black and Latino heritage to  build  [[Page H774]]  working relationships between both cultures.   He was a passionate critic of the tactics and procedures of the Los  Angeles Police Department and led the effort to ban the use of the  battering ram and the choke hold by LAPD. He led peaceful efforts to  unite hundreds of community members demanding change.   He was a former board member of Neighborhood Legal Services of Los  Angeles County, and to this day their community room at Pacoima is  named in honor of him.   We have many legendary sports heroes that emanate from our community  of Pacoima, especially at our great San Fernando High School.   The San Fernando High School Tigers football team, during the 1960s  and 1970s, the home of the Mighty Tigers, was the training ground of  future USC Trojans and NFL stars, an A-list of players such as Charles  White, Anthony Davis, Kevin Williams, and Manfred Moore.   Charles White, who recently passed away, was a track and football  star at San Fernando High School. He was a star running back and won  back-to-back city football championships at our high school. He then  went on to USC, where Charles White was an All-American and the 1979  Heisman Trophy winner. He played in the NFL and led the NFL in rushing  yards and was selected to the Pro Bowl in 1987.    After his retirement, Charles worked for USC. Despite his struggles  with addiction and mental health throughout his career, he was a true  star.   Unfortunately, we recently lost Charles White on January 11, 2023.   Anthony Davis was another football star. He was also an All-American  in 1974 who played for the USC Trojans. At San Fernando High School, he  was a running back during their city championship run.   He was known by ``Sports Illustrated'' as the ``Notre Dame Killer''  when he infamously led USC to a comeback victory. Notre Dame had a 24-0  lead, but before the end of the first quarter, Anthony Davis scored a  touchdown which kicked off a 55-point comeback. He scored six  touchdowns, ran and caught for 368 total yard performance in one game  versus the Fighting Irish.   Anthony Davis helped lead the Trojans to three Rose Bowl games,  including victories in 1973 and 1975, and two national championships  during his three seasons.   During his Trojan career, Davis won five national championships, two  in football and three in baseball. He played his professional career in  the NFL, the USFL, and the CFL.   Another great star is Kevin Williams, who was also a USC football and  track star and part of the tremendous trio with White and Moore at San  Fernando High School.   Known by his family as ``Little Man'' and nicknamed the ``Bug,'' he  was known for his speed and elusiveness on the field. He played for USC  and was drafted to the NFL.   After his athletic career, he worked as a brakeman for the Santa Fe  trains.   We unfortunately lost him in 1996 in a devastating accident.                                time  1845    Before Charles, Anthony, and Kevin were there, Manfred Moore was the  running back for the 1967 San Fernando High School city champions. He  was a State wrestling champion, as well. As a USC Trojan, he was part  of the 1972 national championship team that had one of the most  dominant college seasons ever.   These four Mighty Tigers set the bar of athletic excellence for all  of us in the San Fernando Valley. They are all true champions.   Andrae Crouch's musical career began at home. He was a son of a  minister, where he found his love and passion for gospel music. His  father, Reverend Benjamin Crouch, founded the New Christ Memorial  Church.   Andrae bridged the gap between gospel and mainstream music, working  with major stars such as Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Quincy Jones.  Songs like Michael Jackson's ``Man in the Mirror'' and Madonna's ``Like  a Prayer'' became pop hits because of Andrae's musical genius.   He also received Oscar nominations for musical arrangements for  movies such as ``The Color Purple'' and Disney's ``The Lion King.''   His popularity laid the foundation of R&B influence in gospel music  to this day. His eight Grammys were instrumental in the merging of pop,  contemporary gospel, and soul.   When it comes to educating the children of our community, there is no  one like Leroy Chase. For more than 50 years, the San Fernando Valley  Boys and Girls Club president was the tenacious Leroy Chase, running  one of the oldest not-for-profits in Pacoima.   In 1968, he was hired and ended up expanding the small storefront  into the large facility that it is today.   Leroy provided resources to over 75,000 youth. One of those youth was  me. He gave me my first job.   After school, this was a place where boys and girls could study and  do their homework. It served as a safe space to stay out of trouble. I  would not be here if it wasn't for Leroy Chase.   In honor of Leroy, the city of Los Angeles will be dedicating the  intersection of Glenoaks Boulevard and Pierce Street in his honor, in  his name.   The legacy of the San Fernando Valley Boys and Girls Club carries on  through the work of his daughter, Nicole Chase, who currently serves as  the president and CEO of the San Fernando Valley Boys and Girls Club  and continues the legacy of being a center for kids to learn and play.   This is all done so that kids like me could reach their full  potential, and we are so blessed to have Leroy Chase and his family in  our lives.   I close by thanking the Pacoima Historical Society and their  president, Crystal Jackson, for ensuring that this history, the history  of my community, our community, is being shared with future  generations. The great work and legacy created by these leaders will  always be remembered and always be in our hearts.   I would be remiss if I didn't take this opportunity to take some of  the time afforded me as a Member of the House of Representatives to  comment on the amazing, wonderful work that our President, President  Biden, is doing in his administration.   As I said earlier, I am blessed to be a Member of the Chamber, of the  House of Representatives, to be able to speak on this floor, to be able  to address my fellow Americans about the issues that face us, the  challenges that we have had, and the hope and challenges that we will  tackle in the future.   President Biden's administration is one of the most successful  administrations, accomplishing in just these 2 short years more than  most administrations accomplished in 4 or 8 years. I am excited for the  next 2 years to come.   People say our government is divided, but at the end of the day, I  truly believe in my heart that by working together, by hearing each  other, we will be able to accomplish what we were sent to accomplish  for the people of this great Nation and, more importantly, to make sure  that we restore the confidence that the world has in the reputation of  the United States of America.   Just recently, one of the most devastating earthquakes, which has  taken thousands and thousands of lives, occurred in Turkey and Syria.  Immediately, the Biden administration, along with communities around  the country, rallied together to send help and rescue teams to the  people in need.   That is the United States of America that I have always known. That  is the United States of America that we all can and should be proud of.  That is the United States of America, and we have some work to do to  restore our reputation around the world because not every Presidency is  the same, Mr. Speaker.   Some Presidencies have torn down our image, but I am so proud of the  fact that President Biden and his administration are doing the work  that we all deserve as Americans for our President to do. That is to  restore our position and the faith that people have in what good it is  to know that the United States of America is here, here to help, and  here to be assisting.   More importantly, in any time of need, we are ready to help any  nation that needs our support and our help, especially those nations  who aspire to be a democracy, especially those nations who need us to  be there to make sure that we can help human beings live a dignified  life.   I am here to say, Mr. Speaker, that we have done it time and time  again  [[Page H775]]  for generation after generation to help as a world leader without  compromising the commitment and the dedication that we have to the  people of our great Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
