 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to a massive  spending bill filled with payoffs to progressives.   We should be focused on defeating COVID, getting Americans back to  work, and helping small business recover. Instead, House Democrats are  tossing bipartisanship aside to ram through a one-sided $1.9 trillion  bill.   We need a full accounting of the $1 trillion in existing COVID relief  that hasn't even been spent before asking taxpayers to foot the bill  for trillions more.   And this isn't even emergency relief. Less than 10 percent is for  actually fighting COVID. The rest will only make it harder for small  business to recover, hire workers, and rebuild our economy.   On top of that, it is a massive bailout for fiscally irresponsible  cities and States. Put simply, Hoosiers should not have to pay for the  bad decisions of progressives in California.   This is not the unity President Biden called for. It is not the  bipartisanship Americans expect. It is certainly not the targeted COVID  relief our country needs.                            ____________________
