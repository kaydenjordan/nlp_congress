 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I would like to have been here today to  offer strong bipartisan support for a bill that would help with rules  and regulations for the smallest banks and credit unions in the  country. There is a real effort on the part of a lot of us to come to  an agreement particularly aimed at those banks, the community banks and  the regional banks. I have three. Senator Portman's and my State is the  only State in the country that has three regional banks, the banks that  have $50 billion, $100 billion, $150 billion--Huntington, KeyCorp, and  Fifth Third.   Unfortunately, this bill started off that way, but it has become  something else, and the something else is that this bill seems to me  and many others to be more concerned with the largest banks and Wall  Street than it does with community banks.   There are lots of things that can come out of this bill. The bill  gives regulators way too much flexibility--regulators such as Mulvaney,  Otting, Quarles, and others. It vests more power in FSOC--something  that the Republicans didn't want to do until they got regulators like  Mnuchin, Mulvaney, and people like that who are much more likely to  side with Wall Street. The White House is increasingly looking like a  retreat for Wall Street executives, and these are the people who are  going to be doing the regulation of this bill.   Republicans and Democrats alike who believe in the need for  regulation are concerned about this bill or are opposed to this bill,  people like Dan Tarullo, who used to be a member of the Board of  Governors at the Federal Reserve in charge of regulation; Paul Volcker,  a Federal Reserve Chair who was selected by a Republican and a  Democratic President; Sarah Bloom Raskin; Gary Gensler; Tom Hoenig, a  Republican; Sheila Bair, President Bush's nominee at the FDIC; Phil  Angelides, who did a good analysis of what actually happened 10 years  ago when Wall Street almost collapsed our economy.   This body seems to have experienced sort of a collective amnesia.  Take a look at what happened to the economy 10 years ago, and today we  are giving relief to many of the largest banks in this country, relief  that these things on the stress test--a weaker stress test, a less  regular stress test, will mean many of the larger banks simply will not  be under the intense examination that we have done in the past. What  does that mean? What that means is those banks are more likely to  jeopardize the safety and soundness of the banking system. Again, we  know what happened 10 years ago when we had to bail them out.   There is a Washington Post article that came out today. The headline  is ``Senate banking bill likely to boost chances of bank bailouts, CBO  says.'' The CBO says that the Senate banking bill is likely to boost  chances of bank bailouts. Why would we do that when banks are doing  very well? Banks of all sizes are very profitable these days. We just  did a tax bill that gives the largest banks--the financial services  industry overall but especially the Wall Street banks--huge tax breaks.  So we are going to pass a bill that the Congressional Budget Office--a  neutral scorer here, the referee--the Congressional Budget Office says  that this will cost taxpayers $671 million, and it will increase the  chances of a bailout. Why would we pass a bill to give the banks breaks  and then give them $671 million of taxpayer dollars? I just don't  understand why we as a Senate would want to do such a thing.   Nobody in Ohio, except for some bank executives, are clamoring for  this bill. Nobody is saying: Oh, we have to deregulate the banks. We  have to help the biggest banks. We have to help these banks that drove  us into the ditch 10 years ago. It simply doesn't make sense.   I ask for a ``no'' vote on the motion to proceed.                                Cloture Motion     Mr. President, 10 years ago almost to the day, this  country was on the verge of a financial crisis that would wreck the  lives of millions of families. The experts--let's say the so-called  experts--had their heads in the sand. They shrugged off the warnings.  They told the public everything was fine.   Jim Cramer was telling hard-working Americans to invest their money  in Bear Stearns. Maybe younger Members of the Senate don't really  remember what Bear Stearns was. Jim Cramer said: ``I'm not giving up on  the thing.''   Bank of America was putting the finishing touches on its plan to buy  the subprime lender Countrywide, which they called ``the best domestic  mortgage platform.''   Hank Paulson, the last Treasury Secretary who got plucked from  Goldman Sachs--we have had at least one since--downplayed homeowners'  pain. He said: ``You know, the stock market goes up and down every day  more than the entire value of the subprime mortgages in the country.''   Meanwhile, advocates in communities--the people who were actually  dealing with the consequences of the crisis--were sounding the alarm.  The fair lending group Greenlining began meeting with Federal Reserve  Chairman Alan Greenspan at least once a year, starting in 1999--1999-- to warn about predatory mortgage lending. Attorneys general from across  the country started to caution about troubling trends.   In Cleveland, which is in the Presiding Officer's home State, we saw  home prices climb 66 percent in 10 years, with the housing market  juiced by ``flipping on mega-steroids,'' according to a government  panel that investigated the crisis. City officials in Cleveland began  to hear reports that predatory home refinances were being pushed on  buyers regardless of whether they could afford to repay the loans.  Those refinances mean fees to bankers.   Foreclosures began to shoot up in Cuyahoga County--5,900 foreclosure  filings in 2000, and by 2007, 15,000. My wife and I live in ZIP Code  44105, which includes Slavic Village in Cleveland, OH. In the first  half of 2007, that ZIP Code had more foreclosures than any ZIP Code in  the United States of America.   The city of Cleveland went to the Fed and asked it to use its  authority to restrain subprime lending. The Fed did nothing. The people  in charge in Washington were too certain, too detached, and perhaps too  comfortable to listen to the warnings from Ohioans and from people  across the country.   We saw what happened. All of these people who had the hubris to say  that the economy could keep growing and keep growing and keep growing  while the middle class was being looted--those people, thank you very  much, weathered the crisis just fine. No one with a cable show had  their home foreclosed on. Nobody on Wall Street who tanked the economy  went to jail. In fact, many of these same people now have fancy jobs in  fancy buildings and dress in fancy clothes and have fancy titles and  work on Wall Street and in the White House. But in ZIP Codes like  44105, in Slavic Village and Cleveland, OH, and places like it across  the country, parents were sitting down at kitchen tables to have  painful conversations with their children.   Think about what this means. You lose your job, or you can't keep up  with your mortgage payment. The husband, the wife, two teenage  children. You have a family pet, a dog. You realize you are falling  further and further behind. You are still working and you are still  trying, but things aren't going well. The first thing you do--your dog  has to go to the vet. You can't pay for that. You simply don't have the  money. You take the dog to the shelter. You do what a lot of families  in Cleveland unfortunately do; you just try to give your dog away or do  something.   You then face your children. You say to your children: We are going  to lose our home. We are going to have to move. We don't know where we  are going to move yet. We don't know which school district. We don't  know where your friends will be because we are going to have to move.   I don't think people around here really think much about what  foreclosures mean to families. Remember what I said--5,900 foreclosures  in Cuyahoga County in 2000 and 15,000 by 2007. Hundreds of those were  in ZIP Code 44105. Think what that does to those families. My  colleagues, when we vote today and tomorrow and Thursday on whether we  are going to pass this giveaway bill to Wall Street, just think about  that.   The CEOs and the boards at the banks and people in Washington who are  supposed to be watching failed these Americans. That is why Congress,  including some Republicans, did something about it 10 years ago,  something to stop this from ever happening again. We passed a law. We  created important protections for the financial system, for taxpayers,  for homeowners. We held banks and watchdogs accountable to prevent  another crisis.   Fundamentally, we did it right a decade ago, but Wall Street never  gives up that easily. They didn't like that bill. They opposed that  bill--most of them. Big bank lobbyists, the same ones who were so sure  the 2000s crisis wasn't going to happen, those who flippantly said that  things are all right--remember what Hank Paulson said. Hank Paulson,  the Bush Secretary of the Treasury, said: You know, the stock market  goes up and down every day more than the entire value of subprime  mortgages in the country. Well, Hank Paulson didn't pay much of a  price.  [[Page S1351]]  None of the regulators paid much of a price.   Ten years ago, we did it right. As I said, the big banks never gave  up. Big bank lobbyists went to work.   Get this: The day the President signed the Dodd-Frank bill  implementing these safety rules and regulations--implementing the  consumer protections, making sure that the government was actually on  the side of consumers and people paying their mortgage and homeowners-- the same day President Obama put his ``Barack Obama'' signature on the  Dodd-Frank law, the top financial services lobbyists in Washington  said: Now it is half time. In other words, we may have lost the first  half. They passed this bill. We didn't want it, but don't worry about  us in the second half.   To these people, the economy is a game. They can't tell the  difference between putting millions of Americans' lives and homes and  savings at risk and a game of pickup basketball.   Piece by piece, Wall Street has gone to the agencies, they have gone  to the courts, they have gone to Congress to dismantle the consumer  protections we put in place. The drumbeat is constant. It is ongoing.  It has been happening for 10 years. They always want a new exemption,  they always want a weaker standard, they always want a new tax break,  and do you know what? They can always find a whole lot of Senators and  House Members who will write a letter to the Federal Reserve, who will  make a call to the Office of Consumer Counsel, who will go at it and  will attack in public the Consumer Bureau. They can always find Members  in this body who are fueled by lots of Wall Street contributions and a  lot of allies in New York. They can always find people to do their  bidding. That is why you see this drum. That is how you hear this  drumbeat. They want a new exemption, a new weaker standard, a new tax  break.   The last year has been a really good time to be a bank lobbyist.  After the crisis, we had created the Consumer Protection Bureau to  represent the interests of regular Americans who have to fight with  their bank or their credit card company. Now, in this administration,  the Consumer Bureau, unbelievably so, is run by a guy who believes-- publicly said it--it shouldn't even exist. The Consumer Bureau's new  protections are under attack.   One quick story. All Democrats, even some Republicans, agreed we  should protect consumers' right to take their bank to court. What is  more American than that; if you think your bank cheated you, that you  should be able to go to court.   Bank lobbyists, with a lot of allies on this side of the aisle,  convinced the Vice President of the United States to come to this very  Senate Chamber late at night--late at night here, at 9 or 10, the  public is not watching, but you can be damned sure the special  interests are alive and well and watching in their offices and making  calls and doing all that.   The Vice President of the United States came to this Senate Chamber  to break a tie, to cast a tie-breaking vote to vote against hard- working American families. Instead of protecting these families, the  Vice President and his allies in the Senate--they voted for Wells  Fargo, they voted for Equifax, they voted for Citigroup. The rule is  gone. That rule to ensure that consumers have their day in court if  their bank cheated them, that rule is gone, piece by piece by piece.   The watchdogs who are supposed to be protecting Main Street all come  to their jobs fresh from--surprise--Wall Street and K Street. The  President's Cabinet looks like an executive retreat for Wall Street  bankers. They have released blueprint after blueprint on how to  dismantle all the rules put in place after the crisis, and they are  putting their people in place to do it. They just rammed through  Congress a bill to give Wall Street an enormous tax break that will  cost American families $1.5 trillion, but it gives big bank CEO's a  huge raise.   That is 10,000 times more than what we spend at HUD every year to  protect kids from toxic levels. Back to ZIP Code 44105, the health  department of the city of Cleveland told me almost all those homes  built before World War II, 99 percent of them have levels of toxic lead  that will make children sick--99 percent of those homes. Yet we can do  this big tax cut and not take care of those families.   Not long ago, another bank lobbyist told us their plan: We don't want  a seat at the table, he said, we want the whole table--and they are  about to get it under the bill the Senate will consider this week.  Piece by piece, they tear these protections down. This bill gives them  the whole table. It leaves nothing for working families.   If you thought the Secretary of HUD's $31,000 he spent to buy that  fancy table for his dining room--31,000 taxpayer dollars--if you  thought that was a bad deal for taxpayers, wait until I tell you about  the billions and billions of dollars at risk that are packed into this  effort.   This bill puts Americans at risk of another bank bailout. The  Congressional Budget Office, the independent, nonpartisan scorekeeper,  confirmed yesterday that this bill would increase the probability of a  big bank failure and a financial crisis. It will add $671 million to  the deficit. The Washington Post said: ``Senate banking bill likely to  boost chances of bank bailouts.''   It is bad enough we are going to pass--after banks have been so  profitable the last decade, after they were bailed out by the public-- thank you very much--they have had a really, pretty darned good decade.  Then they got a big tax cut. Now they want this and a little cherry on  top. First, they get this bill, which is about to pass--which will be  really good for bankers--but then they get $671 million extra from  taxpayers. So, again, thank you very much, taxpayers, for taking care  of the banks. So we are going to weaken the rules, and we will pay Wall  Street for the privilege of doing it.   This bill weakens stress tests for all large banks, even Wall Street  megabanks that are designated as global, systemically important banks-- like JPMorgan Chase, $2.5 trillion in assets. Now, 2.5 trillion is  2,500 billion, and a billion is a thousand million. So $2.5 trillion-- that is hard to calculate, but that is a lot of money. So JPMorgan  Chase gets a break. They get their $2.5 trillion in assets. Bank of  America gets a break. They get $2.3 trillion in assets. Wells Fargo,  which can't stay out of trouble--every week there seems to be something  new--$1.9 trillion in assets. Citibank, $1.9 trillion in assets. These  banks--and the Wall Street Journal, hardly a paper hostile to business  or a bank that is really always close to Wall Street. Wall Street  Journal headline this morning: ``[Wall Street] Banks Get a Big Win in  Senate Rollback Bill.''    So don't let my colleagues--don't let anybody who supports this  bill--tell you this is all for the community banks. The community banks  get some things in this bill. I would love to support the community  banks and make this a bill about community banks, about credit unions,  even about the regional banks like the ones in my State that generally  do the right thing--Huntington and Fifth Third and KeyBank. But this  bill, this is the Wall Street Journal: ``Big Banks Get a Big Win in  Senate Rollback Bill.''   This is about those four banks I mentioned: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of  America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup. These banks hold 51 percent--more than  half--of all industry assets. They are a pretty darned big part of our  economy, and we are doing things for them. As they are profitable, as  their executives make maybe tens of millions of dollars, as they are  doing stock buybacks to make even more millions of dollars, we are  doing things for them. We are not dealing with infrastructure, we are  not dealing with the opioid crisis, we are doing nothing here about  guns, but we have time to do a lot for America's largest banks. With  this deregulation, these are banks whose collapse could cause ripples  across the world.   Together, the country's biggest banks took $239 billion in taxpayer  bailouts. So without the rigorous annual stress test that we put in  Dodd-Frank a decade ago and we are relaxing now, taxpayers could, once  again, be on the hook if too-big-to-fail banks collapse, and we don't  have the right tools in place to see it coming.   This is maybe even more unbelievable than the fact that this body has  fallen all over itself to help the biggest banks. This bill also  weakens the oversight for foreign megabanks operating in the United  States--the same banks that repeatedly violate U.S. laws. Let's  [[Page S1352]]  run through the rap sheets of some of these banks.   Deutsche Bank, a big German bank, manipulated the benchmark interest  rates used to set mortgages. It is also known as the only large bank in  the world that will finance the President's businesses.   Santander, a Spanish bank, illegally repossessed cars from members of  the military who were serving our country overseas. So we are going to  give a break to a Spanish bank that repossessed the cars of men and  women at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and others when they were  serving overseas. Santander repossessed their cars, a Spanish bank, and  we are going to deregulate and make them more profitable with less  accountability.   Barclays, a British bank, manipulated electric energy prices. If you  live on the West Coast--I don't; my constituents weren't affected--but  a whole lot of people were as they manipulated energy prices.   Credit Suisse and UBS, two Switzerland banks--one of them illegally  did business with Iran. We have tried to tighten the sanctions on Iran  to get Iran to behave better so they don't continue to harass--or  worse--Israel and all the threats they make. We are going to help a  bank that did business with Iran, and UBS sold toxic mortgage-backed  securities.   It didn't have to be this way. I tried for months to work with the  chairman of the committee--and I like Senator Crapo a lot. We work  together well. I tried for months to work in a commonsense package of  reforms aimed at lifting up community banks and credit unions. That is  what we ought to do. That is what we could do. That is what we still  could do. These are the local financial institutions that fuel home  ownership and small businesses. I know a lot of them. They come to see  me when they are in Washington. I see them in their communities. I see  them in Sycamore, Columbus, and Mansfield, and all over the State.  These are not the people who caused the meltdown 10 years ago. These  are the ones who got dragged down when big banks crashed the economy. I  support relief to those banks and regional banks that do things right  and play by the rules. I want to do more to help average Americans who  have to cope with unfair tricks and traps, but that is not what this  bill does. That is how it started out. That is what Wall Street wants  you to think; this is a bill for the community banks.   Don't forget, they said that about the tax cut bill: It is a tax cut  for the middle class. Well, 81 percent of the benefits of the tax cut  go to the richest 1 percent. So don't always believe what they say when  they talk about this.    This was a false choice. Why should we have to roll back rules for  the largest banks in Switzerland to help out community banks or credit  unions in Ohio? Of course we shouldn't. It has been a false choice. We  could pass a bill today that helps those local banks invest more in  their communities while keeping in place strict rules for Wall Street  megabanks, but Wall Street and Republicans don't want to do that. They  want to use the little guys, the community banks we all want to help.  They want to use the little guys to extract something for the big guys.  It is the oldest trick in the book around here.   We are going to cut taxes for the middle class. Well, really we are  kind of hoping we can give big tax breaks to the richest 1 percent. We  are going to help the community banks, but really we are hoping--we  know we are going to help Wall Street.   This city, Washington, this government, this Senate, this Senate  Banking Committee are all suffering from collective amnesia. They just  forgot what happened 10 years ago. Maybe it is convenient they don't  want to remember what happened. Thankfully, the IMF, the International  Monetary Fund--an agency of international financial experts--has done  us a favor, to help jog memories. They have cataloged 300 years of  history of bank deregulation efforts all across the globe. Do you know  what they found? We deregulate, the economy explodes. We put in  protections, the economy gets better. We deregulate again, the economy  explodes. We put in protections, the economy gets better. We deregulate  again--wash, rinse, repeat.   We can do better. We owe it to the people we serve to do better. The  Senate owes it to 176,000 kids in Ohio and other kids across the  country whose lives and education were disrupted by the foreclosure  crisis. Think how many children lived in homes when their parents were  foreclosed on or their parents were evicted, and everything in their  lives turned upside down. We don't care about them. We are going to  forget about them, this collective amnesia. We are going to forget  about them because we want to help the big banks get bigger and bigger  and bigger. Is that what we are going to do? We owe it to the millions  of people whose retirements were wiped out. Millions of Americans lost  big chunks of their retirement, but we bailed out the big banks at the  same time. We owe it to the students who graduated in the great  recession and may have low earnings for the rest of their lives.   The watchdogs who understand these markets are trying to warn us.  Paul Volcker, former Chair of the Federal Reserve, has cautioned us  about this bill. He was the Fed Chair for a Democrat and a Republican  President. Sheila Bair, who helped us put protections in place after  the crisis, is a Republican warning us about this bill. Tom Hoenig, the  current Vice Chair at the FDIC, selected to that position by  Republicans, has told us this bill is harmful. Barney Frank, as in  Dodd-Frank, has said he would vote no if he were here. Former member of  the Federal Reserve Dan Tarullo, who used to do the bank regulation  with the Federal Reserve, has outlined a long series of concerns. Sarah  Bloom Raskin, Antonio Weiss, Gary Gensler, law professors, fair housing  advocates, big bank experts, people who provide legal services across  this country who deal with foreclosures and civil rights groups are  telling us we can't go down that path again.   We know what happens next. It is hubris to think we can gut the rules  on these banks again but avoid the next crisis. If you strip the rules  away from the big banks and you turn your back as regulators on  misfeasance and malfeasance, that collective amnesia--we are going to  pay for it, and we know we are.   There are so many important things we should be doing here instead.  We should be addressing the fact--and the Presiding Officer and I have  been working on this bill--that workers and retirees in Ohio and across  the country might have their pensions they have spent a lifetime  earning slashed in half if Congress doesn't act. We can be doing that.  We could be addressing the fact that 400,000 Ohioans pay more than half  their income each month on rent to keep a roof over their head. We  could be creating jobs. We could be attacking the opioid epidemic. We  could be fighting against high drug prices. We could be investing in  our crumbling roads and bridges. Instead, guess what. We are here  helping the big banks. Everybody is willing to work full time to help  Wall Street.   It is a question of whose side are we on? Are we on the side of  megabank lobbyists or are we on the side of American taxpayers and  homeowners and students and workers?   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Reilly Steel,  a fellow with the Banking Committee, be granted floor privileges during  the pendency of S. 2155.
