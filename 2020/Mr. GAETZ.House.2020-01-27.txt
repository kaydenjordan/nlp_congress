 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to honor and remember the life  of one of northwest Florida's great public servants, my friend and one  of my mentors, Mayor Randall Wise.  [[Page H557]]    Mayor Randall Wise was born in 1930 in Niceville, Florida, and spent  his entire life as a dedicated servant to our town. He began his career  in service in the 1950s as a member of the city council.   In 1971, he was appointed to the position of mayor, and to the day of  his death, he served as mayor. He was one of the longest serving public  officials in America, and he was the longest serving mayor in the State  of Florida. His leadership reverberated throughout many projects in our  community, including a senior center, a library, and more.   Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the United States Congress, I recognize  this remarkable man for his selfless service to our community, his  State, and our Nation. I am grateful for his lasting contributions to  our town.                            ____________________
