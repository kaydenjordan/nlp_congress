 Mr. President, I strongly support the gentleman's  amendment. In fact, the Biden administration is in the midst of trying  to find out what is the greatest technological ability to create  internet access for the people of Cuba and limiting the ability of the  regime to jam that internet access, and I hope that we will see this  shortly.   This reserve fund would be in good order and in line with what the  administration is seeking to do as well.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3097     Mr. President, the U.S. Government already has laws in  place to prevent U.S. taxpayer dollars from going to terrorist  organizations and laws that specifically prevent funds from going to  Hamas and Palestinian Jihad.   So this is purely a messaging amendment that does absolutely nothing  in practice, but it is a message we can all get behind. And because  Democrats stand against terrorist organizations that threaten innocent  civilians in Israel and anywhere else in the world, we support the  amendment, and we would urge the Senator to take a voice vote.                          Vote on Amendment No. 3383     Madam President, it is past 3 a.m., and we are dealing  with another messaging amendment. Like the junior Senator from Alaska,  we all oppose terrorism; we condemn state sponsors of it. But this  amendment goes well beyond that and is drafted so broadly, whether  intentionally or not, that it signals a cutoff of funding to every  international organization--every single one--including the United  Nations because some members are bad actors.   Now, our Republican colleagues are well aware that adversaries such  as China are expanding their influence at some of the most important  international organizations. They are calling the shots because we are  not there. This amendment would cede the field to the Chinese so we can  sit on the sidelines and watch them make the rules.   When Israel is wrongly signaled out at the U.N. Human Rights  Commission, we will not be there to defend her. And when international  standards are being created for high-tech issues, we will not lead the  world, as we should. That is why this amendment should be defeated.    Mr. President, I know the hour is late, but we have  nearly 30 highly qualified Foreign Affairs and Development nominees who  are languishing on the Senate floor. We have to confirm these nominees  to fully equip the United States to pursue our foreign policy  objectives, and I will be asking unanimous consent to confirm each one.   My distinguished colleague from Connecticut, Senator Murphy, a member  of the committee, is here to join with me in this effort. I know the  Presiding Officer is also a distinguished member of the committee.   In the nearly 30 years that I have been working on foreign policy, we  have never faced such a confluence of global challenges: a once-in-a- century global pandemic; climate change threatening stability, health,  and safety across the world; fueling displacement and resource-driven  conflicts; great power competition from an increasingly emboldened  China and Russia.   We have the tools to confront these challenges; to promote American  values and interests around the world to advance the safety, health,  and economic well-being of all Americans. But we cannot do that when we  do not have empowered diplomats and development professionals in place  to do so.   So I call on this body to confirm these nominees--all of whom the  Foreign Relations Committee has moved with bipartisan support--to put  the United States in the best position to advance our foreign policy,  development, and national security priorities.   I am calling for confirmation of all of these nominees: those up for  Ambassadorships, senior State Department, and USAID positions. We need  them in place.   Now, the Trump administration had its first Ambassador confirmed on  day 62 of the Trump Presidency. The Obama administration had its first  Ambassador confirmed at day 73. The George W. Bush administration had  its first Ambassador confirmed at day 75. For the Clinton  administration, it was day 75. For the George H. W. Bush  administration, it was day 83.   We are now more than 200 days into the Biden administration, and as  of this moment, there is not a single confirmed State Department  country Ambassador--not one. And going back four administrations, there  is a precedent of moving a package of nominees before the August  recess.   Under George W. Bush, the Senate confirmed a package of 81 nominees.  During the Obama administration, the Senate confirmed a package of 104  nominees. And during the Trump administration, we confirmed a package  of 75 nominees.   We should be ashamed of holding the record for the longest delay in  fully equipping the State Department and USAID to pursue the foreign  policy, development, and national security interests of the United  States.   Now, some Members of this body call on one hand for assertive  American leadership on the global stage, and, at the same time, they  hold up these critical positions. Many of these nominees are career  diplomats, public servants who have dedicated their lives to advancing  U.S. interests. They have served under the Trump administration in the  same way they will serve in the Biden administration: on behalf of the  American people.   Many of my colleagues are readily focused on effectively confronting  Chinese malign influence. Well, a fundamentally critical element of  confronting China is empowered leadership in our diplomatic corps,  across the world. So let me be clear. Holding up diplomats to posts  across Africa and the Western Hemisphere is effectively ceding  influence to China and actively undermining U.S. national security  interests.   I recently heard an anecdote from a diplomat in Cameroon. When he  travels outside the capital city, Cameroonians will greet him with a  ``ni hao,'' assuming that if he isn't Cameroonian, he must be Chinese.   Meanwhile, we haven't had an American Ambassador in Cameroon in more  than a year, and the Foreign Relations Committee approved a career  diplomat for the post by voice vote nearly a month ago. What could  possibly be the rationale for holding him up?  [[Page S6255]]    Lastly, looking at the Department itself, critical leadership  positions remain held up.   Now, I know many of my colleagues have dedicated a significant amount  of their time over the past few years to combating the flow of fentanyl  into the United States, but here we have a hold on a career Foreign  Service officer nominated to be Assistant Secretary for International  Narcotics and Law Enforcement, who would be leading the Department's  efforts to combat the flow of fentanyl.   So which one do you want? The American people deserve better than  this.   Now, I know we are all tired of being here, and I want to salute and  thank the different--the reading clerks, the Parliamentarian, the  Democrat and Republican staff who are still here, but we feel compelled  to go through and ask UC for each of these nominees. They all deserve  to be confirmed tonight. So let me start off.   I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session  to consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 233, Larry Edward  Andre, Jr., of Texas, a Career Member of the Senior Foreign Service, to  be Ambassador of the United States to Somalia; that the nomination be  confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon  the table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions  be in order to the nomination; that the President be immediately  notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative  session.    Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I  will be brief for the sake of everybody here. There is a lot more to be  said. But, look, first of all, this legislation was just introduced  today--today.   It has not been brought before the committee. It has not had a full  vetting. And it is not quite fair to say that it is exactly the same.  It isn't. I was just looking through it.   Secondly, I know that the Senator believes that he can dictate to the  President of the United States, duly elected by the American people,  what the foreign policy should be. I believe we should have a role in  foreign policy. I share that with the Senator. But you can't say: If it  passes the Senate, if it passes the House, signed by the President,  then I will release my hold.   I mean, I guess that would be nice if the Senator could accomplish it  for his goals, but it is not the way the system ultimately works.   And I would just say President Trump, for the longest period of time,  did not issue the sanctions that were necessary because he was so cozy  with Vladimir Putin, and the result was that the pipeline was almost  finished by the time President Biden came to office. And had he done  what the Senator wishes, we wouldn't be in this position today.   So for all of those reasons, I object to the Senator's unanimous  consent request.    Mr. President, one thing that is demonstrably true is  that Donald Trump did nothing as it relates toward this pipeline, and  there wasn't much effort to try to get them to stop the pipeline at the  time.   And while I disagreed with President Trump on a whole host of foreign  policy issues, I did not hold up all his nominees just to get my view  to be the order of the day.                Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar    Mr. President, therefore, I ask that it be in order to make the same  request that I made previously with respect to Executive Calendar No.  234, Elizabeth Moore Aubin, a Career Member of the Senior Foreign  Service, to be Ambassador of the United States to Algeria.    Mr. President, I would just simply say that the Senator  from Texas did not hold up any of the nominees of President Trump as it  relates to this.   I ask that it be in order to make the same request with respect to  Executive Calendar No. 235, Maria E. Brewer, a Career Member of the  Senior Foreign Service, to be Ambassador of the United States to the  Kingdom of Lesotho.    Mr. President, I ask that it be in order to make the  same request with respect to Executive Calendar, No. 236, Christopher  John Lamora, a Career Member of the Senior Foreign Service, to be  Ambassador of the United States to Cameroon.    Mr. President, I ask that it be in order to make the  same request with respect to Executive Calendar No. 237, Tulinabo S.  Mushingi, a Career Member of the Senior Foreign Service, to be  Ambassador of the United States to Angola and to serve concurrently as  the Ambassador to the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe.    Mr. President, I ask that it be in order to make the  same request with respect to Executive Calendar No. 238, Eugene S.  Young, a Career Member of the Senior Foreign Service, to be Ambassador  of the United States to the Republic of Congo.    Mr. President, I ask that it be in order to make the  same request with respect to Executive Calendar No. 239, Michele Jeanne  Sison, a Career Member of the Senior Foreign Service, to be Assistant  Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs.    Mr. President, here is one where it is a monumental  mistake to not permit this person to be confirmed when we want to stop  fentanyl from coming into our country.   I ask that it be in order to make the same request with respect to  Executive Calendar No. 240, Todd D. Robinson, of New Jersey, a Career  Member of the Senior Foreign Service, to be Assistant Secretary of  State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs.    Mr. President, I ask that it be in order to make the  same request with respect to Executive Calendar No. 241, Daniel J.  Kritenbrink, a Career Member of the Senior Foreign Service, to be the  Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific affairs.    Mr. President, I ask that it be in order to make the  same request with respect to Executive Calendar No. 317, Marc Evans  Knapper, a Career Member of the Senior Foreign Service, to be  Ambassador of the United States to Vietnam; and that the Senator from  Texas' remarks, which he has made repeatedly, be inserted each and  every time after the motion that I have made.    Mr. President, now is here one where we heard a lot  even during the debate we just had about the United Nations and the  need for reform. Well, here is an opportunity. I ask that it be in  order to make the same request with respect to Executive Calendar No.  318, Christopher P. Lu, to be Representative of the United States of  America to the United Nations for U.N. Management and Reform, with the  rank of Ambassador.    Mr. President, I ask that it be in order to make the  same request with respect to Executive Calendar No. 319, Christopher P.  Lu, to be an Alternate Representative of the United States of America  to the General Assembly of the United Nations.    Mr. President, I ask that it be in order to make the  same request with respect to Executive Calendar No. 320, Rufus Gifford,  to be Chief of Protocol, with the rank of Ambassador.    Mr. President, now, here is a generational mistake if  we do not confirm the next person. We are in the midst in Latin America  and the Caribbean of turmoil all around. We have the challenges of  Venezuela, the Cuban people crying out for change, the situation in  Haiti after the assassination, Nicaragua becoming a new dictatorship.  We need to have the Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere  be out there helping us in the hemisphere.   So I ask that it be in order to make the same request with respect to  Executive Calendar No. 322, Brian A. Nichols, a Career Member of the  Senior Foreign Service, to be Assistant Secretary of State for Western  Hemisphere Affairs.    Mr. President, I don't get to serve on every committee,  and I don't have the questions for the record of every committee  hearing. Eventually, they get printed, and they are available to all  Senators. But the suggestion that the Senator is being denied something  when he is not a member of the committee is a unique one, to say the  least. But nonetheless, I think there would have been another objection  even if his interests were answered.   I ask that it be in order to make the same request with respect to  Executive Calendar No. 323, Marcela Escobari, to be an Assistant  Administrator of the United States Agency for International  Development.    Mr. President, I ask that it be in order to make the  same request with respect to Executive Calendar No. 324, Monica P.  Medina, to be the Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans and  International Environmental and Scientific Affairs.    Mr. President, before I yield, finally, to my colleague  from Connecticut, a member of the committee, I just want to say that in  30 years of doing foreign policy between the House and the Senate,  sitting on both the House and Senate Foreign Relations Committee, God  forbid that something happens in one of these countries or in these  regions where we do not have a confirmed Ambassador, Assistant  Secretary of State, or Development Official to promote our interests,  to respond to it, to be able to deal with it. I wouldn't want to be the  Senator who held up that person when that happens at some point. I  wouldn't want to be the Senator who held up that person when that  happens at some point in the world.    I yield to the Senator from Connecticut.                Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the accelerating  political crisis in Nicaragua and the Ortega regime's anti-democratic  efforts to hold illegitimate elections in November.   On November 7, Daniel Ortega will attempt to deny the Nicaraguan  people their most basic right: the right to choose their country's  leaders in free and fair elections. This grave restriction on basic  democratic freedoms confirms that the Ortega regime is consolidating  the Western Hemisphere's third dictatorship. In the lead up to these  elections and in response to unrestrained assaults against democracy,  the U.S. Senate unanimously passed my legislation entitled the  ``Reinforcing Nicaragua's Adherence to Conditions for Electoral Reform  (RENACER) Act.'' This bipartisan legislation, taken together with the  Biden administration's additional imposition of visa restrictions  against individuals affiliated with the regime, demonstrates the United  States is firmly committed to the restoration of democracy to  Nicaragua.   The legislation is also consistent with our commitments to promote  and defend democracy in the Americas. As the 20th anniversary of the  Inter-American Democratic Charter approaches next month, we must  recognize that a growing trend of deeply flawed and fraudulent  electoral processes jeopardizes regional consensus in support of free,  fair, and transparent elections across the Americas. Whether in  Nicaragua in 2016, Honduras in 2017, Bolivia in 2019, Guyana in 2020,  or Venezuela in 2017, 2018, and 2020, democratic elections are under  attack by autocrats and populists alike. Regretfully, the Ortega regime  is taking steps to continue this trend.   Today, Daniel Ortega and Rosario Murillo hold more than 140 political  prisoners, including eight opposition candidates for President and Vice  President. These individuals represent a broad political spectrum and  include Arturo Cruz, Felix Maradiaga, Juan Sebastian Chamorro, Medardo  Mairena, and Miguel Mora. Three more contenders, Berenice Quezada,  Cristiana Chamorro, and Noel Vidaurre, are under house arrest.   On July 27, the regime incarcerated the country's 76-year-old former  Minister of Foreign Affairs, Francisco Aguirre Sacasa, under bogus  charges of treason and without regard for his health or well-being. The  regime is holding Sacasa and many others at El Chipote detention  center: a facility infamous for acts of torture and ill-treatment,  according to the United Nations Human Rights Commission. The regime  continues to deny prisoners due process, access to family contact, and  legal counsel. Essentially, many of them have been disappeared.   On Friday, Ortega cancelled the registration of the last remaining  opposition political party that was positioned to participate in the  November elections, Ciudadanos por la Libertad--Citizens for Freedom.  The regime went as far as to strip the head of that party of her  Nicaraguan citizenship. These are not actions that would be tolerated  in any democratic system in the world; these are the actions of a tin- pot dictator.   The events since June are the culmination of the Ortega regime's  years-long process to dismantle democracy in Nicaragua. When  Nicaraguans took to the streets to protest their living conditions in  2018, the regime responded with a brutal campaign of violence. Over 330  protesters were killed. Today, the number of Nicaraguans fleeing the  country is on the rise, increasing the complexity and reach of the  challenge.   The Ortega-Murillo regime's authoritarian power grab poses a direct  challenge to U.S. national security and regional stability. I am proud  to have authored the RENACER Act and to lead the bipartisan, bicameral  effort to send a clear message to Daniel Ortega and Rosario Murillo:  Reverse course now and the international community stands ready to  support the restoration of democracy; or continue down the current path  and face consequences.   The RENACER Act requires the United States, working with our partners  in the European Union, Canada, and Latin America and the Caribbean, to  align our diplomatic efforts and sanctions tools to push for one goal,  democratic elections. The bill requires increased intelligence  reporting on the regime's corruption and its malign partnership with  Russia. This legislation will provide for better documentation of human  rights violations and guarantee that the regime and its enablers are  held accountable.   The law further calls for the President to review Nicaragua's  participation in the Central America Free Trade Agreement--CAFTA. The  United States would never sign a free trade agreement with Belarus  given the authoritarian conditions that exist in the country. And the  United States should not turn a blind eye if one of our free trade  partners becomes the Belarus of Central America.   In closing, let there be no doubts--the United States will continue  to support defenders of democracy in Nicaragua, condemn violence and  intimidation, and hold accountable the Ortega regime and those who  support it. If Daniel Ortega assumes a fourth consecutive term via sham  elections, he will rule without a shred of legitimacy.   I urge my colleagues in the House of Representatives to pass the  RENACER Act so that we can speak with a single voice and make it clear  that Daniel Ortega's paranoia of losing at the ballot box is no excuse  for his systematic  [[Page S6268]]  dismantling of Nicaragua's democratic system.                            ____________________
