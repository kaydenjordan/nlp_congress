 Madam Speaker, I cannot believe that this week, under  the leadership of my colleagues on the Democrat side, under Speaker  Pelosi, we are actually going to vote on a resolution condemning people  for using the place of origin to distinguish this novel virus. We are  going to use our time and the formal declaration of this great body to  do that instead of condemning the lawlessness and the violence that is  ravaging our once-great American cities.   I think that is unacceptable by all standards. I think we have plenty  of opportunity to stand with our law enforcement officers who risk  their lives, the law-abiding citizens who are having their rights  trampled, and say no more.   I have the David Dorn Act and the Patrick Underwood Act. Both men  died, being murdered in cold blood by these violent protesters. This  would increase penalties and accountability for the folks who consider  even thinking about doing that in the future.   We also have a resolution to condemn this lawlessness. I hope my  colleagues can join me on that.                            ____________________
