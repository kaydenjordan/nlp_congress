 I thank the gentleman for yielding, Mr. Chairman.   I come here to the House floor as the son, grandson, and great- grandson of farmers. I grew up working on a farm in rural Texas, and I  strongly oppose Federal subsidies to agriculture in general and the  sugar program in particular.   Under the Federal sugar program, which dates back to the New Deal,  domestic sugar prices are propped up via a Byzantine system of  marketing, allotments, import quotas, price supports, and a loan  guarantee program so bad it would make a Soviet commissar blush.   This may be a sweet deal for sugar producers, but it is not a sweet  deal for the auto mechanic in Mesquite, Texas; the store clerk in  Mineola, Texas; or the teacher in Garland, Texas, that I represent in  the Fifth District. Where is their government subsidy program?  [[Page H4176]]    This is antijob. It is a food tax. It is income redistribution at its  worst. And it is not commensurate with any free market principle I  know.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all Members to support the amendment.
