 Mr. Speaker, for generations, Maine families have  enjoyed the great outdoors. That means hunting, fishing, camping, and  hiking. That is part of who we are as a people. That is part of our way  of life.   Part of that way of life is responsibly and lawfully owning firearms.  We are comfortable with them. We have been for generations.   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Hudson's bill, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act  of 2017, is a commonsense fix to a patchwork of State laws that will  confuse, and do confuse, law-abiding Americans who have valid concealed  carry permits issued by their own States when they want to travel to or  through other States that have different concealed carry laws.   I want to make this very clear: H.R. 38 does not allow travel as long  as the holder of a concealed carry license does not obey the laws of  the States that he or she is traveling to. I read directly, Mr.  Speaker, from the statute: ``This bill shall not be construed to  supersede or limit the laws of any State.''   So the other side of the aisle just needs to make sure they get this  exactly right, because they have not been correct on this fact.   Mr. Speaker, Mr. Hudson's bill actually additionally strengthens  existing regulations by requiring Federal Government agencies to  promptly and accurately require a reporting to the FBI someone who is  mentally ill, someone who has committed a serious crime, or someone who  is in the country illegally and should not have a firearm.   This bill is a commonsense bill that will help law-abiding Americans  enjoy their Second Amendment right, their outdoor sporting activities,  and help keep our families safer.
