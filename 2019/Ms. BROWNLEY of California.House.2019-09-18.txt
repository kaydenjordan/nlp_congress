 Mr. Speaker, recently, it was reported  that a seventh person has died from a vaping-related illness in the  United States.   In response, the CDC recently announced that it has activated its  emergency operations center to investigate what is quickly becoming a  public health crisis. It is becoming abundantly clear that e-cigarettes  are causing harmful health impacts among both teens, approximately 2.4  million students, and adults who use them.   While more research is needed, I believe this public health emergency  requires swift action by Congress to prevent the marketing of these  products to young people. That is why I have introduced the Stop Vaping  Ads Act, which will close the loophole in current law and would ban e- cigarette advertisements on broadcast media.   I invite my colleagues to join me in support of this commonsense bill  that will help curb the onslaught of harmful and dangerous e-cigarette  ads.                            ____________________
