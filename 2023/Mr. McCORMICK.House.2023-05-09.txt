 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 75th  anniversary of the founding of the State of Israel.   Seventy-five years ago, 11 minutes after David Ben Gurion announced  the creation of the new Jewish state, President Harry Truman became the  first world leader to recognize Israel. Our nations have been friends  and partners ever since.   The people of Israel have won against overwhelming odds and repelled  many attacks over the decades. They have not merely survived; they have  created a free and prosperous society, becoming our most valued ally in  the region.   What they have accomplished is nothing short of miraculous. They have  revived a dead language and rejuvenated agriculture, technology, and  prosperity. No matter what acts of terror or threats they face, Israel  will always have the right to self-defense and self-determination.   I congratulate her people for this anniversary of independence in  their historic homeland, and pray that they may be blessed with  strength, peace, and unity for generations to come.
