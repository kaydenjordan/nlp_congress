 Mr. Chairman, since our founding, and as Ronald Reagan  emphasized regularly, America has stood as a shining city upon a hill  whose beacon light guides freedom-loving people everywhere. Today we  have an opportunity to shine a little brighter.   As we continue our battle to defeat terrorism, the Islamic Republic  of Iran remains dangerously corrupt. While the average Iranian earns a  mere $15,000 a year, corrupt, top political and military leaders  control an estimated one-third of the nation's total economy. These  same leaders are, more often than not, the same ones who repeatedly  provide support for acts of terrorism in the Middle East and continue  to sponsor terrorist groups around the world.   Unfortunately, the Iranian Government continues to tolerate this  corruption, which is why the State Department has named Iran as a  country of primary concern for money laundering and it continues to be  listed as a state sponsor of terrorism.   These officials who perpetuate such destructive and destabilizing  behavior should and need to be exposed.   Today, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 1638, the Iranian  Leadership Asset Transparency Act. This bill will require a list of the  known assets of senior Iranian officials to be made publicly available  in all three of Iran's major languages. Specifically, the U.S. Treasury  Secretary will submit a report to Congress on the assets held by Iran's  most senior political, military, and business leaders and on the  probable sources and uses of the assets.                                time  1530    This report will serve as yet another tool in the toolbox of  businesses and financial institutions, both foreign and domestic, to  better comply with existing sanction regimes and international  financial restrictions.   It will provide clarity and certainty for companies when determining  the legitimacy of their business partners if they decide that doing  business with Iran is in their interest.   Moreover, with this information, with better knowledge of where their  money is going, Iranians who wish to invest not in terrorism or in  corruption, but in freedom, can.   Today, we can help the freedom-loving people of Iran. We can help  shine a light on Iran's corruption, and America can continue to be a  shining city on a hill.   I appreciate the work of my colleague from Maine (Mr. Poliquin),  [[Page H9872]]  whom I am proud to serve with on the Terrorism and Illicit Finance  Subcommittee. I thank Chairman Hensarling and Monetary Policy and Trade  Subcommittee Chairman Barr for moving such an important bill through  the committee and to the floor today. I urge all of my colleagues to  vote in support of H.R. 1638.
