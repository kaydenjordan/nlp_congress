 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the positive impact  that international automakers' investments have made in the United  States and, specifically, in my home State of Indiana.   Today, international automakers operate 30 manufacturing facilities  across 12 States, including 3 in Indiana, and build more than 60  different vehicle models across the country.   Eleven models are produced in my home State, including the Subaru  Ascent, Impreza, Legacy, and Outback, which are all built in Lafayette,  in our Fourth Congressional District.   In addition to Subaru, Indiana is also home to Honda Manufacturing of  Indiana and Toyota Motor Manufacturing Indiana.   Overall, international automakers in Indiana have directly employed  more than 13,000 Hoosiers and helped support more than 126,000 local  jobs via direct and indirect employment, produced over 1 million  vehicles in 2018, and invested $7.5 billion in our State's economy.   For 50 years and counting, international automakers have thrived in  this country, thanks to an economy that welcomes investment,  competition, and innovation.   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the important role of  international automakers in the United States.                            ____________________
