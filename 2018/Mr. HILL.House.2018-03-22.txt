 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to pay tribute to Arkansas native  Rudy Johnson. Former Private Rudy Johnson will be laid to rest at the  Arkansas State Veterans Cemetery in North Little Rock this Friday, 73  years after he was killed in action during World War II.   Private Johnson was drafted into the Army in 1943 and was assigned to  the 93nd Division, nicknamed the Buffalo Soldiers and the only African- American division to see combat in Europe during World War II.   Rudy was stationed in northern Italy, fighting against German forces  when his unit reported that he was killed in action in 1945 at the age  of 20. Private Johnson's remains were finally identified after DNA  analysis in 2016, and he was flown home this week to rest where his  journey began.   Rudy's sacrifice for Arkansas and America will never be forgotten,  and I join his family and all Arkansans in welcoming him back home for  his final rest.                            ____________________
