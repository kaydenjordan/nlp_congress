 Mr. Speaker, The Wall Street Journal  last week reported that the ``Baghdad Blast Walls Come Down.'' It  explained that ``the Iraqi Government marked the first anniversary of  the Islamic State's defeat Monday by reopening parts of Baghdad's Green  Zone.'' Iraqi forces, along with support from the U.S.-led alliance,  reclaimed the last of Islamic State territory last December.   The article notes that ``the changes at the Green Zone reflect  declining violence across Iraq that is particularly tangible in  Baghdad, and further states that: ``Over 1,000 streets in Baghdad have  been reopened during the past 2 years, with 70,000 segments of concrete  blast wall removed. The number of civilians killed across Iraq by  terrorism, violence, and armed conflict in November fell to its lowest  level in 6 years, according to the United Nations.''   As a grateful dad who has had two of my four military sons serve in  Iraq, I am particularly happy for the Iraqi people.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may we never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
