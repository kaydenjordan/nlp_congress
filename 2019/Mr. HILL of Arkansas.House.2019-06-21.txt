 Madam Chair, I thank my good friend from Texas  for yielding me this time.   Madam Chairwoman, my amendment in this en bloc package is very  simple. It transfers $1.5 million from the general administration  account to the homeless assistance programs and suicide prevention  outreach.   According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, 40,000  veterans are homeless in any given night in this great country. In  Arkansas, we have coordinated robust efforts in Little Rock to combat  homelessness, but still 250 veterans can experience homelessness on any  given day.   I have got three veterans on my constituent team. They spend time in  our shelters every month helping vets. Our vets deserve that extra  touch. One of those safe places is St. Francis House, a nonprofit in  Little Rock that has done exceptional work to help our veterans  experiencing homelessness. For over 30 years, they have been providing  transitional housing for homeless veterans.   Our veterans put their lives on the line to protect our freedoms and  safety, and in return, we need to do everything we can to ensure they  get the proper attention and care that they deserve. We must all work  together to continue to move forward, addressing this issue that  plagues too many of our veterans across the country and help those  suffering from the plague of homelessness.   Madam Chair, I urge passage of my amendment.
