 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr.  Pat Godbey, who was sworn in as the president of the American College  of Pathologists on September 18.   The college's 36th president, Dr. Godbey has been active with the  organization for the last 25 years, serving on numerous committees and  councils. His election is an extraordinary honor, with the College of  American Pathologists being the world's largest association of board- certified pathologists.   As president, Dr. Godbey will be tasked with continuing their  commitment to creating accountable, high-quality, and cost-effective  patient care.   I know that he is up to the task. He has already served a 2-year term  as president and maintains an exceptional track record as director of  the Southeast Georgia Health System in the First Congressional District  of Georgia.   Congratulations on your election, Dr. Godbey. Keep up the good work.                            ____________________
