 Madam President and fellow Senators, I rise today to join  the chorus of my colleagues that are urging that Tracy Stone-Manning  not be confirmed and, indeed, not even be discharged from the committee  that voted to not send her to the floor for confirmation.   First of all, it is amazing to me that someone with this background  has been appointed to this position. Now, I understand she has held  some positions in the State of Montana for politicians there, and I  don't comment on that. That is up to them, who they want the hire to do  that.   In Idaho, that has a very, very significant number of acres of BLM  ground, we have a different view of how our public resources should be  protected and be administered, and this appointee in no way reflects  the values we have.   This woman is an ecoterrorist. She participated in a conspiracy to  murder people who work in the timber industry for a living. She is a  perjurer, very recently. And she is someone who is supposed to put out  fires and, as late as 2020, has made very disqualifying statements  regarding her desire to do that and, indeed, commitment to do that.   Let's start with the ecoterrorist charge. I want to go a little bit  further than what my colleague who just spoke did about using a chain  saw to tear down--or to take down a tree in the forest.   Let me explain to you how this works. The prop that he held up was a  spike that ecoterrorists put in trees. There is one reason to put a  spike in a tree--one reason and one reason only--and that is to kill  and to maim the people who harvest that tree.   These are innocent people who are involved in the timber business.  They are my friends. They are my neighbors. We have lots of them in  Idaho, and they work in a dangerous industry anyway. But for someone to  go out and intentionally put these spikes in the trees, as the Senator  spoke before me, Senator Marshall mentioned, there can be an injury in  the forest when you are actually cutting the tree with a chain saw.   But that isn't the main difficulty with this. The main difficulty is  when it hits the mill. They cut these logs up into mill-sized pieces  and then run them through the mill, which is cut either with a circular  saw or band saw into boards. And when that happens, the log and saw  move very quickly through the log and cut up the wood into timber,  which is not a problem unless there is a spike in the way. If there is  a spike in the way, somebody in that mill will be badly injured and/or  killed.   When that saw hits the spike, the saw shatters, the spike shatters,  and it sends shrapnel to everybody who is standing within the vicinity.  It has happened. It is documented. And it is ugly.   So when ecoterrorists do this, this is not a Sunday school prank.  This is an act knowingly, willfully, intentionally with a black and  abandoned heart committed in order to murder someone who works in the  timber industry. This is wrong.   The person that we are voting on today participated in a conspiracy  to do just that. Indeed, she wrote a letter. She claims she just typed  it. Originally, she said it was handed to her by some person and asked  to type. We now find out, of course, that this was a letter that was  composed by a number of people, not the least of which was a gentleman  that she lived with; but she is the one who put this together and sent  it to the Federal Government as part of this act of conspiring, to take  the lives of innocent people in the forest.   She says she edited the letter. But if she did, then it is what it is  in front of us. She said she typed this and sent it to the Forest  Service.   She said: This letter is being sent to you to notify that the Post  Office sale in Idaho has been spiked heavily. The project required that  11 of us spend 9 days in God-awful weather conditions spiking trees. We  unloaded a total of 500 pounds of spikes, measuring 8 to 10 inches, et  cetera, et cetera.   Well, if she edited this letter, then she properly stated what her  participation was in all of this. And there is no question that she  admits that she prepared this letter and sent it to the Forest Service.   Today, in Idaho, those spikes remain in the trees. We don't know when  one of those logs is going to be cut and going to cause damage,  possibly the loss of life, but certainly the maiming of people who  attempt to process that log into usable lumber. She says they put 500  pounds total of spikes in those trees.   This is a person whom the administration has chosen to administer the  largest chunk of Federal land in the United States of America, possibly  in the world. She is going to manage these after she committed this act  of ecoterrorism and participated in this conspiracy.   Now, you say: Why isn't she in prison? Well, her coconspirators went  to prison because she testified against them. She was found out. The  investigators determined what her participation was in the conspiracy.  She hired an attorney, and the attorney negotiated a deal where she  would rat on the fellow conspirators and she did so and thereby avoided  going to prison.   So that is what happened in her prior history. It is important to  know those things because somewhere down in the recesses of her heart  and her soul, she was prepared to participate in a conspiracy that  would cause the death and the injury of innocent forest workers.  [[Page S5087]]    Now, more recently than that, she has made statements that certainly  call into considerable question how she will be able to do her job. For  those of you who don't live in the Western States, as I do and many of  us do, when public land starts on fire, it is important that the fire  be put out and be put out as quickly as possible. Her husband wrote an  article. I wouldn't ordinarily tag her with her husband's view of  things, but she took that article; she republished it in 2020 and said  this was a ``clarion call.'' Now, if you look up ``clarion call'' in  the dictionary, it is an urgent call to require somebody to do  something. She calls this a clarion call.   He wrote this article about how people shouldn't be building in the  forest around what is called interface land. If you are not--again, we  westerners are familiar with interface. We have so much public land  that many of our subdivisions, our individual homes, our cities butt up  against interface land.   So this is what she said was a clarion call. The solution to houses  in the interface is to let them burn. This is the person that the  administration is going to put in charge of fire suppression in an  interface zone. Let me state it again. The solution to houses in the  interface zone is to let them burn is what she said.   Then: How do you feel about that?   She said:         There's a rude and satisfying justice in burning down the       House of someone who builds in the forest.    That was in 2020. In 2020, she said that. This is whom the  administration wants to take over the Bureau of Land Management.   Well, in addition to that, she lied to the committee. She lied under  oath. I will tell you, this is disgusting. She shouldn't be here. She  should be charged and standing in front of a jury.   Now, I told you what she did about her participation in the tree- spiking incident, and this was a question that was asked of her under  oath as she came to the committee for her confirmation:         Did you have personal knowledge of, participate in, or in       any way directly or indirectly support activities associated       with the spiking of trees in any forest during your lifetime?        No.    Now, we know she wrote this letter. She admits it. She participated  in it because she testified she participated in it when she testified  against the other people who were eventually convicted and sent to  prison. Yet she swore under oath to our committee this year that, no,  she wasn't involved in that. They asked: Have you ever been arrested or  charged--they asked her whether or not she had ever been a target of  such an investigation. She says:         No, I have never been arrested or charged and to my       knowledge I have never been the target of such investigation.    She knew she was a target; she was sent a letter that she was a  target; and she hired an attorney to get her out from underneath that  mess because she was a target. Yet she said no. So she has perjured  herself this year.   Well, look, this is not the right person for this job. It just amazes  me that they would even consider a person like this for this job. This  is an insult to the thousands of good, hard-working people who are in  the Bureau of Land Management and who work day and night to protect our  resources on the public lands in the Western States.   Look, I know we are going to lose this. It is going to be a party- line vote. All Republicans are going to vote against confirming her.  The Democrats are all going to vote in favor of her. I say to this  administration, this is not going to go away. This person's record of  perjury, of ecoterrorism, of participating as a person involved in this  plot and this conspiracy to actually take the life of Forest Service  workers--this is not going to go away during the entire time that she  is the head of this Agency. It is going to come up again and again, and  it should.   So I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, I say to the  President of the United States, who has nominated her for this  position, if this is the character of someone who you want us to  remember as the legacy of your administration, here she is, a perjurer,  an ecoterrorist, a person who has participated in a conspiracy to  murder innocent people working in the forest. If that is what you want  as your administration, here it is. Vote for it. I suspect that is  exactly what is going to happen, but this is not going to go away.   I yield the floor.
