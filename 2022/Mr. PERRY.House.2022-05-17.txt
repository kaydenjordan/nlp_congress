 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend, the good gentleman from  Texas for yielding.   I think that what most people don't understand--and some even in this  body--is that when you think about operational control of the border,  you are assuming that the administration wants to stop people from  illegally crossing. You are thinking that they are about border  security and about national security.   We actually voted in this body, as you know, to fund at higher  levels, Border Patrol, ICE. And many on our side of the aisle even  voted for it, either unwittingly or knowing that this administration  was actually going to use that money, not to stop people from coming  across the border illegally, not to uphold the law, not to stop the  invasion that is guaranteed by our Constitution to the States, but to  actually become more efficient at processing individuals coming across  the border illegally and moving them very quickly into the interior of  the country.   They used the money so that they don't have the optics of what is  happening at the Del Rio bridge. That is why they wanted to be more  efficient. They don't want the optics of people huddling underneath a  bridge, coming from some other country or some other places illegally,  and not having anywhere to go, and the squalor and the potential crime  element that is associated with it.   Since they don't want that optic, what they have done is used the  money that has been appropriated, the additional money--not to mention  all the money that has already been appropriated--to move them more  efficiently into the interior of the country.   So when the Secretary says he has operational control, sure, they are  operationally controlling the influx of illegal aliens, right? That is  the actual definition, right? That is the word that is used--illegal  aliens into the country. And so on that charge, they are actually doing  very well.   Unfortunately, the American people, and my good friend from Texas,  Chip Roy, know they are suffering right now under horrific high prices  that they barely can afford, whether it is for fuel in their car,  whether it is for being able to buy groceries, if you can find them.   And heaven forbid you are a family that has a small child that needs  formula. No extra money for that, Mr. Roy. No extra money for  Americans.    Well, you know why.    Madam Speaker, into the country but without the view of  the cameras, without the access of the American people in to see what  is happening in their country. That is the chain-link fence around it,  without the view of what is happening in every single community which  is due to fentanyl overdoses.   Every single person in America now likely can say they know some  family, somebody in their town that died of a fentanyl overdose. So  that is coming from China, as the good gentleman from Arkansas was just  talking about what is happening in China--it comes from China through  Mexico across our southern border and into your town.   That is national security. That is border security. That is health  security. And our country and the leadership and this administration is  not providing it at this time.     I am aware of that.   Madam Speaker, right here on this floor, the President came and gave  his State of the Union and said he wanted to secure the border. That is  what the President said, he wanted to secure the border. Yet, the  fentanyl keeps coming in. The money has been spent. In many towns they  have defunded the police, right? The drugs keep coming in.   And as there is a primary election going on right now in my home  State in Pennsylvania, many people from across the aisle have said they  want border protection, they want national security, they want to stop  the fentanyl.   But given any opportunity to vote in favor of that, to come down and  sign the discharge petition, not one Democrat, not one Democrat signed  the discharge petition to force that bill to the floor to say keep  title 42 in place and leave us an opportunity to make sure that people  and drugs and the crime element supported by the cartels don't come to  America. Not one will step up.    That is exactly right.   Madam Speaker, the American people see and are feeling it every  single day when they go to the gas pumps, when they have got to get  their kids to soccer games and multiple activities, driving back and  forth, and they can't afford to fill up their gas tanks anymore.   This is because we are at the beginning of implementing the Green New  Deal, forcing it on Americans; not letting you make the choice, but  letting policymakers in Washington, D.C., determine how your life is  going to be.   And while the President says, in this very body, they want to have a  vote on price-gouging. Meanwhile, we are not allowing the people to  produce the gas and oil that we desperately need to keep our energy  economy going. Our country runs on energy, right? The President is  saying no more leases. Not one pipeline is being built.                                time  2150    No more leases. No more refining. It is not happening. They actually  said that we are producing more gas and oil than ever before in  history. But you just gave them the numbers, Mr. Roy. You just gave us  the numbers. It is actually less. That is what happens, and you are  going to pay more. For every single gallon that you buy, you are going  to pay more. And this is all by design. They don't want you to have the  choice. They actually want to force you to drive an electric vehicle.   As long as we are talking about energy and the lack thereof, Mr. Roy,  it was just reported in your State to be prepared for blackouts and  brownouts because there is going to be a lack of electricity  production.   Ladies and gentlemen, this is the 21st century. America knows how to  produce energy. We know how to make electricity. We know how to  transport it. Yet, it is happening in California, and now it is going  to start cascading across the country because of the policy decisions  of the Green New Deal and those who worship at the altar of this green  agenda that forces us to take these things that we can't afford and are  inefficient and ineffective.    And opening one a week.    And hope you can charge. And I sure hope you have the time  to sit there and charge, right? It is not like filling it up at the gas  station and you get back on the road and keep going and make it in a  reasonable amount of time.   The gentleman from Texas is absolutely right. I mean, he talked about  the fact that we are empowering China. Eighty-five percent of the  critical minerals that come here to make the solar panels and windmills  come from China. Now, of course, we subsidize all that. That subsidy  means it is coming from your tax dollars.   Of course, I don't know whether you know this or not, Mr. Roy, but I  suspect you do, those tax dollars going to pay for those raw materials  in China are then--those tax dollars go to mine it, to mine it in the  Congo, right?    One of the biggest mines in the world, the biggest mine in  the world. Slave labor, child slave labor, right? We are talking about  saving the rainforest, meanwhile they are cutting all this stuff down  to mine these minerals, so we can feel good. So we can feel good about  our ourselves and America. Meanwhile, it is supporting child slave  labor with your taxes, supporting deforestation of the rainforest. For  what? For higher prices and less availability, and it is just going to  keep coming, ladies and gentlemen, as long as the agenda of the left  keeps being implemented.    I had a problem with $40 billion with 5 hours, 5 hours of  consideration for $40 billion. When we took the text to the staff and  asked them about this line, what is this $300 million, and they said,  Well, we don't know. And we are expected to vote on that. We are  expected to vote for that or somehow we are aligned with Vladimir  Putin.   Keep in mind, my good friend from Texas, 2 weeks prior to this we did  this lend-lease without any time limit, without any funding limit, then  come back, and the President asked for $33 billion, we give him $40  billion. We can't afford our diesel. Pretty soon you are not going to  be able to afford your food. We won't do anything on our own border.  Prices are going up for every single person.   Every American wants to help Ukraine, but we are Americans, and the  Representatives in this body represent America.    You are absolutely right, Mr. Roy. The American people at  least deserve the debate. Five hours, ladies and gentlemen, 5 hours for  $40 billion. People around here complain about all kinds of things.    Right. That is a problem. But $40 billion, no problem.   Meanwhile, our citizens, the citizens that I represent, they are  having a hard time figuring out, do they pay their insurance, do they  pay their mortgage? I talk to people on a regular basis that say they  put their bills on their table, and they put a date on them when they  are due and when they think they will be able to pay for them. They  say, I have never had to do that before. I am selling stuff to pay my  bills because I can't afford what is happening in my country right now.  Meanwhile, we can't talk for 15 minutes, 20 minutes, an hour about $40  billion to some other country. Meanwhile, we just gave a blank check 2  weeks before to let the President spend any amount of money for any  amount of time on the same country. We didn't declare war.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  allowing me to be part of this Special Order and speak on behalf of and  fight on behalf of the American people that are struggling right now.
