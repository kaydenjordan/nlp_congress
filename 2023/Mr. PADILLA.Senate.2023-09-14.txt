 Madam President, I rise to introduce the Wounded Warrior  Access Act, along with Senator Braun.   This legislation would streamline the process for veterans to submit  a claim for benefits by giving them electronic access to their benefit  claim file.   This legislation would require the VA to establish and maintain a  secure online tool or website to enable a veteran or their  representative to submit a request to receive their claims file, or C- File, electronically.   Allowing veterans to access their C-File electronically would allow  veterans to access their information in a faster and more efficient  manner.   When a veteran submits a claim for benefits to the Department of  Veterans Affairs, VA, a C-File is created. C-Files contain a veteran's  service records, results of VA exams, additional information submitted  by the veteran, and any material the VA deems necessary to decide a  claim,   Currently, a veteran must travel to a regional VA location or mail in  a form to request a paper copy of their C-File, slowing down the  process for individuals to gain access to their information.   The Wounded Warrior Access Act would require the VA to offer an  online alternative for veterans to request their C-File. Online  requests would dramatically modernize the C-File collection, decrease  processing time, and reduce unnecessary appeals since more veterans  will have access to all the information the VA used to decide their  claims, ultimately saving the VA time and money.   I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the Wounded  Warrior Access Act as quickly as possible, and I thank Congressman Pete  Aguilar for his partnership on this legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mr. PADILLA (for himself, Mr. Blumenthal, Ms. Cortez Masto,          Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Heinrich, Mr. Menendez, Mr.          Murphy, and Ms. Warren):   S. 2813. A bill to promote and support collaboration between  Hispanic-serving institutions and local educational agencies with high  enrollments of Hispanic or Latino students, and for other purposes; to  the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.    Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the  Hispanic Educational Resources and Empowerment Act of 2023, which I  reintroduced today. -   Hispanic-Serving Institutions, HSIs, provide incredible opportunities  for millions of low-income and first-generation students. I am proud  that my State of California is home to 170 HSIs and 47 emerging HSIs,  the most in the country. That is why I launched the first-ever Senate  HSI Caucus with my colleague, Senator Menendez--to spotlight and  advocate for the 572 HSIs across our country. These critical  institutions educate our future leaders and help to build a more  diverse and inclusive workforce.   During the pandemic, the number of HSIs in our country declined for  the first time in two decades due to a decrease in higher education  enrollment among Latino students during the pandemic. While the number  of HSIs has since increased above prepandemic levels, this previous  decrease illustrates the need for further investments in Latino youth.  That is why I am reintroducing the HERE Act.   If enacted, this bill would support Latino students throughout  secondary and postsecondary education. Specifically, the HERE Act would  provide $150 million for grants to create partnerships between HSIs and  K-12 school districts that serve large populations of Latino students.   Schools could use this funding to provide academic support that  better prepares students for postsecondary education. They could create  new programs to foster a college-going culture by exposing students and  their families to postsecondary opportunities. And they could better  support students through the college application and transition  process. Additionally, schools could use grants to address non-academic  needs that serve as barriers to college enrollment and completion--such  as childcare, food insecurity, financial hardship, and more.   Latinos are the largest, youngest, and second fastest growing  minority population in the United States. While making up about 20  percent of our country's population, Latinos comprise 26 percent of  prekindergarten through grade 12 enrollment. Latino students are going  to college more than ever before, but they still face lower educational  outcomes, including lower grades, lower scores on standardized tests,  and higher dropout rates.   As a Senator representing one of the most diverse States in the  country, I am proud to work with my colleagues to ensure the American  dream is a reality for every student.   I want to thank Congressman Joaquin Castro for introducing this bill  with me, and I hope our colleagues will join us in support of this  effort to empower Latino youth.       By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Ms. Murkowski):   S. 2815. A bill to provide for a wage differential program to support  new nursing school faculty members; to the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions.                                  ______                                      Madam President, I rise to introduce the Wounded Warrior  Access Act, along with Senator Braun.
