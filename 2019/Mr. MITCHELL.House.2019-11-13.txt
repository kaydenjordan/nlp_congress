 Mr. Speaker, the House of Representatives most  certainly faces a vote to impeach the President before the end of this  year. I urge my colleagues to carefully and deliberately contemplate  this next step in their votes.   The Constitution provides great latitude to this body in impeaching a  President. It is up to us, all 435 of us in this Chamber, to determine  what constitutes a ``high crime and misdemeanor,'' and those  determinations clearly vary greatly among us.   As we cast those votes, we must consider our place in history and the  implications of those votes in the future of this Republic.   Alexander Hamilton warned of the risks of impeachment becoming a  partisan act. In Federalist No. 65, he wrote of his fear that, during  impeachment, `` . . . there will always be the greatest danger that the decision  will be regulated more by comparative strength of parties, than by the  real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.'' I fear the proceedings  have not heeded this warning.   Impeachment was never designed to be a supplemental election process  but, rather, a safety valve to be used in the rarest of occasions when  an elected official acts in such an immoral and blatantly unlawful  manner as to threaten the very basis of our Republic.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to remember this as  they assess the interviews, depositions, and hearings that are  unfolding today and their impending vote on impeachment.  [[Page H8788]]    Impeachment must not become weaponized. It cannot simply be another  election tool.   The question before this body is not whether a Member is comfortable  with the rhetoric of the President, his political tactics, his use of  Twitter, his policy choices, or his political rallies. The question is:  Have high crimes and misdemeanors been committed? And if so, they must  be prepared to demonstrate that specifically.   I urge the Speaker of the House to ensure that each Member, should  they desire, be afforded time, 5 minutes per Member, during debate on  impeachment to explain his or her view and impending vote. It is  critical the American people, who will be watching closely, be afforded  an opportunity to see and hear those views.   Impeachment must not be based upon polling data, election advantages,  or social media commentary. It must be based upon clear and compelling  facts. To do anything else threatens our Republic.   I intend to approach this matter in just that way. I will uphold my  oath and vote as the circumstances require.   But this judgment also must not be preordained based on political  party or political maneuvering by anyone serving in this Chamber.                            ____________________
