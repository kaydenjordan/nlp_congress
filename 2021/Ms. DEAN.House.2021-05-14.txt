 Mr. Speaker, 22 million Americans lost their jobs during  the pandemic. Slowly we have begun to rebuild, restore, and get back on  track. Since President Biden has taken office, 1.5 million jobs have  been created--the most jobs created in the first 100 days of any  Presidency. Yet, as the April jobs report showed us, we must continue  to take additional steps to get Americans back to work.   There are more than 8 million jobs left to go. The American Jobs Plan  is vital to rebuilding our community and our economy while protecting  our planet. It is a once-in-a-century investment to create millions of  good-paying jobs and to lay the foundation for extensive economic  growth for the following decades.   In my home State of Pennsylvania, our infrastructure earned a C-minus  on its infrastructure report card. There is so much we can do. We need  to safely upgrade Pennsylvania's roads and bridges, mass transit,  ports, rail, broadband, and water supply.   We have a chance here to make a generational investment and get our  Nation back on track with the American Jobs Plan.                            ____________________
