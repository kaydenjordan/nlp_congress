 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Congressman Mike  Johnson from Louisiana, for helping coordinate this effort.   When I got here to Washington for orientation, I will never forget  very early on, one of my colleagues, Congressman Jodey Arrington from  Texas, came up to me and said: I want to introduce myself. And he did.   He was the first Republican that came up to me and said: I want to  get to know you on a personal level. I want to be your friend because  we are going to be working together.   I have to tell you how impressed I was that somebody was reaching out  across the aisle because they wanted to develop a personal  relationship, knowing that we would be able to work together.   Later on, I got to meet the rest of my colleagues at Harvard, where  they have a bipartisan program that is a wonderful program and gives  you an opportunity to help build these relationships, which I think is  so important, especially today in our time.   We just got off one of the ugliest elections in history where it  really felt as if civility disappeared. Today it  [[Page H1163]]  sometimes still feels that way, which is why I think this is such an  important effort.   As Members of Congress, we need to set an example of statesmanship  for younger generations of Americans to follow. We must remember that  every person should be respected. Somebody yesterday said something  that really struck a chord. It is not that we need to agree on  everything or that we need to agree all the time, but we need to learn  to disagree better.
