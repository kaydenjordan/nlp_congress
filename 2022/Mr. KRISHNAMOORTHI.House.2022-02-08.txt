 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for  yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of the Postal Service Reform Act. I  thank Chairwoman Maloney and Ranking Member Comer for delivering good  news for America.   What is this good news? This bill eliminates the retirement health  prefunding mandate. It requires 6-day-a-week delivery. It increases  transparency and accountability for the Postal Service.   I thank all of our allies who have been working to pass this bill,  including the letter carriers, post handlers, rural carriers, postal  workers. Neither snow, nor rain, nor heat, nor gloom of night, nor  politics or partisanship can get in the way of this bill.   I urge swift passage of the Postal Service Reform Act.
