 Mr. Chairman, Democrats are doing everything  that we can to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs, so  I strongly support the act that is on the floor today. It contains two  bills that I authored.   First is H.R. 1010, which prohibits the expansion of these junk  insurance plans. Junk insurance plans are the ones that do not cover  preexisting conditions. You can often be tricked into buying one of  these plans and find out it doesn't even cover the trip to the  hospital.   In fact, I asked Secretary Azar, in committee, about this. I asked  him: You are aware that these junk plans do not cover preexisting  conditions?   He said: That is correct.   The bill also contains another section that I authored, the ENROLL  Act, to restore funds to our independent navigators who are helping  American families choose the right health insurance options for them.  Agents and brokers are important, but they are no substitute for  independent navigators who are trusted in the community.   We have got to pass these bills today to lower healthcare costs for  families all across the country and lower prescription drug costs. I am  very proud to have authored two portions of this.   Let's not let them expand these junk plans and leave you on the hook.  Let's make sure that families have the independent advice that they  need to choose what makes the most sense for them.    Mr. Chairman, we are trying to turn back the  sabotage of the Trump administration on people's healthcare for the  folks back home who we represent. The Trump administration has done  everything they can to make it more expensive, whether we are talking  about prescription drugs or that all-important health insurance policy.   Don't just take it from me and my Democratic colleagues. Take it from  folks who are on the side of our families day in and day out: the  American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, the American Diabetes  Association, the American Heart Association, and the American Lung  Association. I could go on and on.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record letters from over 20 health groups  that represent our families back home who say: Pass this bill.                                                      May 15, 2019.      Hon. Kathy Castor,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Castor: The 23 undersigned       organizations, representing millions of American patients,       providers, and consumers, write today in strong support of       H.R. 1010, To provide that the rule entitled ``Short-Term,       Limited Duration Insurance ``shall have no force or effect,''       which is now included in H.R. 987. Our organizations strongly       support providing protections for patients from short-term,       limited-duration (STLDI or short-term) plans and support       preventing action on implementing or enforcing the ``Short-      Term, Limited-Duration Insurance'' final rule (83 FR 38212,       published August 3, 2018).        Our organizations remain concerned about this final rule       which expands the maximum  [[Page H3875]]       duration of short-term health insurance plans from three       months to 364 days. Previously, short term plans were       available to fill a temporary gap in coverage, such as gaps       in employment. However, since the rule was finalized, the       growth and availability of these products continues to       threaten patients with pre-existing conditions because       insurers offering these policies can either deny coverage or       charge higher premiums to individuals with pre-existing       conditions. Expanding access to these policies could cause       premiums in the marketplace to increase, as younger and       healthier individuals choose to enroll in the short-term       plans. This forces individuals with serious or chronic       conditions into a smaller, sicker risk pool to obtain the       coverage they need to manage their health. Premiums for these       comprehensive plans would likely skyrocket, making insurance       unaffordable.        Short-term plans also lack patient protections guaranteed       by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), severely impacting       individuals with serious or chronic health conditions. Plan       providers are permitted to consider pre-existing conditions       in decisions to deny coverage, charge higher premiums, or not       cover certain care and treatments. After enrolling in a       short-term plan, providers are permitted to rescind or amend       coverage based on new health issues. Short-term plans are not       required to cover all of the Essential Health Benefits (EHBs)       categories outlined in the ACA, potentially forcing       individuals to pay out-of-pocket for expensive treatments.       These plans can also impose lifetime and annual limits on       coverage and do not require limits on out-of-pocket expenses       and deductibles.        H.R. 1010 would both protect patients and consumers from       substandard insurance products and assist in stabilizing the       marketplace. The decreased up-front costs of short-term plans       may be more appealing to younger, healthier individuals,       thus, dividing the individual marketplace risk pool.       Segmenting the market in this way will result in increased       premiums for comprehensive ACA-compliant plans in the       marketplace, decreasing marketplace stability, and reducing       affordable access to insurance.        It is for these reasons we enthusiastically endorse your       legislation and urge Congress to act swiftly to limit the       sale of short-term insurance plans. People with pre-existing       conditions need access to adequate, affordable health       insurance. Again, our organizations thank you for your       leadership on this critical issue for people with pre-      existing conditions, and we support your efforts to expand       access to affordable health insurance.

Hon. Kathy Castor,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative Castor: The 23 undersigned       organizations, representing millions of American patients,       providers, and consumers, write today in strong support of       H.R. 1386, Expand Navigator's Resources for Outreach,       Learning, and Longevity (ENROLL) Act of 2019, which is now       included as a provision in H.R. 987. Our organizations       recognize the importance of navigator programs to assist       potential enrollees with the open enrollment process. Your       legislation will guarantee resources for navigators, allowing       them to continue the important work of educating Americans       about their coverage and enrollment options.        In March 2017, we identified three overarching principles       to guide and measure any work to further reform and improve       the nation's health insurance system. Our core principles are       that health insurance coverage must be adequate, affordable,       and accessible. Together, our organizations understand what       individuals and families need to prevent disease, manage       health, and cure illness. Our organizations are deeply       concerned about cuts to these services and the lack of       reliable resources for consumers who have questions about how       to enroll in coverage. We are pleased that this legislation       represents a significant and meaningful step towards       increasing access to services that help consumers enroll in       high-quality health care, including Medicare and Medicaid.        Cuts to navigators and outreach and enrollment activities       since 2016 have taken away resources that help consumers       understand and select health care coverage. Navigators and       consumer assisters are critical to educating the public about       their health insurance options and helping individuals enroll       in appropriate coverage. Navigators conduct outreach and must       provide fair, accurate, unbiased, and culturally appropriate       information to individuals and families regarding eligibility       and enrollment requirements for the marketplaces and other       state health insurance programs. They are valuable allies to       consumers seeking affordable coverage that meets their needs.       Many navigators also provide in-person help to low-income and       rural communities, consumers with limited English       proficiency, people with disabilities, and other populations       for whom such assistance is not often available.        We strongly and enthusiastically support your legislation       to preserve funding for navigator programs. Informed       enrollees can choose plans that provide the coverage they       need at prices they can afford. Research has shown that       states that devote robust resources to marketing, outreach,       and enrollment assistance programs experience higher rates of       enrollment compared to those who do not. Providing resources       to ease the enrollment process will help stabilize the       marketplace and result in lower premiums for many enrollees.        People with pre-existing conditions need access to       adequate, affordable health insurance. In order to be       accessible, potential enrollees need to understand open       enrollment and coverage options. With the increase of       coverage options that are not compliant with the Affordable       Care Act (ACA), such as short-term, limited-duration       insurance plans, navigator programs are particularly       important to allow uninsured individuals to make informed       decisions. This legislation will keep this information       accessible to all. Again, our organizations thank you for       your leadership on this critical issue for people with pre-      existing conditions, and we support your efforts to expand       access to affordable health insurance.

I have heard so much misinformation today from my colleagues on  the other side of the aisle who have denigrated our navigators. They  say agents and brokers can do the job of helping to sign up our  neighbors for health insurance.   Boy, that is not the case. Yes, agents and brokers are important, but  we heard expert testimony in our committee that the navigators provide  independent, trusted advice. They are our community-based folks at  community health centers and groups like the American Cancer Society,  who I mentioned, that understand how important it is.   A lot of the agents and brokers send their customers over to  navigators to sign up because the agents and brokers are not interested  in going over to folks who rely on Medicaid, or the Children's Health  Insurance Program.
