 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to  acknowledge tomorrow, July 25, as National Hire a Veteran Day.   Veterans are an important part of our community. They sacrifice a  great deal to ensure that we live in a Nation that is free and safe.  Sadly, when returning to civilian life, many of our Nation's veterans  find themselves unemployed or underemployed.   I am an Army dad. My son was wounded in combat during a tour in Iraq,  and so this issue is personal. My daughter-in-law is also a veteran.   Our veterans are highly trained and highly skilled. They deserve our  support while deployed and when they return home. One of the best ways  to do this is to prepare them for the workforce outside of the  military. That is one of the reasons I was proud to cosponsor the  Veterans in Effective Apprenticeships Act last year with Congresswoman  Katherine Clark.   The bill instructs apprenticeship programs to account for a  participant's competencies and prior experiences, including those  gained during military service, among other things.   Mr. Speaker, the best way to thank a veteran is to hire a veteran.  The skills obtained in service are invaluable.                            ____________________
