 Mr. Speaker, I, too, want to add my congratulations to Mr.  MacArthur for continuing to find ways to improve Mr. Obama's and this  committee's excellent work on the JOBS Act from some 8 years ago. We  have learned a lot. We have seen the benefits of the JOBS Act, and  today we have a chance to make it even better by improving Reg. A+.   I appreciate Mr. MacArthur's personal story about his  entrepreneurship and how this is an opportunity for more investors in  our country and more capital for our entrepreneurs.   Mr. Speaker, this week I attended a meeting where people asked: Why  do we need more public companies?   Gosh, that is an easy rhetorical question.   Because we have half the number of public companies we had during the  Reagan administration, and we need them for our young people to invest  in. We need them for our union workers to have an earning asset in  their pension fund.   So we need more public companies in this Nation to share the growth  and prosperity of this Nation. That is what this legislation is all  about.   I thank Mr. MacArthur for his very straightforward, bipartisan,  commonsense increase in the authority from $50 million to $75 million  for young, growing companies to raise money under Reg. A+.   Former SEC Commissioner Dan Gallagher advocated the increase in the  offering threshold to even $100 million before the SEC adopted their  final rule.                                time  1445    Mr. Gallagher expressed his disappointment that this offering  threshold was not raised in the final rule from that original statutory  cap of $50 million.   We have support through the commission and through the staff for  raising this amount, Mr. Speaker, to help our entrepreneurs. Expanding  Reg. A+ to include offerings up to $75 million will allow private  companies to consider a mini-IPO under Reg. A+. This will give us more  competition for capital, driving down cost of capital, driving up the  number of opportunities for people to take advantage of going public,  growing a prosperous company, and sharing that equity with investors  through their exchange-traded fund, through their pension plan, through  their 401(k) plan. We want more opportunities to share our Nation's  prosperity.   I thank my friend, Mr. MacArthur, for his thoughtful work, and I  thank our chairman for his leadership on the committee.
