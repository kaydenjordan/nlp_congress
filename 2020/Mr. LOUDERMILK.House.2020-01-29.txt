 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of National  School Choice Week and the powerful impact that putting education  choice in the hands of families can have in the lives of students, both  in Georgia and across America.   Every child is a special gift from God, unique in their learning  styles and capabilities. When it comes to their education, the options  available to students and their families should not be limited by  mandates from Washington, D.C.   It is also an unfortunate reality that opportunities for a quality  education are not the same in every ZIP Code. Parents should have  flexibility when choosing the best school setting to fit the specific  needs of their children.   Whether it be through traditional public schools, charter schools,  private schools, homeschooling, or vouchers, the decision about where  to go to school should be made as close to the student as possible.   When we empower families to choose the educational options best  suited for their sons and daughters, we give them the opportunity to  thrive and to become the next generation of leaders in their families,  churches, and communities.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to lend my voice in support of school choice,  especially during National School Choice Week.                            ____________________
