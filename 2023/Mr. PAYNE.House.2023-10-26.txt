 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the new House  Speaker, Representative Mike Johnson.   In doing some research, not knowing the gentleman very well, I have  come to find out that he is not the moderate unifier that we need right  now.   Speaker Johnson was a key player in Trump's plot to overthrow our  democracy. He worked to justify the tragic January 6 insurrection, an  attack that threatened the lives of my House colleagues, Republican and  Democrat alike.   Speaker Johnson wants the government to control a woman's right to  her healthcare decisions. He wants the government to control who  Americans can marry. He wants the government to ban interracial  marriage.   He also wants to slash funding for Social Security, Medicare, and  Medicaid and deny critical healthcare to vulnerable seniors.   Americans reject these extreme agenda items, yet Republicans voted  for him to lead the people's House. Once again, they are putting  politics over the American people.                            ____________________
