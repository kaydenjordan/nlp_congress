 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to  complete my remarks prior to the vote.    Mr. President, the latest inflation numbers came out  Friday, and the news was not good. Inflation is currently at the  highest level in nearly 40 years--40 years. The last time inflation was  this bad, ``E.T.'' and ``Rocky III'' were in theaters, and the Green  Bay Packers were being coached by Bart Starr.   High inflation is taking a major toll on American families. Gas  prices are at a 7-year high. The price of used cars and trucks is up 31  percent--31 percent. Propane, kerosene, and firewood are up 34 percent.   Food prices have increased significantly. Ground beef is up 14  percent. Apples are up 7.4 percent. Pork is up 17 percent; eggs, 8  percent. Baby food is up 6.7 percent. Bacon and related products are up  21 percent. And the list continues.   Rent prices are up. Utility prices are up. Furniture prices are up,  and on and on.   Inflation is so bad that, despite wage growth this year, Americans  have seen a de facto pay cut, with real average hourly earnings down  1.9 percent this year.  [[Page S9133]]    Inflation is what happens when you have too many dollars chasing too  few goods and services. And a big reason for our current inflation  situation is the Democrats' decision to pour a lot of unnecessary  government money into the economy earlier this year, despite--despite,  I might add--being warned that their partisan $1.9 trillion American  Rescue Plan spending spree could stoke inflation.   And you don't have to take my word for it. Here is what former Obama  economic adviser Jason Furman had to say recently when discussing our  inflation problem:         The original sin was an oversized American Rescue Plan. It       contributed to both higher output but also higher prices.    That quote from Mr. Furman appeared in a New York Times article that  also noted:         But some economists, including veterans of previous       Democratic administrations, say much of Mr. Biden's inflation       struggle is self-inflicted. Lawrence H. Summers is one of       those who say the stimulus bill [that] the president signed       in March gave too much of a boost to consumer spending. . . .       Mr. Summers, who served in the Obama and Clinton       administrations, says inflation now risks spiraling out of       control and other Democratic economists agree there are       risks.    Again, that is from the New York Times.   Inflation is spiraling out of control, and Democrats are preparing to  throw more fuel on the fire. That is right. Democrats are preparing to  double down on the strategy that helped get us in this mess in the  first place and pass yet another massive government spending bill.   I am not sure whether Democrats simply don't care about the inflation  situation facing American families or whether they are operating under  the delusion that they can somehow pass another major government  spending bill without serious consequences for the economy.   Regardless, there is no question that pouring another $1.75 trillion  in government money into the economy would likely make our inflation  crisis even worse than it is today.   I say $1.75 trillion because that is what Democrats have been selling  as the pricetag for their so-called Build Back Better plan. But as we  learned on Friday of last week from the Congressional Budget Office's  latest analysis, the Democrats' spending spree would far exceed $1.75  trillion. When you take away the shell games and budget gimmicks, the  Democrats' spending spree would cost almost $5 trillion--5 trillion.  And, of course, the tax hikes in the Democrats' plan, as large as they  are, wouldn't even come close to funding that amount.   The Democrats' Build Back Better proposal, if implemented over 10  years, as they plan, would add an eye-popping $3 trillion to our  national debt. It turns out that Build Back Better is more like ``Build  Back Bankrupt.''   Democrats have attempted to disguise the true cost of their ``Build  Back Bankrupt'' plan by strategically sunsetting various provisions  before the end of the bill's 10-year budget window. Of course,  Democrats have never had any intention of actually sunsetting these  provisions. But by claiming that they are going to sunset these  measures, they have been able to sort of disguise the fact that their  spending spree would actually cost nearly $5 trillion.   That is the Congressional Budget Office, not me. The Congressional  Budget Office, last Friday said, if extended--the 10-year window--this  bill would cost $5 trillion.   Democrats are implicitly admitting that they plan to extend these  programs, but they are saying that people shouldn't worry, that the  cost of these extensions will be offset. Well, I would like to know  just how exactly they plan to do that.   With massive new tax hikes, on top of the tax hikes they have already  included in their bill--just how many tax hikes do Democrats think our  economy can handle?   And if Democrats had a plan for future offsets, why didn't they  include those offsets in their bill, in the first place, along with an  honest accounting of the length of their programs?   Is it because they thought that the American people would balk if  they knew the true cost of the bill, that they might not be crazy about  the idea of a bill that would cost them $5 trillion?   I am hard-pressed to think of anything more irresponsible than for  Democrats to pass their Build Back Better--or their ``Build Back  Bankrupt''--measure right now. Inflation is soaring, as I have just  pointed out, and there is no clear end in sight. Even the Federal  Reserve is now acknowledging that this isn't transitory. They removed  that word from their description.   We are emerging from a pandemic that required a lot of government  expenditure and a corresponding increase in our debt, and we have no  idea what government money might be needed down the road.   Passing a $5 trillion spending spree that would add $3 trillion to  our national debt is the very last thing that we should be doing.   I hope that at least some of my Democrat colleagues will think better  of their spending plans before the American people are forced to  discover just what ``Building Back Bankrupt'' is really like.
