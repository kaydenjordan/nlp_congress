 Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the chairman on  his assumption of the chairmanship of the full committee and for  putting this bill together when he chaired the Subcommittee on Defense.   This bill certainly represents the outcome of many hard choices. It  prioritizes funding where our troops need it the most. It wisely  invests in readiness, training, maintenance, and procurement, and  ensures that our troops are prepared for the tasks before them. This  bill also supports our efforts to defeat ISIL alongside our allies in  the region as well as our continued focus on deterring Russian  aggression.   I am also pleased, Mr. Speaker, that this bill takes care of the  troops and their families, granting them a long-awaited 2.1 percent pay  raise. Time and again, our servicemembers put themselves in harm's way  and respond to the myriad threats facing the Nation. This pay raise is  one small way for us to honor their dedication and willingness to  serve.   As the threats we face continue to become more unpredictable, we must  provide our troops with the tools that they need to win in uncertain  times. This bill goes a long way toward restoring the shortfalls in  manpower and readiness that our military has endured in recent years.   In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me call attention again to Will Smith,  who has been a clerk of this committee for 6 years and served as my  chief of staff in my private office for many years before. This is  likely his last appropriations bill on the floor to help manage and put  together, and so I want to say to Will and all of you in behalf of  saying something good about Will, what a great amount of service he  rendered the Nation with a true Kentucky attitude, which he has.   Will, we owe you a lot. Thank you for your service. You have been  great. We wish you Godspeed.                                time  1600
