 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as our Nation begins to  grapple with the fall of Roe v. Wade.   Twenty days ago, the Supreme Court erased 50 years of precedent,  ending the freedom for women to have the right to choose.   Already, the devastating effects are becoming very clear: State  legislatures are criminalizing women and healthcare providers, pregnant  cancer patients who cannot get the treatment they need to survive, a  10-year-old rape victim forced to travel across State lines to access  the abortion she needs.   It is horrific. But make no mistake, these stories are the result of  a radical Republican agenda, and these are the stories that Republicans  refuse to acknowledge. We must call them out.   This is an extremely difficult, personal decision, but I trust that  women can make that choice, and I will do everything in my power to  protect that right to choose.                            ____________________
