 Mr. President, yesterday, I was pleased to join my  colleagues on the Senate Agriculture Committee to approve a landmark  farm bill. Under the fair and bipartisan leadership of Chairman Pat  Roberts, our committee has produced a bill that will bolster struggling  agriculture communities across our country.   Speaking for my home State of Kentucky, agriculture is part of who we  are. Kentucky farm families produce everything from poultry to  soybeans. This legislation will assist them, encourage economic growth,  and increase investment in rural communities.   This farm bill also includes a bipartisan provision I crafted with  Senator Wyden to legalize industrial hemp. At present, with just a few  limited exceptions, our Federal Government bans domestic hemp  production--never mind that this is a completely different plant than  its illicit cousin, and never mind that consumers are already buying  hemp products, everything from clothing to auto parts; they are just  imported from foreign producers. Federal law has mostly prohibited our  own farmers from getting in on the action. It is time to remove the  roadblocks and let American farmers explore this growing market.   This has long been a priority of mine. I championed hemp pilot  programs in the 2014 farm bill. They have shown big success. It is time  to take the next step.   Again, I would like to thank the chairman and ranking member of the  committee for their leadership on this subject. I was pleased to join  the overwhelming bipartisan majority who voted the farm bill out of  committee yesterday morning, and I look forward to taking it up here on  the floor in the next few weeks.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another subject, for the past week,  the Senate has been considering the John S. McCain 2019 National  Defense Authorization Act. It is a thorough bill. It is a bipartisan  bill.   The Armed Services Committee has conducted hearing after hearing,  gathering testimony from our Nation's top military leaders. They have  heard straight from the experts about the gaps between current  capabilities and current challenges. Taking this testimony into  account, throughout the committee markup, they considered and included  300 amendments--300--in the version they reported to the Senate.   For days now, we have discussed and debated it here on the floor.  Senators Inhofe and Reed modified the substitute amendment to include  more than 40 additional amendments from Members on both sides. Even so,  I am confident no Senator sees this as a perfect bill. I am sure every  one of us has further issues we would like to tackle. Some pertain to  the substance of Defense authorization; others concern completely  different topics.   Personally, I would like to have seen even more votes on amendments  this week, but one of the realities of this body is that any Senator on  either side can object to setting up amendment votes. Any Senator on  either side can object to setting up amendment votes.   The good news is what we already have in hand: an excellent Defense  authorization bill that will fulfill one of this body's important  responsibilities and empower the men and women who volunteer to protect  us. We have fulfilled that responsibility for 57 consecutive years.  When this bill passes, it will be 58 consecutive years. You might call  that a routine, but in this body, as we know, what can seem like the  most routine activities are often among the most important. This  Defense authorization bill is right at the top of the Senate's to-do  list so we can do right by our men and women serving in uniform around  the world.   Today is the 243rd birthday of our U.S. Army. I am glad we will have  the opportunity to vote to keep advancing this bill in just a few  minutes.   As I have discussed all week, this legislation is critical to  implementing Secretary Mattis's new national defense strategy. It is  critical for supporting our allies and regional partners  [[Page S3930]]  around the world. It is critical for keeping America safe in a world  that confronts us with everything from terrorist threats from nonstate  actors to great power competition.   One way or another, the Senate will pass this bill. We will fulfill  our solemn responsibility to our military, and then we will proceed to  other important business for our constituents.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on one final matter, day after day and  week after week, more evidence piles up that Republicans' overhaul of  the U.S. Tax Code is igniting new growth and increasing opportunity all  across our country.   Here is what tax reform means to middle-class Floridians. It means  thousand-dollar bonuses for all 26 employees at Spellex Corporation, a  software company in Tampa. It means an 11-percent increase in the base  wage at a bank with more than 600 locations all across Florida. At a  brewery, it meant the flexibility to purchase $100,000 in new capital  equipment and hire two additional employees. For the customers of  Florida Power & Light, it meant a lower monthly bill. The utility had  planned to implement a new surcharge for rebuilding after Hurricane  Irma, but tax reform let them cover the cost of the entire rebuilding  themselves and kept that added burden off of the shoulders of  Floridians. These are just a few of the ways tax reform is helping  jump-start prosperity up and down the State of Florida.   Florida's junior Senator, Mr. Rubio, voted to pass this once-in-a- generation law. It is too bad his colleague, the senior Senator from  Florida, stood with every single Democrat in the House and in the  Senate and tried to block these tax cuts from reaching the American  people. Apparently, he preferred that more middle-class families' money  remain with the IRS. I would call that a curious decision. Perhaps our  Democratic colleagues don't quite understand the importance of a  thriving economy.   We recently heard some revealing comments from the House Democratic  leader. Here is what she said:         Hip hip hooray, unemployment is down. What does that mean       to me and my life?    Unemployment is as low as it has been since 1969. There is soaring  confidence from consumers and small businesses. There are more job  openings than Americans looking for work for the first time in at least  20 years. No big deal, say our Democratic colleagues. Nothing to see  here. Do they really think an outstanding job market doesn't matter to  American families? Well, that might help explain their voting record on  tax reform and other issues, but I suspect this is just pure  partnership because it is Republican policies that are helping generate  this success. Our friends across the aisle want to deny reality and  ignore the obvious improvements for workers, families, and job  creators. Fortunately, the facts are the facts. Americans know success  when they see it, and Republicans will keep fighting to unleash more  prosperity for the middle class.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 449,  H.R. 5895.
