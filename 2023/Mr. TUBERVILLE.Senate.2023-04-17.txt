 Madam President, this month, I am proud to  recognize U.S. Army Veteran Jason Guyton of Toney, AL.   Some of Jason's favorite childhood memories were trying on his dad's  Navy uniform and flipping through photo albums from his grandad's time  in the Navy. Even as a young boy, he recognized the importance of their  military service and admired their sacrifice.   After a successful wrestling career at Howard University, where he  became the first freshman in school history to compete for a NCAA  Division I Championship, Jason decided to follow in his dad and  grandad's footsteps. But instead of joining the Navy, Jason enlisted in  the U.S. Army Reserves as a chemical operations specialist, while also  keeping his day job as an operations manager at West Corporation.  During his time in the Reserves, Jason was deployed to Operation  Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, where he ensured sites were safe  from nuclear chemicals and biological threats.   Like many veterans, the challenges of serving our country did not end  after Jason's 12 years in the military. He experienced several personal  setbacks, causing him to fall on hard times financially and become  homeless. But thanks to his military training and support from  veterans' groups, Jason overcame his situation and channeled his  experience into a career in financial services.   Now, Jason serves as a member experience advocate for Avadian Credit  Union at its Huntsville location. He is very open about his struggles  because he wants other veterans to know that they, too, can overcome  any challenges they face after their military service.   Additionally, Jason is very active in Madison County, where he is  involved in several local outreach efforts. Although he is not an  Alabama native, after finding out Huntsville was the home of the U.S.  Space and Rocket Center through an Internet search, Jason decided he  wanted to call Madison County home. So he moved to the area nearly 30  years ago, and has been giving back ever since.   He uses his talents to coach wrestling for students between ages 5  and 12, serving as a positive influence for hundreds of athletes whom  he has mentored throughout the years. Jason says his greatest success  is watching those he has coached compete at a higher level.   And his influence doesn't end with being a coach. Jason's son, Tre,  also decided to join the Navy and become a fourth-generation  servicemember in the Guyton family. Jason's story is an example of  overcoming hardship and using it to help others, and we salute his  service to the Madison County community.                            ____________________
