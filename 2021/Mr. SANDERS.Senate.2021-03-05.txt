 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that for the  duration of the Senate's consideration of H.R. 1319, the American  Rescue Plan Act of 2021, the majority and Republican managers of the  bill, while seated or standing at the managers' desks, be permitted to  deliver floor remarks, retrieve, review, and edit documents, and send  email and other data communications from text displayed on wireless  personal digital assistant devices and tablet devices.   What do we think about that?   All right. I further ask unanimous consent that the use of  calculators be permitted on the floor during consideration of the bill;  further, that the staff be permitted to make technical and conforming  changes to the bill, if necessary, consistent with the amendments  adopted during Senate consideration of the bill.    Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 972.    I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the  amendment be dispensed with.    Madam President, I rise to offer an amendment to  increase the Federal minimum wage from a starvation wage of $7.25 an  hour to $15 an hour over a 5-year period.   As I think you know, Congress has not raised the minimum wage since  2007. The result of that is that half of our people are now living  paycheck to paycheck, and many, in fact, are working for wages that are  much too low in order to take care of their families. So, to my mind,  the American people in poll after poll and State after State understand  that we have to raise that minimum wage to a living wage of 15 bucks an  hour. I intend to do everything that I can to make that happen, and I  will be offering that amendment this morning.  [[Page S1220]]    Madam President, before I do that, let me begin my remarks by  explaining why this reconciliation bill that we are debating today, the  American Rescue Plan, is so enormously important that it must be passed  and must be passed as quickly as possible, in my view. This legislation  is the most consequential and significant legislation for working  families that Congress has debated for many, many decades.   Now, why is that?   The answer is that, as I think all Americans know, the last year that  we have gone through has been, in so many ways, the very worst year in  our lifetimes. That is what it has been. The working families of our  country today are hurting in a way that they have not hurt since the  Great Depression, and they want their government to hear their pain and  come to their aid, and that is not too much to ask.   There are a lot of folks in this country--there are estimates of  maybe 30 to 40 percent of Americans--who have literally given up on  democracy. They are moving toward authoritarianism. They are hurting.  Their kids are hurting. Their parents are hurting. They look to  Washington for help in their democratic society, and they don't see  Washington responding. What they see year after year are policies which  make the very, very rich richer, which enable large, profitable  corporations to not pay a nickel in taxes, but for them, they face  eviction; they face hunger; they don't have healthcare; they can't  afford to send their kids to college. They are asking: Does anybody-- anybody--in Washington care about their lives?   So what today is about, in a very profound way, is whether or not we  stand with the working class of this country and say: Yes, we live in a  democratic society. We understand what you are going through, and we  are going to move as aggressively as we can to respond to your pain and  improve your lives.   This is not just a healthcare bill. It is not just an economic bill.  It is not just an educational bill. It is perhaps more than that. This  is a bill which will answer a profound question: Are we living in a  democratic society, where the U.S. Congress will respond to the needs  of working families rather than just the wealthy and large corporations  and their lobbyists? That is what today is about. It is dealing with  the pandemic. It is dealing with the economy. It is dealing with  education and so much more, but most importantly it is dealing with the  issue of whether or not we are hearing the pain that is out there and  if we are responding to it.   During the last year, as everybody knows, over 500,000 Americans have  died of COVID, and millions more have been made ill. Unbelievable. It  is unbelievable what we have gone through in terms of this terrible  pandemic. COVID has not only caused massive death and illness; it has  resulted in a way we have never experienced social isolation. That  means, all over this country, we have old people, elderly people, in  their homes. They can't interact with their grandchildren, with their  own kids, with their friends. You have young people who want to go to  school, who want to socialize, who want to date, who want to do things  that young people do. They can't do it and have been unable to do it  for the last year, and that has resulted in a very sharp increase in  mental illness in this country--something, by the way, that this  legislation also deals with. Many Americans, young and old and middle- aged, are now dealing with depression, anxiety disorder, addictions. We  are seeing the growth of addictions and even suicidal ideation. So this  has been just an awful year for people in our country and, in fact,  throughout the world.   This last year has not only been a public health crisis, as bad as  that has been. The pandemic, as we all know, has led to a terrible  economic downturn, which has resulted in millions of Americans losing  their jobs and their incomes, and it has led to the shutting down of  something like one out of four small businesses in this country. That  is just an unbelievable number. Go to any town in America, and you will  see its Main Street shuttered down. Thriving businesses no longer  exist. Real unemployment in this country today is now over 10 percent.   Further, countless Americans face the threat of eviction. We have a  moratorium on evictions, which is the right thing, but there is going  to be a day when that ends. People are saying: I am $5,000, $8,000 in  debt. What happens to me when the moratorium ends? How am I going to  pay my rent? Am I going to be one of the 500,000 people already  sleeping out on the streets?   Millions more--and we have seen this in Vermont, and I know the  Acting President pro tempore has probably seen it in Minnesota, for it  is all over this country--are lining up in their cars for food, and it  is something that none of us ever dreamed. It is right in my own  community of Burlington, VT--hundreds of people, while in their cars,  lining up for food. Many of them, never in a million years, would have  dreamed that they would be in that position. Today, the level of hunger  in America is at the highest level it has been in decades.   Then, on top of all of that, we are in the midst of a pandemic.  People are scared to death about coming down with COVID. Yet, because  of our dysfunctional healthcare system, we have over 90 million people  who are uninsured or underinsured in the midst of a pandemic.   It is not only the public health crisis we worry about; it is not  only the collapse of our economy that we have to worry about; it is  what is happening to our young people because the pandemic has created  a massive disruption in our educational system, from childcare through  graduate school. The majority of our young people have seen education  disrupted. Think about all of the implications of what that means. It  is likely that hundreds of colleges in America, which were struggling  before the pandemic, will cease to exist.   So you have the public health crisis with a half a million people  dead, an economic crisis with real unemployment at 10 percent and small  businesses going out of business, and an educational crisis.   Meanwhile, in the midst of all of that, it is important to note that  not everybody in this country is hurting. What we are seeing, in the  midst of massive income and wealth inequality, is a moment when, in  fact, that gap between the very, very rich and everybody else is  growing wider. Incredibly, during this pandemic, over 650 billionaires  in America have increased their wealth by more than $1 trillion. The  50--five zero--richest people in America now own more wealth than the  bottom half of American society, some 160 million people.   So the bottom line here is very simple: In this moment of  unprecedented crises, the U.S. Senate must respond to the pain of  working families all across this country, and we must respond in an  unprecedented way, which is what this legislation is about.   Now I want to say a few words about some of what is in this bill.  This is a 600-page bill, and I will not read it all again. I think our  clerks had enough fun reading it last night, but I do want to summarize  some of what is in it.   Most importantly, what the American people want is, they want to get  back to a normal life. They want their kids to go to school. They want  to go to work. They want their businesses open. And what the American  Rescue Plan does is enable us to aggressively crush this pandemic and  enable the American people to return to their jobs and their schools.   It will establish a national emergency program to produce the  quantity of vaccines that we need and get them into the arms of our  people as quickly as possible. Clearly, we are making progress in that  area. More and more people are getting vaccinated. But we still have a  lot of work to do, and this legislation will enable us to do that.   At a time when so many of our people are hurting, this legislation  will allow us to provide $1,400 in direct payment to every working- class person in this country and to their kids, and this is on top of  the $600 that we provided last month. So if you are out there and you  are a family of four earning less than $150,000 or an individual  earning less than $75,000, you are going to get that check for $1,400,  and for that family of four, that is $5,600.   Now, I know that to some that isn't a whole lot of money. You know,  5,600 bucks ain't that much. But for a family that is struggling right  now and can't pay their rent and can't feed their kids, that $5,600 for  a family of four could be the difference between desperation and  dignity.  [[Page S1221]]    Further, at a time when so many of our people are unemployed, this  Budget Reconciliation Act will provide $400 a week in supplemental  unemployment benefits to over 10 million Americans until the end of  August. If you are unemployed right now, you are worried--if your  unemployment check is your only source of income, you are worried that  it is going to cease, well, it is not. This legislation will continue  that check coming until the end of August.   This legislation understands that we have a childcare crisis in  America, and we provide the resources to provide childcare to 875,000  children.   And very importantly--we don't talk about this enough--one of the  absolute disgraces of our economy right now is the level of childhood  poverty in America, which is one of the highest for any major country  on Earth. This legislation will go a long way toward cutting childhood  poverty. Some studies suggest we are going to cut it in half by  expanding the child tax credit from $2,000 to $3,000 and $3,600 for  kids under the age of 6. In other words, we are about to cut childhood  poverty in half in this country.   This legislation, obviously, deals with the horror of so many of our  people facing hunger. We put in very substantial amounts of money for  nutrition assistance for working families, for kids, for the disabled,  and the elderly.   This legislation will provide rent relief, utility assistance, and  mortgage assistance to millions of tenants and homeowners who are in  danger of eviction and foreclosure.   This legislation will protect the pensions of many millions of  workers who are in danger of seeing their retirement benefits cut by as  much as 65 percent.   Not only is this $1.9 trillion emergency COVID relief package the  right thing to do for people from a moral perspective, it is exactly  what the overwhelming majority of the American people want us to do.   The American people didn't want us to give tax breaks to  billionaires. The American people did not want, as the Republicans  fought to do, throw 30 million people off the Affordable Care Act. The  American people didn't want that, but that is what the Republicans  tried to do under reconciliation.   Well, we have a different idea. Yeah, we are going to use  reconciliation, which requires only 51 votes. We are going to use it,  not for tax breaks for the rich, not to throw people off of healthcare  but to provide the help that working-class people need all across this  country.   Madam President, I am introducing, as I mentioned earlier,  legislation--an amendment--today to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks  an hour.   Because of an unfortunate and, in my view, misguided decision by the  Parliamentarian, this reconciliation bill does not include an increase  in the minimum wage to $15 an hour. In my view, it should have, and I  think the Parliamentarian was dead wrong.   But more importantly, it is an absurd process that we allow an  unelected staffer, somebody who works for the Senate, not elected by  anybody, to make a decision as to whether 30 million Americans get a  pay raise or not. I don't care how the Parliamentarian rules. No  Parliamentarian should have that power.   If people here want to vote against raising the minimum wage, you  have that right. You want to vote for it, and I hope you do, you have  that right. But we should not shuffle off that responsibility to an  unelected staffer. That is wrong.   The amendment I am offering today to raise that minimum wage to $15  an hour is cosponsored by Majority Leader Schumer, and I thank him for  his strong support; Senator Patty Murray, who is the chair of the  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee; Senator Ron Wyden,  who is the chair of the Finance Committee; and many others in this  Chamber.   In fact, this amendment is similar in many ways to the legislation  that I have offered which is cosponsored by 38 Members of the Senate.   And let us not forget, this legislation was passed in the House, and  I want to thank my friends and colleagues in the House Progressive  Caucus for their extraordinary leadership on this issue.   This amendment is supported by some 300 national organizations,  including the AFL-CIO, and virtually all of the major unions in our  country. I want to thank in particular the SEIU, one of the great  unions in America, who have led this effort for years in terms of the  Fight for $15, where people working in McDonald's and Burger King have  gone out on strike and said: No, we can't make it on 10 bucks an hour,  11 bucks an hour. I want to thank the SEIU.   And this legislation will help workers all across the board, but it  will significantly help women who are unfortunately forced into low- income work more than the general population, more than men, and it  will disproportionately help African Americans and Latinos, who  disproportionately are forced into low-income work. This legislation is  supported not only by 300 organizations but by groups like the  Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. They understand that  if we are going improve the standard of living of the African-American  community, we ought to raise that minimum wage.   It is supported by the National Organization for Women because,  again, this raising the minimum wage is a women's issue in a very  significant way--not totally, believe me. There are a lot of men out  there who are working for 9, 10, 11 bucks an hour, but  disproportionately it impacts women.   It is supported by Unidos and other Latino organizations. It is  supported by the American Association of University Women, supported by  Indivisible, Justice for Migrant Women, the National Domestic Workers  Alliance, and the National Women's Law Center.   Here is the simple truth, and that is that in the richest country in  the history of the world, we can no longer tolerate millions of our  workers being unable to feed their families because they are working  for starvation wages. And that is not what I say, although I do say it;  it is what the President of the United States says. He very, very  strongly supports raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and I thank  him for his support.   You know, when we look at the economy, people look at the stock  market, and they look at a whole lot of indices out there, but at the  end of the day, we have to ask ourselves: What is going on in the lives  of ordinary people? It is not acceptable to me that half of our people  are living paycheck to paycheck and millions of people are trying to  get by on 9, 10, 11 bucks an hour. And do you know what? You can't do  that. You can't do that in Vermont, and you can't do it in California,  and you can't do it in Minnesota. You can't do that. Our job is to make  sure that we have an economy that works for all and not just for the  few, and in order to do that, we are going to have to raise that  minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour.   Frankly, it is disgraceful that Congress has not passed an increase  in the minimum wage since 2007. Think of all the things that have  transpired since then. But Congress has not raised the minimum wage  since 2007.   The reality is that the minimum wage has lost over 30 percent of its  purchasing power since 1968. The minimum wage is worth a lot less now  than it used to be. When we increase the minimum wage, we will be  giving over 32 million Americans a much needed pay raise.   Let's be clear. Raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour is an  enormously popular idea. More than 60 percent of the American people,  in poll after poll, support raising the minimum wage.   Since 1998--this is really amazing. You know, I have some friends  here who are nervous: Oh, my goodness, how radical can it be? Should we  raise the minimum wage? Oh, my God, I am scared of the American  Restaurant Association.   Well, since 1998, every time a State has had an initiative on the  ballot to raise the minimum wage, it has won. In conservative States,  in progressive States, put it on the ballot, it wins.   Just as one example, in November, just this last November, election  time, Joe Biden lost Florida. Donald Trump won Florida by three points.  But in that same election, the people of Florida--and I say that to the  two Senators from Florida--61 percent of the people in Florida voted to  raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. Florida voted for Donald  Trump and voted to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.   Eight States--over the years, 8 States and over 40 cities have  adopted  [[Page S1222]]  laws to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour. It is not a radical  idea.   And, as you know, over just a few days ago, the House of  Representatives did the right thing and voted to raise the minimum wage  to $15 an hour. This is not a radical idea. People want it. States have  done it. The House of Representatives has done it, and now it is our  turn to do what the American people want.   Now, in the last few days, I have heard some concerns from my  colleagues about one part of our amendment, and that is the provision  to raise the tip wage, which now stands--I want everybody to hear  that--the tip wage for waiters and waitresses and all those people who  get tips now stands at $2.13 an hour. No, you did not mishear me--$2.13  an hour. That is the Federal minimum wage for waiters and waitresses,  for barbers, for hairstylists, for parking attendants, and others. That  tip minimum wage has not been raised since 1991, 30 years ago.   You think maybe it is time to raise the tip wage from $2.13 an hour,  passed 30 years ago? I think so. The proposal in this legislation would  raise that tip wage from $2.13 an hour to $14.95 over a 7-year period.   Now, time and again, our legislation gets misrepresented. People say:  Oh, you are raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour tomorrow. No, we  are not. The tip wage is going to take 7 years. For better or worse,  that is what it is.   Now, the National Restaurant Association, a very powerful lobbying  organization, has suggested to Members of Congress that this  legislation is opposed by restaurant workers and would be harmful to  their interests. This is not true.   One Fair Wage, an organization representing service employees, has  just delivered to the White House a petition with 140,000 signatures  from service workers who are demanding that they receive the same  minimum wage as every other worker in their State.   Polling among service employees and nonservice employees also  supports the reality that Americans want our waiters and waitresses and  other service employees to get a fair minimum wage.   Now, I heard from some people that those people who are working in  the service industry are doing really well, you know, and they don't  want an increase in the Federal minimum wage. The tips that they are  receiving are covering all of their needs. ``Leave well enough alone,''  they say. Well, today, 70 percent of tipped workers are women who  suffer from three times the poverty rate of the rest of the U.S.  workforce. They are not doing so well. They use food stamps at double  the rate of the general workforce and suffer, by the way, from the  highest rates of sexual harassment of any industry because they must  tolerate inappropriate customer behavior to get the incomes that they  need.   Further--and this is important, and I want all of my colleagues to  hear this. The idea of moving tipped wages to the same level as the  overall minimum wage is not a radical idea. It has been done in State  after State. It already exists in seven States in our country,  including California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Montana, Alaska, and  Minnesota. I should point out that all of those States experienced a  growth in the number of small businesses and restaurants after they  abolished the tipped minimum wage. And guess what. Waiters and  waitresses in these States received more tips, not less, and let's be  clear: This pandemic has made a bad situation worse for waiters and  waitresses.   So, right now, it is absolutely imperative that we raise that minimum  wage to a living wage for all of our workers and that we raise the  tipped wage as well, which is already law in seven States of the  country right now.   And I see the Senator from California, Mr. Padilla, and we are  delighted that he is joining us. And his State has been one of the  leaders in this country in raising the minimum wage, and I would yield  the floor to him for his remarks.    Mr. President, my colleague, the ranking member, Senator  Graham, says: Why?--$1.9 trillion, a lot of money. We have spent money  over the last year. He is right. Why did we spend the money? The answer  is because we are facing a series of unprecedented crises and because  the American people are reaching out to us, and they are saying: We are  hurting. We are in desperate condition, and we need help from the  Federal Government. That is why we are responding.   Half a million people have died in this country from COVID, and many  millions more have been made ill. And what the long-term impact of  those illnesses are nobody at this point knows, but certainly no one  will deny that we have a pandemic crisis.   Our job is to make sure that we produce the vaccines that the  American people desperately need and that we develop an effective  mechanism to get it into the arms of the American people. And the truth  is--I want to thank the President and his team--we have made progress  in the last month, but we still have a long, long way to go. To produce  the vaccines, to hire the people who will make sure that people get  those vaccines, inject people with the vaccines, it is going to take  money.   Everybody in this Senate and, I assume, in the country wants our kids  to get back to school. Well, you just can't open the schools unless  they are safe. Parents are not going to send their kids back to those  schools. Teachers are not going to teach. Childcare workers are not  going to provide the care that the little ones need.   And do you know what? To make those schoolrooms and school buildings  safe is going to require resources, but, for the sake of our children,  we need to reopen the schools as quickly as possible and do it in a  safe way.   There is money in this bill--Senator Graham didn't mention it--to  make sure that, this coming summer, school districts all over this  country have the resources to provide strong, well-staffed summer  programs so kids who have missed significant amounts of school can make  up some of what they have lost, in addition to getting some recreation  and associating with their fellow young people in a way that is safe.   There was a poll that came out just last week. It was rather shocking  at what it said. It said that 63 percent of the American people are  living paycheck to paycheck.   Senator Graham says: Why are we spending all of this money? The  answer is we don't believe that children in America should go hungry.  We don't believe that working people should be evicted from their  apartments or lose their homes. We don't believe that, in the midst of  a pandemic, people should not be able to afford to go to a doctor.   So making sure that people have those direct payments, yeah, we  believe in that. We believe that if a family is struggling today  through no fault of their own, having lost their income, yeah, we are  going to get them a check for 1,400 bucks and a family of four a check  for $5,600.   There are a lot of people in this country who are doing very well,  and they are wondering: What is this big deal about $1,400? That is not  a lot of money. You go to a corporate lunch, a bunch of people come in,  and they can spend $1,400 on a lunch.   But if you are struggling to put food on the table for your kids,  that $5,600 for a family of four is life and death; it is dignity or  desperation.   People are wondering: How am I going to pay the rent that I owe after  the rent moratorium, the eviction moratorium expires? How am I going to  feed my kids? How am I going to take care of the basic necessities of  life?   So, yes, we are providing $1,400 per working-class family because  that is desperately needed.   So when the Senator says: Well, why are we spending all of this  money? The answer is because we are living in the most difficult moment  in the modern history of this country and, arguably, even a more  difficult moment than the Great Depression of the 1930s. People are  hurting, and, in a democratic society, government is supposed to  respond to the people who sent us here.   Now, I know that there is controversy, and Senator Graham raised this  issue. Democrats have a majority, a bare majority with the Vice  President--51 votes. Why are we not working with our Republican  colleagues? We have reached out time and time and time again. The  President has reached out: Work with us. But you have got to understand  the severity of the crisis, and they have not done this.   Using reconciliation, by the way, as the Presiding Officer well  knows, is not a new idea. When our Republican colleagues had the  majority, they used reconciliation. What did they use it for? They used  it for massive tax breaks for the rich. That is what they used  reconciliation for. They used reconciliation in order to try to throw  32 million Americans off the Affordable Care Act, something that Trump  was fervent about. And by one vote--Senator McCain--we prevented 32  million people from losing their health insurance through the  reconciliation process.   So our response is, you want unity? Well, do you know what? We  probably have more unity today in America around this package than  anything that I can remember. The polls vary: 65, 70 percent of the  American people understand the crisis we are facing. They want us to  respond. This legislation is enormously popular, not just from  progressives, not from moderates, but from Republicans, as well,  depending on the poll.   Forty, fifty percent more Republicans support it because they can't  afford to pay their rent. They can't afford to go to the doctor. They  understand that government has to help.   So the real question here--and President Biden has raised this  issue--is, we believe in unity, we believe in bringing people together.  How does it happen that when 40, 50 percent of Republicans support this  legislation, we can't get one vote from Republicans here? What  [[Page S1230]]  is going on? And the answer is, I am afraid, that my Republican  colleagues have moved so far to the right that they have lost contact  with the needs of working families.   As I said earlier, this legislation is not just about dealing with  the pandemic and healthcare. It is not just dealing with the severe  economic downturn that we are facing. It is not just dealing with the  disruption of education in America and so much more. It is not just  dealing with the worst moment in the modern history of this country.  This amendment, this legislation, has everything to do with restoring  the confidence of the American people in democracy and in their  government. And if we can't respond to the pain of working families  today, we don't deserve to be here.   Senator Graham said it is going to be a long night. Bring it on. We  are ready. But at the end of the day, we are going to do what the  American people want, what the American people need. We are going to  pass the American Rescue Plan.    I yield back my time as well.    Mr. President, in accordance with section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of all  applicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections  of that act and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of amendment  No. 972, and I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, given the unprecedented series of crises  this country now faces, the Republican amendment simply does not  accomplish what the American people need or what they want.   Our bill would substantially expand the child tax credit and cut  child poverty in this country in half. Our bill provides a full $1,400  direct payment to every working-class adult and their kids. Under the  Collins amendment, if you are a single parent earning $50,000, you get  zero, nothing at all, while millions of children would receive just  $500 instead of the full $1,400 payment.   Our bill provides $130 billion to public schools so our kids can get  back to school and get back safely. The Republican alternative does  not.   Our plan provides $40 billion to colleges and universities, which  have already lost 650,000 jobs, and many are----   --cutting down. The Republican amendment simply does not  do what the American people need right now. I ask for a ``no'' vote.  Oh, I raise a point of order. I am sorry.                                Point of Order    Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment  produces budgetary changes that are merely incidental to the  nonbudgetary components of the amendment and therefore violates section  313(b)(1)(D) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.    Mr. President, President Biden is right. He canceled the  Keystone Pipeline because he is listening to the scientists, and what  the scientists are telling us is that we have a small number of years-- 5, 6, 7 years--before this country and this world face irreparable--I  underline the word ``irreparable''--harm because of climate change.   My friends here talk about creating jobs. Well, we all want to create  jobs. Do you know where the jobs are? The jobs are in energy  efficiency. The jobs are in sustainable energy. That is where the jobs  of the future are.   If we love our kids and if we love our grandchildren and if we want  to leave them a country and a planet that is healthy and is habitable,  yes, this country is going to have to lead the world, work with the  world, in transforming our energy system away from fossil fuel.   I urge opposition to this amendment.                                Point of Order    Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment is  not germane and therefore violates section 305(b)(2) of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974.    Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this  amendment. There are some people here who do not understand the crises  facing the American people. Sixty-three percent of our people today are  living paycheck to paycheck. Every day that we do not vaccinate  somebody, there is somebody unnecessarily dying. Our kids are not in  school. We are suffering a mental health epidemic.   This country is demanding that Congress act now and stand up for the  working families of this country. People are tired of obstructionism.  They are tired of delays. They want action. Let's do it.   I yield.                          Vote on Motions to Commit     Mr. President, my colleague from Florida may not know  it, but this is a budget, a $1.9 trillion reconciliation budget, which,  in fact, will turn out to be the most significant piece of legislation  for working people that has been passed in decades. Finally, Congress  is doing its job. Unfortunately, my friends on the other side have used  delaying tactics, after delaying tactics, and obstruction, obstruction,  obstruction.   The American people want action. They want action now. I urge my  colleagues to oppose this motion.                           Vote on Motion to Commit     Mr. President, I rise in support of the technical  amendment and in very strong support of the overall bill, the American  Rescue Plan.   Let's be clear. This bill that we are completing now is the most  significant piece of legislation that benefits working people in the  modern history of this country. Not only are we going to go forward to  crush this pandemic, to rebuild our economy, and to get our kids back  to school safely, we are going to do something even more important. We  are going to help restore faith in the U.S. Government among the people  of our country. The people are hurting, and today we responded.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired.   The question is on agreeing to the amendment.   The amendment (No. 1398) was agreed to.                    Vote on Amendment No. 891, As Amended    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to amendment  No. 891, as amended.   The amendment (No. 891), as amended, was agreed to.   The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a  third time.   The bill was read the third time    Mr. President, section 3001 of S. Con. Res. 5, the  fiscal year 2021 congressional budget resolution, allows the chairman  of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the allocations, aggregates,  and levels in the budget resolution for legislation considered under  the resolution's reconciliation instructions.    I find that Amendment 891 fulfills the conditions found in section  3001 of S. Con. Res. 5. Accordingly, I am revising the allocations for  the reconciled committees and other enforceable budgetary levels to  account for the budgetary effects of the amendment.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables, which provide  details about the adjustments, be printed in the Record.    There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                      REVISION TO ALLOCATION TO SENATE COMMITTEES     (Pursuant to Section 302 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and Section 3001 of S.

The material follows:                                 Finalists           ALEXANDER SHRIVER, BRATILEBORO UNION HIGH SCHOOL, SENIOR         On November 8th, 2016, the American people exercised their       most basic democratic freedom and decided to elect Hillary       Clinton as their President. According to CNN Politics,       Clinton won the majority of the 138 million votes cast. If       U.S. democracy stayed true to its ideal of equality, Clinton       would have been elected. Instead, the 2.9 million votes which       gave Clinton the edge meant nothing--those voices unheard and       disrespected. Donald Trump was placed in office.        Writing the Constitution, the founding fathers struggled to       find a fair way to elect a President and ultimately created       the Electoral College. Instead of relying on a popular vote,       this system, along with the infamous Three-fifths Compromise,       was built to appease the opposition of southern slaveholders       worried the more populous North would control the country and       outlaw slavery. Since its inception, it has contradicted the       peoples' decision in five elections, including 2016.        As horrible as its origins are, some argue that the       Electoral College still protects the interests of smaller       states where people might not otherwise be heard. They argue       the antiquated system forces candidates to campaign in less       populous areas, protecting their importance. However, the       Electoral College does not fulfill this purpose. Consider the       areas Donald Trump visited in his 2020 campaign: he never       traveled to states like Vermont, Wyoming, North Dakota, Rhode       Island, or Montana. This is the kind of disproportionate       attention the Electoral College is supposed to prevent, but       because of their low vote count and poll's suggesting a large       polarization towards one candidate, these states were not       prioritized.        330 million people live in the U.S., almost none of whom       have had any sort of interaction with a presidential       candidate. Most citizens learn about presidential campaigns       through the media, online campaigning, and events like       nationally televised debates. Therefore, even if the       Electoral College did force equal attention to every state,       it makes no difference because of the manner in which       citizens make their voting decisions.        In the Electoral College, some votes count for more than       others. Each state has two voting delegates from the Senate       and at least one member in the House of Representatives       regardless of their population, automatically giving smaller       states more voting power. According to the University of       North Carolina, a vote in Alaska is about 2.42 times more       valuable than the average vote, while a Californian vote is       only 87% as valuable as the average. Furthermore, in states       where the vast majority of people vote the same way, each       individual vote is less important than in a more politically       diverse state. Because its original purpose of protecting       small states is unnecessary, the Electoral College only       serves to devalue some votes.        The best solution to promote a more pure democracy is to       amend the Constitution to replace the Electoral College with       a popular vote. The only factor in determining the President       would be the will of the people. There are many ways the       American democracy needs to improve, so let's start with its       most fundamental institution.                  STEPHIE SIKI, WINOOSKI HIGH SCHOOL, SENIOR                                 Antiracism         ``To be black and conscious of anti black racism is to       stare into the mirror of your own extinctions'' by lbram X.       Kendi. The assassination of George Floyd showed me that my       life could also be taken away at the knees of a police       officer. As a black woman, it felt as if I had a danger in my       chest, that I couldn't pull out, I could only watch it bleed       for nine and a half minutes. Despite the horrendous police       brutality, I believe that our generation has the power to       remove racist thoughts, beliefs, and actions in this world.       The only way to remove racism is to become an antiracist.        My definition of antiracist is someone that actively       chooses to be against racism. It takes learning about       structural racism and one's own implicit bias and privilege.       According to PNAS, Between the ages of 25 and 29, black men       are killed by police at a rate between 2.8 and 4.1 per       100,000. Stephan Clark, a young man that was standing in his       grandmother's yard, holding a mobile phone. The police shot       him 20 times, they assumed Clark was holding a weapon because       his skin is seen as a weapon. This type of scenario is not       the first nor is it the last unless we change it as a       country. Based on the National Equity Project, Structural       racialization refers to institutional practices and       structural arrangements that lead to racialized inequities       Equity is when every individual or group of people receives       the right amount of support based on their needs. We need to       work on providing racial equity in our country.        Since the minority communities have been built to be       inferior to be majority communities, it is hard to survive in       a crisis. We have to understand the 400 years of nightmares       black people have lived through because it impacts our lives.       Based on The Washington Post, black Americans were 37% more       likely to die from Covid19 than whites. As a black woman,       this statistic scares me because it is implying that my race       will be the reason I am more likely to die from Covid19 and       not my health. As a member of The Winooski Students for Anti       Racism, we are demanding that SRO officers be removed from       our school because of the institutional racism the police       system was built on. Two thousand twenty was the last march       to demand BLACK LIVES MATTER, my life matters.        We have to mandate Culture and Community class for middle       and high school. That class will focus on teaching students       about race, racism, identity, equity, biases, privilege, and       slavery. We need social workers accompanying police officers       to a situation believed to be racially motivated. We also       need to support anti racist organizations in the U.S.A.       Encourage states to at least have one organization that       prioritizes anti racism. In order to save the world from this       racist pandemic, we have focused on targeting racism.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  following staff members from my staff and from Senator Graham's staff  be given all-access floor passes for the consideration of the bill:   Majority staff: Michael Jones, Joshua Smith, Michael Lawliss, Melissa  Kaplan-Pistiner, and Ari Rabin-Havt.
