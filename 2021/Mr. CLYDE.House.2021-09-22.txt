 Madam Speaker, I stand before you today on behalf of our  Nation's unborn children, children, let me remind you, with heartbeats  at 6 weeks, with fingers and toes at 10 weeks, and with the ability to  feel and react to pain as early as 12 weeks. For too long, our Nation's  leaders have tolerated the murder of millions of our precious children  through cruel and painful abortions. Madam Speaker, this cruelty and  insanity must stop.   Many States have passed legislation to protect both these unborn  babies and their mothers, but my Democratic colleagues are actively  attempting to undermine and overturn these protections through H.R.  3755, the Abortion on Demand Until Birth Act.   In addition, the bill disregards the conscience rights of millions of  Americans. An Associated Press poll released in June of this year shows  that up to 66 percent of adults believe abortions should be illegal in  the second trimester and up to 81 percent in the third trimester. Yet  H.R. 3755 is set in direct contradiction to the beliefs of the people  as it allows for full-term abortions for any reason under the bill's  all-inclusive health clause.   The abortion on demand bill is murder in the first degree.   Madam Speaker, it is impossible to justify the murder of a precious  child in the womb. We all know that it is wrong to take innocent life,  and no amount of slick talk will make it right.   The scientific community has made great advancements through modern  medicine and patient care practices to extend longevity for those who  could not otherwise survive on their own, both old and young.   At the time of Roe v. Wade, the average life expectancy for a man was  close to 68 years and for a woman 75 years. Today, the average life  expectancy is 78 years for men and nearly 83 for women. These are  significant increases thanks to modern medicine.   Such scientific and medical advancements have also proven viability  for many infants born as early as 21 weeks gestational age, a feat that  was nearly impossible at the time of Roe v. Wade or Planned Parenthood  v. Casey. We also now know that a heartbeat exists at 6 weeks.   While science is ever improving, the moral and ethical considerations  are crystal clear: To end an innocent human life is to end a heartbeat.  That is murder.   I firmly believe that life begins at conception, and speaking  objectively, I ask you this: What better scientific metric to determine  the existence of life than the presence of a heartbeat? You have a  heartbeat, and I have a heartbeat. We both are alive. A heartbeat means  life. When a heartbeat ceases, then life ceases. So when a heartbeat is  present, we know there is life. When two heartbeats are present, a mom  and her child, we know there are two lives.   Madam Speaker, a heartbeat is a defining evidence of life.   A small child and an aged adult alike can both wrap their minds  around the fact that a heartbeat equals life, and that to end a  heartbeat is to end life.   This bill, H.R. 3755, ends heartbeats, so it ends life. The  Declaration of Independence says: ``We hold these Truths to be self- evident, that all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by their  Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life,  Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. That to secure these Rights,  Governments are instituted among Men . . . ''   Life is the first of the unalienable rights mentioned in the  Declaration of Independence. And to secure these rights, government is  instituted. To protect life is our first responsibility. We cannot  ignore this. We must not ignore this.   Therefore, I encourage my colleagues to reject H.R. 3755 and join me  in standing for the sanctity of life, for the preservation of the most  innocent heartbeats in America. Soli Deo gloria.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr.  Johnson).   Mr. Speaker, everyone sees it on the news. No one can legitimately  deny it. Our country is going through the worst immigration crisis in  the country.   Now, statistics reported by Customs and Border Patrol show that, in  August 2021, our frontline border agents encountered 208,000 illegal  migrants. That is a 317 percent increase from August 2020, just 1 year  ago.   In total, over 1.3 million illegal aliens have crossed our border  this year alone, and we are on track to reach almost 2 million by the  end of the calendar year. We do not have a secure border.   Now, with the continued failure of the administration to fully use  Title 42 authority to expel illegal immigrants and reduce the spread of  COVID-19, it is not just border communities facing the consequences of  the Biden administration's policies; it is every community. Every State  is now a border State thanks to the administration's open border  policies that have green-lighted drug smugglers, human trafficking, and  other criminal enterprising that are finding their way into our  communities.   Instead of using the Federal Government and the resources at its  disposal to protect American citizens, the White House and my Democrat  colleagues are doing nothing, failing to even call what we continue to  witness at the border a crisis.   Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. We must finish the wall to control the  crisis at our southern border, and then we must consistently implement  our immigration laws. Americans deserve nothing less.
