 Mr. Speaker, Black history is American history. As Black  History Month begins, all across the country we see radical, rightwing  elected officials attempting to whitewash American history and ban  Black history from being taught in our classrooms.   This is, Mr. Speaker, unmasked white supremacy at its core. You  cannot teach the truth about American history without Black history.  [[Page H744]]    This should be alarming to many of us in this Chamber, especially as  we fight for a more inclusive multiracial democracy.   I am reminded of the need for Congress to pass critical legislation  like Congressman Bowman's African American History Act.   It is now more important than ever and very timely that, again, we  make sure that we teach our history accurately. The truth must always  be taught and should inspire all of us to continue to march for  freedom, equity, and justice for all in the spirit of our civil rights  leaders and our social justice seekers who came before us.   We cannot, Mr. Speaker, rob our children of learning the role of  systemic racism in our American history and how it continues to impact  the lives of many of our neighbors across the country.   This is how we support our communities to gain unity, to embrace  diversity. It is critical that we tell the truth about our Nation's  past, and that includes reckoning with our history of racism,  enslavement, segregation, and redlining in our communities, and even  now with the Black Lives Matter movement in our country.   This painting, Mr. Speaker, is called Critical Race Theory by  Jonathan Harris, a local artist in Detroit. It is a powerful reminder  of the importance of teaching and preserving Black history. We cannot  allow anyone to erase Black history and the powerful legacies of our  civil rights warriors, many of which inspire me today.   We cannot learn from our past if our past is no longer being taught  in our education system.                            ____________________
