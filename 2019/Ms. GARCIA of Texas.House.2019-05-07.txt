 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the serious  threat that soaring costs of prescription drugs pose to the health and  well-being of families.   Americans spend more money on prescription drug prices per person  than any other country in the world. The problem has grown so much that  now Americans are paying more for out-of-pocket drugs every year than  for hospital care. These inflated prices are sapping the strength of  our economy and the health of our families.   However, this is a challenge, Mr. Speaker, we can begin to tackle in  this Congress this year. We can begin to fight this battle now by  targeting abusive barriers to entry for cheaper generic drugs and  taking steps to simplify pricing in our overly complicated system.   That is why, last week, my colleagues and I on the Judiciary  Committee voted to refer four bills for consideration that will give  generic drug manufacturers greater access to our markets, increase  competition, and save lives in the process.   I call on all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support  this bipartisan measure.                            ____________________
