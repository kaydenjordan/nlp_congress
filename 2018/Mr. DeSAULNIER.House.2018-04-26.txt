 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  service of a longtime Antioch, California, resident and friend, Ms.  Tique Lee Caul.   Tique was a single mother, worked full-time, attended classes at  Laney College, and served as a volunteer with Habitat for Humanity. She  was a trailblazer and a woman who wore many hats. She also sat on  multiple boards, including Toastmasters and Black Women Organized for  Political Action.   She was a true stalwart of our community, active with volunteers in  many efforts. She enjoyed supporting others in their personal  transformation and goal attainment.   A mother of five beautiful children, a successful realtor, Tique was  a shining light until the very end. She will be sincerely missed by her  family, friends, everyone who knew her, and our community.                            ____________________
