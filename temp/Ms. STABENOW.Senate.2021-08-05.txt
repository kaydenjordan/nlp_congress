 Mr. President, I just wanted to lend words and support  to what Majority Leader Schumer just said about Rich Trumka.   I send my prayers and love to Barbara, his family, and everyone in  the labor movement.   What a strong, vibrant, committed leader. We have worked together on  so many different issues, and it was always about: Is this going to  create good-paying jobs? Are workers going to be able to have their  voice in the workplace? Is their standard of living going to increase?  What are we doing for folks? Are we bringing jobs home? Are we creating  jobs here? What are we doing for the backbone of our country, which are  working men and women?   So I just want to indicate my profound sadness and shock and my love  and support for all of those who I know are very sad and grieving at  this moment.   Thank you.
