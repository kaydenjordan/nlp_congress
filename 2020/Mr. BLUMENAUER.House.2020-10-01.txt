 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  Independent Restaurant Coalition who have been my partners on the  RESTAURANTS Act that is currently being negotiated between the Speaker  and the White House. This coalition has willed this legislation into  effect.   It is comprised of chefs Jose Andres, Nina Compton, Andrew Zimmern,  Tom Colicchio, Naomi Pomeroy, Gregory Gourdet, Erika Polmar, Bobbie  Stuckey, Robert St. John, and Will Guidara.   Mr. Speaker, these key leaders have represented 500,000 independent  restaurants across America and their 11 million workers. They are sort  of the point of the spear for the 180-member steering committee who  have extended themselves in an extraordinary fashion in helping craft  targeted legislation. They make the case to the American public that  restaurants--independent restaurants--are the cornerstone and the very  fabric of our communities.   It is hard to imagine your city or mine, Mr. Speaker, without these  independent restaurants. For many people it is the first job that they  get. They are representative of minorities, and they are  disproportionately women-owned. They have an energy and a vitality.  They provide an area for Americans to come together. In the time of  COVID-19, we miss that opportunity to gather, and we need to take  action to make sure that they remain in business.    That is what the coalition has done. Uniting behind the RESTAURANTS  Act, they have made the case to people all across the country. They  have driven Members in the House and the Senate to cosponsor  legislation--well over 200 in the House and 40 companion bills in the  Senate--making the case that there is something that we can do.   The need here is to have a tailored approach. Without something  specific for independent restaurants, we face 85 percent of them  closing their doors permanently by the end of the year. The restaurant  industry of these independent restaurants are the hardest hit segment  of the American economy. In April alone they accounted for half the  unemployed.   We have united behind a proposal of $120 billion in direct grants to  restaurants. The PPP simply isn't working for them. It is too  cumbersome; the time constraints don't work; and, as a practical  matter, we don't need to change the format that we have developed. We  have extensive research that documents if we are able to extend this  $120 billion lifeline to the independent restaurants, then we will  avoid over $183 billion of costs for unemployment and having these  institutions file bankruptcy rather than paying their taxes. They  support the supply chains in every community. That includes not just  the restaurant workers and owners but deals with the people who supply  them with the linens, the fruits, the vegetables, and the wine. This is  an extensive supply chain that stretches throughout the local economy.   The good news is that we have progress. The Heroes Act includes the  RESTAURANTS Act in its entirety with the full $120 billion. Yesterday  there was extensive discussion with our leadership and the White House.  We had earlier conversations in the White House with leaders from the  Independent Restaurant Coalition. I heard from Will Guidara from New  York City about the interaction he had with Secretary Mnuchin, and  President Trump was there as a part of it.   This is something that we can do. We can come together, support this  provision in the Heroes Act, and negotiate out in terms of the final  package to make sure that we protect this lifeline for these vital  institutions for all our communities.   I deeply appreciate the interest and momentum that has been developed  in both the House and Senate; the people who are stepping forward to  help their independent restaurants and the members of the coalition;  and, most of all, I want to thank the members of the coalition who  represent this critical industry and a potential solution to those  problems.                            ____________________
