 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, first, I would  like to thank the gentleman from the great State of Colorado (Mr.  Perlmutter), my good friend, for his extraordinary leadership, not only  on the Rules Committee, but on the Financial Services Committee, and  his work and support on this bill over a decade. So I thank him very  much.   Madam Speaker, I rise in very strong support of this rule which would  make a number of amendments in order, and I think would improve the  underlying bill. Most importantly, the rule would make in order the  Waters manager's amendment, which contains the text of Mr. Cleaver's  bill, called the COUNTER Act.   Mr. Cleaver is the chairman of the Subcommittee on National Security  and has been an exceptional leader on anti-money laundering issues. His  bill would make a number of improvements to the Bank Secrecy Act that  would protect our national security, make our anti-money laundering  regime more effective, and would reduce burdens on financial  institutions.   For example, the bill would close loopholes for high-risk commercial  real estate transactions and the transfer of arts and antiquities,  which we have heard testimony about in our committee.   It would also make modest increases to the threshold for currency  transaction reports, which was a compromise that Mr. Cleaver reached  with Mr. Loudermilk on the other side of the aisle. This would provide  financial institutions with regulatory relief, while also ensuring that  law enforcement has the information they need to catch bad actors who  are using our financial system to hide their illicit money.   Finally, the bill protects privacy by mandating a privacy and civil  liberties officer, as well as an innovation officer in each of the  Federal financial regulators. These officials are required to meet  regularly, to consult on Bank Secrecy Act policy and regulation.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Cleaver and Chairwoman Waters for  this amendment, which I strongly believe will make my bill better and  will improve the chances that it gets passed by the Senate and signed  into law.   This bill before us today, the underlying bill, H.R. 2513, would  crack down on illicit use of anonymous shell companies. This is one of  the most pressing national security problems we face in this country,  because anonymous shell companies are the vehicle of choice for money  launderers, criminals, and terrorists.   Coming from New York, I am particularly concerned about cracking down  on terrorism financing. Because of the importance of this bill, it has  been endorsed by every single law enforcement agency in our country.  They say that passing this bill will help them protect American  citizens, Americans, visitors, anyone in our country.   Madam Speaker, I include in the Record a listing of all of the law  enforcement agencies that support this bill, and it also has wide  support from stakeholders, major stakeholders in our country from the  business community, the NGOs, and the not-for-profit community.

MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, this is a win-win  for protecting our citizens, and like every national security issue, it  should have strong bipartisan support. If you care about protecting  American citizens, you should be supporting this bill.                                time  1245     MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I thank the  gentlewoman for yielding and for her leadership on the Financial  Services Committee and on this bill.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 2513, the Corporate Transparency  Act. This bill would crack down on the illicit use of anonymous shell  companies. This is one of the most pressing national security problems  that we face as a country because anonymous shell companies are the  vehicle of choice for money launderers, criminals, and terrorists.   The reason they are so popular is because they cannot be traced back  to their true owners. Shell companies allow criminals and terrorists to  move money around in the United States financial system and finance  their operations freely and legally.   Unfortunately, we know that the U.S. is one of the easiest places in  the entire world to set up an anonymous shell company. The reason why  these shell companies are anonymous is because States do not require  companies to name their true beneficial owners, the individuals who are  collecting the profits and who outright own the company.   As any FBI agent or prosecutor will tell you, far too many of their  investigations hit a dead-end at an anonymous shell company. They know  there is illegal money, yet they can't pursue and stop it.   Because they can't find out who the real owner of that shell company  is, they can't follow the money past the shell company, past this pile  of cash that they know is financing illegal activity. The trail goes  cold, and the investigation is stopped dead in its tracks.   Treasury actually conducted a pilot program a couple of years ago  when they collected beneficial ownership information for real estate  transactions in Manhattan and Miami over a 6-month period. The results  were stunning.   Treasury found that about 30 percent of the transactions reported in  those 6 months involved a beneficial owner or purchaser representative  that had previously been the subject of a suspicious activity report.  In other words, these were potentially suspicious people buying these  properties. And this was after the Treasury Department had announced to  the world through the press that they would be collecting beneficial  ownership information in these two cities for 6 months, so this didn't  even capture the money launderers who simply avoided those two cities  for that 6-month period.   Our bill would fix this problem by requiring companies to disclose  their true beneficial owners to the Financial Crimes Enforcement  Network, or FinCEN, at the time the company is formed. This information  would only be available to law enforcement and to financial  institutions so they can comply with their know-your-customer rules.   This bill would plug a huge hole in our national security defenses  and would be a massive benefit to law enforcement.   We have a very large coalition supporting the bill. We have the  support of 127 NGOs. All of the law enforcement groups in our Nation  support this bill, all of the banking trade associations, the credit  union trade associations, human rights groups, antitrafficking groups,  State secretaries of state, and  [[Page H8318]]  most of the real estate industry, and many more because law enforcement  has said that enacting this bill will make our residents and our  country safer.   I want to specifically thank the FACT Coalition, Global Witness, and  Global Financial Integrity for their support. I want to thank the Bank  Policy Institute, which has been a strong supporter from the beginning.  And I want to thank my personal staff, especially Ben Harney.                                time  1415    I also want to thank my Republican partners on this bill, most  notably Peter King from New York and Blaine Luetkemeyer from Missouri.  They have been both fantastic to work with, and I believe the changes  that they negotiated in good faith on this bill have made it an even  better bill.   The two people I want to thank the most are Congresswoman Waters, who  has been a steadfast supporter of this bill for years, and Congressman  Cleaver, who has worked so hard on the COUNTER Act, which has been  added to this bill. His leadership on the anti-money laundering reforms  in the COUNTER Act have been indispensable.   Mr. Chairman, this bill will make our country safer, and I urge a  strong ``yes'' vote for this bill.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, critics on the other  side of the aisle have made wild claims about the bill costing small  businesses millions of dollars. But in the U.K., where they already  collect this information, the cost of compliance for the average small  business was only about $200, and that is a one-time cost. To me, that  is a very modest price to pay for national security.   Every law enforcement agency in this country is asking for this  reform, in order to make us safer.   In the U.K., the median company had 1.1 owners, which means that the  vast majority of small businesses only have one owner, so that these  businesses only have to file one name.   We are asking for only four pieces of information, and it is basic:  name, date of birth, current address, and driver's license.   Does that sound burdensome? For most small business owners, it would  take less than 5 minutes to fill out the form.   According to studies, it was pointed out earlier, you have to  disclose more information to get a library card than you need to  disclose to create a corporation or an LLC. And you don't hear people  complaining about filling out forms for library cards.   I think the idea that the disclosure would be unduly burdensome is  simply and completely false.   The bill also goes out of its way to exempt every category of  business that already discloses their beneficial owners, either to  regulators or the public filings. This includes banks, credit unions,  insurance companies, and investment advisers, brokers, utilities, and  nonprofits.   The bill even exempts companies with more than 20 employees and over  $5 million in revenues because, if you have 20 employees, you are  actually generating a significant amount of revenues and you are,  certainly, a real business and not a shell company that is being used  to launder money.   In fact, in almost all the cases where law enforcement has uncovered  a shell company that is being used for illicit purposes, the company  had either zero employees or one employee. That is why we felt very  comfortable exempting companies with more than 20 employees.   I think we have gone way out of our way to ensure that the bill is  appropriately tailored and is not burdensome to small businesses.   I would like to repeat that, usually, national security bills are  bipartisan, and I am proud that we had significant support in the vote  from our friends on the other side of the aisle. I urge my colleagues  on both sides of the aisle to support this important bill that will  make our citizens safer, will help law enforcement do their jobs, and,  therefore, will save lives in our country.   This is a serious bill. Most countries already have it, and we are  way behind. We are the money laundering capital of the world. It is  just plain common sense to protect our citizens.   Vote for national security, and vote for this bill.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I support this  amendment, which would simply require Treasury to submit an annual  report to Congress with basic statistics on the beneficial ownership  information that is filed under the bill.   This is very similar to a recent report that the U.K. conducted, that  they started collecting beneficial information. The U.K.'s report was  very helpful because it highlighted that the vast majority of companies  have only one beneficial owner, which makes compliance with the bill  extremely easy.   I think that the data that Treasury would be required to report to  Congress under this amendment would be helpful in case we decide that  we need to tweak the bill in the future to address any unforeseeable  future issues that arise.   So I want to thank the gentleman from Texas for offering the  amendment. I think it is a very good idea, and I urge my colleagues to  support it and to support the underlying bill, which will increase  national security for our country.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I support this  amendment, and I would like to thank Mr. Hill for offering it.   This amendment would require FinCEN to establish stringent procedures  to ensure the beneficial ownership information isn't being  inappropriately accessed or misused by law enforcement agencies.   I believe the underlying bill already addresses these issues-- certainly, it was the intent to protect against unauthorized access and  misuse of beneficial ownership information--but I am not opposed to  making that language even more explicit.   His amendment would also require FinCEN to submit an annual report to  Congress detailing the number of times beneficial ownership information  was accessed, either by law enforcement or by financial institutions.                                time  1515    I think this information would be very helpful because it would tell  us how useful the information is to both law enforcement and financial  institutions. So while Mr. Hill and I have had disagreements over this  bill, I think this amendment is a helpful addition to the bill, and I  want to thank him for offering it.   I urge my colleagues to support it and the underlying bill.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I rise as the  designee of the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin) to offer amendment  No. 4.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is  a clarifying amendment. It would clarify that FinCEN can actually use  the beneficial ownership information it is collecting under the bill.  This was always our intent, but we were concerned that because FinCEN  technically isn't a law enforcement agency, their authority to use the  information under the bill might be unclear.   Mr. Levin's amendment fixes this by explicitly stating that FinCEN  can use the information to issue public advisories and to share the  information with financial institutions in order to improve compliance  with their know-your-customer rules. However, FinCEN would only be able  to disclose the information in an aggregated format so that it protects  the disclosure of personally identifiable information.   I want to thank Mr. Levin for working closely with my office and with  the committee on this amendment. I urge my colleagues to support the  amendment and the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I have no further  speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I thank the  chairwoman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose this amendment, which would completely  gut the bill and would dramatically weaken our national security.   Right now, the only protection we have in place against bad actors  using anonymous shell companies to launder their money through the U.S.  is FinCEN's customer due diligence rule, which requires financial  institutions to find out the beneficial owners of the corporations and  the entities that open accounts with them.   The FinCEN rule, which is very important, is still only half a  measure. When FinCEN passed the rule, they explicitly said that  Congress still needed to pass the bill that is before us today.   Mr. Davidson's amendment would not only delete the underlying bill  but would also repeal the FinCEN rule. In other words, it is worse than  the status quo and practically invites criminals and money launderers  to use the U.S. financial system.   Mr. Chair, this is a deeply irresponsible amendment, and I strongly  urge my colleagues to oppose it and to support the underlying bill.
