 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Meeks for his unyielding  leadership on this important bill and Ranking Member McCaul for setting  a tone for this entire Congress that we succeed when we work together,  particularly in a cause as great as this, liberty for a country that  voted for independence. Thirty years ago, 90 percent of the people  voted to be independent of tyrannical Russia, and today now they are  fighting again.   The bipartisan nature of this bill today would warm the hearts of  great American leaders, like President and General Dwight D. Eisenhower  or General George Marshall or President John Kennedy or President  Ronald Reagan, because across Europe they fully understood how many  American lives were given to the cause of liberty so that we, their  descendants, would pass it on to our descendants.   We are here today in that fight because Ukraine is the scrimmage line  for liberty in Europe today. The valor of the people of Ukraine against  the Russian state is extraordinary. Our young people are learning what  the price of liberty is, sadly, and the people of Ukraine are inspiring  the world. We think so much of their valor, their fight, and their  desire to join the world of free nations. May God bless them and may  God bless America, and thank you for understanding a united America  always wins for liberty.    Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the PACT Act  that Chairman Takano and the Committee on Veterans' Affairs brought  before us today. I was very pleased to vote for it.   When those who go to serve our country abroad or even here at home  come back to civilian life, they often carry with them the injuries of  toxic exposure, such as burn pits, and we have a moral obligation for  their care.   Madam Speaker, to shift to a different subject, as we watch the  slaughter in Ukraine, I would urge the Government of the United States  and the President of the United States to mobilize our National Guard  Partnership for Peace programs across the various States. Ohio is  linked to Serbia and Hungary, and Illinois to Poland.   There are ways for us as a country to use idle aircraft, like C-130  sitting on the ground in this country, where the American people want  to donate blankets and bandages in ways of caring for those who are  being killed and injured, who are hungry in the Nation of Ukraine. That  is an unrealized asset we have.   We could do that overnight if we had the will to do it, the  Partnership for Peace, the State Partnership for Peace, which is part  of the U.S. Department of Defense under the National Guard Bureau.   Madam Speaker, I ask the President to help us help Ukraine.                            ____________________
