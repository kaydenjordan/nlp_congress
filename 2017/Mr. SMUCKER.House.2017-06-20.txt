 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of and to ask my  colleagues' support for H.R. 2866, the Reducing Unnecessary Barriers  for Relative Foster Parents Act.   I would like to first thank my friend and colleague from Pennsylvania  for his leadership and sponsorship of this bill. I would like to thank  the chair of the Ways and Means Committee, Representative Brady, and  members of the Ways and Means Committee for bringing this bill to the  floor, and I would like to thank my cointroducer of the bill,  Representative Sewell from Alabama, as well, for the work that she has  done in regards to foster care issues over the years.   Every child, Mr. Speaker, deserves a loving home; but when a child's  home is no longer safe, often because of abuse, neglect, or behavioral  issues, children are placed in foster homes. In fact, in 2015, more  than 670,000 American children--16,000 in Pennsylvania, the State,  including in my district, more than 16,000 there have spent time in  foster care.   Countless families across the country are willing and eager to accept  foster children into their homes, and research shows that placement  with relatives is better for the child. Therefore, Federal policy  should make it easier for foster children to be placed with family  members.   Our bill is being considered today on the floor, and again, I ask for  my colleagues' support. When it comes to finding loving homes for  children, this is a bipartisan issue. There are no Republicans or  Democrats, just mothers and fathers, aunts and uncles, and sons and  daughters who believe each child should have a bed to be tucked into at  night in a loving home.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to also note that the following  organizations have expressed support for H.R. 2866: the American  Academy of Pediatrics, the American Congress of Obstetricians and  Gynecologists, Child Welfare League of America, First Focus, March of  Dimes, and the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners.   Again, I would like to thank Representative Sewell from Alabama for  her work on foster care issues and for her leadership on this bill. We  really appreciate her work.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   I strongly support H.R. 2866, the Reducing Unnecessary Barriers for  Relative Foster Parents Act.   This important bill helps relative caregivers by requiring States to  examine whether their licensing standards align with the best practices  in licensing family foster homes. In so doing, H.R. 2866 requires  States to set reasonable requirements for family homes, standards that  consider community norms and cultural differences and standards that  remove artificial barriers to family care.   I have advocated these provisions within my own bill to improve  support for kinship caregivers, and I am proud to support Congresswoman  Sewell and Congressman Smucker's bill.   More than 25 percent of children in care live with a grandparent or  other relative. My congressional district has the highest percentage of  children living with grandparent caregivers in the Nation, followed  closely by two other congressional districts in Illinois.   In Illinois, 37 percent of all children placed in out-of-home care  are placed with relatives; however, less than half of these children  are placed with relatives in homes that are licensed.   The vast majority of relative caregivers are not able to become  licensed caregivers because the standards do not make sense with their  circumstances, such as requiring a grandmother in an expensive city  like Chicago to have one bedroom for each of her three grandbabies or  requiring her to take dozens of hours of parent training each year.   In 2008, I worked with Congressman Jerry Weller from Illinois to  allow States the ability to waive nonsafety licensing standards on a  case-by-case basis to help kinship caregivers via the Fostering  Connections Act. Unfortunately, many States chose not to exercise this  waiver authority to assist kin caregivers.   For example, in 2011, although Illinois had more than 3,600  nonlicensed relatives caring for youth, only 72 licensing waivers for  relatives were approved. Less than 2 percent received waivers.   H.R. 2866 requires States to modernize their licensing standards to  align with the best practices in licensing. This is a commonsense and  important change.                                time  1615    Further, this bill advances our goal of ensuring that States follow  the waivers to meet the best interests of the children. To understand  the use of waivers, Children's Bureau should collect data on State's  granting waivers for nonsafety licensing standards for relatives,  including the number of relatives applying for waivers, the number of  waivers issued or denied, and the reason for denial.   I strongly support H.R. 2866, the Reducing Unnecessary Barriers for  Relative Foster Parents Act and urge my colleagues to support it.   I reserve the balance of my time.
