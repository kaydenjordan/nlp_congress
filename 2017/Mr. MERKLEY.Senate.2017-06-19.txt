 Mr. President, will my colleague yield for a moment? The  majority leader has returned to the floor to hear a unanimous consent  request--actually two of them--which we will make very brief and then  yield back to the Senator from New Jersey.    Mr. President, this weekend, I was out doing townhalls  in rural Oregon. I was in Klamath County and Lake County--counties that  on any map would be described as solidly red. At my townhalls, people  were turning out with one huge anxiety; that is, the healthcare bill  that might be considered next week, with no consideration in committee,  no consideration for amendments, no opportunity for experts to weigh  in, and, most importantly, no opportunity for the citizens of America  to weigh in.   So two veterans came up to me after one of the townhalls, at the  Paisley Saloon, and they asked: Does DC understand the despair, the  anxiety in rural Oregon over this healthcare bill plan? The answer, of  course, at this point is no, but we hope the answer will be yes.   Then I was visiting a nursing home, and two different individuals I  spoke to noted that virtually everyone on long-term care was there  through Medicaid. They said: You know, if we lose Medicaid, we are out  on the street. As one woman said: I will be out on the street, and I  can't walk so that is a problem. Well, yes, it is a problem for folks  on long-term care to be dumped onto the street.   That is why, at this moment, I am asking for our normal process for  any bill, any modest bill, but certainly a major bill to get thorough  democratic consideration in this beautiful, ``we the people,''  democratic Republic, and that means committee hearings, that means  experts testifying, and that means input from citizens.   Mr. President, that is why I ask unanimous consent that no motion to  proceed to Calendar No. 120, H.R. 1628, the American Health Care Act,  be in order until the bill has been the subject of executive session  meetings in the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions, during which amendments from the  majority and the minority have the opportunity to be presented and  considered, and the American people have the chance to weigh in, and  the bill has been reported favorably from the committee.    Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks from my  colleague from Wisconsin, who came here to champion the citizens of her  State and the citizens of all of America. As she spoke so passionately  about the need to make sure we have affordable, quality healthcare,  that is really the theme that we are talking about. That is the value  we are talking about, that in this great big, beautiful, wonderful  Nation, the United States of America, everyone should have access to  affordable, quality healthcare.   There are some colleagues here who do not share that value. They  consider healthcare to be a privilege for the wealthy--healthcare for  the wealthy, healthcare for the healthy--but not healthcare for all  Americans. They say: You can't afford healthcare? Too bad.   They have a plan of 13 Republicans meeting in secret--the secret 13-- even meeting in a room to which the hallway is not accessible to press  because they are afraid to have the cameras showing them as they go  into the room and out of the room. If you are ashamed to see yourself  going in and out of a room and for your constituents to see that,  shouldn't you be ashamed of what you are concocting? Shouldn't you  really wonder if you are doing the right thing in saying to your  constituents: I am not going to show you the bill because I know you  will not like it. I am going to keep it secret, and I am going to bring  it out at the last minute. I am going to employ a tactic that does not  belong in the Senate.   This is supposed to be a deliberative body--once called the world's  greatest deliberative body--but under this leadership, it is now the  body of zero deliberation, zero committee meetings, zero markups, zero  chance for the public to weigh in, zero chance of hearing the experts  and taking their insights into account. That has to change.   We need three of our colleagues who believe in this Nation, who  believe in the Constitution, written with those beautiful three words  ``We the People.'' They need to stop thinking about ``we the powerful''  and ``we the privileged.'' They have to stop thinking about how they  help their friends in the gated communities of America or in the  corporate suites of America. How do you help working Americans? How do  you help struggling Americans?   Franklin Roosevelt said that the test of our progress should not be  whether we do more--add to the abundance of those who have much--but  whether we do enough for those who have little. Yet the philosophy of  this bill that the secret 13 is cooking up is about giving more to the  abundance of those who have much and taking away from those who have  little. It is the opposite. It is government by and for the wealthy and  government by and for the powerful and government by and for the  privileged.   Have they forgotten the first three words of our Constitution? Have  they forgotten that the philosophy, as Jefferson put it, was that we  would have outcomes that would reflect the will of the people? If you  are afraid to share the bill with the people of America, you are  certainly not pursuing the will of the people of the United States of  America.   What is really in this bill?   On the one hand, we understand that it is going to take healthcare  away from millions of Americans. They are saying that it might do it a  little more slowly than did the TrumpCare bill.   As for the TrumpCare bill, the President himself said it was  ``mean,'' and he used a derogative slogan, which I will not repeat on  this floor, to say how terrible it was. Why did the President call it  ``mean''? Was it that it was taking away healthcare from an estimated  23 million people? My colleagues, we understand, are going to do it  more slowly, inflict that damage over a number of extra years. Does  that make it right to hurt people? Does that make it right? In the  meantime, they are going to hand out an insurance bag of goodies to the  health insurers of $127 billion. Strip healthcare over here. Give  goodies to the insurance companies over here.   What happens to those who are in long-term care and nursing homes?  More than 6 out of 10 Americans who are in long-term care are there  because they are paid through Medicaid. They have to pay down all of  their income and their wealth before they can use Medicaid. This is the  last resort. It is the last thing they have. Medicaid comes to the  rescue.   I visited a couple of nursing homes over the weekend, one in an urban  area and one in a rural area. I encourage my colleagues to go visit a  nursing home and talk to the men and women who are there. They are so  thankful that they have that care.   One woman said to me: ``Medicaid is how I am paid for.''   Her name is Deborah.   Deborah said: ``Medicaid is how I can afford to be here. If you take  it away, I am out on the street. Being on the street is a problem  because my legs do not work.''   Picture that individual being thrown into the street. She is in her  wheelchair because her legs do not work. Where is she going to sleep?  How is she going to feed herself? Where is she going to bathe?   Then I went to a nursing home in rural Oregon, which was down in the  south, Klamath County. At that nursing home, they told me that almost  100 percent of their long-term care patients are paid for by Medicaid-- almost one 100 percent. Imagine that entire hallway of individuals  swept out, tossed out.   And why? What else do we have in this bill? Oh. Give tax deductions  and gifts to the health insurance executives. First we have gifts to  the health insurers and then another $18 billion to the health  insurance executives.   Then my colleagues say: Let's make insurance cheaper by getting rid  of the essential benefits. That way, people can have an insurance  policy for less.   But unfortunately it is not worth the paper it is written on. We have  been there. We have seen that. There is a reason you set a floor as to  what the benefits are. It is so that when you actually get sick and  need to go to the emergency room, you can actually go. When you  actually get sick and need an operation, you can actually get it. When  you break a leg, you can actually get it set. When you need treatment  for a disease, you can actually get the treatment. When you are having  a child, you can actually get maternity care. These are the  fundamentals. They are not the fancy end of healthcare. It is not the  fancy end that you might find with some executive healthcare packages.  These are the basics, the essential basics. My colleagues want to strip  that away.   On the other hand, they say: Hey, we have so much money that we can  give tax giveaways to the prescription drugmakers--$29 billion to the  prescription drugmakers.   Then they want to destroy the rural healthcare clinics and hospitals.  I was in four of my rural counties this weekend. I was in Klamath and  Lake, and I was in Grant and Wheeler. I held townhalls. People came out  and spoke to me.   These folks said: Do you know that our rural clinics are the heart of  our  [[Page S3610]]  communities, and they are what allow people to live here with the  confidence that they can get the healthcare they need instead of having  to go to some city that is hundreds of miles away or maybe not even be  able to get care at all on a timely basis?   They love their hospitals that provide care in the bit larger  communities in rural Oregon.   Yet, as for the heads of these hospitals and the heads of these  clinics, what do they say? They say that without the Affordable Care  Act and the vast decrease in uncompensated coverage, they would have to  fire a whole lot of employees and provide a whole lot less healthcare.   One doctor from a clinic in the northeast corner of the State came to  me and said: We doubled--roughly doubled--the amount of healthcare we  are able to provide, and we are so remote, and it is so important to be  able to have that nearby.   So why do my colleagues really dislike healthcare in rural America?  Why do they want to undermine it? Well, they can give away more money  to medical device makers--$20 billion to medical device makers--and all  of this is before we look at the fact that they are giving more than  $200 billion away to the richest Americans. So over here, let's strip  the essential benefits. Let's destroy the health clinics. Let's  undermine the rural hospitals. Let's make it challenging for those with  preexisting conditions. Let's take those in nursing homes and make sure  they are not able to be in nursing homes and, magically, maybe they  will get cared for some other way so we can give tax giveaways to the  health insurers, tax gifts to the insurance executives, tax goodies to  the prescription drug makers, and special tax provisions to the medical  device makers, and then give $200 billion to the richest Americans.  Isn't that the opposite of the test of our progress? Here, in the  United States of America, under a system of government that is supposed  to be of the people, by the people, for the people--this bill is by the  privileged and powerful, for the privileged and powerful. And not just  that, but let's really hurt ordinary working people and struggling  Americans in the process right where it really gets them--right here-- at the fundamental heart of the peace of mind they get from knowing  that currently they have access to healthcare.   I don't know that anything is quite so disturbing as worrying about  the fact that if your loved one gets sick, will he or she be able to  get the care he or she needs? If your loved one gets sick, will he or  she go broke? And what about your neighbor, and what about your  extended family? This Republican bill is all about creating stress and  anxiety and bad outcomes for ordinary working Americans, ordinary  middle-class Americans, ordinary struggling Americans.   They didn't send us here to the Senate to do this. That is why the  secret 13 are meeting in secret. That is why they don't want to meet in  a room that has a hallway where the reporters can be. That is why they  don't want to answer the questions in the hallway about whether they  will vote to proceed to a bill without letting the people of America  weigh in on it.   Shouldn't everyone here be willing to answer that question: Are you  willing to vote to move to a bill that has had no public process?  Aren't you working for the people of America? Or, as this bill says,  are you just working for the companies and the rich? That is it, and  too bad for everyone else.   Aaron in Portland wrote to me. Because she has been diagnosed with  diabetes, she is terrified that if TrumpCare goes through, her  condition will be considered a preexisting condition, and she won't be  able to afford the coverage she needs. She says: ``Although through  committed lifestyle changes and family support, I have done well  managing this condition, I will be marked as high risk along with my  age.''   Ellen from Medford, the southern part of our State, tells me that she  has the challenge that her baby daughter was in a catastrophic accident  just days before her second birthday. Her husband had just switched  jobs and didn't have health insurance yet. But, fortunately, Medicaid-- that would be the Oregon Health Plan--was there for them, and her  daughter got the lifesaving care she needed. That is anxiety for an  ordinary person. Do you have health coverage when you are switching  jobs? Is there one health insurance you can afford?   My colleagues want to strip healthcare from Ellen in Medford so they  can cut $800 billion in Medicaid overall, so they can give tax  giveaways to powerful corporations and the richest Americans. It is  just wrong, morally wrong, and wrong in every possible way.   Marilyn from Ontario says that she is living with two autoimmune  diseases--difficult to pronounce, so I won't. She was diagnosed before  the ACA became law, but rather than be denied coverage outright by her  insurance company, she was told she could be covered if she paid a  monthly premium of about $1,000 with a $20,000 deductible--$20,000  deductible. Needless to say, that wasn't helpful to her. Marilyn went 5  years without insurance, and she ended up being very sick. She had to  borrow against her home, leverage her home. She had to deplete her  retirement savings. And she had to make payments on $64,000 worth of  credit card debt, run up in order to cover her healthcare.   Then the ACA came along, and Marilyn was able to afford insurance,  and she got community pricing. In other words, despite these  preexisting conditions, you pay the same price as everyone else. That  is so important to peace of mind about healthcare. Just saying that you  will have ``access to healthcare''--a favorite phrase some of my  colleagues use--if you can pay extraordinarily high prices that I know  you will not be able to pay, that is not access. That is teasing  people. That is cruelty to say: Oh, yes, we are going to make sure you  have access; as long as you are a millionaire and you can pay a ton  every month, you have access. We have taken care of you. You have  access. No, that is not access. Affordability is critical to having a  functioning healthcare system, and Marilyn will probably be priced out  of the market again with the Republican strategy.   How about Lisa in Corvallis, a single parent of three children, two  with serious medical conditions that have placed them on permanent  disability. Lisa faces some hard times, and I will let her words speak  for themselves. She says:         Our family was very fortunate and eternally grateful that       the ACA passed while I held that job, because in 2015, my       middle child was hospitalized for the first of four times in       the last two years. And, in March of 2016, I developed a       serious heart condition which my doctor attributes in part to       stress.    She goes on to say:         In June of 2016, my employer declined to renew my contract,       and if it weren't for the ACA, I would have been out of a job       and completely without medical coverage, this time with a       serious and expensive preexisting condition.    The stories are coming in through emails. They are coming in through  my townhalls. They are coming in over the phones. They are letting us  all know--and not just in States represented by folks on this side of  the aisle, but every Senator here is getting these letters.   So I say to my fellow Senators: Read these letters from your  constituents because I know that your constituents are in the same  position my constituents are in. Be a champion for them. Be a champion  for struggling families, for working families, for middle-class  families. Honor the role and responsibility of representing all of the  people of your State, not simply powerful companies and your richest  constituents but all of your citizens. That was the vision on which our  country was founded, and that is the spirit in which Franklin Roosevelt  said: This test of our progress is not whether we give more of the  abundance to those who have the most, but enough to those who have  little.   Enough means affordable, accessible healthcare for every single  person in America. Tearing that down is wrong morally and wrong to do  it secretly and wrong in terms of the enormous damage that it will  cause.   I am pleased to see my colleague from Pennsylvania, who has been a  champion for working Americans every day he serves in this Chamber. He  particularly makes sure that all of us are thinking about the impact on  children, and there is so much of this secret Republican plan that is  going to hurt the children of America. I appreciate the insights that  he shares with all of us as  [[Page S3611]]  he urges us to ponder and do better every time we consider legislation.   I yield the floor.
