 Mr. President, it is with deep sadness that I rise  today to remember Chief Justice Clement Clay ``Bo'' Torbert, Jr., who  died on Saturday, June 2, 2018. Bo Torbert was a good friend and a wise  and thoughtful jurist whose leadership in the bench and bar will not  soon be equaled or forgotten. Indeed, the significance of Justice  Torbert's legacy was apparent way back in 1994 when the Alabama  Judicial Building in Montgomery was named in honor of Justice Torbert  and Senator and former Chief Justice Howell Heflin, another friend,  mentor, and Alabama legal icon.   Justice Torbert was born on August 31, 1929, and he was proud to call  Opelika home. An active member of the First United Methodist Church, he  was also a lifelong hunter, conservationist, historian, and  outdoorsman. Educated in the public schools of Opelika, after high  school, he attended the U.S. Naval Academy and graduated from Auburn  University in 1951, where he was a collegiate swimmer. He served in the  U.S. Air Force, attaining the rank of captain. Following his graduation  from the University of Alabama Law School in 1954, Justice Torbert  began practicing law in Opelika, first with Bill Dickinson, who later  became an Alabama Congressman, and later with Yetta Samford. In 1958,  he was elected to represent Lee County in the State legislature.   Only 30 years old in 1959, Torbert was voted ``Outstanding Freshman''  in the Alabama State House. In 1966, he was elected to the Alabama  Senate, where he proposed a number of legislative initiatives that  would set the stage for significant reforms to Alabama's courts and  legal system. After his return to private practice in 1970, Torbert  continued to support then-Chief Justice Howell Heflin's efforts to  effect court reform through constitutional amendment 328, which was  finally ratified in December of 1973. Returning to the State senate in  1974, Torbert shepherded through the legislature the bills necessary to  implement the reforms mandated in the amendment, and after he was  elected chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court in 1976, Justice  Torbert oversaw the transition to the streamlined system, which was  subsequently ranked as one of the best court systems in the Nation.   During his tenure as chief justice, Torbert was also active in  national and international judicial organizations, serving as president  of the Conference of Chief Justices, chairman of the National Center  for State Courts, and chairman of the State Justice Institute. In 1979,  he was elected to the Alabama Academy of Honor. After leaving the  court, Justice Torbert taught at both the University of Alabama School  of Law and Cumberland School of Law before joining the law firm of  Maynard, Cooper & Gale, P.C., where he practiced until his retirement  several years ago.   My wife Louise and I extend our sincere condolences to Bo's wife,  Gene Hurt Torbert and to his three children, my longtime friend Dixie  Alton and her husband, Mitch; Shealy Cook and her husband, Penn; and  Clay Torbert and his wife, Cindy, as well as his five grandchildren,  Rebecca Cook Davis and her husband, William; Elizabeth Cook; Clay Cook;  Bo Torbert IV; James Torbert; and two great-grandchildren, Penton Davis  and Celia Davis.   Justice Torbert was a great Christian, husband, father, lawyer,  statesman, and judge, and while Alabama will surely miss him, his  legacy will live on for generations.                            ____________________
