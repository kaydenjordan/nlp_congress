 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor a sports organization  in Guam. Actually, it is more than an organization. It is a sports  legacy and icon of our beautiful island. This year, Guam's Hal's Angels  Football Association is celebrating their 40th anniversary of promoting  youth football on the island.   Four decades ago, the late and great Hal Shiroma envisioned a way to  keep Guam's youth off the streets and out of trouble by promoting the  values of participation in youth football. His belief was to provide  our kids with a wholesome environment which would promote the mystique  of competition, the joy of victory, the reality of defeat, the  importance of commitment, and the spirit of community, while gaining a  strong sense of teamwork.   Over the years, he combed the streets, and whenever he saw troubled  kids, he would reach out to their families to encourage participation  in his football organization. His coaching was not easy, but it proved  to be effective. Today, we see parents and grandparents, who once wore  the Hal's Angels football jersey over the decades, encourage their  children and grandchildren to play for the organization whose values  they continue to uphold.   Over four decades, Hal's Angels have held the most championship  titles in each age division of the Guam National Youth Football  Federation, and their legacy continued this past weekend where the  Hal's Angels Metgot team repeated as champions in their division.   While Coach Hal sadly passed away in 2002, his legacy and his vision  continued through the hard work, sacrifices, and efforts of his sons  Ivan, Buzz, Blu, and Ty Shiroma.   On behalf of a thankful island and nation, and under this historic  dome of democracy, I congratulate Guam's Hal's Angels Football  Association for celebrating 40 years of promoting youth football in  Guam and for instilling character and healthy competition in the hearts  and minds of thousands of our youth for four decades.                            ____________________
