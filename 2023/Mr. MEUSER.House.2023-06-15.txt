 Mr. Speaker, on top of the self-inflicted crises the  Biden White House has created, including excessive spending, the  assault on American energy, open borders, and a rattled economy, the  Biden administration has accumulated over $367 billion in regulatory  costs.   These overbearing regulations are harming small businesses and  hindering growth. This administration seems determined as well to  weaken the American energy industry. It has gone after everyday  automobiles, drilling, pipelines, coal, and natural gas. But their  anti-all-of-the-below energy crusade doesn't stop there.   They have mandated emissions rules on air-conditioning units, washing  machines, refrigerators, and, yes, even light bulbs. What a bright  idea.   Now they are coming after the American families' gas stoves.   This is a blatant example of the heavy hand of government thinking it  knows best, putting an excessive burden on American families.   Mr. Speaker, we must change course and start working for the American  people, not against them.                            ____________________
