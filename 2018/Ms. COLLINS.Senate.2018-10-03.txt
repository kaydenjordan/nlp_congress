 Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support  [[Page S6497]]  the Home Health Payment Innovation Act, which I have introduced with  Senator Stabenow and Senator Nelson. Our legislation would help  preserve access to existing home health services under the Medicare  program while also providing a pathway for innovative approaches to  utilizing these services moving forward. This bipartisan legislation is  endorsed by the National Association of Homecare and Hospice as well as  the Partnership for Quality Home Healthcare.   I have been a strong supporter of home care since my very first home  visit during my second year of Senate service. This experience gave me  the opportunity to meet and visit with home health patients, where I  saw first-hand what a difference highly skilled and caring visiting  nurses make to the lives of patients and their families. I have been a  passionate advocate for home care ever since. Last year, I was  delighted to be recognized with the Ruby Slipper award from the Maine  Home Care and Hospice Alliance--appropriately named because as Dorothy  said in The Wizard of Oz, ``There's no place like home.''   The highly skilled and compassionate care that home health agencies  provide in Maine and across the country has helped to keep families  together and enabled millions of our most frail and vulnerable  individuals to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay just where  they want to be--in the comfort and security of their own homes. In  fact, in 2014, AARP found that nearly 87 percent of of adults over 65  years old want to stay in their current home and community as they age.  Furthermore, 85 percent of home health patients live with three or more  chronic conditions.   The legislation I am introducing today ensures the viability of home  health services now and in the future. First, the Home Health Care  Payment Innovation Act provides two key adjustments to the Bipartisan  Budget Act of 2018 home health payment reform provisions. These changes  would prevent premature payment rate cuts by basing any behavioral  adjustment on observed evidence. It also provides a phase-in for any  necessary rate increases or decreases to limit the risk of disruption  in care. This phase-in is critical for home health providers as CMS has  already proposed cutting Medicare payment rates in 2020 by more than $1  billion in the first year alone, based purely on assumptions of changes  in behavior.   Second, the legislation provides a pathway to expanded use of home  health care in Medicare without increasing program spending by  providing flexibility on waiving the ``homebound'' requirement for home  health services when a plan or innovative care delivery models such as  an ACO determines that providing care in the home would improve patient  outcomes and reduce spending on patient care.   By helping patients to avoid more costly hospital visits and nursing  homes, we already know that home health saves Medicare, Medicaid and  private insurers millions of dollars each year. Moving forward, as  plans and providers continue to experiment with innovative ways to  deliver care and improve value in Medicare spending, allowing them the  flexibility to waive this limitation will help advance the goals of  ensuring that care is delivered at the right time, at the right place,  and at the right cost. The legislation I introduced today provides the  pathway to do just that--promote innovation in home health. I urge my  colleagues to support this legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to  support  [[Page S6497]]  the Home Health Payment Innovation Act, which I have introduced with  Senator Stabenow and Senator Nelson.
