 Mr. Speaker, by executive order, President  Biden reversed the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance policy,  which was a reiteration and expansion of President Ronald Reagan's  Mexico City policy. Announced by Ronald Reagan at a U.N. conference on  population growth in Mexico City in 1984, hence its name, the policy  was designed to ensure that U.S. taxpayer money was not funneled to  foreign, nongovernmental organizations that perform or promote  abortion.   My amendment, which was not made in order, would have inserted new  text that reinstates the Mexico City policy which was rendered  inoperative by the President, and it also would have taken out new pro- abortion language that says that no President in the future can  promulgate any iteration of the Mexico City policy.                                time  1430    The Mexico City policy established pro-life safeguards; benign,  humane conditions on global health assistance. For years, foreign  nongovernmental organizations have been subsided and empowered by  taxpayer funds--and let's not forget, this is grant money--to weaken,  undermine, or reverse pro-life laws in other nations, especially in  Africa, and to destroy the precious lives of unborn children.   The Mexico City policy mitigates U.S. taxpayer complicity in global  abortion and underscores our deep commitment to protecting the weak and  most vulnerable.   According to a recent Marist poll, 77 percent of Americans are  opposed to using tax moneys to pay for abortions in other countries.  Only 19 percent support it.   The Marist poll found that 55 percent of Democrats, 85 percent of  Independents, and 95 percent of Republicans were against using taxpayer  funds to pay for abortions in other countries.   U.S. foreign assistance, Mr. Speaker, and foreign entities that we  fund with billions of dollars of grant money should consistently  affirm, care for, and tangibly assist women and all children--all  children, including unborn babies--regardless of their age or condition  of dependency.   Second, Mr. Speaker, since 1973, the Helms amendment has prohibited  using taxpayer funds to directly pay for abortions in other countries.  Helms is the Hyde amendment for the rest of the world. The bill before  us today, however, completely reverses the Helms amendment.   I had offered in Rules a second amendment that would have reinstated  Helms. It was not made in order.   Taxpayers should not be forced to pay for child dismemberment,  including severing arms and legs and actual decapitation of the baby  with sharp knives, or deadly poisons or drugs like RU-486, which  starves the baby to death.   Children alive but not yet born who are killed by abortion after 20  weeks or later experience excruciating suffering and pain. And until  they are rendered  [[Page H4143]]  unconscious or dead by these hideous procedures, the baby feels the  pain of every cut.   Years ago, Senator Biden said, and he wrote to constituents, that  opposition to abortion funding would: ``Protect both the woman and her  unborn child.''   He said: ``Those of us who are opposed to abortion''--again this is  Joe Biden--``should not be compelled to pay for them.''   Finally, my amendment on the U.N. Population Fund was not made in  order, as my good friend and colleague Harold Rogers had said, this  legislation weakens the Kemp-Kasten language significantly.   I would point out to my colleagues--because I offered the first  amendment on this floor back in 1984 on the complicity of the U.N.  Population Fund in forced abortion and forced sterilization in China.  For over four decades, the U.N. Population Fund has vigorously  supported, funded, defended, promoted, even celebrated the Chinese  Communist Party's coercive population control program.   I met with the head of the Chinese program, Peng Peiyun, back in 1991  in Beijing, almost a 3-hour meeting.    Mr. Speaker, Peng Peiyun told me over and  over again, there is no coercion in the Chinese program, even though  everyone who has followed it knows that there is, because she said the  UNFPA was there, on the ground whitewashing and falsifying the truth.   We are missing maybe 60 million females, women of all ages now,  because it has been a systematic extermination of the girl child in  China. It is one of the reasons why human sex trafficking has exploded  in China, because the girl child has been killed, exterminated, and the  UNFPA has been at best silent on that issue, again, giving the Chinese  Communist Party a clean bill of health.   Doubling the amount of money that was in previous bills from $35  million to $70 million while simultaneously weakening Kemp-Kasten  trivializes these crimes against women and these crimes against  children.    Mr. Speaker, this needs to be clarified for  all Members who are listening.   The Kemp-Kasten language--is and has been--the law and has been  supported in a bipartisan way for years, because we are so unalterably  opposed to coercive population control. It says that we will not  support any organization that supports or comanages a coercive  population control program. The new language takes out ``supports and  comanages'' and puts direct, ``directly involved with abortion.''   China is an absolutely closed society. It is run by a dictatorship  under Xi Jinping. I have chaired 72 congressional hearings over the  years on human rights in China, and many witnesses were women who have  been forcibly abducted. Usually only the ones that escape and get here  and become asylees and get asylum by our law here in the United States  can speak out about it.   So how will you ever ascertain if it is ``direct'' because Xi Jinping  is not going to let you in to investigate. We can't even get answers on  Wuhan, and this is even more closed than that, quite frankly.   I do hope Members will realize this is a gutting of the Kemp-Kasten  language. No matter how you feel about population control, we should be  absolutely opposed to coercion. Nobody should be forced.
