 Mr. President, I rise today regarding the Emery County  Public Land Management Act, that was included in S. 47, the John D.  Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act. This became  Public Law 116-9 on March 12th, 2019.   Throughout 2018 and early 2019, Senator Hatch, Congressman Curtis,  and I engaged with the Emery County Commissioners and Emery County  Public Lands Council on this important piece of legislation. After  Senator Hatch's retirement, I was honored to help carry the ball across  the finish line.   This law is the result of over 25 years of deliberation, and I find  it important to highlight some areas of congressional intent to  maintain the integrity of the process. While congressional intent  should be evident in the legislative text and corresponding map, the  historical context of how we arrived at some of these decisions may be  of benefit to the Department of the Interior, future members of the  Utah delegation, and those in Utah. The residents of Emery County, the  Utah delegation, and I look forward to the implementation of this new  law.   Fundamental to this process was the effort to avoid any action that  would end a current ongoing use. For example, it was important to not  close a road, trail, airstrip, or prohibit other existing use in the  legislative text or corresponding map with a wilderness designation.  Further, to avoid applying more restrictive designations, such as  wilderness, to areas it would limit ongoing activity, such as grazing  or recreation. Designation boundaries were drawn along geographic and  physical features or just outside cherry-stemmed roads to ensure  management made sense for the area.   Any designation boundary that does not follow this approach,  particularly any designation that puts at risk an existing use due to a  poorly drawn boundary, was a clerical error and should be resolved  under the authority clearly provided in Sec. 1221. Given the scale of  this bill and legislative map, this authority is a vital tool to  resolve such errors.   I would also highlight the clear intent within Sec. 1232, section  (e), which clearly states that non-wilderness activities or uses that  can be seen or heard from areas within wilderness are to be left  uninterrupted by this legislation. The clear intention of the bill was  to avoid any type of a buffer zone management plan.   On the topic of roads, stakeholders worked closely with BLM to ensure  all roads in the 2008 Resource Management Plan were ``cherry-stemmed,''  meaning they were not included in a wilderness designation. Our intent  was to maintain these roads and for those designated as ``open'' to  stay open. These cherry-stems are of various sizes and were intended to  ensure an adequate corridor exists to facilitate necessary maintenance.  In the Recreation Area, Sec. 1222 includes language to ensure the  necessary maintenance to existing routes may continue and allow  rerouting of roads or trails to protect the resources of the Recreation  Area.   The driving force for this compromise bill was the desire for  countywide land use certainty and thus preventing the designation of a  national monument under the authority granted to the President under  the Antiquities Act. As so many know, in my home State of Utah national  monument designations under the Antiquities Act have been the source of  extreme controversy and deep division in our communities. In my own  view, land management is most effective when it is driven by local  voices and well-reasoned planning. Sweeping designations via  Presidential proclamation are often politically motivated, lead to poor  management of the lands they intend to protect, and erode trust between  the Federal Government and local residents. With the passage of the  Emery County legislation, the need for a national monument is obsolete  because a clear plan has been laid out for the long-term management of  the San Rafael Swell. To be clear, this is a view that was shared by  the many parties, including locally elected officials,  conservationists, recreationists, and others that were intimately  involved in the forging of this compromise legislation. Any advocacy of  a future national monument designation under the Antiquities Act or  other large-scale land use designation in Emery County would be a  violation of the good-faith agreement that was shared among those that  negotiated during this bill's process.   I believe this bill is a victory for all stakeholders, and I look  forward to watching this quarter-century journey for Emery County  finally come to fruition.                            ____________________
