 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 620.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Private enforcement of title III of the Americans with Disabilities  Act is a critical tool for disabled individuals to gain access to  places like restaurants and shopping centers. Most businessowners,  however, feel blindsided when they are sued for violations they were  unaware of.   This has been the case even for disabled businessowners who have  testified before the House Judiciary Committee. Lee Ky testified in  2016. She runs one of her family's doughnut shops that was sued for  technical violations of the ADA because a restroom sign was in the  shape of a triangle instead of a square.   A person who has never walked in her life, Ky testified that she is  proud of this Nation's effort to improve accessibility by enacting the  ADA, but she thinks that businesses should be given an opportunity to  remove barriers before getting sued.   Donna and David Batelaan have also testified. They were co-owners of  a store that sold accessibility devices in Florida. Despite employing  two people who used wheelchairs, despite themselves using wheelchairs,  and despite the fact that virtually their entire clientele was composed  of customers who had mobility limitations, they were sued because they  had not painted lines and posted a sign for a ``handicapped'' spot  required by the ADA.   Indeed, according to their testimony, it was later found that they  had been just one of many businesses targeted by an unscrupulous, out- of-state attorney. According to Mrs. Batelaan, it did not matter that  their parking lot and store were totally accessible. It was greed that  was driving these suits.   These examples are among many shared by businesses across the  country. The ADA's private right of action, which was originally  intended to be the primary enforcement mechanism to achieve greater  access, has instead encouraged a cottage industry of costly and  wasteful litigation that neither benefits the business nor disabled  individuals seeking more accessibility.   A report aired on ``60 Minutes'' on December 4, 2016, for example,  featured several small-business owners who were subject to what are  known as ``drive-by'' lawsuits. In such lawsuits, commonly filed by  opportunistic trial lawyers, the plaintiff need only drive by the  property, not actually visit it, to file a lawsuit alleging an ADA  violation. In other cases, plaintiffs can even use Google Earth to  target alleged violations and, in turn, file lawsuits before even  notifying a small-business owner of the problem.   The fact that these types of small businesses are ill-equipped to  defend an ADA lawsuit is the reason why they are sued. Indeed,  opportunistic attorneys are more often willing to settle for just less  than it would cost those mom-and-pop businesses to defend themselves in  court. According to a 2017 op-ed published in The Hill, a conservative  estimate of the average settlement amount is $7,500.   Given that plaintiff attorneys' motive is often to line their own  pockets, there is little or no incentive to work with businesses to  cure a violation before a lawsuit is filed. This results in wasted  resources that could have been used to improve access.   H.R. 620 is a commonsense solution because it gives businesses a fair  chance to cure title III violations before they are forced into a  lawsuit, while still preserving the power of the threat of a lawsuit  when businesses fail to make the required fixes in a timely manner.   H.R. 620 will create more access for more Americans more quickly  because businesses would much rather fix an access problem quickly than  face an unpredictable and expensive lawsuit that could hurt their  ability to expand access in other ways.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense  reform, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 30 seconds to respond to the  gentleman from New York.   In point of fact, the United States Code contains several examples in  which a potential plaintiff must provide notice before filing a  lawsuit.   For example, title I of the ADA, in fact, requires a plaintiff to  first file an administrative complaint with the EEOC. Unlike a  complaint filed in Federal court, it is a method for parties to try to  resolve the case before litigation through a conciliation process. As  part of this process, the complainant is required to fill out a form  that puts the recipient on notice of the alleged issues. Title VII of  the Civil Rights Act has a similar process.   Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Calvert).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Poe), a member of the Judiciary Committee and the chief  sponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.    Mr. Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Peters), the primary cosponsor of this legislation.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from California.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is remaining  on each side?    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1\1/2\ minutes to respond  to the gentlewoman from Texas.   Opponents of this bill claim it will delay access in some cases, even  if just by a few months. But under current law, unscrupulous lawyers  already delay filing ADA complaints for months after alleged violations  are discovered, simply to boost their claim for attorneys' fees based  on hours worked.   Here is an affidavit from a former ADA lawyer showing his firm  fraudulently and routinely waited months to alert businessowners of  potential violations and file lawsuits so they could falsely claim many  hours of work preparing the case when no such work was required. Here  is what the lawyer testified to:         The alleged time entries at issue in this case include       authorizing discovery 6 months in advance of the case being       filed. I told Mr. Lopez, the real person in charge, this       practice was useless. Mr. Lopez's response was that       increasing legal fees was what I was supposed to do.    This means that, today, there are months of unnecessary delays before  the businessowner is even notified of a violation so they can begin  working on fixing the problem. That is an additional delay of months  that this bill will eliminate.   The bottom line is that, in ADA cases, lawyers routinely delay filing  lawsuits to boost their fees. This bill will stop that practice and let  that time and money be used instead to increase access, not pad the  pockets of unethical lawyers.   This bill will provide access months sooner than under current law.  This is a pro-civil rights bill, and I urge my colleagues to support  it.    I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, they oppose our bill  to increase sanctions on unethical lawyers.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, it is my pleasure to yield 3 minutes to  the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall).    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Georgia.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record the affidavit  that I cited in my earlier remarks.         United States District Court Southern District of Florida                         Case No. 1:17-cv-24116-KMM         Enrique Madrinan, Plaintiff, v. Harbour Shopping Center,       Inc. and Luza Corp. d/b/a Donut Gallery Diner, Defendants.   DEFENDANT LUZA CORP.'S NOTICE OF FILING AFFIDAVIT IN RELATION TO DOCKET      ENTRY THIRTY-THREE, PLAINTIFF'S REPLY TO DEFENDANTS RESPONSE TO    PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO DISQUALIFY COUNSEL AND LAW FIRM REPRESENTING              DEFENDANT LUZA CORP., D/B/A DONUT GALLERY DINER         7. Notably, the alleged time entries at issue in this case,       include authoring discovery six months in advance of the case       being filed. Because most cases settled upon filing, and       Federal Disability Advocates wanted to bill hours before they       settled, they had their off-site team who handled the pre-      filing, filing, and service, serve discovery with the       Complaint. I repetitively told Mr. Lopez, the real person in       charge of Federal Disability Advocates, this practice was       useless because a party cannot propound discovery until after       the scheduling conference. I even argued that it was counter-      productive because it led to a debate over when, and if,       discovery was served, which unnecessarily increased legal       fees. Mr. Lopez's response was that increasing legal fees was       what I was supposed to do, and that serving discovery with       the complaint was part of how to get to ten hours pre-filing.     Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume to respond to the gentleman from Maryland.   The technical requirements of title III are constantly changing. We  have seen numerous revisions to both regulations and guidance, not to  mention the resulting case law that affects its interpretation;  therefore, the regulatory requirements of the ADA in 1991 are not the  same as those today.   There is no better example of these changes than the rise of the  internet, which came into its current existence after the ADA was  enacted. As people no longer need a physical storefront to have a  business, the courts have struggled to apply the ADA's public  accommodation requirements.   There is, for example, a current circuit split as to whether  companies operating exclusively online are subject to these  requirements. And with continued advancements in technology, we will  continue to see changes to the regulatory requirements.   It is perfectly reasonable for small-business owners, many of whom  are disabled themselves or of minorities, to have the opportunity to  fix a problem before a predatory lawyer simply brings an action for the  purpose of recovering--not fixing the problem, but getting money that  could have been better spent by that small business fixing the problem.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H1190]]         Mr. Chairman, I have no speakers remaining other than  myself and I am prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chairman, the House Judiciary Committee, over decades, has heard  testimony from many disabled owners of businesses, several of whom have  testified before the committee who themselves have been extorted by  trial lawyers to pay thousands of dollars to lawyers. That money could  have been spent on making small adjustments to the premises to easily  overlooked technical violations.   Let me give you an example. Take the testimony of Donna Batelaan, who  owned a store for the disabled, and herself used a wheelchair. It was a  store devoted entirely to selling accessibility devices and similar  items.   She was made to pay $2,000 in attorneys' fees for a simple fix that  cost $100. Clearly, Mrs. Batelaan was deeply interested in  accommodating the disabled, yet she, too, was caught up in a legal  shakedown.   She said the following before the House Judiciary Committee: ``We  have co-owned a mobility equipment business in south Florida for the  last 20 years. Our parking lot and our building are totally wheelchair  accessible. We employ two people who use wheelchairs, and we ourselves  use wheelchairs, and all of our customers have mobility limitation. We  had not painted the lines and posted a sign on''--just one of the-- ``handicapped spot that is required by ADA. An attorney from New  Jersey, without notice, filed a suit against us. It cost us less than  $100 to correct the infractions and $2,000 for attorneys' fees.''   ``The original intent of ADA was to provide access and opportunity to  American life for all people with disabilities, not to give the legal  profession an opportunity to make more money.''   As Abraham Lincoln's name was mentioned previously, I want to quote  him on the subject of unnecessary and wasteful litigation. In his notes  on a  [[Page H1191]]  law lecture he delivered, here is what Abraham Lincoln had to say:  ``Discourage litigation. Point out to them how the nominal winner is  often a real loser--in fees, expenses, and waste of time. As a  peacemaker, the lawyer has a superior opportunity of being a good man.  There will still be business enough.''   And finally, to that same point, I have to say it is simply ethical  practice for lawyers to give a business a heads-up of a potential  violation before a lawsuit is filed.   There are many other examples in Federal law where that notice to the  defendant to cure, including in civil rights actions, is afforded. It  should be afforded here as well.   Indeed, the vast majority of lawyers do what this bill requires as a  matter of simple ethical lawyering. But many lawyers don't act  professionally, and they abuse the law to shake down businesses, taking  money away from compliance and putting it into their own pockets.   All this bill does is require those unscrupulous trial lawyers to do  what ethical lawyers already do: give fair notice of a violation before  thousands of dollars in attorneys' fees are racked up against a small  business, diverting money away from accessibility where it belongs.   Mr. Chairman, this is the right correction addressing this problem.  It will enhance accessibility, it will encourage more work to be done,  and it will not deprive anybody the opportunity to notify people that  they have a problem with accessibility at their business. If they don't  fix it, they will then be the subject of that very lawsuit.   But the opportunity to fix it in a prompt fashion is, I think,  critically important to making accessibility more available and helping  small businesses in America to succeed, thrive, and create even more  jobs for people with those disabilities.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this important  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Poe  of Texas) having assumed the chair, Mr. Simpson, Chair of the Committee  of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that  Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 620) to amend  the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 to promote compliance  through education, to clarify the requirements for demand letters, to  provide for a notice and cure period before the commencement of a  private civil action, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution  thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment, but I do not oppose the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I want to first commend the gentleman from California for  addressing this issue. He is quite right that it is important that, in  order to expeditiously make sure that accommodations for the disabled  are made, people have to understand what those requirements are. The  regulations on this change frequently and constantly.   I do not oppose this amendment. In fact, I support it. I would ask  the gentleman if he would work with us moving forward to make sure that  this does not impose an inordinate burden on the bureaucracy  responsible for putting this out so as to delay getting new regulations  to protect the ADA folks out.    There are many languages spoken by people in various businesses in  this country. Some are very common, and that is definitely the case,  but we may not have this written in every single language that is  spoken by every single individual.    I yield to the gentleman from California.    Mr. Chairman, at this time I am pleased to yield 1  minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe).    Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers. I urge my  colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.  [[Page H1194]]     Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I must oppose this amendment because it  would completely gut the notice and cure provisions, which are the core  provisions of this bill. The need for a notice and cure period has been  highlighted in congressional hearings since the early 2000s.   In 2016, David Weiss, who testified on behalf of the International  Council of Shopping Centers, stated:         The problem that the private sector faces is an increasing       number of lawsuits typically brought by a few plaintiffs in       various jurisdictions and often by the same lawyers for very       technical and usually minor violations. It has become all too       common for property owners to settle these cases, as it is       less expensive to settle them than to defend them, even if       the property owner is compliant. It is often too costly to       prove that a property owner is doing what is right or       required. Therefore, the property owner makes a rational       business decision commonly resulting in settlement.    Mr. Chairman, given that plaintiffs' attorneys' motives are often  monetary, there is little or no incentive to work with businesses to  cure a violation before a lawsuit is filed. This unintended result  wastes resources on the cost of litigation that could have been used to  improve access sooner. This delays justice.   H.R. 620 remedies these problems by allowing businesses a finite  period of time, before a private enforcement lawsuit can be filed, to  fix defects on their premises once they are notified that these  premises do not comply with the ADA.   This will reduce abuses of the law by opportunistic lawyers. It will  result in more access for the disabled because it encourages businesses  to cure their access issues now in order to avoid costly litigation  later.   Mr. Chair, I would also note that made in order is an amendment  coming up that would reduce this amount of time by 2 months, the total  amount of time for notice and cure.   I think that is a good step to address the concerns raised, but I  cannot support an amendment that completely takes away the purpose of  the legislation, which is to give small-business owners the opportunity  to cure a problem once they are made aware of it. Many of these are  very technical violations of the law designed primarily to line the  pockets of some unscrupulous lawyers, as opposed to really helping  advance the cause of accessibility.   For those reasons, I oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.                                time  1045     Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, as I indicated,  because the ADA is a regulation-based law, and those regulations are  constantly changing as new technology changes and as accessibility to  new features that businesses offer are desired by those in the  disability community.   That is a necessary thing, but it is also necessary to make sure that  businesses have time to accommodate as well and learn about those new  requirements and have the opportunity to fix it before somebody can  just get attorney's fees for something that is going to be done anyway.   So I think the better approach is to oppose this amendment and  support the underlying bill with the addition of an amendment coming up  that would reduce that time by 2 months.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
