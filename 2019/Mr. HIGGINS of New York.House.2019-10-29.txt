 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to applaud the  House approval of the Veteran Treatment Court Coordination Act  legislation led by Chairman Charlie Crist, of which I am a proud  cosponsor, directing grants, training, and assistance for communities  to establish and operate veteran treatment courts.   In 2008, Buffalo City Court Judge Robert Russell established the very  first veteran treatment court in the Nation. Today, there are over 400  such courts. These specialized courts provide veterans, many battling  substance abuse or post-traumatic stress disorder, with a tactical path  to avoid jail and take command of their future.   At their side are fellow veterans, also known as battle buddies, who  serve as volunteer mentors, as well as judges and professional staff  who can connect these warriors with VA benefits. Support for veteran  treatment courts allows the Nation to give veterans what they have  given us: freedom and peace.  [[Page H8549]]                                ____________________
