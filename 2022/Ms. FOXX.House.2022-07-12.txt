 Mr. Speaker, we must equip workers with the tools for  success by empowering employers to play a more influential role in our  Nation's workforce development system. To do this, we must embrace a  flexible, employer-driven apprenticeship model.   Under the previous administration, a task force composed of business  leaders, educational institutions, and trade associations recommended  reducing the regulatory burden faced by businesses, allowing them to be  flexible in their apprenticeship program requirements to meet the  varying needs of different industries.   Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs, IRAPs, help cut through  the overly prescriptive and burdensome red tape many new and small  businesses face. But the Biden administration killed IRAPs and is  actively working to limit job creators' input by doubling down on  registered apprenticeships and foolishly ignoring any alternatives.   Ending this innovative and successful program will hurt students,  jobseekers, and job creators.                            ____________________
