 Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an  extraordinary Alaskan, Victor Fischer, who passed away on October 22,  2023, after an incredible 99-year life where he made an indelible mark  on the State of Alaska. Vic's legacy of dedicated public service  continues to touch the lives of all Alaskans, and we will miss his  kindness, compassion, and mentorship.   In his early life, Vic Fischer witnessed firsthand the regimes of  Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia. He came to the United States at 15  years old and quickly immersed himself in his new country, first  through education and later through military service. His service in  the Army during World War II took him to France, Germany, and the  Philippines. This experience, along with his early years in Berlin and  Moscow, helped shape his lifelong belief in the intrinsic value of  democracy and human life, values which influenced his many  contributions to the State of Alaska. After the war, Vic obtained a  graduate degree at MIT and then came to Alaska in 1950 as Anchorage's  first city planner, drawn by the promise of adventure and the freedom  of opportunity.   Vic's many contributions were invaluable to the formation of Alaska  as we know it today. He served in the last territorial legislature and  was an active participant in Operation Statehood from its inception,  believing strongly that Alaskans should be able to make decisions for  their own communities as full members of the Union. As a member of this  legislature, Vic cosponsored the repeal of Alaska's death penalty, work  he remained proud of throughout his life as someone who witnessed the  power of an authoritarian state to kill its citizens. He played an  important role as a delegate to the Alaska Constitutional Convention,  helping draft the Alaska Constitution for our new State. Several  decades later, as a State senator, Vic worked with colleagues on both  sides of the aisle to improve Alaskan education, promote women's  rights, social infrastructure, fishing rights, and much more. He  remained politically active until his final months, educating Alaskans  about our constitution, governance structures, and advocacy at all  levels. As the author and journalist Charles Wohlforth wrote shortly  after Vic's passing, ``Time on Earth is only an opportunity. Fischer  had a large share, and made use of it all. He remained optimistically  engaged deep into his 90s, always making friends, always committed,  always connecting.''   Generations of Alaskans will remember Vic Fischer as a kind man with  strong, clear values who committed his life to serving Alaska. Vic had  a fundamental belief in the value of democracy, encouraging people to  participate in their local communities, their State, and their  government and to stand up against authoritarianism. He opposed  discrimination in any form and emphasized the need to dedicate time and  effort to those without power. Above all, he encouraged Alaskans to  exercise the civic power to vote, believing that we all have an  obligation to each other and to our State to do so. Vic's lifelong work  and political activism reflect his belief that Alaskans can come  together to solve any problem, provided we share a love for Alaska and  a willingness to do what is right.   The life and legacy of Vic Fischer will continue to inspire Alaskans  across our State, and we will all miss his integrity and friendship.  Our condolences are extended to his wife Jane Angvik, his children, and  grandchildren.                            ____________________
