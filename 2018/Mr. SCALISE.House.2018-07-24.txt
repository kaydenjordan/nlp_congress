 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  yielding, and I really want to thank my colleague, Mr. MacArthur from  New Jersey, for his leadership in bringing this amendment forward,  which would reauthorize the National Flood Insurance Program on a  short-term basis through hurricane season.   Why are we here, Mr. Speaker? We are here because, first of all, the  House did take strong action to pass a 5-year reauthorization of NFIP  that included really important reforms, reforms that I was happy to  work with the chairman on to pass through the House.                                time  1730    But, ultimately, as the bill went over to the Senate, we kept hearing  story after story that the Senate was going to pass something, and then  a month would go by and another month would go by, and, ultimately, the  Senate still hasn't passed anything to reauthorize this program. So it  leaves us here literally days before the program expires.   Mr. Speaker, we can't play some game of chicken with the lives of  millions of families that represent, by the way, all 50 States. All 50  States participate in the National Flood Insurance Program. This isn't  something that just applies to coastal communities. You have got every  inland State as well that have families that rely on this program to  work.   Mr. Speaker, what kind of program would we like to see? I would love  to see a vibrant marketplace with private sector company after private  sector company that would offer options to families just like we have  with car insurance or homeowners insurance. But we don't have that  today. So what we need to do is usher in reforms like the Ross-Castor  legislation, Mr. Speaker, that I am a cosponsor of. Ross-Castor, by the  way, was included in the House-passed bill.   There are other important reforms that encourage communities to get  better mapping from FEMA. Some of those reforms were included in the  Royce-Blumenauer legislation which, was also in the House-passed bill.   So we could talk about the reforms that are needed, and I encourage  us to get those kind of reforms done. But at the midnight hour, let's  at least keep this program going for a few more months while we  continue negotiating, and let's get a long-term deal that actually has  the reforms that will make this a sustainable program with private  sector involvement for years to come.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
