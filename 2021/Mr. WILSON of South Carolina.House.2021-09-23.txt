 Mr. Speaker, the U.S.-India partnership  is strong and mutually vital. It is strengthened with a vibrant Indian- American community assimilated with fantastic economic success.   We are grateful Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in America to attend  the gathering of global world leaders.   Here are a few great examples of our partnership: bilateral trade  reached $150 billion; over 2,000 American companies have a presence in  India; every U.S. State exports to India, creating over 260,000 jobs;  Indian students enrolled in U.S. colleges contributed over $8 billion  to our economy.   An effective organization is AMCHAM India, with President Salil Gupte  of Boeing, and William Blair, Ranjana Khanna, and Valerie Swope, who  work with President KV Kumar of the Indian American International  Chamber of Commerce, coordinating with Governor Henry McMaster of South  Carolina and Consul General Swati Kulkarni in Atlanta.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years as the global war on terrorism continues, moving  from abroad to our neighborhoods.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I want to commend Chairman  Ted Deutch. I am grateful to be the ranking member of the Subcommittee  on Middle East, North Africa, and Global Counterterrorism. I appreciate  his heartfelt comments.   I also have been to Sderot, and I have seen the example of the  terrorist rocket attacks by Hamas from Gaza with Iranian rockets. I  have seen the effect on mothers and families. And so this is something  that should be addressed, and I appreciate Mr. Hoyer bringing it up.  That, indeed, 4,400 rockets, 400 a day. A reason for that is the  weakness of the Biden-Harris government. They are putting the people of  Israel at risk.   And then I also believe that what we see with Mr. Hoyer, he is being  undercut. And I sympathize with him that his political party, the  Democratic Party, has become under the influence, extraordinary,  bizarre influence of a group of anti-Semites, who also hate the State  of Israel. It is very clear, as we saw a few minutes ago, right here,  how horrible this is.   In fact, this vote is to cover the mistake of the Democratic Party.    Mr. Speaker, I will vote in favor of  the bill. But this is really a cover by the Democratic Party of the far  left movement of their party abandoning the people of Israel.    And so I urge a ``yes'' vote. But this is clearly just to cover a  horrible mistake. It is worse than a mistake, a bowing down of  extremists within the Democratic Party.
