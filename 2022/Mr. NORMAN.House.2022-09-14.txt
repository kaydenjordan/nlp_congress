 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the outstanding  achievement of a very special church, Bethesda Presbyterian Church,  located in Camden, South Carolina.   Bethesda Presbyterian Church was established before the American  Revolutionary War. Its first sanctuary was destroyed during that war,  and two more were built in 1790 and 1806. The sanctuary present today  was designed by Robert Mills.   The edifice is more classical than some of his later work and is one  of the few surviving ecclesiastical designs. The sanctuary, completed  over 200 years ago in 1822, is the work of Mills' maturing  architecture, strongly influenced by Jeffersonian classicism.   In front of the sanctuary is a monument that is dedicated to the  memory of Baron DeKalb, a Continental Army soldier killed in 1780 at  the Battle of Camden. In 1985, the church and the monument were  declared national historic landmarks.   Bethesda Presbyterian Church's mission is: ``To know, love, glorify,  and serve our Lord God.'' The church provides a strong sense of  community, fellowship, and worship as the members walk in their faith  journey during both the joyous times and challenging times. I know  personally that their members experience tremendous personal and  spiritual growth.   I am pleased to recognize Bethesda Presbyterian as an outstanding  church faithfully serving the Camden community and proudly serving as a  historic landmark in the Fifth District of South Carolina. May God  continue to bless this church and its congregation.                            ____________________
