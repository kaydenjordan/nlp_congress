 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2543. The U.S.  economy faces tremendous challenges. We have 40-year high inflation,  persistent supply chain disruptions, and tight labor markets.   The American people are grappling with increased costs across every  aspect of their life. Food is more expensive, energy and gasoline  prices have skyrocketed, and the cost of housing is surging.   In 1977, when I first started out as a young farmer, we slid into the  inflationary period of the Carter years, and went through Chairman  Volker's dramatic tightening of the money supply. This period was  devastating to my neighbors and the entire U.S. economy, and left a  profound impact on how I view fiscal and monetary policy.   Now is not the time to take the Federal Reserve's eyes off the ball.  Congress should be focused on the issues that currently weigh on the  economy and aim to strengthen the financial well-being of the American  people.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose H.R. 2543.
