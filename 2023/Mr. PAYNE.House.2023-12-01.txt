 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the bipartisan  efforts to make our Nation's pipeline network safer.   Recently, the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure  introduced the Promoting Innovation in Pipeline Efficiency and Safety  Act, or PIPES Act, of 2023. This bill would help secure 2.6 million  miles of pipelines that carry natural gas and petroleum to communities  nationwide.   It would allow the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety  Administration to hire more workers to monitor pipeline safety and  create proper protections to regulate carbon dioxide pipelines more  efficiently. Also, it would promote more methods to contain greenhouse  gases.   In addition, the bill would make it easier for historically Black  colleges and universities and other minority-serving institutions to  educate and develop the next generation of pipeline safety  professionals.   As the ranking member of the Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous  Materials Subcommittee, I applaud my colleagues from both parties for  creating a bill that works for the American people.                            ____________________
