 Madam Speaker, I am the only Member of Congress who has  been involved in all three of the last Presidential impeachments. Those  were long proceedings.   Today, we don't need a long investigation to know the President  incited right-wing terrorists to attack the Congress to try to overturn  constitutional government. The actions were in public, plain as day.   His actions are the most serious offense against our Constitution and  our country. They are impeachable acts.  [[Page H168]]    The Founders devised the Impeachment Clause to protect against a  President who would threaten constitutional order. If we don't act now,  the Impeachment Clause would essentially be meaningless.   Faced with these facts, if we don't impeach to protect our country,  we will fail our own oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the  United States against all enemies, foreign and, yes, domestic.   We have no choice. We must impeach.   God bless America.
