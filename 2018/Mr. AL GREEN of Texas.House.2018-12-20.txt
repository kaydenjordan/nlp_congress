 Mr. Speaker, I thank the leadership on both  sides of the aisle for extending this opportunity for us to speak  tonight. This is an important issue for all Americans.   I rise tonight on behalf of Mr. Michael Nguyen, an American citizen.  Mr. Michael Nguyen, an American citizen who was on a mission of mercy  to Vietnam and who is being detained in Vietnam.   I would ask that persons please not allow the last name Nguyen cause  you to think anything other than the fact that he is an American  citizen who makes America the beautiful a more beautiful America. He  was on a mission of mercy.   He is being detained; being detained without the benefit of bail,  something that we routinely expect to be the case in this country;  being detained without the benefit of a lawyer, something that we are  all entitled to under the Constitution in this country when charged  with criminal offenses; being detained  [[Page H10502]]  without the benefit of a speedy trial, something that we take for  granted; being detained in Vietnam, Mr. Speaker. This is something that  every American ought to be concerned about, when we have one of our own  being detained without the benefit of bail, without the benefit of a  lawyer, and without the benefit of a speedy trial.    Mr. Nguyen is a resident of California's 45th District, and Mr.  Nguyen is being represented by Mrs. Walters. Mrs. Walters is here  tonight. I know that she has been engaged and involved in doing what  she can to help extricate Mr. Nguyen from his circumstance.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Mimi  Walters).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for the  extraordinary work that she has done to extricate Mr. Nguyen.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Correa), a  person who came to Congress and has done an outstanding, great job  since he has been here. I don't know whether he came to be a freedom  fighter, but that is how I know him. He really takes a stand against  injustice.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  powerful words and look forward to our continuing to work together to  extricate Mr. Nguyen.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho),  another Member who has been involved and engaged in this process, who  has been with us on phone calls when we have talked to our Ambassador  to Vietnam, and who has been a party to our contacting the Secretary of  State.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his  comments, and I want to reiterate what he said about this being a  bipartisan issue.   This is an issue that crosses the lines that sometimes divide us.  There is no chasm between us when it comes to the extrication of Mr.  Nguyen. We want him back.   I would like to call to the attention of all who are within the sound  of my voice, who are viewing this at home, that there is another Member  who is not here tonight but who has played a significant role in this  effort to bring Mr. Nguyen home. He is Mr. Alan Lowenthal. Mr.  Lowenthal is from California's 47th Congressional District, and he has  been a real champion on causes such as this.   He understands the laws of Vietnam. He understands the culture of  Vietnam as well as any, and he has really had a major push to try to  get Michael home. I want to thank the gentleman from California (Mr.  Lowenthal) for what he has done. While he is not here physically, I do  know that he is here in spirit.   What has been said about Michael's detention is correct. Michael is  being detained without bail, as has been indicated previously. In  Vietnam, unfortunately, the investigation can go on for weeks, months,  and can exceed a year.   When investigations go on for this length of time and the person  being detained does not have the opportunity to visit with family  members, is denied access to family members during holiday seasons,  such as what is occurring here now in our country, when a person is  detained without the benefit of bail, without the benefit of speedy  trial, when this happens, unfortunately, the detention itself becomes  punishment. The detention itself becomes egregious. The detention  itself becomes reason for us to complain to the Government of Vietnam.   If you have charges, yes, you should investigate, but you should file  your charges. You should not detain and then at some point have some  charges brought that may or may not necessitate a long period of  additional detention.   This is an American citizen. We have expectations. We believe that  every country has a right to its autonomy, every country is sovereign  unto itself. But we also believe that every country should respect the  human rights and dignity of people who are within the confines of their  country.   Mr. Nguyen has a necessity to be with his family and his four young  children. They miss him. They want to be with him. This is their father  who is expected to be at home, especially around this time of year when  we are all celebrating the holidays, many different holidays, but they  are celebrated in this country.   We are making an appeal, a human cry, a clarion call to the  Government of Vietnam to release this husband, release this father,  release this man who has been on missions of mercy to Vietnam to work  with his wife as a volunteer when they are helping young children to  receive surgery.    He has demonstrated his love for the people of Vietnam. He has  demonstrated his willingness to go above and beyond, to be of service  to the people of Vietnam, and I ask that the Government of Vietnam  release him. Let him come home. If you have charges, sure, you should  file them; but if not, let's not allow the investigation to become a  form of punishment.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank all of the Members who have appeared on  the floor tonight. There are others who would be here, but  circumstances do not permit.   I want to thank the leadership for allowing us to get this message  out to the masses, to the American people, and, hopefully, to officials  in Vietnam.   I want to thank the Secretary of State and our Ambassador to Vietnam  for their intervention. We are all doing as much as we can, but we all  have to do more. Until he comes home, we have not done enough.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
