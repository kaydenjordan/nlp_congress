 Mr. Speaker, what do we think would happen in this country  if we said we were only going to lock up 1,000 people, total, for  murder? Well, probably, after the thousandth person was arrested and  locked up, you would have a lot more murders, not less, because people  would think they could get away with it.   The caravans that are forming in Central and South America and coming  toward our southern border aren't shrinking; they are growing. That is  why Democrats don't want us to be able to lock up all the people who  commit the crime of unlawful entry into the country, because they want  to induce that illegal immigration.   Well, Mr. Speaker, we want to stop it, and our negotiators are  operating in good faith, but now Democrats are adding new issues.   Here is my challenge to Speaker Pelosi: If she has got a bill that  can pass with Democratic votes to secure the border, put it on the  floor, because we are tired of negotiating when the goalposts keep  moving, when the terms keep changing, and when Democrats do not appear  sincere about securing our border.   It is like we are negotiating against a ghost. We are tired of it,  and the American people are tired of it.                            ____________________
