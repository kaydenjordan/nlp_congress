 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Manheim  Township High School boys lacrosse team, who recently won the program's  first-ever PIAA State title. The Blue Streaks defeated La Salle, 6 to  4, in the PIAA Class 3A championship game this past Saturday to bring  the title to Lancaster County.   Manheim Township of District 3 became the first school from outside  Districts 1 or 12 to win the boys lacrosse title since the tournament  began. This historic championship is a fitting end to an excellent  season that also included a program best 26-1 record and both the  Lancaster-Lebanon League and District 3 titles. These young men have  put in countless hours of hard work to achieve this incredible result.   As I have said before, high school sports are about more than just  winning. They are about teaching our children valuable skills such as  teamwork, commitment, and perseverance. They build character and create  memories that will last a lifetime. These young men have displayed  these valuable skills throughout their entire season, and I am proud to  represent them. I look forward to the team's future successes.   Congratulations to the Manheim Township High School boys lacrosse  team, the coaches, their families, and the faculty, staff, and students  who enabled this historic title.                          Combating Opioid Epidemic     Mr. Speaker, I would like to address another topic this  morning. I want to speak in support of the House's efforts to combat  the opioid epidemic that has swept across Pennsylvania and across the  Nation. This week, the House is voting on more than 30 opioid-related  bills, with many more to come next week as well.   Sadly, you would be hard-pressed today to find someone who hasn't  been impacted by this epidemic or who doesn't know someone who has. It  transcends socioeconomic and geographic lines and makes no distinction  between age, income, race, gender, or politics.   Hundreds of thousands of American lives have been cut short by drug  abuse. In my region of Pennsylvania, prescription drugs, heroin, and  fentanyl are the leading causes of death in several communities. In  fact, our region has experienced a 23 percent increase in opioid- related deaths in 2018 as compared to the same time period in 2017.   Too many families feel broken and feel lost. Those whom we know  personally--our neighbors, our family, and our friends--are working to  save the lives of those whom they love.   Our constituents should know that we here in Congress have their  backs. They should know that we are working to provide them with the  resources necessary to prevent addiction, to treat abuse, and to help  families and individuals recover.   This week and next, the House is passing legislation that changes the  way opioids are prescribed and encourages alternative methods and  medications to treat pain. We are cracking down on deadly synthetic  drugs like fentanyl. We are giving law enforcement tools to get  dangerous drugs off our streets and out of our communities, and we are  improving data used to help at-risk patients, families, and those who  are already struggling with addiction.   Our communities are coming together and standing side by side to help  each other through this difficult time. Those struggling with addiction  and their family and friends are getting some much-needed assistance  from Congress. Both in Washington and in Pennsylvania, I will continue  to work with my colleagues, community leaders, healthcare  professionals, and law enforcement to prioritize an immediate and  effective response to save the lives of those we love.                            ____________________
