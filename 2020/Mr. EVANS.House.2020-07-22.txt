 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor a truly great American and a  real-life hero.   I was fortunate enough to have him as a colleague for 4 years.  Congressman John Lewis has been an inspiration to me at a very young  age.    I remember the first time I saw him was on the evening news. He was  walking across the Pettus Bridge. I felt very strongly about him and  what he was doing. I was 10 years old, and I found him to be inspiring.  He was purposeful. He was driven to make a difference. He was driven to  make some good trouble.   Now, we must carry on with the work of civil rights and equal  opportunity.   Rest in power, Congressman Lewis.
