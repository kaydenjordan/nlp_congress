 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service of my  friend and district office staffer Greg Burkot.   A proud Bardstown resident, Greg served the Second District as a  field representative from 2009 to 2021. He represented my office in  Edmonson, Hart, LaRue, Meade, and Nelson Counties and was a key liaison  to constituents in those communities.   Greg and his wife, Paula, have two daughters, the apple of his eyes,  Rebecca and Allyson, with their husbands, and their three  grandchildren. They are also active in their community and church.   I will miss Greg's welcoming personality, and I thank him for his  service to the Second District and the Commonwealth.   I wish Greg the best on his retirement, and I hope he and Paula enjoy  this next chapter of their lives as parents and grandparents and as  retirees.                            ____________________
