 Madam Speaker, I rise today to address yet  another tragic school shooting. Yesterday, a gunman killed two students  and wounded three others in Santa Clarita, California.   While we continue to gather the facts and pray for everyone in that  California community, we must also continue to fight for action on gun  violence.   It has been 261 days since the House passed the Bipartisan Background  Checks Act. That bill is buried in Mitch McConnell's legislative  graveyard. In that time, at least 320 mass shootings have occurred.   While I don't expect Senate Republicans to agree with every word of  every bill that we pass here in the House, I do expect them to do their  job. They need to hold hearings. They need to have a vote.   The American people deserve better.  [[Page H8906]]                                ____________________
