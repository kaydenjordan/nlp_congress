 Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to my dear  friend and colleague, the former senator from Alaska, Ted Stevens. He  was an incomparable and one of kind senator.   With Ted, they broke the mold.   To me, he was my friend, mentor, and a person that comes along your  pathway of life who changes everything.   In all my years in the House, I seldom sheathed my sword with  appropriators who were always rustling our mandatory and authorized  money. Our cause was just, but seldom successful.   It did not take Ted and Danny Inouye long to convince me not only to  sheath my sword but give it to them. I had been in the Senate for just  a few months when Ted cornered me on the Senate floor, jabbed me in my  shoulder and said, ``You're coming with me to North Korea. Don't argue  with me, Dole says you are Mr. Agriculture. You don't have to say  anything, just nod your head.''   He was trying to arrange a third-party grain sale to alleviate  constant famines in North Korea. He and Danny almost pulled it off.   If you wanted to get things done, it was a good idea to listen to  Uncle Ted. His advice: ``Get to really know people. Don't pay attention  to partisan diatribes, socialize and gain their trust.''   By following his advice, it is amazing what you can get done. I still  apply those lessons today; it works: 87 votes for a farm bill that the  President just signed last year.   Example may be better than advice, but when the two join hands they  make a team that is hard to beat and that would be Ted Stevens and his  friend--if not brother--Danny Inouye. Either one could be chairman, and  the result would be the same in behalf of our military and national  security.   We who have the public trust know we are only as good as our staff,  and Ted had the best, many of whom are in the audience.   As the Senator toting the bucket for our beloved Marine Corps, I  mention one: Sid Ashworth.   Back in the day, the Commandant would trust me to follow up after  meeting with Ted. We all knew the Air Force got top dollar; then the  Army, Navy, and maybe we got retread tires and bailing wire.   Sid said, ``Take in three requests. Make the first so big, he'll say,  `You know we can't afford that.' Then with number two, make that  difficult to understand and fill it with acronyms, and he'll shut you  down. Finally for your third request: take your number one ask and  plead your case, `What am I going to tell the Commandant? At least give  me this.' ''   And it would work. Then I would call the Commandant and casually say,  ``Sir, we're okay, we got our top ask.'' Thanks, Sid.   My relationship with Ted was simple, I did what he asked. On a CODEL,  very late at night, we were watching ``Band of Brothers''--again; it  was Ted's favorite. All lights were off, it was past midnight, everyone  fast asleep. I was sitting next to Ted whose eyes were closed, so I got  up quietly and attempted to turn the TV off. Ted said in a very loud  voice, ``Leave it on, this next part is the best part.'' I sat down.   ``Temper is a valuable possession, don't lose it,'' Ted Stevens. Our  Tuesday policy lunch often included discussions of appropriations bills  versus policy and ideology. One day, Ted had enough and shouted, ``When  are you people going to understand, without Democrat votes, we cannot  pass appropriations bills!''   He left the room, slammed the door so hard that Mike Mansfield's  portrait almost fell to the floor.   I waited about a minute, followed him down to his Appropriations  office.   I strode in and said, ``Why in the hell did you do that?''   He said, ``You don't understand, I'm not angry, I just use my anger  as a tool.''   Nevertheless, when he donned his ``Hulk Tie'' colleagues steered  clear.   Ted Stevens had a wonderful perspective on life. A successful person  can lay a firm foundation with bricks that others have thrown at him.  Even the longest day will have an end, and it did. The Alaskan of the  Century was vindicated.   With this grand portrait, he returns to the Senate, and he will  remain here for decades to come.   In just 7 months, Ted and Danny will be honored again at the  dedication of the Dwight David Eisenhower Memorial, Ted's favorite  President.   They led the charge to create the memorial. The dedication will be on  May 8, 2020, and the memorial will be another part of Ted Stevens'  legacy.   It was a privilege to know and serve with him and to share his  friendship. Alaska and our country are better and stronger thanks to  his duty and devotion.   We will never see the likes of Ted Stevens again. However, he still  lives within all of our hearts, and we thank the Lord for enabling us  to live in his space and time.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
