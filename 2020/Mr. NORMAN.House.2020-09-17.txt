 Mr. Speaker, today is a special day in which we pause to  cherish the bedrock of our union that is the Constitution.   The great experiment that is this Nation rests upon the spirit that  Madison enshrined in this document. It is the  [[Page H4495]]  unwavering commitment to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,  the American ethos that sustains us to this day.   The essence of our democratic republic lies in the words, ``We the  People.'' This creed is the glue that holds our United States together,  and it ought to be revered. When held close, our Nation will continue  to prosper through generations to come. As Henry Clay once said, ``The  Constitution of the United States was made not merely for the  generation that then existed, but for posterity-unlimited, undefined,  endless, perpetual posterity.''   Unique to the world is our tireless belief in a better tomorrow. If  we are to sustain this hope, we must maintain an enduring commitment to  the ideals of the Constitution.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage every American, young and old alike, to  study the framework and celebrate the greatest Nation that this world  has ever known. Let this day serve as a reminder of everything that was  and everything that can be so long as we remain united under the  articles of the Constitution.                            ____________________
