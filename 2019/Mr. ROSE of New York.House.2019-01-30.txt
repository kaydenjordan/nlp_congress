 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the  Solidarity in Salary Act, which would withhold paychecks from Members  of Congress, the President, and the Vice President during a shutdown.   Everyone right now is trying to figure out who won the shutdown and  who lost it. Well, here is the deal: Nobody won this thing, but the  American people lost. We failed them. We turned our back on them, and  they suffered.   Keeping the government open and running is our most basic  responsibility. It is what our constituents ask of us. In just 3 weeks  we managed to make them question whether Members of Congress were born  without common sense, or whether we just get a frontal lobotomy after  we are sworn in. And what did we get out of putting them through this  misery? Nothing.   All that happened is we arrived at the same basic truth that we knew  5 weeks ago: that we had a deal. In these Halls we love to kiss up to  vets, and cops, and firemen. All we do is thank them for their service,  and rightfully so, because they put it all on the line each and every  day.   But it is time that we actually try to emulate their service here.  Because what they do, what they have to endure is that when they fail  at their job, people die. People get hurt, and they have to live with  that for the rest of their lives.   All this bill is talking about is us having skin in the game and not  getting paid. We, as Members of Congress, should be feeling the same  pain that we just inflicted on the American people.                            ____________________
