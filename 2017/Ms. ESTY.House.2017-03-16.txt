 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I recently joined the Committee on Veterans' Affairs  because of its bipartisan history of working together to improve care  for our veterans. I stand ready to work with the committee--in  particular, with Chairman Roe--and with every Member of this House to  improve and work on the important issues that affect our veterans every  day. However, I cannot support this bill, and I strongly urge my  colleagues to oppose it.    As this House knows all too well, there is a veterans suicide crisis  in this country, a crisis that is enabled by the easy access to  firearms. Just last week, the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs, David  Shulkin, told the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs that the issue  of veteran suicide is one of his highest priorities, and it needs to be  a priority of this House as well.   Today, on this day that we have this debate, 20 brave men and women  who have worn the uniform in service of this country will take their  lives in suicide, and the vast majority of them will use a gun.   As folks all over the country who have helped veterans know, the  means matter. Research has shown that more than 85 percent of suicide  attempts with a firearm are ultimately fatal compared with just 5  percent for all other means. That is why addressing the public health  crisis in the veteran community demands a thoughtful and comprehensive  approach: to ensure that veterans in crisis do not have easy access to  guns and that they get the care that they need and deserve.   And yet, today, this House is voting on legislation that completely  ignores the crisis that many of our most vulnerable veterans are  facing. Unfortunately, this bill was rushed to the floor with no  consideration in committee, collaboration, or even time for all of us  to understand its full implications. The majority scheduled H.R. 1181  for a vote in committee last week with the bare minimum notice  required, even having to move the start time of the markup to comply  with the 48-hour notice requirement.   During last week's committee markup, I raised the concern shared by  many who work closely on this issue that H.R. 1181 would end up being  applied retroactively. The result of this bill being applied  retroactively would mean that, if it should pass, more than 170,000  veterans currently prohibited from owning a firearm would be able to  [[Page H2104]]  pass a background check and buy a gun.   While the chairman expressed his sincere intent and desire that this  legislation not be applied retroactively, it is fair to say that  reasonable people disagree on how this bill would be implemented. This  honest disagreement, alone, illustrates exactly why this House should  be taking its time on a bill that could have such a profound impact on  our Nation's veterans.   The fact of the matter is that, should H.R. 1181 be signed into law,  it would need to be read together with the NICS Improvement Amendments  Act of 2007, which requires--requires--Federal agencies to update the  records they have previously shared with NICS, meaning, should this  bill pass, the VA would be required to remove the 170,000 records they  have previously shared with NICS since none of those were approved by a  court, nor did they meet the new standard established by this bill.   Now, with respect to the text of the bill itself, the Veterans 2nd  Amendment Protection Act, contrary to its name, would create an end run  around the firearms mental health prohibitor that we have attempted to  refine and improve since Congress passed the Brady Act nearly 20 years  ago and the bipartisan NICS Improvement Amendment Act of 2007.   Put simply, this bill would make it easier, not harder, for those  veterans in crisis to get access to a firearm by establishing a new  judicial requirement that is far higher than any other agency's or  department's implementation of the firearms mental health prohibitor,  and, quite frankly, would be impractical, if not impossible, for the VA  to actually use. The VA is already strapped for resources, and it is  unclear if it has the legal standing to initiate a legal proceeding  such as that suggested in the bill.   As Members of this House know very well, there has been a fierce  debate in this country over the meaning and extent of the Second  Amendment right to bear arms. But the question before this House today  is not whether an American has a right to own a firearm. The Supreme  Court has been very clear on this issue, and the controlling law has  been settled. However, constitutional rights are not absolute. As the  late Justice Scalia wrote in the controlling Supreme Court Heller  decision on the Second Amendment, ``the Second Amendment is not  unlimited.''   The question before this House is whether we are going to summarily  overturn the VA's efforts over the last 20 years to help prevent  veteran suicide and protect veterans' families by reporting the names  of veterans with serious mental health issues to the National Instant  Criminal Background Check System, known as NICS.   Supporters of this legislation argue that the current process used by  the VA to share mental health records with NICS is overinclusive and  must be thrown out and replaced with a process that ensures veterans'  due process rights.   I agree that the current process is overinclusive, and I agree that  we must do more to ensure veterans have sufficient notice, an  opportunity to be heard, and a meaningful opportunity to appeal any  decision that may impact their constitutional rights; and I stand ready  to work with my colleagues on the committee and in this House to more  specifically tailor the application of the firearms background checks  law as it applies to veterans, both prospectively and retroactively.                                time  1430    But a wholesale elimination of the VA's long-established practice to  help keep firearms out of the hands of veterans who are at serious risk  of harming themselves or others is dangerous and misguided.   To be clear, of the 170,000 veterans currently prohibited from owning  a firearm, as of 2015, almost 20,000 of them were diagnosed with  schizophrenia, over 11,000 with dementia, and over 5,000 with  Alzheimer's. For a veteran suffering with a significant mental health  condition like one of these, access to a firearm is a serious matter.   Moreover, just 3 months ago, this Congress passed bipartisan  legislation that codified a process for how the VA can make a  determination of the mental capacity of a veteran before that  information is sent to NICS. The 21st Century Cures Act, which passed  this House 3 months ago by a vote of 392-26, required a veteran to be  provided notice of a proposed financial competency determination and  given an opportunity to be heard, present evidence, and be represented  at a hearing.   H.R. 1181 seeks to undo this carefully crafted compromise before we  even have a chance to study the impacts of the 21st Century Cures Act  or the VA's existing practices.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter signed by 12 veterans,  including retired Generals Stanley McChrystal and David Petraeus, whose  leadership and support for our military and veterans community is  unquestioned and who believe that this bill could put mentally ill  veterans in harm's way by giving them easy access to firearms.                                             Veterans Coalition for                                                    Common Sense,                                                     March 14, 2017.      Hon. Mitch McConnell,      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Chuck Schumer,      Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Leader Schumer, Speaker       Ryan and Leader Pelosi, As dedicated service members and       members of the Veterans Coalition for Common Sense, we write       to you today to express our grave concerns with legislation       being considered by Congress, the Veterans 2nd Amendment       Protection Act. This proposal would put America's veterans       who need our support the most in harm's way by providing them       with easy access to firearms. Instead of passing this       irresponsible and dangerous legislation, Congress should       instead do more to guarantee that all veterans have access to       world-class medical and counseling services. We urge you to       oppose this bill.        Our nation is facing a devastating epidemic of veteran       suicide. The bill you are debating comes at a time when an       average of 20 veterans commit suicide each day, two-thirds of       whom do so by using a firearm. We know that non-deployed       veterans are at a 61 percent higher risk of suicide compared       to the American civilian population, and deployed veterans       are at a 41 percent higher risk. Firearms are the most lethal       means when it comes to suicide, resulting in death nine out       of ten times. When vulnerable veterans have access to       firearms, they can do harm not only to themselves but also to       family members and loved ones. The impact of these tragedies       is felt in communities across our nation.        Last week, we were pleased to hear Secretary of Veterans       Affairs (VA) David Shulkin announce his intent to provide       urgent mental health care services to veterans with other-      than-honorable discharges. This is a step in the right       direction. Over 22,000 soldiers in the Army alone have       received these bad paper discharges since 2009 due to mental       health conditions, and they are among the ones who most need       access to comprehensive mental health services.        But they are not the only ones. In 2008, President Bush       signed a law requiring all federal agencies to submit the       names of individuals who are legally prohibited from       possessing guns to the National Instant Criminal Background       Check System (NICS). Since then, the VA has submitted over       174,000 names of servicemen and women who require a fiduciary       to manage their benefits and have been determined through       clear and convincing evidence to meet the federal standard       for gun prohibition. Of these 174,000, 19,000 are individuals       that suffer from schizophrenia and another 15,000 have severe       PTSD.        For these individuals, possession of a firearm could be       fatal. The Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act would put at       risk the safety of these veterans and our communities by       changing the standard for gun prohibition, so the VA's       determinations would no longer stop a veteran from obtaining       a gun. Instead, the names of veterans already in the       background check system would be erased, putting them at much       greater risk of self-harm. This would be irresponsible,       dangerous, and life threatening to those who need access to       care, not weapons.        Just last year, Congress worked to ensure that all veterans       have appropriate due process protections in place through the       21st Century Cures Act. This codified existing practice and       guaranteed that individuals who disagree with their final       adjudication have the ability to appeal this determination.        We appreciate your service to your country in the United       States Congress, and look forward to working with you to       support and protect our men and women in uniform and their       communities. In doing so, we urge you to oppose the Veterans       2nd Amendment Protection Act. Thank you for your       consideration.            Sincerely,          Admiral Thad Allen, USCG (Ret.); General Peter W.             Chiarelli, USA (Ret.); General Wesley Clark, USA             (Ret.); General Michael V. Hayden, USA (Ret.);  [[Page H2105]]             General James T. Hill, USA (Ret.); General Stanley A.             McChrystal, USA (Ret.); Admiral Eric T. Olson, USN             (Ret.); General David H.

Cheney, USMC (Ret.).     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter from  Everytown for Gun Safety and a coalition letter led by the Newtown  Action Alliance signed by over 40 organizations from around the country  opposing this bill.                                       Everytown for Gun Safety,                                        New York, NY, March 7, 2017.      Re Reject H.R. 1181, which would put U.S. veterans in danger.       Hon. Phil Roe,      Chairman, House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Tim Walz,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Roe and Ranking Member Walz: I write to       express Everytown for Gun Safety's strong opposition to H.R.       1181. In the midst of a suicide epidemic among our veterans,       this bill would discard hundreds of thousands of mental       health records from the background check system and enable       Veterans Affairs beneficiaries suffering from severe mental       illness to buy firearms.        The stakes could not be higher. Twenty U.S. veterans take       their lives each day--a suicide rate more than 20 percent       higher than among the civilian population. Two in three of       those suicides are carried out with firearms. While suicide       in the general population has decreased since the turn of the       century, suicide among veterans has not.        H.R. 1181 would repeal the law that blocks VA beneficiaries       from possessing or purchasing firearms if they have been       found mentally incompetent, after receiving due process and       the right to a formal hearing. According to the VA, more than       170,000 prohibiting records for these beneficiaries are       already in the background check system. Under this       legislation, those records would no longer lead to a failed       background check--and would be removed from the system       entirely. H.R. 1181 would roll back the law that prohibits       people with a VA incompetency finding from purchasing       firearms--even though many of these beneficiaries suffer from       schizophrenia or severe long-term post traumatic stress       disorder.        The current process works, and it provides veterans with       due process. To make an incompetency finding, VA officials       must have clear and convincing evidence. The beneficiary has       an opportunity to request a formal hearing and may appeal an       adverse decision to a federal judge. Indeed, the 21st Century       Cures Act, passed in 2016 by the Republican Congress and       signed into law by President Obama, provides new comfort at       the statutory level that beneficiaries can present evidence       from a mental health professional and be represented by       counsel at incompetency hearings.        When it comes to suicide, means matter. When suicide is       attempted with a firearm, the chances that a person will       actually end his or her life are radically increased. Because       firearms are uniquely lethal, up to 90 percent of suicide       attempts with guns result in death. In addition, suicide is       often an impulsive act and 90 percent of people who attempt       and fail to kill themselves do not end up dying from suicide.       Preventing firearm access in these moments of crisis can be       the difference between a long life and a tragedy.        I urge you to protect our service members and veterans by       rejecting H.R. 1181.            Sincerely,                                                    John Feinblatt,      President.                                   ____                                          Newtown Action Alliance,                                        Newtown, CT, March 14, 2017.        Dear Members of Congress: We strongly urge you to oppose       H.R. 1181--Veterans 2nd Amendment Protection Act, a bill that       would immediately remove 174,000 individuals deemed       ``mentally incompetent'' by the Department of Veterans       Affairs (VA) Secretary from the National Instant Criminal       Background Check System (NICS). These individuals who suffer       from serious mental illnesses like dementia, schizophrenia,       and severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) will be able       to access firearms more easily. With veteran suicide rate       increasing by 32.2% from 2001 to 2014, Congress should be       closing the background check loopholes rather than weakening       our background check system.        Please thoroughly review the 2014 veteran suicide       statistics from VA's Fact Sheet on Suicide Prevention to       understand why HB 1181 must be opposed to reduce the tragic       epidemic of veteran suicides in our nation.        https://www.va.gov/opa/publications/factsh eets/      Suicide_Prevention_FactSheet_New _VA_Stats_070616_1400.pdf        ``Veteran Suicide Statistics, 2014        In 2014, an average of 20 Veterans died from suicide each       day. 6 of the 20 were users of VA services.        In 2014, Veterans accounted for 18% of all deaths from       suicide among U.S. adults, while Veterans constituted 8.5% of       the US population. In 2010, Veterans accounted for 22% of all       deaths from suicide and 9.7% of the population.        Approximately 66% of all Veteran deaths from suicide were       the result of firearm injuries.        There is continued evidence of high burden of suicide among       middle-aged and older adult Veterans. In 2014, approximately       65% of all Veterans who died from suicide were aged 50 years       or older.        After adjusting for differences in age and gender, risk for       suicide was 21% higher among Veterans when compared to U.S.       civilian adults. (2014)        After adjusting for differences in age, risk for suicide       was 18% higher among male Veterans when compared to U.S.       civilian adult males. (2014)        After adjusting for differences in age, risk for suicide       was 2.4 times higher among female Veterans when compared to       U.S. civilian adult females. (2014)        Overview of data for the years between 2001-2014        In 2014, there were 41,425 suicides among U.S. adults.       Among all U.S. adult deaths from suicide, 18% (7,403) were       identified as Veterans of U.S. military service.        In 2014, the rate of suicide among U.S. civilian adults was       15.2 per 100,000.        Since 2001, the age-adjusted rate of suicide among U.S.       civilian adults has increased by 23.0%.        In 2014, the rate of suicide among all Veterans was 35.3       per 100,000. Since 2001, the age-adjusted rate of suicide       among U.S. Veterans has increased by 32.2%.        In 2014, the rate of suicide among U.S. civilian adult       males was 26.2 per 100,000.        Since 2001, the age-adjusted rate of suicide among U.S.       civilian adult males has increased by 0.3%.        In 2014, the rate of suicide among U.S. Veteran males was       37.0 per 100,000.        Since 2001, the age-adjusted rate of suicide among U.S.       Veteran males has increased by 30.5%.        In 2014, the rate of suicide among U.S. civilian adult       females was 7.2 per 100,000.        Since 2001, the age-adjusted rate of suicide among U.S.       civilian adult females has increased by 39.7%.        In 2014, the rate of suicide among U.S. Veteran females was       18.9 per 100,000.        Since 2001, the age-adjusted rate of suicide among U.S.       Veteran females has increased by 85.2%.''        Gun suicides and homicides are preventable with common       sense gun laws. Connecticut passed the second strongest gun       violence prevention laws in America after the Sandy Hook       tragedy, without infringing on the Second Amendment rights of       gun owners. Regrettably, Congress failed to take action after       the Sandy Hook massacre and over 400,000 Americans have been       killed or injured by guns since the gunman with severe mental       illness brutally gunned down 20 innocent children and six       educators in five minutes. If it can happen in Sandy Hook       then it can happen anywhere.        We urge you to adequately represent the 90 percent of       Americans who continue to support expanded background checks       to keep guns away from individuals who are a danger to       themselves or others. We implore you to vote NO to H.R. 1181,       fix NICS and pass an expanded background check bill to       protect the military service members, our veterans, our       families and our communities throughout the United States.

Mr. Speaker, I recognize that the current practice of  information sharing between the VA and NICS is overinclusive and that  alternatives should be explored that would more appropriately balance  veterans' Second Amendment rights with ensuring that veterans who pose  a danger to themselves or to others do not have access to firearms.   This bill, however, was not considered through regular order and no  genuine attempt was made to work across the aisle or with the VA to  craft a real solution that addresses the real crisis of veterans'  suicide in this country.  [[Page H2106]]    I stand ready to work with the chairman to address legitimate  concerns regarding the VA process. And in fact, just yesterday, I  visited at length with VA Secretary Shulkin on how we can all work  together to keep our veterans safe and get them the care and support  they and their families need.   I cannot support any bill, especially one addressing an issue as  important as veterans' suicide, through this rushed process.   I ask all of my colleagues to join me in opposing H.R. 1181. Our  veterans put their lives on the line for this country. We shouldn't put  their lives and their families at risk when they need us most.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  respond to the assertion that there is no due process in this act and  that the 21st Century Cures Act did not do anything to help veterans.   The 21st Century Cures Act codified the following due process  guaranteed to veterans through the VA. Individuals are notified by the  VA that a fiduciary is recommended and are allowed 30 days to respond  with a notification of acceptance or contest, and they are notified of  the implications that this would have for being reported to NICS. The  veteran then has 60 days to present evidence against the need for a  fiduciary. And as required by law, the VA relief process allows  impacted individuals to maintain their fiduciary, but regain gun  eligibility removing their names from NICS. These are all already  processes in place.   I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano), who  is the vice ranking member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Bera).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gallego).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Brown).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I note that the chairman noted the support of some of  the veteran service organizations, and I think it is noteworthy that  the IAVA, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, has in the past  supported this bill. They do not support it this year. They do not  because they are so concerned about the crisis we are facing,  particularly in their members--those who have come back from the wars  in the last 10 or 20 years. They are concerned about that veteran  suicide crisis that we are facing and are concerned that this bill  might make that worse.   We have heard repeatedly assertions that this would be the only  category, that veterans alone would be deprived without adjudication.  That is not true. In fact, the law for the firearms prohibitor covers  many categories of people who do not have any legal determination:         Anyone who is an unlawful user or addicted to a controlled       substance is prohibited, does not require any adjudication.    The NICS has 23,000 people who are prohibited under the controlled  substance addiction and use category. Anyone adjudicated as mentally  defective or committed to a mental institution, there are 4.2 million  people. There are a wide variety of people who are in that category,  again, many without court orders. Those were aliens, those dishonorably  discharged from the Armed Forces, that is 10,000 individuals. So it is  not unique to veterans. There are other categories as well.   But I really think the bottom line is this: we have heard a great  deal of agreement that we care about our veterans, we want to prevent  military suicides, and we know that for some of these veterans, it  would be dangerous for them to have a firearm. That is precisely why  this committee should have had a hearing, so we would have had the  opportunity to systematically address these issues and find a better  way forward that recognizes that some veterans who need a fiduciary  also should not have firearms, and some who need a fiduciary, there is  no concern there. But we have been deprived of that opportunity in  committee, to do the work we should be doing in committee, to work  together in a bipartisan way to fashion a better way forward.   This is way too far. It is an overreaction to a process that should  be fixed, and we are committed to do that. But the alternative we are  presented with today will wholesale uproot the 20-year process of the  Veterans Administration that would be dangerous and wrong, and we  remain committed to working together in committee.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I note that 18 of the 26 Members of the House Veterans'  Affairs Committee did not serve during a time when there has been a  hearing on this bill--18 of us, and that includes me. The evidence that  the chairman was referencing from 2015 was from a hearing that never  occurred, so there was never an opportunity to discuss that evidence.  Again, I think this underscores the extent to which we really do need a  hearing.   I have to say, since 2012, when the Newtown shootings occurred in my  district, the public feels differently about this now, and our veterans  numbers have been going up and up. So I think it is high time for us to  have a hearing. It has been 5 years. We should be looking at this  process.   The last point I will note: there has been much made of the  Constitution today and how outrageous it is. In 20 years since this  process has been in place in the VA, I note that no one has ever  challenged this successfully in court as a violation of constitutional  due process, and I know the love our veterans have for the  Constitution, as we do in this Chamber. That tells me that many  families, for example, actually are relying on this.   So, again, I pledge to the chairman we should be working together in  committee to get this process right. This is not the way to do it, not  with this bill, not with the questions, and not without an opportunity  for us to do the things I have referenced.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, we have heard spirited and passionate remarks here  today, but I think it underscores how much we would benefit, the  veterans that we serve would benefit, their families, and this Chamber  would benefit from our pursuing regular order with this very important  topic. So, again, I urge in the strongest possible terms for my  colleagues to vote against this bill, to give us the opportunity to get  this process right, to safeguard our veterans, protect them from  military suicide, and to preserve their rights in the best possible  way. This hastily considered, rushed-through legislation that leaves  way too many questions and way too much risk for our veterans I must  strongly oppose.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
