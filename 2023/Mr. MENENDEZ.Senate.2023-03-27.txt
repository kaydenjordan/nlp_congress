 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be  allowed to complete my statement before the vote.    Madam President, the vote the Senate is about to take  is about what is right for our Nation. It is part of exercising our  most solemn duty as elected officials. It is a recognition that  Congress not only has the power to declare war but also should have the  responsibility to end wars, and it is a decision to turn the page on  one of those chapters in our country's history.   With today's vote, we can move closer to repealing two obsolete and  outdated authorizations for the use of military force against Iraq.  Repealing these authorizations will demonstrate to the region--and to  the world--that the United States is not an occupying force; that the  war in Iraq has come to an end; that we are moving forward, working  with Iraq as a strategic partner. So I commend the Senate for moving  forward to take this critical step.   I hope the Senate will speak overwhelmingly in support of preserving  congressional prerogatives as to when and under what circumstances we  send our sons and daughters, brothers and sisters into harm's way and  clawing back authorities that have clearly outlived their purpose and  scope.   Some of my colleagues have argued that repealing 20- and 30-year-old  authorizations will weaken our ability to confront Iranian aggression.  Some have offered amendments that would alter these authorizations.  Others have offered amendments that would expand these authorizations.  And a few have offered amendments that have, well, quite frankly,  nothing at all to do with these authorizations. So let me address that  point briefly.   Just in the last few days, the President directed targeted strikes  against groups affiliated with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps  in Syria. This was in response to Iranian-backed drone attacks that  killed a U.S. contractor and wounded five American servicemembers at a  maintenance facility in Syria. The President looked at the  intelligence, he consulted his advisors, he ordered the strike, and he  committed, publicly, to continue to defend against Iranian aggression  and to respond to attacks against U.S. forces. He did so without-- without--relying on the 1991 or 2002 authorizations for use of military  force against Iraq.   This President has been clear in his view that he has sufficient  authority to defend against threats to U.S. personnel and interests. If  we are going to debate whether to provide the President additional  authorities, then we should have that debate separately. But it should  not be under the cloak of keeping old authorizations on the books,  authorizations that are not needed to meet any current threat. They are  not about the current threat; they are about a regime that is no longer  alive and has been gone for the better part of those 20 years. This is  just a tactic to delay this repeal from going forward. Nor should we  turn a debate about repeal and a chance to take  [[Page S950]]  a historic step forward into a new backdoor authorization for the use  of force against another country.   So I urge my colleagues to stay focused on the facts, repeal an  authorization that is no longer used or needed, and close this chapter  on American foreign policy. Let's finally--finally--repeal the 1991 and  2002 authorizations for use of military force against Iraq. I urge my  colleagues to vote to move forward with repeal of these AUMFs.   I yield the floor.                                Cloture Motion
