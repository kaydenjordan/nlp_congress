 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Louisiana (Mr.  Johnson).   Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today with one clear message for the  American people: Bad policies have bad consequences.   Not that many weeks ago, we had a thriving and stable economy. We  were energy-independent. We were a sovereign Nation with a secure  border. Now, roughly 100 days into Joe Biden's presidency, we are  living in what feels like the twilight zone with gas shortages, 2008  levels of inflation, rampant and out-of-control spending, high  unemployment rates, destruction in the Middle East, political  correctness and wokeness, winning the war on common sense, and worst of  all, a massive border crisis.   These things didn't just happen, folks. They are the direct result of  the left's conscious policy decisions--or rather delusions. Is this the  America they really wanted?   Unfortunately, the mainstream media wants to distract you from the  colossal failures of America's weakest President and his  administration. In fact, the liberal media dedicated approximately zero  minutes of airtime to  [[Page H2600]]  the April illegal border crossing numbers, which were the worst in our  Nation's history.   But I am here to tell you the truth. Biden's foolhardy policies have  created a disaster on America's southern border. He has failed us. He  has failed you and your family. And most importantly, he has failed to  maintain the sovereignty of our beloved Nation.   We cannot begin to comprehend the lasting impact that Biden's border  crisis will have on the sanctity and security of this Nation. And as I  wade through the anarchic waters of living in Joe Biden and the  Democrat's America, I am reminded of the words of Alexander the Great,  when he said, ``I am not afraid of an army of lions led by a sheep; I  am afraid of an army of sheep led by a lion.''   My friends, leadership is everything. And sadly, right now, our  country is in desperate need of a real leader.
