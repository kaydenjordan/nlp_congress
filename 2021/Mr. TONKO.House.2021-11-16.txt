 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for leading us in  this discussion this evening.   So what does the infrastructure bill mean to my district, mean to me?  I think it is sharpening our competitive edge.   And when you are out there functioning in a global economy, we may  not be the only force out there as we were decades ago, and so  sharpening that pencil and making certain we cut costs, costs for  families, costs for production, and providing for resources that will  put the tools in the kit that are required for a 21st century economy  is what it is all about. We have back-burnered infrastructure for far  too long.   Having been here now, this is my 13th year in Congress,  infrastructure is not a Democratic or Republican idea. People have been  talking about it in both Chambers in both parties for a long time. And  every week in the last administration was infrastructure week.   But finally it took leadership.   President Biden, with his experience of almost four decades in the  Senate and serving as Vice President, knew about those relationships.  He knew that you had to negotiate across party lines, you had to  negotiate across House lines to make certain that working with his  administration and with his cabinet officials we would come up with a  blueprint for a sound economy. And that is exactly what happened here.  [[Page H6305]]    Yesterday's bill signing was exciting. We were sitting together on  that south lawn.    It was chilly and windy, so it felt even chillier than it  was. But what was so important to recognize and to consume was that  what you had here was a President who is in the likes of Abraham  Lincoln, who built an intercontinental rail system; President Teddy  Roosevelt, who set up a National Parks System; President Dwight  Eisenhower, who set up the Interstate Highway System. This person  stands as a giant when it comes to infrastructure now, someone who  brought us together; and it wasn't talk on and on, it was negotiations.  And finally now the first step in this process, the huge downpayment on  our infrastructure, is very vital.   So to me it is about competition, but it is also about hope,  providing a spirit of hope for working families in this country to know  that there is a bolder tomorrow.   I liken our country to the pioneer spirit. I think it is part of our  DNA. We showed again that there is spirit, spirit to embrace invention  and innovation as we are going through R&D dollars to develop more  efficiency and effectiveness with wind power.   We are going to invest in my State and across the 50 States in  infrastructure that ranges from roads and bridges to ports, making them  more secure, more equipped for the modern economy, making certain that  we are providing for a response to the transportation sector for  climate's sake.   This allows us to be better stewards in protecting our planet, making  certain the next generations that follow us will have a better world.  That is done by us making certain that in my State where there are  those nonattainment areas, in accordance with the Clean Air Act, they  will now clean up that air that they breathe; the water that they  drink; the soils that they can restore. That is part of an economic  response.   And as we restore some of those sites--many of them are in  communities of color, neighborhoods of Brown and Black people, who will  now prosper because they will remediate these soils and now go forward  with opportunities for work.   So this is about putting people to work. The jobs that will be part  of this will be tremendous. And it is just a green light to go forward  and really focus on our efforts as we travel forward to invest in those  dynamics that truly matter.   I look at my State, they are scheduled to receive approximately--we  are still working out the numbers--some $30 million to build our  airports into a stronger bit of infrastructure. Important in  international travel. Making certain that we invest in the Northeast  corridor with Amtrak. Our rail system requires, for safety sake and  ridership time, an investment. And so those dollars of some $66 billion  will be going towards Amtrak. $100 billion going toward roads and  bridges in this country. Making certain that we address one of the  issues very important to the subcommittee that I chair, the  Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change, that reports to the  standing Committee on Energy and Commerce, that subcommittee under its  umbrella has the responsibilities of implementing the Safe Drinking  Water Act. And what we found is that we need to invest heavily in our  drinking water infrastructure.    Think of it, the spaghetti below our communities, below our feet, is  so critical in getting a commodity that is essential, sound, pristine  drinking water to industry, to homes, to schools. That begins and ends  with sound infrastructure.   And some of this infrastructure, Representative Cartwright, is dating  back to the days of Rutherford B. Hayes in the White House.   We are not content with our phones because they are outdated, and we  have had them 2 years. We are not content with our TV screen because it  is not large enough. We are tired of the miles on the car or the color  of it, so we get a new vehicle. But we are content to sit there with  100-year-old pipes that are providing an essential commodity for this  economy and for the safety of people in their homes and in schools.   So this is about investing $55 billion in lead pipe removal, which is  going to put a lot of pipefitters and plumbers into working situations  as they replace these pipes. No child, no family should be drinking  water that is lead infested. And for us to know that there are 10,000  pipes actively serving communities across this country, it is far past  time to respond to that replacement mechanism, which this bill does.   So, obviously, I am listening to the colloquy you have had with so  many of our colleagues tonight, and we can go on and on about the  benefits of this bill. There are tremendous benefits that put people to  work in union jobs so that they will be given a salary, a check, a  paycheck that is commensurate with the skill and the talent they bring  for all of us as Americans.                                time  1700    And putting people to work, stronger stewardship of our planet, and  innovation concepts that will take us to the next economy of the 21st  century, these are all virtuous outcomes. And how 206 Members of this  House could vote against infrastructure when they talked about it, they  touted it for years. But they were okay to support a tax cut that went  to the 1 percent of wealth of this country and some of the largest  corporations in the world. But for the working families, for the middle  class community of this country, for those looking to ascend the middle  class, there was a ``no'' vote, while you could have made it so  competitive, sharpen that competitive edge, give us the skills and the  talents and the resources we need, making certain we go forward with a  sense of hope, a spirit of hope that we can do, that we can embrace  that pioneer spirit of this country.   Madam Speaker, the President yesterday said to the President of  China, I believe it was, when he asked him, What is America? How would  you define it?   Possibilities. Opportunity. Possibility. Pioneer spirit. All of that  comes together in one venue that is enabled by these bills that are  going to address infrastructure. And that bill signing yesterday for  that infrastructure bill, that was a powerful statement, a powerful  moment. One that says ``can do.'' Yes, America. We are back. We are  going to make certain that all of the good work that is done will  improve our economy, strengthen our economy, and provide for a  competitive edge that will keep us the strong economy in the world that  we ought to be.    Not at all.    Absolutely.    Oh my gosh, this is generational. We haven't seen this  kind of investment in ages. So when we look back at that interstate  railroad system, we look back at the park system, we look back at the  interstate issues, these are infrastructure investments that are still  providing for us.   I look at some of the work that came under President Franklin  Roosevelt's administration and the infrastructure in my district,  phenomenal schools that are like fortresses that are part of the  cityscape, the landscape of any community that are still tremendous  bits of architecture that are serving a very useful purpose.   When we think about the Rural Electrification Act of about a century  ago, people are still prospering from that connection. As you called  it, the pockets that were unserved or underserved.   So this is going to be a lifetime and beyond for even the youngest of  our communities, as we celebrated yesterday.   We look at the broadband that is also part of this process, how can  you allow for communities to go unserved or underserved. This is about  children doing their homework. This is about cottage industry surviving  and growing. This is about security for those who live in remote rural  areas or in some poor neighborhoods. This is a connection with the  outside world. So the connection that  [[Page H6306]]  comes with this via rail, via airports, via jobs, via infrastructure,  via water systems that will serve us well.   I remember being back in the beginning of my elected capacity in a  county government situation. We were much stronger in our response to  water. Today, we are at about 4\1/2\ percent of any project--4\1/2\  percent is contributed from the Federal Government. It is time to  change that.   And you know what, the message that I think is important also,  Representative Cartwright, is that these issues, these concerns, these  needs--and they are needs--don't go away. So either pay for them at a  Federal level where there are much more progressive opportunities to  create the revenues--and by the way, this is all paid for, which is a  great highlight--but we had those more progressive opportunities for  revenues rather than relying on a property tax as it percolates down  into the most local of levels and say, Okay, you need this water, dig  into the purse for the property tax. Unfair. Unacceptable.   So we are here now celebrating what can be a golden moment. It was  just great to gather together yesterday and see mayors of both parties,  see governors of both parties, see the cabinet officials, seeing union  labor, seeing the private sector, seeing the faith community, all  gathering together applauding and recognizing the leadership, the  profound leadership of President Biden, Vice President Harris, their  Cabinet, and certainly those who voted for the measure in the Senate  and in the House here in Washington.    Sure.    Well, of course, we are modernizing our ports. We are  modernizing our roads and bridges. We are making certain that we have a  state-of-the-art grid for electricity sake so that as you integrate  renewables, and integrate distributed generation; you need that state- of-the-art grid. So all of this investment, starting with the  modernization of the ports allows us to take this in.   You brought up a really good point. This pandemic rocked this economy  here in the U.S. and around the world in a way that we haven't seen in  over 100 years. And for us now to be experiencing this aftermath  shouldn't be a surprise. People are staying home not spending. They  didn't go shopping; they were afraid, as they should be. They were  warned not to go into stores and spread the virus.   So it rocked the economy. And so there was a supply that was  building, and the demand was way down. And now we are trying to steady  this out. This infrastructure issue will help us. We need to work  through this now to steady the economy because we saw spikes that  obviously aren't acceptable.   The President and his team will use this infrastructure measure and  other concepts to make certain we come back and steady the economy in a  way that will get us back to normal--that is so important to do--and to  be visionary.   I see that Representative Ross is going to join us from North  Carolina, and we have been working together--perhaps you have been  working with Representative Ross, too--on offshore wind. There is a  visionary piece. And there is a way for us to really build the energy  supply in a way that is going to put a lot of people to work.   So Representative Cartwright, thank you for leading us in this  discussion tonight.    This bill is definitely going to address the supply-chain  concern. The pandemic was so instructive--supply chain, technology,  reliance on technology--making certain we learn these lessons; take  them to mind, take them to heart, and respond. And this administration  is about that.   A golden moment, a celebratory moment, once in a lifetime, once in a  generation, I am just proud to witness it. Proud to witness it and to  have cast a ``yes'' vote.   I thank all of my colleagues in the House that voted yes for  strengthening the muscle of the American economy and the American  worker.    No matter what political label you have at the end of the  day, we are all going to prosper.   When you see these headlines across the country, ``billions coming to  X State,'' and then the sidebar discussion: Entire delegation voted  ``no.'' You explain it to the public.
