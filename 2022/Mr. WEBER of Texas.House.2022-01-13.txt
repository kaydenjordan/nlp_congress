 Madam Speaker, on March 29, 1971, in Pasadena,  Texas, Mickey Gilley opened a honkytonk bearing his name and changed  the world of country music forever. Gilley's reputation grew so much  that Hollywood took notice with the hit movie ``Urban Cowboy,'' filmed  in and around the Pasadena location. Man, was it a hit.   Inspired by the real-life romance of a pair of the club's patrons,  ``Urban Cowboy'' put Gilley's on the map, revived music careers, and  launched others. It introduced two-stepping to a whole new audience and  created a lifestyle which has been adopted by millions.   Madam Speaker, 40 years later, America's love of Wrangler jeans,  cowboy boots, and pickup trucks underscores that lasting cultural  legacy.   Although the club is no more, Gilley's is certainly not forgotten.  Its memory lives on decades later through music and film, of course,  but even, more importantly, through the lives and loves of those who  frequented Gilley's. And you always knew when someone had been to  Gilley's because they had the bumper sticker to prove it.   Thank you to Mickey Gilley for introducing our way of life to the  world. Thank you to the Galveston Chamber of Commerce--at 177 years  young, Texas' oldest chamber of commerce--for honoring the 50th  anniversary of our great southeast Texas true country club and Mr.  Mickey Gilley.                            ____________________
