 Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New York for  yielding, as well as for the tremendous work she and our staffs have  done together on the Flood Insurance Affordability and Sustainability  Act of 2017.   There is a capriciousness of flooding which makes the National Flood  Insurance Program so important. You can have a mountaintop village next  to a dry gulch. If there is a sudden flash flood, folks who have lived  there 100 years suddenly find their 100-year-old homes destroyed. The  NFIP helps rebuild the lives of those who are so affected.   The Flood Insurance Program is critical, not just to that mountaintop  village but, by extension, our entire country. The economic impact of  flooding extends far beyond real estate transactions to the fundamental  vitality of communities and the workforce that operates our ports,  develops and refines our domestic energy, and produces our seafood and  agriculture for global consumption. It just makes sense.   Most towns started on the coast and on riverways because that is how  goods were transported, and the history of these waterside communities  is what makes them, one, economically vital, but, two, also makes them  susceptible to flooding. I will note that the Presiding Officer's State  of Pennsylvania, I believe, has among the most incidents of flooding in  our country--principally because there are so many riverine systems.  There is a valley with a river. If the water rises quickly, that  riverside community is flooded. Look at my State of Louisiana. It  relies on an accessible and affordable flood insurance program, but  that benefits the country.   Louisiana is the No. 1 producer of offshore oil and gas, producing  over 15 percent of our Nation's domestic energy supply. That is 15  percent of our Nation's domestic energy supply. It is home to the  second largest refining capacity in petrochemical industry. The Gulf of  Mexico is home to 11 of the top 20 U.S. ports by cargo volume, and we  have one of the largest seafood industries in the world. After  Hurricane Katrina, when our port facilities were affected and the  farmers in the Upper Missouri suddenly could not get their crop to  international markets, it shows the importance of our ports for our  entire economy.   The National Flood Insurance Program allows folks in my State to  participate in a working coast that gets that energy inland and gets  those products in the international market, and this is what provides  the value-added contribution to our domestic economy. Since the  creation of the National Flood Insurance Program, people in Louisiana  paid over $5 billion in flood insurance premiums, but, unfortunately,  we have suffered some of the greatest losses after Hurricanes Katrina,  Rita, Gustov, Isaac, and the flooding of the great Louisiana floods of  last March and August.   While the NFIP has a deficit of $24 billion--according to FEMA's  premium and payout data--the NFIP would have had a surplus if we remove  the 2005 loss year, including the losses incurred after Superstorm  Sandy. I will also note that New Orleans flooded because federally  built floodwalls designed to protect those businesses and families were  constructed in a faulty way. This has been recognized, and their  failure is what led to the expense. I am not here to say that NFIP  doesn't need reforms--it needs reforms--but to underscore the fact that  the program has worked for many years despite its failings. We need to  reauthorize the NFIP and use the opportunity to improve the program,  make it more affordable, transferring more risk to the private sector  at a lower cost, increase investment mitigation, modernizing flood  mapping to produce greater accuracy, and improve the transparency and  accountability of all the participants that operate and administer the  program.   There are a number of constituencies interested in long-term  reauthorization of NFIP. Senator Gillibrand and I know that the issue  of flooding crosses party and geographical lines. We wanted to set the  right bipartisan tone as Congress begins to debate the issue by  introducing our bill, the Flood Insurance Affordability and  Sustainability Act. We hope the legislation will contribute to the  ongoing discussion and work the committees of jurisdiction are  conducting as we move toward reauthorization of the NFIP and with the  needed reforms that enhance affordability and sustainability of the  program.   Senator Gillibrand and her staff are passionate advocates for an  affordable and sustainable flood insurance program. I am glad to work  with her on this issue. We have listened to many stakeholders: bankers,  realtors, homebuilders, flood plain managers, insurers, reinsurers,  mapping experts, local government officials, financial experts and,  most importantly, homeowners who work on our working coast and who have  so much invested in making sure they can live and raise their families  in a way which has protection from the capriciousness of flooding.   I thank my colleague from New York, as well as Senator Capito, for  her contribution to this legislation and process.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself and Mr. WARNER):   S. 1314. A bill to amend the Natural Gas Act to bolster fairness and  transparency in consideration of interstate natural gas pipelines, to  provide for greater public input opportunities, and for other purposes;  to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.
