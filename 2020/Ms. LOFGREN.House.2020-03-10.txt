The Committee on House Administration shall take all steps       practicable to make any report required under this resolution       publicly available on the official public website of the       Committee or in some other manner.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H. Res. 756.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress was created by  Speaker Nancy Pelosi on January 4, 2019, when the House adopted title  II of H. Res. 6, the House Rules package.   The House voted an overwhelming 418-12 to create the committee. The  Speaker was insistent that the committee's membership contains a  diverse set of views, which is why its membership is evenly divided  between Republicans and Democrats and is required to have two first- term Members among its ranks.   I am proud to serve on the Select Committee on the Modernization of  Congress, a committee whose guiding principle, in the words of Chairman  Derek Kilmer, is to ``make Congress work better so that the institution  and its Members can better serve the American people.''   During its first year of work, the committee has heard from former  Members, discussed making legislative information more transparent, and  focused on cultivating diversity and improving retention among  congressional staff. The committee has also worked to promote civility  and collaboration and listened carefully to Members about the  congressional schedule.   The committee is already having an effect. Shortly after a hearing on  congressional mailing standards, the Franking Commission moved quickly  to modernize their rules so Members could communicate with their  constituents more directly.   The committee's success is the very reason that the Speaker decided  to extend the life of the committee. Originally scheduled to conclude  its work after the first session, the House agreed to extend its work  for the balance of the 116th Congress.   I was pleased to work with the ranking member of the House  Administration Committee to make sure that the select committee has the  resources it needs to do its work.   H. Res. 756 incorporates the first two sets of recommendations made  by the select committee. These recommendations focus on increasing  transparency, improving human resources practices on the Hill,  improving the onboarding process for new Members, addressing needed IT  improvements, and making the proceedings and functions of the House  more accessible to all Americans.   It has been a pleasure to work with Chairman Kilmer, Vice Chairman  Graves, and the ranking member on the Committee on House Administration  as we have worked to translate recommendations into legislation.   Successful reform efforts in Congress are rare. For the most part,  these efforts fade away and are forgotten. I am glad that this reform  effort, spearheaded by the bipartisan work of the select committee, is  moving forward and that we will all see tangible results in how the  Congress operates as a result of this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Washington (Mr. Kilmer) who chairs the Select Committee on the  Modernization of Congress.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to again acknowledge the  bipartisan work of the Select Committee on the Modernization of  Congress.   As a body, we haven't focused on the need for internal reforms to  improve our work for the American people, and the Select Committee on  the Modernization of Congress has enabled us to focus on reforms and  improvements that are necessary to better serve our constituents.   It may be true, if you read the reports, some of this is boring.  Boring is good. To get these things done in a very thoughtful,  collaborative way so the system works better, so we can serve our  constituents better, it has  [[Page H1574]]  been a pleasure to work here, both as a member of the Select Committee  and certainly as chair of the House Administration Committee charged  with implementing many of these recommendations.   Mr. Speaker, I urge that all of us support H. Res. 756, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
