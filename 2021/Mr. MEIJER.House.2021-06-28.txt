 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my bill today to repeal  the outdated and unnecessary 1957 Authorization for Use of Military  Force.   We have heard from many on just how this bill originally designed to  defend Middle East nations against ``armed aggression from any country  controlled by international communism,'' how far it has outstripped its  usefulness, no longer serving any purpose, but still retains that  potential to be abused by any current or future administration to  launch unwarranted military operations in the Middle East and doing an  end run around Congress.   The repeal we are discussing today would have no impact on ongoing  operations, and is all the more reason to take it off the books  immediately, but, Mr. Speaker, a decades-long war on terror and the  lack of oversight, the lack of that reaffirming action on behalf of  Congress has demonstrated to us the risks when we neglect our  constitutional duty to oversee matters of war and peace. It is time  that Congress get back in the habit of vigorously debating and voting  on these matters because the Constitution and the American people  demand it.   I applaud the work of my colleagues to help lead this bipartisan  effort to restore Congress' authority. Congresswoman Spanberger's bill  to repeal the outdated 1991 AUMF is another critical step in this  effort, and I am proud to support her on this matter.   I also thank Congressman   Mike Gallagher and Congressman Jared  Golden for helping to lead the effort to repeal the 1957 and 1991  AUMFs. And lastly, I thank Chairman Meeks and Ranking Member McCaul for  helping to bring these bills to the House floor for a vote and for  their leadership on reprising Congress' authority in this area.   Mr. Speaker, I urge passage on this bill.
