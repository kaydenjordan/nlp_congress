 Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to  H.R. 7780.   The China virus lockdowns of our schools resulted in an undisputed  increase in mental health issues for our students, for our children.  This bill is yet another leftist response to the lockdown problems that  Democrats created.   Thanks to Democrat lockdowns in collusion with their beloved teachers  unions, students across this country are suffering academically and  mentally. You know, students--remember, the ones who we were supposed  to put first in decisions regarding our schools. That is what we used  to do.   But 9-year-old students have suffered a 7-point drop in math scores  and a 5-point drop in reading scores since 2020, losing 20 years of  academic progress, meaning children today are posting the same test  scores in reading and math as they did 20 years ago.   The CDC reports that students who experienced long-term isolation  from schools because Democrats would not reopen or let the kids come  back to school, they have experienced acutely higher feelings of  hopelessness and higher rates of attempted suicide as a result.   According to one report, emergency room visits for young girls for  attempted suicides were 51 percent higher in the spring of 2021 than in  the same period in 2019.   History will judge us harshly for how we treated children during the  China virus pandemic, regarding how this government crushed the  economy, this government crushed small businesses, this government  crushed individual liberties and sacrificed our children on the altar  of the leftist political agenda and the special interest groups.   Yet, Democrats still don't want to acknowledge that the pandemic is  over. The President said it. Then, of course, his staff is walking that  back.   Maybe it is because they want to hold on to the power that they have  accumulated in the name of the emergency, or maybe they want to hold on  to proxy voting in this Chamber, or maybe they want to hold on to the  expansion of government and the expansion of the welfare state. But  with poll numbers plunging and suburban moms and minorities and others  fleeing the Democratic Party, not to mention literally fleeing blue  States that are even more destroyed by their policies, they are  suddenly realizing and Democrats are saying: Houston, we have a  problem.   Their solutions are all wrong and promise more of what created the  suffering across America. They don't want to understand or don't care  to understand that it was government that exacerbated the problems from  the China virus lockdowns that caused the mental health issues for our  students, and expanding this government will only increase the problem.   H.R. 7780 prohibits arbitration and conflict resolution clauses in  employee benefit plans, creating an opening for trial lawyers--perhaps  the only group that the Democrats love more than teachers unions, trial  lawyers--allowing them to sue and trip up businessowners in troublesome  and expensive litigation.   Instead of empowering businessowners after the harmful lockdown  mandates from the Democrats, they instead want to create more ways to  hurt the American economy.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of my  constituent, Mr. William Eckerson of Crozet, Virginia, who celebrated  his 100th birthday on August 20, 2022.   Mr. Eckerson currently resides in Virginia's Fifth District but, as a  young man, he faithfully served the United States marines during World  War II, even serving in Iwo Jima.   Following his time in the Marines, he worked in the private sector  but maintained his commitment to the Marines by participating in the  Marine Band, various parades, and many World War II marine reunions.   Mr. Eckerson has further demonstrated his commitment to the Marines  and this country by spending years of his life cleaning up veteran  cemeteries.   When he is not serving others, Mr. Eckerson is also an avid golfer  and cheers for his beloved Boston Red Sox and New England Patriots.   It is a great privilege to honor my constituent following his 100th  birthday and thank him for his many years of service to the United  States of America and his local community.   Mr. Eckerson, I certainly hope that you and your loved ones enjoyed a  great day and celebration. May God bless you, and happy 100th birthday.                            ____________________
