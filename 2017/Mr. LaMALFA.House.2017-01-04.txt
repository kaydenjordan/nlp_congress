 Mr. Speaker, I just want to point out the pride of  Chico, California, and the First District. The Pleasant Valley High  School Vikings became State champions of football just a few weeks ago.   It was a very exciting game. They traveled south to Long Beach for  it, to beat St. Anthony. The resiliency of the Vikings was amazing. I  didn't get to go to the game myself, but I was texting back and forth  with a good friend down there. After a 17-13 halftime score, it ended  up 50-49.   The Vikings were back and forth, up and down. With just 1\1/2\  minutes left in the game, after a late interception by the other team,  they were down by 8 points. But with about 1\1/2\ minutes to go, they  drove the field, scored a touchdown, got the 2-pointer and tied. They  went into overtime. After giving up a touchdown to the other team in  overtime, they came back, drove the field once again, scored a  touchdown, and went for two and became division champions for the State  of California by a score of 50-49.   Congratulations, Pleasant Valley Vikings. Well done. You showed a lot  of heart.                            ____________________
