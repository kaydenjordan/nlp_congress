 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New York for  yielding. For over 40 years, the landmark Supreme Court decision, Roe  v. Wade, has stood as a bulwark protection for women's reproductive  rights and healthcare rights.   Now, in 2017, House Republicans are leading yet another  unconstitutional, dangerous, and outright assault on women's health and  privacy. This extreme bill not only takes aim at Roe v. Wade by  lowering the ban on abortion to 20 weeks, it goes even further by  promising to throw doctors in jail. This is a cynical, repugnant effort  by Republicans to pander to a far-right base while jeopardizing women's  health--all for a political payoff.   At the same time this House is considering a measure restricting a  woman's right to choose, we have not found time to assist 3.5 million  American citizens who are suffering and dying in Puerto Rico. You call  that pro-life? I urge Republicans: listen to the majority of Americans  who support a woman's right to privacy and a safe abortion. Reject this  shameful bill.
