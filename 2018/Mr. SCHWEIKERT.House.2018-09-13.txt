 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Hill for yielding. And to  the gentlewoman from Arizona, I thank her for doing this every year.   This is one of those moments where you are walking toward the  microphone because we just got out of votes in Ways and Means, and you  are sort of discussing in your head whether you ultimately tell the  personal story. I have two I want to share.   My reason for doing this is, if someone is watching, we have someone  in our life, and you are having self-destructive thoughts, please,  please reach out, get the help, and understand the devastation that  happens and the pain that happens when someone takes their life.   My two stories. When I very first got elected in the Phoenix- Scottsdale area, one of the very first constituent meetings I had was  with a mom. Her son had been part of the Phoenix VA. She always felt  that the prescriptions he was given put him into an emotional spiral.   They kept trying to get him mental health services. They felt all  that he was receiving was more prescriptions and a future date for  mental health services. And he took his life.   That mother, the pain, the tears, the crushing blow, what the loss of  her son's life meant to that family.   I believe now, a few years later, the Phoenix VA is better. They have  learned a lot, they understand how to be almost a quick reaction force  in helping an individual. But we need to make sure these things never  happen again.   Now for the personal one that I have never told in public.                                time  1700    I was born in an unwed mothers' home in L.A. I was adopted. It turns  out the gentleman who adopted me had multiple sclerosis. But he was a  veteran, and he was receiving his medical treatments from VA.   This is a long, long time ago, but this is about the pain that comes  when a veteran takes his or her life.   Because of the pharmaceuticals he was given, the lack of emotional  counseling, and the failure to properly diagnose his disease, he put  himself in a car in a garage, turned on the motor, and took his life.  That was my dad.   Some time later, my mother remarried Mr. Schweikert. I got readopted,  and I was blessed to grow up in a wonderful household that had brought  me to Arizona.   Many years later when I was a young adult, my mom sat me down and  told me the story. You could tell there was still that burning hole in  her heart of finding her husband, my dad, dead in that car, having  taken his own life, believing it was the failure of the very services  he was receiving from the VA.   Now it is decades later, and I believe we have learned a lot. This  body has tried as hard as it can to get their heads around: Are we  allowing too many pharmaceuticals to be prescribed? Are we not  providing emotional services? Do we need to put resources into having  that communal get-together, the quick reaction force?   I believe it is getting better.   But understand the pain that Mom shared with me when I was first  elected about the loss of her son. Even these many, many years later,  it is still part of our family's legacy of that pain. If this body can  do anything, if we can find ways to make that pain come to an end, then  we will have done something very honorable and very powerful.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Hill for yielding to me.
