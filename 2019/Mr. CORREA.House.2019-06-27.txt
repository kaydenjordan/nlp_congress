 Madam Speaker, today I rise to congratulate the Hector  Godinez Fundamental High School women's softball team on their first  ever CIF Southern Section championship victory. The team clinched their  first ever title for the school and for Santa Ana Unified School  District.   Their head coach, Ed Medina, has been the coach since the school  opened in 2007 and was named the 2019 Orange County Softball Coach of  the Year.   His assistant coaches--Clarissa Castellanos, Kevin Pola, and Selene  Pola--are also to be commended.   Again, I congratulate the team, the coaches, and, of course,  Principal Jesse Church on a job well done.   Congratulations, Grizzlies.                            ____________________
