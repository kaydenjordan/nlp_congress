 Mr. President, I wanted to weigh in on a debate that  took place on the floor a couple of hours ago--actually, when I was  presiding in the chair--between the majority leader and the minority  leader on what we are going to be doing here in the next couple of days  on the Senate floor.   So right now we are having a healthcare debate. We are finally having  a healthcare debate. Many Members on both sides of the aisle--I say to  the Presiding Officer, I saw your speech a few hours ago--are talking  about the importance of healthcare for our country, the importance of,  from our perspective, repealing, replacing, repairing a healthcare  system that is not working. It is certainly not working the way in  which it was promised to Americans. I will not repeat all the promises  made by the former President and many Senators, but we know those  haven't come to pass.   As a matter of fact, a number of us--I certainly believe in my State,  the State of Alaska, the so-called Affordable Care Act has done a lot  more damage than good. Here are just a few statistics in Alaska:  Premiums in the individual market went up over 200 percent since the  enactment of the Affordable Care Act--200 percent. Alaskans in that  market--individual Alaskans, for one health insurance plan for one  individual, pay almost $1,100 a month in premiums for healthcare. That  is not affordable.   So we are debating it. It is important. There is an open amendment  process. We are probably going to be debating all night, and that is  what we should be doing--the world's greatest deliberative body  debating a very important topic, but healthcare is not the only issue  the Senate is focused on.                                     NDAA    As a matter of fact, a number of us on the Armed Services Committee,  over the last several weeks, have been working on and debating and  bringing amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act, the  yearly act that authorizes funding and training and equipment and  policy for our military and young men and women who serve in our  military. It is one of the most important things we do in the Senate,  by far. So we have been doing that as well as healthcare, which is also  extremely important.   Three weeks ago, after a lot of debate in committee, after a lot of  hard work, debate between Republicans and Democrats, the draft NDAA of  2017, the National Defense Authorization Act--focused on our national  security, focused on our troops--passed out of the Armed Services  Committee 27 to 0, a very bipartisan bill, a very important bill, and a  very important bill for the country to move on after the healthcare  debate.   So the majority leader and the chairman of the Armed Services  Committee had a very simple request of the minority leader this morning  when I was in the chair presiding, and the request was: Once we are  done for now--because it is going to continue with the healthcare  debate, we will not be done for a long time--once we complete the  business we are undertaking for the next several hours on the  healthcare debate, that we move forward to debate and pass the NDAA of  2017. It is a pretty simple request, a very reasonable request.   This bill, like healthcare, is extremely important for the Nation,  for our troops, for national security. On a personal note, it is  particularly important for one of our Members, the chairman of the  Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator McCain of Arizona. We all know  him. Americans  [[Page S4368]]  know him. He has been a mentor to many of us, a leader, certainly an  American hero who has sacrificed immeasurably for our country. In  another of a series of heroic acts by the Senator from Arizona, he  returned to the Senate this week after announcing that he is fighting  brain cancer. Now, Senator McCain is a fighter. He is going to win this  fight, but he is going back to Arizona very soon for treatment.   So many of us--but especially the chairman of the Senate Armed  Services Committee who did more than anyone to move that bill forward  in such a bipartisan way--want to take up the NDAA after the healthcare  debate. It is pretty simple, pretty reasonable, and really good for the  country: finish the healthcare debate for now with this open amendment  process that we are beginning already on the floor, then turn to the  NDAA after and debate that. It is good for our troops, good for our  national security, and it would show a lot of respect to the chairman  of the committee who has done more for his country and more to advance  this important bill than anyone else.   I hope all of my colleagues--this shouldn't be a partisan issue--can  agree to this, but unfortunately we are hearing rumors that the other  side is saying: Unless we vote against any healthcare bill to continue  to move forward, unless we vote against it to move forward, then they  are not going to take up the NDAA. Now, does that make any sense? We  are going to debate healthcare. That is really important, but now we  are hearing the other side saying: If they don't get their way in the  debate, then forget about it. We are not going to take up the bill that  authorizes the training and equipping and the policies of the U.S.  military. Does that make any sense?    The answer to everybody--everybody in the Senate Chamber, anyone  watching on TV--it makes no sense. These are not connected. These are  not connected issues.   Is playing politics with our troops, tying it to another bill, any  way to advance the national security and the welfare of the men and  women serving in our military? The answer is no.   Unfortunately, we have seen this movie before. Some might remember  last summer, right around this time, we were working hard on  appropriations bills. The Appropriations Committee voted different  appropriations bills out of committee, as they are supposed to do, and  they voted the Defense appropriations bill out of committee with an  overwhelming bipartisan vote.   So what did we do? We brought it to the floor to debate it and try to  pass it--funding for the troops. That bill was filibustered six times  by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, six times. Go home and  explain that vote, why you filibustered spending for our troops--when  they are in combat, by the way--six different times. I came down to  this floor numerous times asking somebody, anybody on the other side to  come down to the floor and explain why they were filibustering spending  for our troops on a bill that passed out of the Appropriations  Committee with overwhelming bipartisan support.   I am going to ask the same question. The NDAA came out of the Armed  Services Committee 27 to 0. If the minority leader is going to  filibuster that, he should come down and explain it. If he is really  saying we will only take up the NDAA if we get our way on the  healthcare debate we are having right now, he should come down and  explain that because it makes no sense. It makes no sense, particularly  because we all know that right now we are seeing very significant  national security threats to our country. Pick up the paper--Iran,  Russia, China, and in particular North Korea.   There was a report in the paper just the other day--yesterday, front  page of the Washington Post--saying it is now estimated that North  Korea is going to have an intercontinental ballistic nuclear missile  likely by next year that could range not only my great State of Alaska  but the rest of the continental United States. These are serious  national security threats. One of the provisions in the NDAA that had  bipartisan support was to significantly enhance our country's missile  defense. Is that important? Given the North Korean threats that are at  our doorstep, do you think the American people care about that? It is  important. It is important, as are the hundreds of other bipartisan  provisions in the NDAA that will enhance our national security,  authorize funding for our military forces, increase the numbers in our  military end strength--and again very bipartisan.   Mr. President, you and I have the honor of serving on the Armed  Services Committee. It is a great committee. It is very bipartisan. We  get a lot of work done, led again by a great U.S. Senator, John McCain.  It is an honor to serve there.   I believe right now the Senate is trying to reach a unanimous consent  agreement that as soon as we are done with healthcare, we will then  take up this critically important bill. As the chairman wants, as he  has requested, and as our military needs, we should do that. This is  not a hard decision by Democrats or Republicans. I hope we can do that.   I encourage all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, whatever  your plans are in the next couple of days, we will get through this  healthcare debate--very important for the country--and then let's get  through the NDAA debate and pass that bill as well. What we shouldn't  be doing is playing politics with our military or somehow tying moving  forward on an important piece of legislation for them to another issue  that has nothing whatsoever to do with it. We shouldn't be doing that,  and if we are, shame on those who are.   So let's move forward, let's have this healthcare debate, and when it  is completed, let's immediately move to the NDAA and pass that. It is a  bipartisan bill. It is going to help our Nation, help our troops,  enhance our national security in dangerous times. There is no reason  anyone should block moving forward on that important piece of  legislation as well.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue).
