 Mr. Speaker, I rise to keep America healthy, saving  the Affordable Care Act.   I rise in the name of Cynthia Perry, facing a life-or-death scenario.  Without the law in place, Cynthia Perry would also be facing life or  death. Perry suffers from an immune deficiency that requires her to  take medication she estimates costs roughly $40,000 a year. Cynthia,  who lives today.   I rise to keep America healthy. Kathryn Will, terrified about losing  access to treatment, terrified because she, herself, at 28 years old,  was diagnosed with stage III breast cancer.   I rise to keep America healthy because a Senator from Kentucky said  we need to think through how we do this, and it is a huge mistake for  Republicans if they do not vote for replacement on the same day they  vote for repeal.   I rise to keep America healthy and not give hundreds of billions of  dollars in tax breaks to insurance companies and drug manufacturers  while eliminating tax credits for millions of working Americans.   I rise to keep America healthy. Vote to save the Affordable Care Act.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House  Committees on the Judiciary and Homeland Security Committee; Ranking  Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland  Security, and Investigations, and the Congressional Voting Rights  Caucus, I rise today to express my views regarding the more troubling  nominations made by the President-Elect to fill the important Cabinet  posts at the Departments of Justice, Health and Human Services, and  Energy.   Let me begin with the nomination of U.S. Senator Jefferson Beauregard  ``Jeff'' Sessions III of Alabama to be the next Attorney General of the  United States.   Mr. Speaker, those of us who oppose the nomination of Senator  Sessions to be Attorney General owe a responsibility to the public to  clear and forthright in stating the reasons they believe he should not  be confirmed as the Attorney General of the United States.   Many of the senator's supporters, ranging from his Republican  colleagues in the Senate to current and former staffers to home state  friends and constituents, praise the senator for his modesty and  courtesy and manners.   The four-term senator and former state and federal prosecutor is, we  are told, learned in the law, a person of deep faith, a good man who  loves his family, his state, and his country.   We can, as the lawyers say, stipulate that these assertions are true.   But that does not make him an appropriate and deserving candidate to  be Attorney General of the United States.   And that is because the office of Attorney General and the Department  of Justice he or she leads is different in a very fundamental way from  every other Cabinet department.   Unlike the Secretary of Transportation or Commerce or Education, or  even the Secretary of Defense or State, the Attorney General leads a  department that is charged with administering the laws and enforcing  the Constitutional guarantees and protections that directly affect  every American, all 320 million of us.   To quote then-Senator Joseph Biden during the 2001 confirmation  hearing of Attorney General nominee John Ashcroft:   ``This Cabinet position is the single most unique position of any  Cabinet office.''   ``For it's the only one where the nominee or the Cabinet officer has  an equally strong and stronger, quite frankly, responsibility to the  American people as he does to the person who nominates him.''   At that same confirmation hearing, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois  observed that ``the attorney general, more than any other Cabinet  officer, is entrusted with protecting the civil rights of Americans.''   The Attorney General is not the lawyer for the President; the  Attorney General is the lawyer, and the Department of Justice the law  firm, for the American people.   That is why I agree so strongly with then-Senator Biden when he said  in 2001:   ``[F]or the office of attorney general, first, the question is  whether the attorney general is willing to vigorously enforce all the  laws in the Constitution, even though he might have philosophical  disagreements.''   ``[The second question is] whether he possesses the standing and  temperament that will permit the vast majority of the American people  to believe that you can and will protect and enforce their individual  rights.''   Put another way, the U.S. Attorney General and Justice Department is  not only the instrument of justice but also the living symbol of the  Constitution's promise of equal justice under law.   Mr. Speaker, the nation's greatest Attorney Generals conveyed this  commitment to equal justice by their prior experience, their words and  deed, and their character.   Think Herbert Brownell, Attorney General for Republican President  Eisenhower, who overaw the integration of Little Rock's Central High  School.   Think Robert Jackson, Attorney General for Democratic President  Franklin Roosevelt, who led the prosecution team at the Nazi War Crimes  trial in Nuremburg, Germany.   Think Robert F. Kennedy, for whom the Main Justice Building is named,  bringing to bear the instruments of federal power to protect  Mississippi Freedom Riders and to stare down Governor George Wallace in  the successful effort to integrate the University of Alabama.   The nomination of Alabama Senator Sessions as Attorney General does  not inspire the necessary confidence.   As a U.S. Senator from Alabama, the state from which the infamous  Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder originated, Senator  Sessions has failed to play a constructive role in repairing the damage  to voting rights caused by that decision.   He was one of the leading opponents of the reauthorization of the  Violence Against Women Act.   He is one of the Senate's most hostile opponents of comprehensive  immigration reform and was a principal architect of the draconian and  incendiary immigration policy advocated by the President-Elect during  the campaign.   And his record in support of efforts to bring needed reform to the  nation's criminal justice system is virtually non-existent.   In 1986, ten years before Senator Sessions was elected to the Senate,  he was rejected for a U.S. District Court judgeship in view of  documented incidents that revealed his lack of commitment to civil and  voting rights, and to equal justice.   And his Senate voting record and rhetoric has endeared him to white  nationalist websites and organizations like Breitbart and Stormfront.   As a U.S. attorney, Senator Sessions was the first federal prosecutor  in the country to bring charges against civil rights activist for voter  fraud.   Senator Sessions charged the group with 29 counts of voter fraud,  facing over 100 years in prison.  [[Page H465]]    Senator Sessions has repeatedly denied the disproportionate impact of  voting restrictions on minorities and has been a leader in the effort  to undermine the protections of the Voting Rights Act.   Senator Sessions has spoken out against the Voting Rights Act,  calling it ``a piece of intrusive legislation.''   Senator Sessions criticized Attorney General Eric Holder for  challenging state election laws, claiming they are necessary to fight  voter fraud.   However, evidence supports that voter fraud is almost nonexistent,  with 31 confirmed cases out of more than 1 billion ballots cast.   As Attorney General of the state of Alabama, Senator Sessions fought  to continue practices that harmed schools predominantly attended by  African-American students.   Senator Sessions led the fight to uphold the state of Alabama's  inequitable school funding mechanism after it had been deemed  unconstitutional by the Alabama circuit court.   In the state of Alabama nearly a quarter of African-American students  attend apartheid schools, meaning the school's white population is less  than one percent.   Although Senator Sessions has publicly taken credit for desegregation  efforts in the state of Alabama, there is no evidence of his  participation in the desegregation of Alabama schools or any school  desegregation lawsuits filed by then Attorney General Sessions.   Mr. Speaker, The United States has been blessed to have been served  as Attorney General by such illustrious figures as Robert Jackson,  Robert Kennedy, Herbert Brownell, Ramsey Clark, Nicholas Katzenbach,  Eric Holder, and Edward H. Levi.   Nothing would do more to reassure the American people that the  President-Elect is committed to unifying the nation than the nomination  and appointment of a person to be Attorney General who has a record of  championing and protecting, rather than opposing and undermining, the  precious right to vote; the constitutionally guaranteed right of  privacy, criminal justice reform, and support for reform of the  nation's immigration system so that it is fair and humane.   Regrettably, Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama is not that person and he  should not be confirmed by the Senate to be the nation's 84th Attorney  General.                            ____________________
