 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the minibus  appropriations bill the House passed earlier today.   This legislation includes my bill to support the revitalization of  vacant shopping malls like the Gwinnett Place Mall in my district. This  provision would catalyze additional investment in these projects and  enhance economic activity, access to housing, and mobility for local  residents.   The minibus also includes six of my community project funding  requests, including funding for the acquisition of African-American  books and historical artifacts at the Hooper-Renwick Memorial Library,  as well as projects to increase wraparound services for Latino families  and youth through Ser Familia, provide transportation to low-income  students through Corners Outreach, and enhance access to transit and  clean drinking water for many communities in Georgia's Seventh  District.   Altogether, the T-HUD bill and the minibus include important  investments that will make our communities stronger.                            ____________________
