 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Neal for  yielding.   This disaster relief bill includes $360 billion for paycheck  protection for American workers; $75 billion for our courageous  healthcare workers and the institutions that they work at; and $25  billion for virus testing to bend, break, and crush the disease curve.   Sadly, New York's State, county, and local governments were kicked  out of this disaster relief bill, and the Senate majority leader's  arrogant advice for them to include bankruptcy is insulting and  arrogant.   What we need at the time of national crisis, a national emergency, is  we need leaders who possess goodness, humility, courage, and a sense  that we are all in this together, a sense of national solidarity.
