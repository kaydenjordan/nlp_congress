 Mr. President, I have a motion at the desk.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         The Senator from New Jersey [Mr. BOOKER] moves that the       managers on the part of the Senate at the conference on the       disagreeing votes of the two Houses on H.R. 1 be instructed       to insist that the final conference report does not contain       any provisions that would increase the number of individuals       who do not have health insurance or increase health insurance       premiums.     Mr. President, my motion to instruct the Senate conferees  would simply insist that the final conference report does not increase  the number of individuals who do not have health insurance and does not  increase health insurance premiums.   It has been stated on this floor by my colleagues on this side of the  aisle that this bill is a blow to our deficit, that it is a blow to our  budget, and that it is going to hurt families, particularly in States  like mine, with the elimination of the State and local tax deductions.  We also know that it could be a bill that could literally threaten the  lives of Americans as well.   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said that it will  increase premium costs by 10 percent and cause 13 million people to  lose their coverage, increase premiums and hurt people.   We know that this bill as it is currently written threatens Americans  who rely on Medicaid, including children, people with disabilities, and  seniors in nursing homes, because of the bill's potential to impact a  State's ability to access funds for its Medicaid Program--again, the  State and local tax deductions.   It is also going to possibly trigger cuts to Medicare. Because the  bill that passed the Senate would possibly add $1.5 trillion to the  deficit, it could trigger automatic cuts to government programs,  including an annual cut of $25 billion to Medicare. A cut that size  will significantly limit Medicare beneficiaries' access to essential  health services in everything from cancer screenings to chemotherapy.   I urge my colleagues to support my motion. The Senate conferees must  insist that the final conference report of this harmful bill at the  very least does not contain any provision that would increase the  number of Americans who do not have health insurance or that would  increase health premiums for already cash-strapped American citizens.   Thank you.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.    Mr. President, I yield back my time.  [[Page S7881]]    The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.                          Vote on Motion To Instruct    The question is on agreeing to the motion by the Senator from  Florida.   The motion was agreed to.                          Vote on Motion to Instruct    The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion by  the Senator from New Jersey.
