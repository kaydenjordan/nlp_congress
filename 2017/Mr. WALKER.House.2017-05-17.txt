 Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the ordering of  the yeas and nays on the motion that the House suspend the rules and  pass the bill (H.R. 984) to extend Federal recognition to the  Chickahominy Indian Tribe, the Chickahominy Indian Tribe--Eastern  Division, the Upper Mattaponi Tribe, the Rappahannock Tribe, Inc., the  Monacan Indian Nation, and the Nansemond Indian Tribe, be vacated, to  the end that the Chair put the question de novo.
