 Madam President, today I am pleased to join with Senators  Schatz, Merkley, Markey, and others who have spoken to highlight the  need to act on climate change.   I said on the floor earlier this week that the Democrats may not yet  agree on exactly how we must address climate change, but we all agree  on at least three things: One, climate change is real; two, we as human  beings are the primary cause of the climate crisis we face today, and  it has been building for the last almost 100 years; and, three, the  U.S. Congress--us, the House--should take immediate action to address  the challenges of climate change.   That is why I am introducing a resolution today that says those three  things: Climate change is real. Humans are leading to this crisis we  face. We have an obligation in this body and the House to do something  about it.   Democrats believe in our hearts and our minds that it is possible to  have a healthy climate and a vibrant, growing economy, and anyone who  says otherwise is preaching a false choice.   Sadly, with President Trump in the White House and this  administration, many of our Republican friends across the aisle have  chosen to ignore the clear science and threat that climate change poses  to our children and to their children.   As we speak about climate change today, this Senate is considering  the nomination of Andrew Wheeler to lead EPA. Under Mr. Wheeler's  leadership, EPA is rolling back climate regulations that will lead to  more carbon pollution in the air while increasing other air pollution  that triggers asthma, lung disease, and, in some cases, death.   Mr. Wheeler claims these actions are needed to provide more business  certainty. He believes industry is stuck in on old world order. I would  just say to Andrew Wheeler, as Bob Dylan once said, ``the times they  are a-changin.''   Things have changed a lot in the last 15 years. Industry knows where  the future lies, and that future is in cleaner technologies. Companies  are making investments now for the next 10 and 20 years down the road.  They see where the global markets are going. They need to invest in  clean energy or be left behind.   Yet, even when industries ask this administration to support climate  policies that will help the bottom line of those businesses, in too  many instances, Mr. Wheeler seems to turn a blind eye. In fact, there  are policies that this administration could support today, right now;  policies that would dramatically help our climate and our economy.   One of those policies is the ratification of something called the  Kigali amendment to the Montreal Protocol. You say stuff like that, and  my colleagues' eyes glaze over. So I want to take a minute to talk  about what they mean.   The Montreal Protocol, ratified by the United States in 1988, is a  global environmental agreement mainly focused on phasing down emissions  that contributed to the hole in the ozone layer. It was not that long  ago--about the time our pages here were born--that it was a burning  issue.   Ozone-depleting substances such as chlorofluorocarbons--we call them  CFCs for short--were often found in the coolants used to cool food in  household refrigerators and the air-conditioners in our homes and in  our cars. CFCs are also found in foams and solvents used in industrial  processes.   If there was a poster child for a successful global agreement, I  think the Montreal Protocol--which most people never heard of--has to  be that poster child. This agreement has led to a 97-percent reduction  in the global consumption of ozone-depleting substances with little, if  any, economic disruption. Think about that.   Over the years, every administration since the Reagan administration  has supported the Montreal Protocol and the four amendments associated  with it.   However, it turns out a majority of the ozone-depleting substances  are actually being replaced by something called HFCs,  hydrofluorocarbons. Those HFCs are easy to use. They are efficient.  They are safe for the ozone layer. That is good.   Unfortunately, there is a catch. The HFCs have a global warming  potential that is thousands of times greater than carbon dioxide. On  the one hand, they are good for the ozone layer; on the other hand,  they are a killer when it comes to carbon dioxide. So some really smart  people decided to see what they could do about this, and what those  smart people did is they came up with a follow-on product to HFCs.   It is estimated that left unchecked, HFCs could account for  approximately  [[Page S1564]]  20 percent of greenhouse gas pollution by 2050, and that ain't good. So  by using HFCs, we are fixing one global environmental problem--the hole  in the ozone--but we are contributing to another, and that is just as  serious.   To address this negative side effect, on October 15, 2016, in a place  called Kigali, which is in Rwanda--that is why they call it the Kigali  amendment or Kigali treaty--more than 170 countries agreed to amend the  Montreal Protocol, including ours.   The goal of this agreement is to achieve more than an 80-percent  reduction in global HFC production and utilization by 2047. It doesn't  say you have to stop using it tomorrow. This is a phaseout and a  phasedown. If we don't do anything by 2047, we will see an increase of  about half a degree Celsius--that is almost a full degree Fahrenheit-- in global warming by the end of this century. We can't afford to do  that. Our planet can't afford to do that. Our kids, our grandchildren  cannot afford for us to do that.   U.S. industry strongly supports the Kigali amendment because U.S.  companies have already invested billions of dollars in order to be able  to produce the next-generation technologies that are going to replace,  over time, HFCs. Phasing down HFCs allows U.S. companies to capture a  large portion of a global market that is--listen to this--$1 trillion  in size, which will create 150,000 new direct and indirect American  jobs in less than a decade.   These new jobs are expected to generate close to $39 billion  dollars--$39 billion--in annual economic benefits for our country;  again, in less than a decade.   Industry also believes ratification of the Kigali treaty will  mitigate unfair Chinese dumping of HFCs in the United States, hurting  our businesses.   Ratification of the Kigali amendment is a no-brainer, and even those  who are skeptical about climate change ought to be able to admit that  it would be great for U.S. competitiveness and good-paying American  jobs.   This is a real win-win situation. If we don't seize the opportunity,  we should have our heads examined. That is why we have some pretty  strange bedfellows supporting the Kigali ratification.   There is a chart behind me. Among others, we have the National  Association of Manufacturers, Natural Resources development folks, the  spirit of enterprise, FreedomWorks, the American Chemistry Council,  Business Roundtable, and Sierra Club.    They are not all wrong. They are right. I say to my  colleagues across the aisle: Listen to these folks, and let's use our  heads and our hearts.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the  Senate for 2 minutes, please.    Madam President, I say to our colleagues that I stand  before you today as a Vietnam veteran--5 years of naval service during  the hot war in Southeast Asia, trying to make sure that the force of  communism was stopped. I served another 18 years beyond that, right to  the end of the Cold War, as a naval flight officer and retired as a  Navy captain.   I am not a socialist. I am somebody who cares deeply about this  planet. I am someone who believes it is possible to have clean air,  clean water, better public health, and to foster economic growth.   As it turns out, there are a lot of companies in this country that  believe the same thing. They believe the same thing. A lot of them  build cars, trucks, and vans. They want a 50-State deal on fuel  efficiency standards, CAFE standards, and tailpipe standards. They want  a 50-State deal so they don't have to build a car for 13 or 14  different States and then a different kind of car or truck for the rest  of the country. They don't want to do that. They want certainty and  predictability so they can build one model for one car. They want to be  able to be successful in competing in the world marketplace in the next  10, 20, or 30 years.   We need someone leading the Environmental Protection Agency who  believes that it is possible to have cleaner air and, frankly, to  foster economic growth in the auto companies. That is what the auto  companies want. They are not socialists. They are free-marketers.   There is something called HFCs, or hydrofluorocarbons. It is a  terrible pollutant for the environment. It is 1,000 times worse than  carbon for our global warming challenges. There are a bunch of American  businesses that have new technology to replace HFCs. They want to be  able not just to develop it, but they want to able to sell it all over  the world. The marketplace is $1 trillion, and we are holding it back.   Unfortunately, the person whom we are going to be voting on here  today to be our EPA Administrator is part of holding us back because he  will not agree to a treaty that the administration wants to put  forward. It is crazy.   Those companies that developed the follow-on products to HFCs-- Honeywell, Chemours, and others--are not socialists. They are business  people. They want a piece of the international market, and they want to  do good things for the climate at the same time.   I just want to say to my colleagues: We can do both. We can have  clean air. We can have clean water. We can have strong economic growth.  We need somebody running the EPA who actually believes in that too. I  am sorry to say here today that right now I don't believe it is Andrew  Wheeler, and I say that with no joy.   Thank you very much.    Mr. President, during the debate on the nomination of  Andrew Wheeler to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection  Agency I came to the floor to express concerns on a number of issues,  including EPA's regulation of per- and poly-fluorinated alkyl  substances--PFAS.   PFAS are a class of man-made chemicals developed in the 1940s. PFAS  can be found across industries in many products, including food  packaging, nonstick pans, clothing, furniture, and firefighting foam  used by the military. These chemicals have a long and tragic history-- suffice it to say that their widespread use resulted too many Americans  without access to safe drinking water.   This very issue is a matter of some controversy as EPA has failed to  provide meaningful and swift action on these chemicals under this  administration. That is why I am here today to introduce a bipartisan  bill to designate PFAS chemicals as hazardous substances under the  Federal superfund law. The Carper-Capito-Peters-Tillis-Stabenow-Rubio- Merkley-Gardner-Reed-Murkowski-Shaheen-Burr-Bennet-Manchin bill will  force EPA to begin the rulemaking process to protecting Americans from  overexposure to these harmful chemicals and hold polluters accountable.  It is very similar to legislation that has already been introduced in  the House of Representatives by Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.   In his confirmation hearing, Andrew Wheeler said, and I quote:         It is these Americans that President Trump and his       Administration are focused on, Americans without access to       safe drinking water or Americans living on or near hazardous       sites, often unaware of the health risks they and their       families face. Many of these sites have languished for years,       even decades. How can these Americans prosper if they cannot       live, learn, or work in healthy environments? The answer is       simple. They cannot. President Trump understands this and       that is why he is focused on putting Americans first.    One would think those words might mean that there could be some  common ground at least on addressing PFAS. After all, who wouldn't  agree that we should be acting with urgency to address contamination  from these hazardous chemicals?   According to one 2017 study, drinking water supplies for 6 million  U.S. residents have exceeded the EPA's lifetime health advisory for  these chemicals.   Another 2018 study performed by the Environmental Working Group  reports that up to 110 million Americans could have PFAS-contaminated  water.   In 2016, the Department of Defense announced that it was assessing  the risk of groundwater contamination from firefighting foam at dozens  of fire and crash testing sites across the country. It is likely that  they are all contaminated.   Just last year, the town of Blades in my home State of Delaware  alerted its 1,250 residents, as well as businesses and schools that use  public water, to stop using public water for drinking an cooking  because PFAS chemicals were present at nearly twice the Federal health  advisory level. Reportedly, 36 of 67 sampled groundwater wells on Dover  Air Force Base showed dangerously high levels of PFOA and PFOS. And it  is not just Delaware--contamination is widespread, in red States and  blue States, in small water systems and large ones, on military sites  and in residential areas, from Maine to Alaska.   It is essential that we legislate to require EPA to designate PFOA  and PFOS as ``hazardous substances,'' which means that polluters could  be held responsible for cleaning it up under the superfund law. In its  recently released PFAS Action Plan, EPA has said again that it would  issue this proposal in the future but did not indicate how long it will  take to complete. Unfortunately, it has no sense of urgency to address  these emerging contaminants and to protect American's from harmful  levels of contamination.   EPA had an opportunity to take action to address PFAS chemicals in a  real and comprehensive way; however, time and again, it has failed to  move in an expeditious and meaningful way. That is why this bill is so  important. Designating these chemicals as hazardous substances will, at  a minimum, start the process to getting these contaminated sites  cleaned up. This not the silver bullet to the broader contamination  problems, but it is a start.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CARPER (for himself, Mr. Merkley, Mr. Markey, Mr. Coons,          Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Jones, Mr. Schatz, Mr. Booker, Mr. Schumer,          Mr. Bennet,  [[Page S1600]]          Mr. Reed, Mr. Van Hollen, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Murphy, Mr.          Manchin, Mr. Heinrich, Ms. Baldwin, Mr. Brown, Mrs. Murray,          Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Blumenthal, Mrs. Gillibrand,          Mr. Cardin, Mr. Warner, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Rosen, Ms. Smith, Mr.          Wyden, Mrs. Shaheen, Ms. Hirono, Ms. Duckworth, Mr. Durbin, Ms.          Hassan, Mr. Casey, Mr. Peters, Mr. Menendez, Ms. Cortez Masto,          Mr. Sanders, Mr. Kaine, Mr. Tester, Ms. Harris, Ms. Cantwell,          Ms. Sinema, Ms. Warren, Mr. King, and Mr. Udall):   S.J.
