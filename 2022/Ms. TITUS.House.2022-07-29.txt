 Mr. Speaker, I have heard a lot of talk today about the  Constitution. Well, when the Founding Fathers wrote the Second  Amendment these kind of weapons didn't even exist. They had muskets and  flintlock pistols that could fire three or four shots in a minute, on a  good day; and they weren't very accurate at all.   The Founding Fathers did not know or anticipate these weapons of mass  destruction that shooters use to kill as many innocent people as  brutally and quickly as possible; and that is exactly what they did in  my district on October 1, 2017, when you had 60 people shot at a  concert.   I urge my colleagues on the other side to have the courage to stand  up to the NRA and support this legislation. It is common sense; it is  necessary; and it will prevent mass shootings and save lives.
