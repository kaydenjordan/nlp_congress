 Mr. President, at the 110th Wyoming State Fair, Senator  Lummis and I will have the pleasure of introducing Pat and Sharon  O'Toole as 2022 inductees to the Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame.   Pat and Sharon O'Toole are ranchers who, along with their family, own  and operate the Ladder Ranch. It is a large-scale cattle and sheep  operation, established in 1881 by A.W. and Anna Louise Salisbury. This  was 9 years before Wyoming became a State. The Ladder Ranch has been in  Sharon's family for six generations. Located outside of Savery, WY,  along the Little Snake River, the ranch straddles the State line with  Colorado.   Pat met Sharon Salisbury while they both attended Colorado State  University. Following marriage, they returned to Sharon's family ranch  in 1977 where they went to work managing the ranch and raising a  family. Since then, Pat and Sharon have been shining examples of  resource conservation, land stewardship, and partnership development.   The conservation legacy of the Ladder Ranch will affect agriculture,  wildlife, and water for generations to come. Their ranch is host to one  of North America's largest elk herds. It provides habitat for mule  deer, sage grouse, and fish. They participate in the Sage Grouse  Initiative, the Conservation Stewardship Program, and the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife's Partners for Fish and Wildlife program. They also have a  stretch of land along Battle Creek recognized as an Audubon Bird Area.   In addition to managing a successful cattle and sheep operation for  45 years, Pat served in the Wyoming Legislature for three terms from  1986-1992. He is the current president of the Family Farm Alliance,  representing irrigators in 17 Western States. The alliance ensures the  availability of reliable, affordable irrigation supplies to Western  farmers and ranchers.   Pat is a strong advocate for efficient irrigation and effective  management tools for agriculture. He has testified many times before  committees in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. As  the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural  Resources, I invited him to testify in June 2022. Pat spoke on  solutions to extreme drought in the Western United States.   Pat gives his time to numerous organizations including AGree, which  addresses international food and agriculture policies. He also serves  on the boards of the Intermountain Joint Venture, Partners for  Conservation, Farm Foundation, and Solutions from the Land. President  Clinton appointed him to the Western Water Policy Review Advisory  Commission in 1997.   In addition to full-time ranching, Sharon is a published author and  writer. Her work has been featured in the Washington Post. She has a  monthly  [[Page S3741]]  column in the Shepherd magazine. She currently blogs on western issues  and life for the Western Folklife Center. She is an avid poet, having  performed at the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering. She was chosen to  write the poem featured at the Wyoming Stock Growers 150th anniversary  celebration. Her writing includes two children's books, highlighting  the connections between family and the land.   Among many prestigious awards, the O'Toole family and the Ladder  Ranch were awarded the Wyoming Leopold Environmental Stewardship Award  in 2014. Two years later, the ranch received the Wyoming Stock Growers  Land Trust Kurt Bucholz Conservation Award.   The Ladder Ranch is truly a family endeavor. Pat and Sharon's three  children all contribute to the success of the operation. Their daughter  Meghan O'Toole Lally works full-time on the ranch with help from her  husband Brian and their four children. The O'Toole's son, Eamon  O'Toole, his wife Megan and their two sons, also reside on the ranch,  working alongside the family. Their daughter, Bridget O'Toole and her  husband Chris Abel help with the ranch from their home in Arizona.   Pat and Sharon O'Toole's unmatched passion for family, Wyoming  agriculture, wildlife and animal conservation, and cultivating  partnerships, makes them an outstanding choice for the Wyoming  Agriculture Hall of Fame. It is a great honor to participate in their  induction. They continue to represent Wyoming and Western interests  with dedication and distinction. My wife, Bobbi, joins me in  congratulating Pat and Sharon O'Toole as 2022 inductees into the  Wyoming Agriculture Hall of Fame.                            ____________________
