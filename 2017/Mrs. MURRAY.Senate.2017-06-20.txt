Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 6  minutes.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I want to thank all of my colleagues for  their comments today on the damage TrumpCare would do. Democrats,  patients, and families have been fighting back against TrumpCare and  Republican efforts to jam it through Congress for months.   I want to take a moment and recall some of the promises President  Trump and Republicans made at the very beginning of this process  because there truly is a Grand Canyon between President Trump's  promises and the TrumpCare bill he has now admitted himself is  ``mean.''   At the start, President Trump promised to provide insurance for  everybody that was both cheaper and higher quality. When TrumpCare was  introduced in the House, Secretary Price said that ``no one would be  worse off financially'' under the law. And when Speaker Ryan was asked  whether millions of people would lose their insurance coverage under  TrumpCare, he said ``no.''   Families were told again and again that TrumpCare would lower costs  and keep people covered. As we know, TrumpCare would do the exact  opposite. It will raise healthcare costs for people across the country,  astronomically for those with preexisting conditions and for seniors,  who could pay as much as 850 percent more in premiums. Medicaid would  be gutted. Women and men would be unable to get care from the providers  they trust and choose at Planned Parenthood. New mothers would pay as  much as $1,000 more a month just to get maternity care. Tens of  millions of people would see their healthcare coverage taken away.   I could continue. And I want to be clear that those facts came from  the nonpartisan, independent Congressional Budget Office.   Unfortunately and unsurprisingly, when TrumpCare passed the House,  President Trump ignored those facts and doubled down on his broken  promises. He championed TrumpCare, calling it ``very, very well- crafted.'' He promised to get TrumpCare through the Senate, predicting  that it would be an unbelievable victory. His Secretary of Health and  Human Services called this bill--which would take healthcare coverage  away from 23 million people--a victory for the American people. Which  people? Maybe President Trump. Maybe special interests who are going to  get these massive tax breaks. But not the hundreds of thousands of  people in Washington State who are rightly scared of TrumpCare or  millions more across the country.   Democrats have come to the Senate floor with story after story about  how our constituents would suffer under this legislation, workers who  would not be able to make ends meet between jobs without losing health  insurance, seniors who know they will go bankrupt if TrumpCare becomes  law, moms who stay up at night worrying about whether their child who  has a preexisting condition will be priced out of coverage, patients  fighting for their lives who are afraid that TrumpCare will kill them  and who are literally begging Congress not to do this.   To these patients and families, President Trump's decision to finally  admit the incredibly obvious--that TrumpCare is ``mean''--doesn't begin  to cover it. To them, that bill is a gut punch. It is the bottom  dropping out. It could be a death sentence. And this is especially true  because, as hard as Senate Republicans have tried to keep their version  of TrumpCare secret, behind closed doors, and in back rooms, as often  as some have made promises just like those President Trump and House  Republicans were making to try to reassure their constituents somehow  that the Senate version of TrumpCare would be somehow less mean, the  truth is, we know the Senate version of TrumpCare will be just as  damaging.   Senate Republican leaders have already admitted that they expect  their TrumpCare bill to mirror 80 percent of the House's. We have House  conservatives writing letters to Senate Republicans making demands even  meaner than many Senate Republicans want. And we all have a good idea  how this is going to end up. ``Mean'' doesn't even begin to cover what  TrumpCare would do to my constituents in Washington and to people  across the country, but it is a start.   I haven't said this often, but I hope Senate Republicans listen to  President Trump. This is a man who knows about mean--from making fun of  a reporter with disabilities, to belittling our friend the junior  Senator from Florida, to even impugning the senior Senator from  Arizona, a war hero. When President Trump says something is mean, that  certainly means something.   Mr. President, I hope they think about why he had to make that  comment. They realize just how hard it will be to defend this truly  appalling legislation, especially after it has been jammed through  Congress, hidden from patients, and hidden from families without seeing  the light of day. I hope they do what we tell preschoolers to do when  they do something mean--apologize and make sure to do better next time.  In Senate Republicans' case, that means dropping this effort to  undermine families' healthcare once and for all and then joining with  us to continue fixing healthcare for the people we serve by making  healthcare more affordable, getting more families covered, and  maintaining quality of care.   Democrats have ideas. We are at the table. We are ready to get to  work as soon as Republicans are. It is not too late to make the right  choice. The wrong choice is far more than mean. If my Republican  colleagues do continue down this deeply harmful path, they should know  they will own every bit of the hurt they cause, and they will be held  fully accountable.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.  [[Page S3624]]                                ____________________
