 Madam Speaker, I rise today, joined by my fellow  congressional colleagues from Indiana, as well as our two Senators, to  honor the eight Hoosiers we lost in last week's senseless shooting at  the FedEx facility in Indianapolis. We also honor those who were  injured and pray that they have a fast and speedy recovery.   The deceased were our friends, family, and neighbors. They had hopes,  Madam Speaker, dreams, and plans for the future, only to have their  lives tragically cut short. And, sadly, they are part of a much larger  group of Hoosiers and Americans we have lost to gun violence.   As our community and our State grieve, and as we seek to move  forward, we pledge to never forget those we lost in this shooting and  any other senseless act of violence. Their legacies will live on  through our efforts to save lives in the future.   Hoosiers are resilient, Madam Speaker, and we will continue working  hard to create safer communities across America, always carrying the  memory of those we lost in our hearts. We will never forget them.   Please join us for a moment of silence.                            ____________________
