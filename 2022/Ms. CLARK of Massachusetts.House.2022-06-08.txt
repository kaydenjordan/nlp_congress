 Madam Speaker, today in our country 321  people will be shot, and 111 of them will die from those gunshots.  Twenty-two of the people who are shot every day in this country are  kids, just like the 19 fourth graders sitting in their classroom while  they were massacred in Uvalde.   So I ask my colleagues: How many more?   How many more innocent people need to die?   How many more elders will be murdered at a grocery store or in their  houses of worship?   How many more children, slaughtered in their classroom, will be  enough to do something to save lives?   We are considering the most basic measures to keep people safe from  gun violence and to keep families from having to I.D. their children by  DNA after their bodies were destroyed by a weapon of war.   Raising the age to 21 to buy assault rifles, safe gun storage, and  cracking down on gun trafficking are obvious solutions. Vote ``yes'' to  protect families. Vote ``yes'' to save our children.
