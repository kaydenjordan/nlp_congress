 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a valley  sports icon we recently lost, Dave Brown.   For over 40 years, Dave worked at KRGV, where he brought the  excitement of sports to our homes, covering everything from local high  school football and soccer games to the World Series.   Despite health challenges, Dave never stopped working and continued  to share his passion through segments like ``Dave's Dozen'' and  ``Football Fridays.''   His impact went far beyond sports. Dave's tireless advocacy for  diabetes and organ donation awareness made a lasting impact on our  community.   His legacy will live on through the lives he touched, the colleagues  he mentored, and the families he loved.   My heart goes out to his wife, Drue; his son, Jeff; his grandson,  Nicholas; and his sister, Marlene.   May Dave's legacy as the ``Valley's King of Sports'' endure for  generations to come.                            ____________________
