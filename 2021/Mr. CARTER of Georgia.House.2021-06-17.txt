 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember and  honor former Chatham County Commissioner David Saussy of Savannah,  Georgia, who passed away on May 19 at the age of 86.   Born the youngest of five children, David moved to Savannah in 1964,  and lived the next 57 years in Ardsley Park.  [[Page H2899]]    All who knew David remember his Savannah smile and his proud  expressions whenever he talked about Savannah's accomplishments.  David's countless friends and family members consider him one of the  most generous people they knew.   He was on the boards of the Chatham-Savannah Authority for the  Homeless and the Coastal Center for Development Services, was a  founding member of the St. David's Society of Savannah, and served two  terms as a Republican County Commissioner.   I am thankful for the immense impact he had on the Savannah  community, and I know his legacy will remain.   My thoughts and prayers are with his family, friends, and all who  knew him during this most difficult time.                            ____________________
