 Madam President, today I have the distinct honor  of recognizing Timmye Crowley of the U.S. Postal Service in Yellowstone  County for her dedication to serving her fellow Montanans and a unique  act of kindness that saved a man's life.   Timmye has worked for the U.S. Postal Service for more than 20 years,  delivering countless letters and packages to the people of Montana.  Recently, on her day off, she decided to extend a helping hand during  this busy season by making additional deliveries along her normal  route. As she approached a house which she knew belonged to an elderly  resident, she decided to walk up to the front door to personally  deliver this man's mail, in an effort to avoid the man potentially  falling on the icy sidewalks, which are a common sight during Montana  winters.   Upon reaching the front door, Timmye realized smoke was billowing out  of the house and suspected there was a fire inside. She saw through the  window that the man was asleep in a chair and promptly began pounding  on the door to wake him up to ensure he would not get hurt. The man was  hard of hearing, so he was unaware of the smoke detector alarms. He  soon woke up and walked to the front door as Timmye called 9-1-1. First  responders arrived on the scene shortly, and the man was no longer in  danger.   Thanks to Timmye's efforts, a potentially fatal outcome was avoided.  It is my distinct honor to recognize Timmye Crowley for her passion and  willingness to go the extra mile serving the Billings community. Keep  up the great work, Timmye. You make Montana proud.                            ____________________
