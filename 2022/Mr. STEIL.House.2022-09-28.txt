 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 6889, the Credit Union Board Modernization  Act.   I thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters), the chairwoman  of the Financial Services Committee, as well as the gentleman from  California (Mr. Vargas) for introducing this legislation, and the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gonzalez) for cosponsoring.   The commonsense bill will modernize credit union practices while  ensuring the safety and soundness of Federal credit unions.   H.R. 6889 would amend the Federal Credit Union Act to revise the  frequency of meetings that a Federal credit union's board of directors  is required to hold.   Specifically, the bill requires monthly meetings for de novo Federal  credit unions during the first 5 years of existence. Highly rated  credit unions, 1 or 2 CAMELS rating, with high management ratings, must  hold at least six meetings annually, with at least one meeting held  during each fiscal quarter. Lower rated credit unions, 3, 4 or 5  CAMELS, must continue meeting once a month.   This is a change from current law, which requires all Federal credit  union boards to meet at least once a month. This meeting requirement  can be burdensome for credit union staff and their volunteer board  members. This is especially true for smaller credit unions and for  those with few employees or those located in rural areas.   The resources needed to run monthly board meetings shift valuable  employee and board member time and focus away from services that credit  unions provide to their consumers.   Commonsense, regulatory right-sizing bills like this one help  American families by reducing costs and the challenges associated with  accessing financial services.   H.R. 6889 is a strong, bipartisan bill that protects the safety and  soundness of credit unions. It also illustrates how Members can come  together to create nonpartisan legislation, modernizing outdated  practices and policies. I look forward to working with my colleagues  across the aisle to meaningfully support our community financial  institutions.   Mr. Speaker, I reiterate to my colleagues that H.R. 6889 is  commonsense legislation that will modernize credit unions.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I thank the Chairwoman of the Financial Services Committee, the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters), for bringing the bill to the  floor today.   I rise in strong support of H.R. 2710, the Banking Transparency for  Sanctioned Persons Act. This bill that I authored represents an  important step forward for oversight of the Treasury Department's  sanctions program.   Under current law, Treasury may issue licenses through its Office of  Foreign Assets Control, authorizing U.S. financial institutions to  engage in transactions that would otherwise be prohibited. These  licenses typically allow for the facilitation of trade in humanitarian  and agricultural goods such as medicines and food.   H.R. 2710 requires the administration to inform Congress that certain  financial services-related licenses have been improved when they  involve state sponsors of terrorism or others sanctioned for human  rights abuses.   While OFAC may have good reasons to issue a license, it is essential  for Congress to be aware of bad actors' access to our financial system.  Though some OFAC licenses are made public, others are not disclosed or  even their existence may be unknown to Congress.   By requiring a semiannual report on these licenses, my bill would  make the disclosure of OFAC's actions more consistent with  congressional notification procedures for other sanctions waivers.  Without this knowledge, Congress is limited in its ability to oversee  the implementation of sanctions.                                time  1645    I am pleased to note that our colleagues on the other side of the  aisle have long supported this oversight, and they have provided  helpful input as we have developed this important legislation.   Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by noting that our majority support for  this measure is reflective of a strong spirit of bipartisanship on the  Committee on Financial Services when it comes to safeguarding our  national security.   While we may not agree on everything, our Members have been extremely  productive in advancing our national security interests while  maintaining a vibrant financial system. It is important to have a  government that is accountable, and this bill brings needed  accountability to our sanctions enforcement efforts.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2710, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I simply close by urging my colleagues to  support this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.
