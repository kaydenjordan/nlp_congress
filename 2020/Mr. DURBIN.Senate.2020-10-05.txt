 Mr. President, it has been said that the United States is  like a brilliant tapestry woven from a dazzling array of colors and  patterns into a unique whole. If that is true, then the contributions  of Hispanics are surely among the largest and most vibrant swaths in  our rich national tapestry, and Hispanic Heritage Month is a good time  to reflect on those contributions.   This celebration runs each year from mid-September to mid-October.  The dates were chosen to coincide with the dates in which several Latin  American nations--including Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala,  Honduras, Nicaragua, Mexico, and Chile--celebrate their own  independence from colonial rule. This national celebration used to be  just a week long, but in 1988, Congress wisely and unanimously voted to  expand Hispanic Heritage Week to Hispanic Heritage Month. The  legislation was sponsored by Congressman Esteban Torres and my friend  and political mentor, Senator Paul Simon. It was signed into law by  President Ronald Reagan, a proud, conservative Republican who  understood that America's heritage as a nation of immigrants is one of  our greatest sources of strength--economically, politically, culturally  and morally.   The contributions and influence of Latinos on our Nation has grown  dramatically in the three decades since the establishment of Hispanic  Heritage Month. Today there are more than 60 million Latinos in the  U.S. Illinois is proud to be home to one of the largest Latino  populations in the country, including many people of Mexican, Puerto  Rican, and Guatemalan heritage. Latinos and Latinas are leaders in  every walk of life, including business, the arts, sciences, education,  sports, entertainment, and public service. A ``wise Latina,'' Justice  Sonia Sotomayor, now serves on the U.S. Supreme Court. Ellen Ochoa, an  engineer and the first Latina astronaut, is now director of NASA's  Johnson Space Center. Latinas are literally helping America reach for  the stars.   In my home State of Illinois, Dr. Juan Andrade, Jr., is the president  of the U.S. Hispanic Leadership Institute, based in Chicago. He and his  organization are doing critical work to educate and motivate Latinos to  vote and to fill out the Census, ensuring that Latinos are seen and  their voices heard. Alexis Esparza is president of Economic Strategies  Development Corporation. For nearly half a century, his organization,  ESDC, has worked in the Pilsen community of Chicago to preserve  historic buildings, build affordable new housing, and help create new  commercial and industrial economic development opportunities. They are  part of a long and proud tradition of Hispanic men and women whose work  has made America's economy more prosperous and fairer for all of us.   Many Americans know the names Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta. In  1966, these two brave labor leaders helped organize farm workers in  Delano, CA, to form the United Farm Workers of America. Standing  together, backed by their union, the farm workers were able to strike  for higher wages, safer working conditions, and protections for women  farm workers from sexual violence.   Far fewer people recognize the name Guadalupe Marshall. She is also a  hero for workers' rights. Let me tell you about her. On Memorial Day  1937, 10 unarmed union demonstrators from Republic Steele were shot  down by police in Chicago. Lupe Marshall, who had immigrated to America  from Mexico when she was 10 years old, was one of the people attending  that strike. She was a mother of three and a volunteer social worker at  the Jane Addams Hull House. The ``Memorial Day Massacre'' is how many  history books label the carnage at Republic Steele. Three weeks after  the killings, Lupe Marshall travelled to Washington, DC, to testify  before the Senate about what she had witnessed.   She described placing herself on the front line when shots rang out  and then turning to see many people lying face down on the ground. She  ran, but she was clubbed in the head and arrested. Her courage helped  to build support among the American people and in Congress for laws to  help working people stand together for fair wages, safe working  conditions, and civil rights.   During this Hispanic Heritage Month, we are especially aware of the  enormous contributions that Hispanic Americans continue to make to  America's economy. Sadly, we know that this COVID-19 pandemic is taking  a disproportionate toll on Black and Brown Americans. Nationwide,  Latinos are being hospitalized with COVID-19 at more than 4\1/2\ times  the rate of White people. In Illinois and several other States, Latinos  have the highest COVID-19 infection rates of any ethnic group. COVID-19  is also threatening the livelihoods of Latinos throughout the US.  Almost 60 percent of Latino households have experienced job loss or  wage reductions during this pandemic.   At the same time, our Nation is relying heavily on Latinos, both  citizens and immigrants, to help steer us safely through this pandemic.  Latinos are working on the frontlines of this pandemic as doctors,  nurses, and home healthcare workers. They are also working around the  clock, behind the scenes, to disinfect our workplaces, schools, stores,  and health centers. Latino farm workers continue to work in the fields  and in packing plants, harvesting, and preparing the food that keeps us  fed. Despite the virus and, now, the thick smoke of wildfires  blanketing much of the west coast, they remain on the job.   Latinos are working as grocery clerks, teachers, postal employees,  servicemembers, and other ``essential worker jobs.'' Many of these  heroic essential workers are immigrants, and many are Dreamers. They  continue to work and serve in their communities while their own status  remains in limbo.   Latino-owned businesses are one of the fastest growing segments of  America's economy. Nationwide, nearly 1-in-4 newly created businesses  today are Latino-owned. More than 4 million Latino-owned businesses  provide jobs for 2.7 million workers. Together, these businesses pump  over $700 billion into America's economy. In Illinois, 120,000 Latino- owned businesses generate $15 billion and create jobs for 100,000  workers. These passionate entrepreneurs are the heart and pride of  their communities. I see them in communities all across Illinois. Let  me tell you about some of them.   In Chicagoland, Latino community and business leaders have created  programs such as the Food for Hope Program and the Big Shoulders Fund  to distribute free food to families who are hungry because of economic  hardships related to the pandemic.   Pedro Perez owns his own maintenance company, PCY General Services.  He and his daughter are part of a team that diligently disinfects  Esperanza Health Centers on the Southwest Side of Chicago to make sure  that the space is safe for families and for the medical professionals  who work there. What is even more remarkable is that he does all of  this without charge. Why? Pedro says, with a smile, because ``it's his  community.'' Every day, in every community in Illinois and every corner  of America, you can find stories like theirs.   The beauty and richness of the Latino community goes beyond food and  traditions. At the heart of the Latino community is an exceptionally  resilient spirit that has sustained them through history and is helping  to sustain America today through the most severe health and economic  crises most of us has ever experienced. I am honored to represent so  many of these hard-working families in my State and look forward to see  how they continue to inspire us to keep building a better America for  everyone.                            ____________________
