 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 41, offered by  my good friend, Mr. Huizenga. This resolution is simple. It repeals an  onerous rule that puts American manufacturing and energy companies at a  global disadvantage.   Both foreign and American companies sell products and energy in our  economy, but only American companies are required to jump through  additional hoops, regulations that cost billions of dollars and pass on  hundreds of millions of dollars to consumers. Michiganders know all too  well what happens when government tips the scale in favor of foreign  companies: jobs are lost overseas, and the investment necessary to  create jobs is delayed or canceled.   My friends across the aisle have suggested that this resolution is  about bribery. It is not. This resolution and, in fact, the election on  November 8 is about jobs, the loss of American jobs.   Manufacturers in Michigan don't need special treatment. The  unparalleled product of hardworking men and  [[Page H855]]  women in Michigan speaks for itself. But I think we can all agree that  the American Government should be their ally, not their opponent.  Repealing this rule does just that.   I encourage my colleagues to support this resolution.   Ms MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.
