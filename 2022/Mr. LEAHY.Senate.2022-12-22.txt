 Mr. President, I spoke on this matter earlier this week,  and I still agree with the Senator from Florida that we have a  responsibility to help Americans in the wake of disasters. It does not  matter if you are a Republican or a Democrat, or if you are from a blue  State or a red State. As Americans, we have to stand together to help  our communities recover and rebuild.   I have done that on this floor for 48 years--voting for disaster  bills for all States. But I believe in reality, not rhetoric. We don't  have time to play politics or for sound bites. We have to enact the  omnibus bill now, and that will get the aid to people in Florida and  other communities that need it most.   So I would urge all Senators to vote for the omnibus, and let us get  these things done. It is time to go forward. We don't have time for  further delay.    Mr. President, the Johnson amendment asks us to cede the  power of the purse to public servants in the executive branch who are  unaccountable to the voters. These public servants, dedicated though  they may be, cannot possibly share the depth of knowledge we hold about  our constituents and the communities in our States. I strongly urge the  Members of this Chamber to reject abdicating the power of the purse-- given to the legislative branch under the Constitution--as the Senator  from Wisconsin's amendment asks us to do.   As a Senator from Vermont, I speak with community leaders, dairy  farmers, small business owners, and Vermonters across my State every  day. I have done this for 48 years. I have a deep understanding of  Vermont and Vermonters.   Through congressionally directed spending, we can use this knowledge  to invest tax dollars directly back into taxpayer communities. We can  make these investments in everything from infrastructure, to community  health centers and workforce development, to afterschool programs.   In fact, under rule X-L-I-V--rule 44--and additional rules that I  established last year, we have unprecedented transparency and  accountability for the congressionally directed spending contained in  this bill--far more transparency than we have had at any time in my 48  years in the Senate.   Congressionally directed spending is not a new concept. In fact, it  dates back more than 230 years when funding for the Cape Henry  lighthouse, which still stands today, was included in a 1790 spending  bill. After the misguided ban on congressionally directed spending in  2011, I was proud to restore the power of the purse to the Senate with  new guardrails to improve transparency and accountability.   These guardrails include rule XLIV--44--of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, which requires each earmark to be clearly identified in the  committee and conference reports and certification that neither we nor  any member of our immediate family would financially benefit from the  requests we made. In fiscal year 2022, I implemented even more rigorous  standards to this process.   We required Senators to make their requests public on their websites  and make public any items that were funded in the appropriations bills.  We also required the GAO to audit a sample of enacted congressionally  directed spending items in order to increase accountability for the  projects that are funded and to restore the trust of the American  people in this process. And we put a 1-percent cap on all  congressionally directed spending items, and we banned congressionally  directed spending items to for-profit entities.   I am proud to say that we met each of these requirements in fiscal  year 2022, and they remain in place in the bill we are considering  today. I am also proud of all the projects I was able to fund for  Vermont in this bill and across my career here in the Senate.   The question before us is simple: Who do we want to control the purse  strings of the Federal Government--the unaccountable bureaucrats in the  executive branch or the representatives of the people?   I think the answer is clear, and I strongly urge every Member of this  Chamber to reject the Johnson amendment.                          Vote on Amendment No. 6555     Mr. President, I brought a lot of bills to the floor here.  This will be the last one I bring to the floor of the Senate. But it is  one that we have to act on quickly or we risk a government shutdown.   This omnibus appropriations bill provides $1.7 trillion for fiscal  year 2023, $42 billion in aid to Ukraine, and $27 billion for victims  of natural disaster.   It is a strong, bicameral, and bipartisan bill; and it adheres to the  framework announced by Vice Chairman Shelby, Chair DeLauro, and myself  last week.   From funding for nutrition programs and housing assistance, to  reducing home energy costs and increasing college affordability, this  bill is a direct investment into the American people and our national  security, which we cannot delay further. The pain of inflation is real,  and it is being felt by families across the country and in every corner  of the Federal Government.   Not only does this bill provide real relief from inflation, it is  this bill where we fund the promises of the landmark, bipartisan  legislation that we passed in the 117th Congress.   The bill provides $1.8 billion in new funding to implement the  bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act of 2022. This will help drive our  innovative and competitive edge on the global stage. We included $9.9  billion--an historic level of funding--for the National Science  Foundation, which will support 2,300 more research and education grants  and 35,000 more scientists, technicians, teachers, and students.   In the bipartisan PACT Act, we made a commitment to countless  veterans across the country to ensure that they receive healthcare and  benefits related to exposure to burn pits, Agent Orange, and other  toxic substances. This appropriations bill makes good on that promise  by providing $5 billion to implement the PACT Act. It provides $118.7  billion--a 22-percent increase--for VA Medical Care. These benefits are  deserved. They were earned, and they are owed.   In the bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, we finally  made a significant investment in addressing our Nation's crumbling  bridges, roads, and infrastructure. This appropriations bill puts tens  of billions of real dollars behind those investments to bring our  infrastructure into the 21st century.   Last week, we passed the National Defense Authorization Act--NDAA-- with overwhelming bipartisan support, but that legislation did not  contain a single penny in funding. The bill we consider today does, and  it fully funds the NDAA.   But the investments in this bill will go far beyond the bipartisan  priorities of this year. It makes real investments that will directly  improve the lives of the American people. It includes a $500 increase  to the maximum Pell grant award, which helps more than 7 million  students across the country pursue a postsecondary education and  further their careers every year. It invests billions of dollars in our  Nation's public schools by providing a 5-percent increase for title I-A  grants.   It helps to address the crisis of childcare access and affordability  by providing $8 billion for Child Care and Development Block Grants and  nearly $12 billion for Head Start. These programs directly help parents  access quality childcare and promote children's healthy development,  learning, and well-being.   It continues our efforts to confront the opioid crisis. I am sure  every Member of this Chamber knows someone who struggles with substance  misuse or someone who advocates on their behalf. I know Marcelle and I  do. Communities across the country host grieving families and people  struggling with addiction from all walks of life who need new resources  now, and this bill provides them. This includes a more than $345  million increase to address this crisis.   Across this country there are more than 34 million people who are  food insecure, including 9 million children. This should not happen in  the wealthiest country in the world, and with the cost of groceries up  more than 10 percent, this crisis could only get worse. Our bill  provides a $13.4 billion increase for the Supplemental Nutrition  Program and funds Child Nutrition Programs, WIC, and other programs to  improve nutrition.    This is just scratching the surface of what this appropriations bill  will mean for the American people, our national security, and how we  project our influence abroad. Our bill invests billions of dollars to  help to make housing more affordable and help those in this country who  are experiencing homelessness. We provide $5 billion for LIHEAP, and we  provide funding to support local law  [[Page S10076]]  enforcement and place more than 1,800 additional police officers on the  streets of our communities.   The bill includes over $42 billion in aid to Ukraine and over $27  billion for the victims of natural disasters.   The real good this bill does is too long to list now. But if you  voted for the bipartisan PACT Act, CHIPS Act, Infrastructure Law, or  the NDAA, you should vote for this bill to actually fund them; if you  want to help families deal with the cost of heating, childcare,  college, food, and housing, you should vote for this bill; if you want  to support law enforcement, you should vote for this bill.   The choice is clear: We can either do our jobs and fund the Federal  Government--which is undoubtedly in the interest of the American  people--or we can abandon our responsibilities without a real path  forward. The alternative, a continuing resolution into the New Year, is  short-sighted and wholly unnecessary. It imperils our national  security, and it ignores the real pain and consequences of inflation.  Without a clear path forward based on a bipartisan framework, punting  on our responsibility to fund the Federal Government risks a full-year  continuing resolution. Under a continuing resolution, America gets left  behind.   I strongly urge the support of this omnibus appropriations bill. I  want to thank my dear friend Vice Chairman Shelby for his partnership  in this process, and I want to thank Chair DeLauro for her diligent  work. Without their work and cooperation, we would not be where we are  today.   I also want to thank our staffs who spent countless, sleepless nights  working through the details of this bill. Specifically, I want to thank  Charles Kieffer, Chanda Betourney, Jay Tilton, and Maria Calderon on my  staff. There are so many, many more who worked tireless days and  nights--far too many names to say now--so I would like to submit a list  of these staff into the Record:         Charles Kieffer; Chanda Betourney; Jay Tilton; Maria       Calderon; Tim Rieser; Clint Trocchio; Jenny Winkler; Ben       Hammond; Joshua Kravitz; Hong Nguyen; George Castro; Dianne       Nellor; Rachel Erlebacher; Hannah Chauvin; Jess Berry; Blaise       Sheridan; Michael Bednarczyk; Angela Caalim; Lindsay       Erickson; Kate Kaufer; Mike Clementi; Abigail Grace; Katy       Hagan; Brigid Kolish; Rob Leonard; John Lucio; Andy       Vanlandingham; Laura Mancini; Drew Platt; Doug Clapp; Aaron       Goldner; Jen Becker Pollett; Laura Powell; Ellen Murray;       Diana Hamilton; Maddie Dunn; Kamela White; Jenn Piatt; Jim       Daumit; Frank Reed; Melissa Zimmerman; Ryan Hunt; Martha       Roberts; Anthony Sedillo; Alex Keenan; Kelly Brown; Mike       Gentile; Mark Laisch; Meghan Mott; Kathryn Toomajian; Fiona       O'Brien; Richard Braddock; Michelle Dominguez; Joanne Hoff;       Jason McMahon; Alex Carnes; Kali Farahmand; Sarita Vanka;       Madeleine Granda; Dabney Hegg; Kelsey Daniels; Rajat Mathur;       Jessica Sun; Valerie Hutton; Elmer Barnes; Penny Myles; Karin       Thames; Lynn Cookley; Alley Adcock; David Adkins; Lucas       Agnew; Jennifer Bastin; Katherine Bowles; Patrick Carroll;       Michael Ciamarra; Chris Cook; Allen Cutler; Brian Daner;       Elizabeth Dent; Bill Duhnke; Anna Fischer Lanier; John       Forbes; Laura Friedel; Paul Grove; Ann Tait Hall; Hanz       Heinrichs; Nora Khalil; Emy Lesofski; Rachel Littleton;       Patrick Magnunson; Nona McCoy; Daniel Mencher; Thompson       Moore; Anna Newton; Lauren Nunnally; Cameron O'Brien; Ashley       Palmer; Todd Phillips; Emily Slack; Lashawnda Smith; Blair       Taylor; William Tutt; Morgan Ulmer; Kevin Wheeler; Kathleen       Williams; Jason Woolwine; Jason Yaworske; and Adam Yezerski.    This is a bill that invests in us--the American people.    Mr. President, the 11th of December marked the 6-month  anniversary of the violent death of widely respected Palestinian- American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. On May 19, I echoed Secretary of  State Blinken's call for an ``independent, credible investigation'' of  her killing. At that time, several Members of Congress called for the  FBI to be involved, as did I. That would be appropriate after a tragedy  like this involving an American citizen killed overseas under  questionable circumstances. Secretary Blinken later said, and I agree,  that ``[w]hen that investigation happens, we will follow the facts,  wherever they lead. It's as straightforward as that.''   Unfortunately, there has been no independent, credible investigation,  at least not yet. Three months ago, the Israeli Government, after first  blaming the Palestinians for Ms. Abu Akleh's death, stated that she was  likely shot, by mistake, by an unnamed Israeli soldier. The U.S.  Security Coordinator--USSC--also stated, at the time, that gunfire from  Israeli Defense Force--IDF--positions was likely responsible, but that  there was ``no evidence to indicate her killing was intentional.'' The  State Department acknowledges that conclusion was not the result of an  investigation, but rather a review of information they were provided by  the IDF and the Palestinian Authority. We were told that ``the  Administration continues to believe that cooperation among Israel, the  Palestinian Authority, and the USSC is the best path to support a  thorough, transparent, and impartial investigation.''   Neither the Palestinian Authority nor the IDF can be relied on to  objectively determine and make public all the facts of what happened in  this case--nor have they. For the State Department to assert,  prematurely, that fatally shooting an unarmed person, and in this case  one with ``PRESS'' written in bold letters on her clothing, was not  intentional, without providing any facts to support that conclusion,  calls into question the Department's commitment to an independent,  credible investigation and to ``follow the facts, wherever they lead.''   Before I was elected to the Senate, I was a prosecutor. I know a  thing or two about homicide investigations, having participated in  many. There are intentional, reckless, negligent, and justifiable or  excusable homicides. Six months after Ms. Abu Akleh's death, key  questions remain unanswered, including:   What specific evidence was the basis for the conclusion that ``there  is no reason to believe that this was intentional but rather the result  of tragic circumstances?'' Has everyone--the IDF personnel, Al Jazeera  employees, and any others--who were in the proximity at the time of her  death been questioned, and if so by whom?   What, specifically, were the ``tragic circumstances'' the State  Department referred to?   Was the soldier who likely fired the fatal shot a trained marksman?  Was he looking through a scope? Was there anything obstructing his  vision? If he did not intend to kill Ms. Abu Akleh, what did he intend?  Did he have reason to believe that the shot would injure or kill her?   Were the rifle and ammunition he used, or the armored personnel  vehicle he was reportedly inside or shielded behind when he fired the  fatal shot, supplied by the United States? What IDF unit was he a  member of? Is he still a member of the IDF? If so, is he on active  duty?   If, as the Israeli authorities may be implying, the IDF soldier  missed, who or what he was aiming at and killed Ms. Abu Akleh by  mistake, who or what was he aiming at?   There are reports of earlier exchanges of gunfire, although not in  the immediate vicinity where Ms. Abu Akleh was standing and not at the  time she was shot. Is there any evidence that the shots that killed her  and injured Ali Sammoudi, another unarmed Al Jazeera journalist, were  fired as a legitimate act of self-defense?   How many shots were fired, and were they all fired by the same  soldier? Have any other bullets been recovered, including the one that  injured Mr. Sammoudi?   On July 5, the State Department spokesperson said, ``We would want to  see accountability in any case of a wrongful death. That would  especially--and is especially the case in the wrongful death of an  American citizen, as was Shireen Abu Akleh.'' Has anyone been held  accountable, and if so, in what manner? What steps does the Department  plan to take to ensure such accountability? What steps has the  Department taken to determine whether the Leahy Law applies in this  case?   Imagine if Shireen Abu Akleh were your sister--or your aunt--or your  daughter. Wouldn't you be asking these questions and expect answers?  Six months after her death, shouldn't we already know the answers?   Recently, it was reported that the FBI has opened an investigation in  this case. I welcome that decision. The Israeli authorities immediately  announced they would not cooperate with the FBI. I hope they  reconsider, especially given that this involves the untimely death of  an American citizen by the actions of a soldier of a country that  receives by far the largest amount of U.S. military training and  equipment. I have voted for that aid because I believe we should help  Israel defend itself, especially with Iran financing anti-Israel  terrorist groups and regularly calling for Israel's annihilation. But  that does not prevent me from asking relevant questions and calling for  a thorough, independent investigation of the violent death of an  American journalist, likely by an IDF soldier. In fact, it compels me  to do so.   There is an increasing foreboding that, as in so many other cases and  like the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, there will never be the  independent,  [[Page S10078]]  thorough investigation and accountability that Ms. Abu Akleh's family,  the Secretary of State, I, and others have called for. That would  further jeopardize the safety of journalists everywhere who  courageously risk their lives to gather facts and inform the public.  This year alone, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at  least 38 journalists have been killed, 294 have been imprisoned, and 64  are missing. Whether Shireen Abu Akleh's killing was a tragic mistake  or the result of a reckless or intentional act, there must be a full  accounting. And if it was intentional and if those responsible are not  brought to justice, then the Leahy Law must be applied.                            ____________________     Mr. President, throughout my 48 years in the Senate, I  worked to uphold the American tradition of a humane immigration policy  and fought to advance comprehensive immigration reform. As an advocate  for refugees and asylum seekers fleeing violence and persecution around  the world, I have been committed to allocating resources to help  welcome these vulnerable individuals and families to my home State. And  I did my best to directly support the Vermont communities that do so  much to help resettle and embrace them.   My office also has directly assisted thousands of Vermonters with  visas, refugee resettlement, asylum, and other immigration casework.  Over the past 48 years, this work has helped children and adults  receive lifesaving medical treatment by enabling nurses, doctors, and  dentists to join our short-staffed hospitals and clinics. It has also  helped H-2A farmworkers to arrive in Vermont in time for harvest, work  that is critical to our food supply and the success of our farms. My  office has assisted students, scholars, engineers, musicians, athletes,  and so many others to participate in and help grow our educational  institutions and workforce, in the process often reuniting families  separated for years. My staff and I have had the honor of witnessing  Vermonters of all ages and from all walks of life realize their dreams  to become citizens of the United States of America.   Working with Vermonters with diverse backgrounds from all across the  globe, I have come to know their struggles and hardships as well as  their successes and achievements. Some were fleeing war and  persecution, others pursuing their own dreams and seeking a better life  for their children. With great courage and determination and the  assistance of so many caring and generous Vermonters, these New  Americans have not only improved their own lives, they have also  brought a great and lasting benefit to our State. Vermont, like the  rest of this great Nation, is built on the contributions of immigrants.   The stories I hear from Vermonters who call my office has helped to  inform my work in Washington. After countless concerned Vermonters  contacted my office as tens of thousands of Afghans fled persecution, I  used my position as chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee to  ensure adequate resources were available for resettlement in Vermont  and elsewhere in the U.S. And when Ukrainians fled Russian attacks on  their country to find safety in Vermont and elsewhere in the U.S., we  appropriated funds to help them.   As former chair and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee,  I played a central role in shaping Federal immigration policy. At the  forefront of my immigration priorities was passing legislation that  incorporated the needs of Vermont agriculture and industry because I  have long recognized the value immigration reform can have on state and  local economies.   I also sponsored the H-2A Improvement Act, a bill to include dairy  workers in the agricultural work visa program. And I have been a lead  sponsor of the Agricultural Job Opportunities, Benefits, and Security  Act to legalize the existing undocumented agricultural workforce in  order to help America's farmers stay a productive and a vital part of  the American economy.   While the reforms I believe are needed across our entire immigration  system have not yet been completed, I am proud that during the 113th  Congress, the Senate made significant progress toward this goal by  passing S.744, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and  Immigration Modernization Act, with an overwhelming bipartisan vote.  This legislation sought to enhance border security, create a workable  and accurate electronic workplace verification system, reform some of  the legal immigration system, and provide a tough but achievable  pathway to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented  immigrants in the country. It contained important long-standing  initiatives that would directly benefit Vermont agriculture and  industry, including important improvements to the agricultural  temporary worker visa program, and reforms that both streamlined and  strengthened oversight of the job-creating immigrant investor EB-5  Regional Center Program.   Nearly a decade ago, I re-introduced the Refugee Protection Act. This  bill would improve protections for refugees and asylum seekers and  fulfill the U.S. obligations under the 1951 Convention Relating to the  Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. And I was a leading voice to  demand an end to the expanded use of family detention for mothers and  children fleeing violence in Central America. Beginning in 2003, I  fought to end discrimination based on sexual orientation in our  immigration laws through the Uniting American Families Act, legislation  that would allow U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents to  petition for their foreign same-sex partners to come to the United  States through the family immigration system. In June 2013, the Supreme  Court decided United States v. Windsor, which held that the Federal  Government cannot discriminate against married same-sex couples for the  purpose of Federal benefits and responsibilities. The result was the  fulfillment of my goal to ensure that married same-sex couples have  full immigration rights.   Thirty years ago, I visited a refugee camp. I brought my camera, as I  do everywhere, so that I could show people back in Washington the human  toll of an issue. A man there encouraged me to take his picture. I  looked at his worn and weary face through the range finder. We sat and  talked afterward, and he said simply: ``Don't forget people like me.''  The black and white photo hung above my desk for 30 years; every day I  came to work, he looked at me, saying, ``You don't know my name, you  don't speak my language, there's nothing I can do to help you--but what  are you doing for people like me?'' That photo and the question it  provokes helped guide my approach to immigration legislation and other  policy areas over the years.   So much more needs to be done, but we must also remember our  accomplishments and always honor the immigrants who have made this  country a great nation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I have been a member of the Senate  Agriculture Committee for 48 years, since I was elected in 1974. I have  helped to write nine farm bills, and I have overseen the creation of  programs that have helped farmers, food systems, and consumers alike.  Throughout the years, I have been proud to bring born-in-Vermont ideas  back to DC.   I was warned when I first came to the Senate not to get on the  Agriculture Committee because I would never be able to get off. And  they were right. But that has been just fine with me because the work  we have done on this committee and in the farm bills has always been so  important, and the work has been bipartisan, in the best tradition of  the Senate.   I have always worked to make healthy food accessible to everyone. In  1988, I authored the Hunger Prevention Act, which improved child  nutrition and SNAP programs and provided other hunger relief. In 1994,  I worked to provide funding for WIC, provide milk to low-income  students, fund school breakfast programs, encourage organic foods at  school lunches, and expand WIC at farmers markets, and promote healthy  eating habits for children through the better Nutrition and Health for  Children Act. And in 2010, I authored the Healthy Hunger Free Kids Act,  which created the Farm to School Program, which brings locally grown  food into schools.   I have been proud to advocate for small- and mid-sized dairy farms,  [[Page S10079]]  which are integral to the history and fabric of Vermont. Family dairies  have struggled and I have been honored to lead the work in the Senate  to find the right model to help family dairy farms manage risk. After  several innovative models, our current one, the Dairy Margin Coverage  Program, seems to be working, and I hope that it will be renewed and  improved in the next farm bill.   In 2018, I advocated to bring one of the Regional Dairy Business  Innovation Centers to Vermont, which now serves the entire Northeast,  supporting the development, production, marketing, and distribution of  dairy products.   This committee has also been home to some of the most significant  Federal forest conservation laws. In 1990, I oversaw the creation of  the Forest Legacy Program, which protects private forests through  conservation easements or land purchases. Since 1990, the Forest Legacy  Program has conserved more than 2.8 million acres of forest land across  all 50 States and U.S. Territories. And in 2008, using the historic  Vermont town forest system as a model, I led the creation of the  Community Forest and Open Space Conservation Program, which allows  communities to acquire and conserve forests that provide public access,  recreation, protect water supplies and wildlife habitat, serve as  demonstration sites for forest landowners, and provide economic  benefits from these products.   One of my proudest achievements was as chairman of the Agriculture  Committee in 1990, when I authored the Organic Food Production Act,  which established the USDA Organic program. What was predicted to be a  ``crunchy granola sideshow'' has become a nearly $58 billion industry.   I have so valued that this is, perhaps, the least partisan of all  Senate committees. Please be reminded of this if you glance up at my  portrait in 2023 and beyond. Keep in mind that while we will have our  differences, farm bills have always been bipartisan, and we have always  come together to support our farmers and rural communities.                            ____________________     Mr. President, the most important technology connections  are ones between people. Vermont is a place where people connecting is  not only important to life, but is the very fabric of it. It was  natural, I think, for me to see cyberspace as a continuation of  connections like in Vermont. It is why I created one of the first  websites in the Senate. It is why I have done hundreds of video chats  with Vermont schoolchildren. And it is why I have ensured that among  the billions of dollars of the Federal budget appropriated for  cyberspace programs the executive agencies pay attention to the special  perspective we have in Vermont.   For all the machines connected to each other that make up cyberspace,  the real connectivity is between the people using them, coding their  software, and fabricating their hardware. Any cyber specialist will  tell you the weakest link in security is the humans who use or create  the programs and hardware. But they will also tell you that humans have  the potential to be the most powerful part of the network.   Much of my work has been about improving the way the human  connections strengthen the technological ones. I created the Trusted  Foundry Program and have supported its evolution, so people in the U.S.  Government and critical industries know that the chips they put in  their equipment come from a fab that has the highest level of security  against meddling by bad actors. The men and women in Essex Junction,  VT, at GlobalFoundries work at such a fab, and the IBMers there  administer the program nation-wide.   At Champlain College, I established the Leahy Center for Digital  Investigation, so there would be a place where protecting and serving  people in the physical world benefits from the online one. Their recent  work to educate on collection of data from crime scenes that meets  evidentiary standards for the Internet of Things--all the connected  devices that now exist in our lives--has set a standard for the Nation,  and their work with the U.S. Secret Service has improved the work at  their premier cyber school for law enforcement in Alabama.   This summer, I am proud that Norwich University announced at  Vermont's first annual Cyber Symposium that their School of  Cybersecurity and Advanced Computing would bear my name. I am proud  because, for years, their students and faculty have been a national  treasure. Among many, many achievements, Norwich created and I secured  funds for the wildly successful DECIDE program for command and control  cyber exercises with the Department of Homeland Security, now in its  fourth expansion in this year's omnibus. Norwich's expertise in helping  local governments prepare for and respond to cyber events, their  education opportunities for undergrads, secondary degrees, guardsmen  and reservists, and their upcoming expansion of their cybersecurity  discipline to fully embrace the roles of information operations,  machine learning, and AI-assisted decision-making in security, are all  ways they are showing national leadership.   The important connections between people go back to the earliest days  of Vermont. We have always had to rely on each other. That has made us  strong and resilient. Everyone here shows that we have continued that  tradition into the digital age, using technology to reinforce and  create new bonds between us. It has been an honor to support and  strengthen that during my Senate career, and I look forward to seeing  how Vermonters continue to grow in connection with each other and the  world.                            ____________________     Mr. President, in 2023 the Center for Civilians in  Conflict will celebrate its 20th anniversary. This is a significant  milestone, as I vividly recall when CIVIC, originally named the  Campaign for Innocent Victims in Conflict, was created by Marla  Ruzicka. When I first met Marla she was a 26-year-old dynamo from  Lakeport, CA, who had gone to Afghanistan on her own to raise awareness  about civilian casualties of U.S. military operations. Like many of us,  she had read reports of repeated incidents of U.S. bombs missing their  targets and wiping out whole neighborhoods, of innocent people being  shot at checkpoints, and other deaths and injuries of civilians. Marla  not only read about those tragic incidents; she became a one-woman  campaign with a laptop who, within a few months of arriving in Kabul,  was quoted in the New York Times and other publications, calling on the  U.S. to do more to protect civilians and assist those who were harmed.  As a result of her efforts, Congress created funds for both Afghanistan  and Iraq, administered by the U.S. Agency for International  Development, to provide such assistance, the latter fund named for  Marla after she was killed, herself an innocent victim of war, in a car  bombing in Baghdad on April 16, 2005.   While no one could replace Marla's vivaciousness and passion for the  cause of protecting civilians in war, CIVIC survived that terrible loss  and has since evolved into a global advocacy organization devoted to  protecting civilians who increasingly bear the brunt of armed  conflicts. Ukraine is a horrifying example that is on the front pages  every day, but there are many others--in South Sudan, Yemen, Syria, and  Burma to name a few.   In August, a year after the disastrous U.S. missile strike that  killed a whole family in Kabul after multiple egregious intelligence  failures, Secretary of Defense Austin released the Pentagon's own  Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Action Plan. If fully  implemented, it could significantly improve the way the Pentagon  addresses civilian harm. CIVIC and other advocacy organizations have  been calling for such reforms, as have I since as far back as when  Marla was still alive. Congress even enacted legislation that specified  procedures for evaluating claims and making ex gratia payments to  eligible civilian victims, but the Pentagon ignored them. They also  failed to utilize millions of dollars appropriated by Congress for this  purpose, despite the obvious needs in Syria and elsewhere. So I welcome  this long overdue step, but as currently envisioned, the action plan is  prospective and does not contemplate investigations of past incidents  of civilian casualties or assistance for those victims. That is wrong.  It should provide for victims of past incidents, at least those for  which credible information has already been collected, and I urge the  [[Page S10080]]  Secretary of Defense to revisit this question.   The importance of minimizing harm to civilians in conflict cannot be  overstated. For far too long, senior officials of United States and  other countries' armed forces spoke little about civilian casualties,  treating them as regrettable collateral damage that is inevitable in  warfare. In fact, if the laws of war are to be taken seriously, they  require effective procedures and rigorous enforcement. CIVIC's mission,  20 years after Marla Ruzicka compelled us to pay attention, is as  relevant today as it was then, to ensure that everything is done that  can and should be done to protect civilians in conflict, and to assist  those who are harmed. By doing so we reaffirm our respect for human  life and human dignity that people around the world expect of us, we  mitigate anger and resentment within local populations whose support we  need, and we enhance the reputation and mission of our own Armed  Forces.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the incredible  institutions of higher education in my home State. Like many  Vermonters, I was the first in my family to attend college--I chose a  small, liberal arts, Catholic college--Saint Michael's College in  Colchester, VT. St. Mike's, as it is affectionately called, was a home  away home for me during some of my most formative years. It was there  that I met my wife Marcelle, received my B.A. in government, and from  where I left to receive my JD from Georgetown University Law Center.   Higher education is a path out of poverty and towards personal and  professional growth for so many Americans. When those who choose to  seek higher education, are able to do so--everyone succeeds. Throughout  my 48 years in the Senate, I have worked to increase access to higher  education through programs such as TRIO, the Public Service Loan  Forgiveness Program, Pell grants, and Federal Work-Study. I know how  important these programs are because I am a product of a quality  Vermont education. Each year, thousands of students attend Vermont  colleges and universities. My alma mater, St. Mike's, is not the only  quality school--but one of many.   The University of Vermont, founded in 1791, is a public land-grant  research university that has championed agricultural, opioid-misuse,  rural development, and medical research, among many other fields of  study. I have been honored to be one of UVM's biggest fans and  supporters in Congress. Throughout his tenure, President Garimella has  been an incredible partner of mine and Marcelle, and I look forward to  spending more time with him and his wife in Burlington.   Another legendary institution is the Vermont State College system.  Today, it is comprised of several outstanding institutions: Castleton,  Northern Vermont University, VT Tech, and Community Colleges of  Vermont. Each of them in their own right have made a name for  themselves through great strides in nursing and teaching workforce  development, creating high-technology manufacturing jobs, rethinking  remote learning, and expanding opportunity for mid-career learners.   I recognize that the future of higher education is often disputed.  What does it offer young people in the face of uncertainty and economic  insecurity? The cost of higher education has ballooned and has become  out of reach for too many families. Higher education's intent has  become lost. Higher education--college or university--should never be a  prerequisite to a job that supports one's family.   However, higher education--such as the extension program at UVM or  the language programs at Middlebury College--provide the tools to  better understand our complex and constantly changing universe. They  provide a challenge to get to know ourselves better and a community to  sustain us.   I rise today to honor one of the places, one of the communities that  first raised me, gave me a home, and a purpose. From my time travelling  throughout the State, I have met Vermonters who are cybersecurity  experts, doctors, researchers, mechanics, arborists, and teachers. Many  of them, like me, were the first in their family to seek continuing  education and many have told me that they never could have imagined  this bright of a future.   I am confident that long after my tenure in the Senate, Vermont  colleges and universities will continue to provide a home, challenge,  and pathway to the future for Vermonters and students from around the  world.                            ____________________
