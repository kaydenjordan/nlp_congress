 Mr. President, today I rise to speak in support of  Xavier Becerra's nomination to serve s Secretary of Health and Human  Services, HHS.   Attorney General Becerra will bring a fresh perspective to HHS at a  critical time during this pandemic. While there is light at the end of  the tunnel with the distribution of the corona virus vaccines, there is  still work to do to end this pandemic and put our country on a road to  recovery, and that is where Attorney General Becerra's leadership will  be crucial.   Attorney General Becerra's 12 terms in the U.S. House of  Representatives gave him a solid foundation in knowing how to set  agendas and achieve results, which we saw deployed in his work as a key  leader on the Committee on Ways and Means ranking member of the  Subcommittee on Social Security, and chair of the House Democratic  caucus.   He helped to expand the Children's Health Insurance Program,  modernize and strengthen Medicare, and helped pass the Affordable Care  Act. His commitment to the letter and spirit of this law is something  he carried into his role as California attorney general, fighting to  maintain his State's ability to bring millions of previously uninsured  residents under the Affordable Care Act's umbrella.   Last November, he led the defense of the Affordable Care Act in the  U.S. Supreme Court on behalf of 20 States and the District of Columbia.  His tweet after the oral arguments concisely sums up the national  importance of his effort: ``The ACA saves lives. It is the law of the  land.'' He brings a strong commitment to using the law and regulatory  tools to make access to health care and other vital services  equitable--the very thing that makes our Nation strong.   I look forward to working with him on ensuring that everyone has  access to quality and affordable healthcare, and I know he will be a  partner in the fight against the corona virus and our goal of getting  all eligible Americans vaccinated, even in hard-to-reach areas.   Last week, President Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan  Act, which included major funding to address the--Nation's worsening  mental health and addiction crisis. This is a high priority of mine and  an issue which Attorney General Becerra has firsthand experience. He  started his career as a legal aid attorney in Massachusetts, supporting  clients contending with mental health issues. I am eager to work with  him on this issue.   Addressing the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs is another  area where Attorney General Becerra has shown key leadership. He and I  share a belief that fairer competition means  [[Page S1611]]  increased access to affordable prescription drugs and better public  health. As California attorney general, he investigated and brought  enforcement actions against drug manufacturers' anti-competitive  business practices to help reduce drug prices and ensure that people  have access to the drugs they need. In March 2020, he led a bipartisan  group of 46 States attorneys general who successfully advocated before  the U.S. Supreme Court to uphold the rights of States to regulate and  address the rising cost of prescription drugs.   The United States must do more to ensure that new technologies have  appropriate privacy and security protections for health data. At a  September 2020 hearing on the need for Federal data privacy  legislation, Attorney General Becerra told me and other members of the  Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation that ``every  consumer should be able to own and control his or her data'' and that  ``if we decide that we don't want anyone to use [our data], it's our  choosing.'' His testimony was reassuring, and I look forward to working  with him to ensure consumers can have a peace of mind when it comes to  the security of their personal health data.   Given the pandemic's spotlight on the vulnerability of our Nation's  seniors, I am eager to work with the Biden administration to improve  the safety and weTI-being of older Americans. When my 92-year-old dad  living in a memory care facility was diagnosed with COVID-19 last year,  I was only able to visit him through a window. He recognized me, but he  just didn't understand why we couldn't be in the same room together.  Tens of thousands of families have been through these wrenching  situations over the past year and want to see the Federal Government  doing more. Attorney General Becerra recently moved to make the  California Department of Justice Medicaid Fraud Control Unit a full- fledged division, underscoring his commitment to protecting seniors and  people with disabilities. I know his leadership will place the needs of  seniors front and center.   Attorney General Becerra has the expertise and experience and the  enforcement and regulatory savvy to handle the job of protecting public  health, strengthening our hospitals and healthcare system, making sure  people have access to quality, affordable healthcare, and supporting  our healthcare workers. And as the first Latino to lead the Department  of Health and Human Services, he will bring a personal understanding of  the immediate need for equitable access to care.   With that, I ask my colleagues to support the nomination of Xavier  Becerra to be Secretary of Health and Human Services.                            ____________________
