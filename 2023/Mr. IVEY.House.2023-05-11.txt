 Mr. Speaker, I will support legislation that fairly and  appropriately addresses the serious shortcomings in our country's  immigration laws, but, unfortunately, H.R. 2 is not that bill.    H.R. 2 is a false promise to the extreme Republican base. The Senate  has already made it clear that this bill is dead on arrival. But even  if the bill somehow passed, it does not provide funding to build a  wall, nor hire more Border Patrol officers, nor retain those we already  have.   A cornerstone of H.R. 2, and its first major provision, is a return  to Donald Trump's quest to build a wall along our southern border. But  the Republican bill doesn't even provide the money to pay for it.   The bill calls for a wall that is at least 900 miles long, but it  would not stop the flow of fentanyl. The Sinaloa cartel in Mexico  routinely drives by the wall that is already there, flies over the  wall, and tunnels underneath it, as we learned during the DOJ takedown  of the Sinaloa cartel a few weeks ago.   The wall would also be a financial disaster. H.R. 2 presumes that the  wall would be funded with unspent money that has been allocated for the  wall. But former President Trump siphoned away much of the unspent  funds for the wall from other departments and the programs for those  funds were eventually returned to them.   According to the CBO's analysis, another 160 miles of the wall would  have to be built to reach the 900-mile mandate that is in the bill. In  estimating these costs, CBO wrote: ``CBO estimates an average cost per  mile of $25 million. . . . CBO expects that previously appropriated  amounts could cover the cost of 80 miles of construction; thus, CBP  would need an additional $2 billion to complete the other 80 miles.''   On top of that, the Republicans just announced that they proposed a  22 percent cut across the board for much of the government, including  DHS.   In March, I joined my colleagues on a visit to the southern border.  We met with Customs and Border Patrol officers. The border officers  were unanimous in the need for more resources, more agents, and more  technology. We took their comments to heart.  [[Page H2261]]    During the markup, Democrats sought to provide more immigration  judges, more processing centers that combined Federal, State, and local  resources, but those amendments were also voted down by Republicans.   Democrats also sought to ensure that Border Patrol officers were paid  according to the established civil pay scale; expand technology to x- ray trucks at the border, where over 90 percent of the fentanyl enters  the United States; boost the quantity and quality of drones used by our  officers to cut the cartel's 17-1 advantage in drones they now use to  traffic drugs and other contraband; and add 1,700 Border Patrol  officers to manage the border and intercept the flow of illegal drugs,  such as fentanyl.                                time  1145    But all of these amendments were rejected by our Republican  colleagues.   Worse still, the Republican bill prohibits NGOs, like the American  Red Cross and The Salvation Army, from providing essential goods and  services to migrants who desperately need them.    Mr. Speaker, this is why many groups have written letters  of opposition to H.R. 2, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic  Bishops, the AFL-CIO, Catholic Charities, and 136 humanitarian aid  organizations who signed a joint letter of opposition.   For example, the bishop of El Paso and the chairman of the U.S.  Conference of Catholic Bishops' Committee on Migration wrote: ``As  drafted, these provisions could even be interpreted to prevent schools,  houses of worship, and other organizations from qualifying for the  Nonprofit Security Grant program amid a rise in violent attacks on  those places.''   The bishop also noted that DHS's ability to rescue persons  encountered in the desert in life-threatening circumstances and process  unaccompanied children, victims of trafficking, victims of torture, and  others, who even under this bill's terms would warrant such processing,  could be precluded.   Mr. Speaker, for these and many other reasons, I thoroughly oppose  H.R. 2.
