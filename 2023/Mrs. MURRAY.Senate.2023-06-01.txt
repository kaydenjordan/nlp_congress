 Mr. President, I come to the floor to urge all of my  colleagues to vote against this Republican bill that would undo  President Biden's student debt relief plan and rip away relief  borrowers across the country are counting on.   It is hard to overstate how badly the student debt crisis has  strained our borrowers and our families nationwide, and this crisis has  been a drag on our whole country and our economy. It is holding people  back from starting families or starting a business or buying a home-- or, in many cases, just making ends meet.   The student debt relief President Biden announced last fall is life- changing for so many borrowers. Under his plan, tens of millions of  people who are struggling with student debt will finally see their  balances go down, and millions will have their debt wiped out entirely.   Before Republican interests sued to deny borrowers this life-changing  relief, putting the President's plan on pause, over 26 million people  across all 50 States had already applied for or were automatically  eligible for that relief.   And let's be clear. This relief is targeted to reach those who need  it the most. Ninety percent of the relief will go to borrowers earning  less than $75,000 a year. That is such a big deal.   I have heard from so many people across my State who were so grateful  and relieved to have a glimmer of hope finally, to see a light at the  end of the tunnel, and now Republicans want to snuff it out. They are  trying to deny relief to borrowers in court and now here in Congress  too. That is what we are voting on today.   To the hard-working people in America who are counting on the student  debt relief, listen up. Republicans are willing to do anything and  everything to prevent you from living a life without crushing debt.   And let's be clear. This Republican bill wouldn't only rip away  relief borrowers who qualify under the President's plan are counting  on. This CRA that we are going to vote on could impact the pause on  loan payments and cause major problems for borrowers who have received  relief through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness and income-driven  repayment programs.   That means these Republican efforts could create the perfect storm  for more than 260,000 public service workers who have already earned  that relief. Borrowers who thought they were done paying their loans  may have to pay more interest or additional payments. Think about that.   You know who we are talking about: nurses and teachers and  firefighters and medical researchers. Seriously, these are the people  who keep America going. The cold, hard reality is that if Republicans  get their way and pass this into law, people across the country would  have relief that they have counted on snatched away from them, plans  they have made upended, less money in their pockets, and monthly  payments not just abruptly restarted but maybe even abruptly jacked up  hundreds of dollars. That is what Republicans are voting for. It is  chaos and hardship for borrowers and families across this country.   Mr. President, I can't speak for everyone, but I came here to make  people's lives better. I didn't come here to punish them for this  broken student loan system that they got stuck with. I cannot overstate  how arcane and complicated and how broken our current student loan  system is, and millions of Americans find themselves unfairly bogged  down with massive debt, so often through no fault of their own.   Myself and all six brothers and sisters of mine got through college  [[Page S1860]]  thanks to Federal loans and aid programs. I know how much of a  difference the President's plan for debt relief will make for people. I  know President Biden did the right thing here for borrowers and for our  economy. This is not a handout. It is a hand up that will benefit  everyone.   So I urge my colleagues today to vote against this resolution that  would needlessly hurt millions of hard-working Americans, and let's  work together then to fix this broken student loan system in this  country.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, first of all, let me acknowledge the  final comments from the Senator from Oklahoma.   Thank you for making us all pause and remember that important time  and important lessons that we all need to have learned from here. Thank  you very much.                                 Debt Ceiling    Mr. President, like so many of my colleagues, I spent last week back  home hearing from folks in my State. Everywhere I went, I heard from  people about how the investments that we make here in Congress actually  matter in their daily lives; how the funding that we provide from here  helps students at Lake Washington Institute of Technology in Kirkland  pursue their dreams and get a higher education and find a good-paying  job. It helps entrepreneurs in Tacoma start a business and grow it from  the ground up. It helps pregnant moms who rely on the Rainier Valley  Midwives Center to get the care they need to have a healthy pregnancy.   I saw how our Federal investments make cutting-edge biomedical  research possible at the Allen Institute in Seattle, leading to  breakthroughs that save lives and give people more time with their  loved ones.   Again and again, I heard about the resources that we send back home  pay off in a truly meaningful way. And it is true: The investments we  make in our country are critical. They are critical in helping our  families succeed; keeping our communities safe; and keeping our Nation  strong, secure, and competitive.   We aren't simply spending; we are investing. We are investing in  fighting deadly fentanyl and upgrading our crumbling infrastructure. We  are investing in keeping America on the cutting edge of clean energy  and scientific innovation. We are investing in rebuilding American  manufacturing and bringing industries of the future back home here to  our shores.   I could go on and on.   But the point is, the funding decisions we make right here in this  Chamber are not just numbers on a page. They are investments in people,  in families, in our communities, and, ultimately, in our country's  future. And they are also crucial to keeping our country secure and on  the cutting edge as competitors like the Chinese Government work hard  to outpace us.   As we all know, our adversaries are not restricting their investments  in their futures. They are not. And they are not teetering on the verge  of calamitous default for the sake of partisan politics. And, yet,  instead of listening to people back home, instead of listening to the  flashing red warning signs from our competitors, House Republicans have  been insisting on draconian cuts and harmful changes to the programs  that are a lifeline for struggling families and the lifeblood of our  global leadership.   House Republicans' push to slash this funding for key Federal  programs is alarming, and the way they have tried to make their cuts is  downright reckless. We have to be clear about what they have done here.  Instead of working through the budget and appropriations process--as we  do every year to craft our Nation's budget and determine how we spend  money--House Republicans just decided they would threaten to tank our  economy and force the United States into default to extract partisan  concessions. They have absolutely not been shy about it.   We heard from House Republican leaders and even the leader of the  Republican Party talk openly about taking our economy and the American  people ``hostage.'' That is damning--House Republicans admitting to  using the full faith and credit of the United States of America as a  political weapon.   Needless to say, that is not how this should work. Negotiating is not  one side saying: Give me everything I want or else. Negotiating is  coming to the table saying: Here are my concerns; here are my  principles; here is what I am hearing from families in my State; where  can we find common ground? That is what people elected us to do. That  is what they sent us here to do.   Frankly, that is what I think many of us here want to do. I have  heard from so many of my colleagues about their desire to return to  regular order, and I have been working with Senator Collins to do that  on the Appropriations Committee. But let's get one thing straight-- hostage-taking is not regular order. It is just not. That is not the  way we should arrive at the top lines for our spending bills. And it is  time we put an end to this dangerous brinksmanship at the next possible  opportunity by scrapping this debt ceiling and taking the threat of  default off the table once and for all. No other country handles its  credit like this.   Hostage-taking is no way to have a conversation about our Nation's  fiscal future.   And let's be clear. For House Republicans, this never was truly about  the debt anyway. Republicans added trillions to the debt under  President Trump through tax giveaways for billionaires and giant  corporations, but they refuse to even talk about asking billionaires to  pay at least as much in taxes as a firefighter or a nurse. They won't  talk about closing giant loopholes for Big Oil or Big Pharma. They  definitely won't talk about capping tax giveaways to the wealthy.  Instead, House Republicans want to give handouts to the rich and  massive corporations. They want to make life harder for struggling  families by cutting the programs they rely on and make competing  globally harder for our Nation by capping our ability to invest in our  future. They agreed to raise the debt ceiling three times under  President Trump without batting an eye, but their tune changes when a  Democrat is in the White House.   President Biden and congressional Democrats have been clear from the  outset that default is not an option and should never have been a  threat because it would be catastrophic to our Nation's economy, to the  financial security of our families, and to the stability of the global  economy. So I applaud President Biden for his laser focus on taking  default off the table.   While I know the President has pushed hard to hold the line on recent  progress and protect vulnerable people who need support and reject the  House Republicans' most extreme demands, we have to be clear-eyed and  honest about how this bill fails to meet our current moment--especially  how it will limit our ability now to make the investments we need to  strengthen our economy and invest in America's future.   I will vote for this legislation because default is not an option,  but I do so with deep concern and with a determination to prevent us  from ever being in this situation again and lessen the damage of these  cuts at every possible opportunity. That can include working with the  administration and my colleagues to consider a supplemental, but that  conversation has to consider more than just defense and Ukraine because  there are other really important priorities, like border security,  disaster relief, and other nondefense items, that we should not let be  shortchanged.   This is absolutely not a bill I would have written, and the fact that  the choice here is between a bill that cuts resources for American  families or trashing the Nation's credit and causing a global economic  meltdown is an indictment of House Republicans, who decided taking our  Nation's credit hostage was an acceptable thing to do.  [[Page S1874]]    Understand that the programs being cut make a real difference in  people's lives. I know that firsthand. I am someone who grew up knowing  what it meant to get by on a tight, tight budget. I had a big family-- six brothers and sisters. My dad was a World War II veteran. He ran a  mom-and-pop store on Main Street, selling everyday goods in Bothell,  WA. We never had a lot, but we always got by, and a lot of times, that  was because our government had our backs.   When my dad got sick and was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, my  mom had to figure out how to support seven kids and find a job that  would make that possible. A Federal workforce training program helped  her get a job as a bookkeeper to keep my family afloat. Me and my  siblings--all seven of us--got through college thanks to Federal  assistance because our government invested in Pell grants and other  programs. My family and I had to rely on food stamps for a brief time.  We didn't go hungry because of Federal investments in nutrition.   So I will say it again. The funding decisions we make right here in  this Chamber are not just numbers on a page; the policy we write and  sign into law has a direct consequence on people's lives, and every  Member of Congress needs to recognize that.   So rest assured I remain very focused on keeping our appropriations  process moving forward here in the Senate, marking up our spending  bills in a timely, bipartisan way. I want to make it clear right here  on the Senate floor that I will be doing absolutely everything I can to  protect the investments that help those families get by and ensure that  this great country lives up to its promise, from childcare, to housing,  to lifesaving research, and more. As chair of the Senate Appropriations  Committee, I will be a voice for working families in my home State and  all across the country.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Senator's  amendment, which would lead to more reckless brinkmanship, more  arbitrary cuts by permanently rescinding 1 percent of discretionary  appropriations every 30 days during a debt limit crisis. This makes no  sense. Rewarding brinkmanship by slashing funding that our families and  our communities and our troops depend on is an absolutely dangerous way  to govern.   Members on both sides of the aisle come to the floor to air  legitimate grievances about this process and the outcome and this debt  limit deal. Nobody likes the position we are in today--nobody. Passing  this amendment would prove we have learned nothing.   We do not need to create new opportunities for hostage-taking and  cuts that would seriously undermine our economy, our families, our  future, and our global leadership. We just need to do our job. Right  now, we have to pass this bill to avoid a catastrophic default.   I will be voting no. I urge my colleagues to do the same.    Madam President, I rise in opposition to the Senator's  amendment.   Our defense spending is critical, but so are our investments to  combat fentanyl; rebuild American manufacturing, especially for things  like chips; improve access to childcare, early learning, and a lot  more. We cannot shortchange our investments in families and our  country's future, and the underlying bill will already force painful  cuts.   This amendment would make it so the consequences of failing to pass  our appropriations bills falls heavily on our nondefense programs, and  that will hurt our families across the country. Let me be clear. We  will not let that happen.   None of us want to end up in a situation where we have a CR in the  first place. That is exactly why I am committed to making sure that we  write the strongest 12 funding bills possible and get them passed in a  timely way.   This amendment will set us back even further and target the programs  that are a lifeline for working people in this country.   I urge my colleagues to vote no.                          Vote on Amendment No. 106
