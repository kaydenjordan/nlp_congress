 Mr. Speaker, I strongly support S.J. Res. 9,  which disapproves of the disastrous rule submitted by the Biden  administration to re-list the lesser prairie-chicken under the  Endangered Species Act.   This is another example of the Biden administration's blatant  disregard for rural America in order to push Green New Deal initiatives  and appease the radical environmentalists.   For nearly a decade, the lesser prairie-chicken population has been  on the rebound due to voluntary conservation efforts of farmers and  ranchers in the Texas panhandle. This new rule disregards these efforts  and empowers bureaucrats, who have no local knowledge of farming or  ranching, to micromanage the grazing plans of responsible landowners in  my district.   This listing is a shortsighted effort that will have little benefit  in increasing the lesser prairie-chicken population but will have a  devastating effect on my district, our Nation's energy production, and  the agricultural industry as a whole.  [[Page H4046]]    Make no mistake, this effort by the Biden administration is about  destroying the agriculture industry and the livelihoods of those who  depend on it.   It is time we stopped this destructive overreach by the Federal  Government and protect our farmers and ranchers.
