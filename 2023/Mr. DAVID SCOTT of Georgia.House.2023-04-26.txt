 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I stand here to make a passionate plea to my Republican  friends. Yes, we have to pay our debt, but we do not need to deal with  this, putting it on the backs of the poor, our children, our veterans.  We must stand down. It is a national security issue.   We must incorporate getting food to our veterans when 11.7 percent of  our veterans live in food-scarce communities and households. Let me  just sum it up and say that if Caesar were here, he would say the words  that he said to Brutus: Brutus, yours is the meanest cut of all.   We cannot put this on the backs of our children, our grandchildren,  our seniors, and our veterans. I plead with you in the words of Caesar  and God almighty because if we do not, it is ungodly.
