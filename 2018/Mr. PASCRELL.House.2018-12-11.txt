 Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 6615, the Traumatic  Brain Injury Program Reauthorization Act of 2018, and I also would like  to thank Chairman Walden and Ranking Member Pallone for their work to  move this important legislation forward. I am grateful to House  leadership for bringing this for a vote. I want to associate myself  with the words of Mr. Burgess and Mr. Green.    Mr. Speaker, I commend Congressman Green and Congressman Burgess for  their steadfast work to improve our Nation's health landscape over the  past several decades, and especially during Mr. Green's tenure on the  Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee. How time flies.   I would also like to give a special thanks to my colleague, Tom  Rooney, who sponsored this legislation with me. Congressman Rooney has  been a great partner as my co-chair of the Congressional Traumatic  Brain Injury Task Force. Over 20 years ago, Mr. Speaker, we put  together the task force on a bipartisan basis, and it is still going,  and it is still very, very active.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman for all he has done for  Americans living with brain injuries during his time in Congress.   I am glad to see this body come together in a bipartisan manner to  support the work being done in our Federal agencies and across the  country to expand research and prevention in the treatment of traumatic  brain injury.   Traumatic brain injury knows no bounds. It affects people of all  backgrounds and every ZIP Code. We are only at the precipice of  understanding how prevalent that is. The passage of this legislation  will fulfill a very critical obligation to Americans living with brain  injuries, including our servicemembers, our athletes, and our children.   This reauthorization is especially important because it includes for  the first time funding for the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention so that they can determine how many Americans have sustained  a brain injury. This will give us critical insight into the problem.   Dubbed the signature injury of servicemembers returning from Iraq and  Afghanistan, TBI has continued to occur on the battlefield. TBI happens  on the sports field as well, and we are working diligently to address  this.   We have come a long way to improve safety screening and rehab since  we first talked about TBI two decades ago, but much more must be done.  This legislation makes the right investments in our Federal and State  TBI initiatives; provides those living with brain injuries the supports  that they need, and when we are supporting the brain injured, we are  also supporting their families. It includes critical increases in  funding and modernizes how the government oversees TBI.   Our legislation is endorsed by the Brain Injury Association of  America, the National Association of State Head Injury Administrators,  and the American Academy of Neurology.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working with Congressman Rooney, the  membership of the Congressional Brain Injury Task Force, as well as  Senator Casey and Senator Hatch to send this legislation swiftly to the  President's desk.                                time  1400
