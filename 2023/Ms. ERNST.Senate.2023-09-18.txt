 Madam President, as ranking member of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  an outstanding Iowa small business that exemplifies the American  entrepreneurial spirit. This week, it is my privilege to recognize WW  Homestead Dairy of Waukon, IA, as the Senate Small Business of the  Week.   Founded by Tom and Paul Weighner and Tom Walleser in 2011, WW  Homestead Dairy is a creamery that features a retail shop in Waukon,  IA. With over 90 years of dairy industry experience between the three  founders, WW Homestead Dairy offers nonhomogenized milk, butter, cheese  curds, and block cheddar cheese. The cheese curds are available in nine  flavors and are made, along with the block cheddar cheese, by creamery  manager Bruce Snitker. For ice cream options, they offer over 30  flavors with 16 dipping options. WW Homestead also has a rotating menu  of seasonal ice cream flavors, and the ice cream is made fresh once a  week.   WW Homestead Dairy supports the Northeast Iowa community. In the  past, they have hosted a chili cook-off to benefit vocational education  training at Waukon High School and coordinated the Cheese Curds for  Schools fundraiser. They also host a ``Drive-In Moo-vie'' night during  the summer and the annual Corn Days Car Show. In 2023, the Corn Days  Car Show celebrated its 10th anniversary, and WW Homestead Dairy  celebrated its 12th business anniversary.   WW Homestead Dairy's dairy products have also been recognized, with  their cheese curds sweeping the top three prizes at the 2022 Iowa  Quality Dairy Products competition. Their best-of-show ranch  peppercorn, second-place grilled steak and onion, and the third-place  white cheddar cheese curds were all on display at the State fair. In  the same competition, they also took home best of show'' and second  place in the Cow Cheese category with their Chipotle Morita cheddar and  medium cheddar respectively. Finally, in 2021, at the World Dairy Expo,  their chocolate milk tied for second in the skim chocolate milk class.   WW Homestead Dairy's commitment to providing high-quality dairy  products in Waukon, IA, is clear. I want to congratulate Tom and Paul  Weighner, Tom Walleser, and the entire team at WW Homestead Dairy for  their dedication to the Waukon community. I look forward to seeing  their continued growth and success in Iowa.                            ____________________
