 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of  H.R. 79, the Helping Angels Lead Our Startups Act. This important  legislation has the ability to produce real results that Congress  continually promises their constituents.   When I decided to seek office, a major driving force was the  governmental overreach that I saw at home in west Tennessee. The  financial crisis of 2008 crushed the middle class and lower classes  across America.   West Tennesseans were hit hard. Far too many faced unemployment,  struggled to pay their bills, and lost their homes and businesses that  meant everything to their livelihoods. There has been no doubt that it  has been a slow recovery under these last 8 years. Thankfully, many  areas of the country have begun to bounce back.   West Tennessee, my home, still needs strong workforce development so  we, too, can bounce back. As I traveled throughout the Eighth District  of Tennessee last year, I met amazing people, great Americans who were  ready to work hard to provide for their families and for their  communities. Too often, I heard stories of burdensome mandates and  regulations that are preventing these hardworking Tennesseans from  moving forward.   With this legislation, we can keep our promise to help alleviate the  burden of Federal regulations on small businesses. There is no doubt  that angel investors are the backbone of startups; and unless we find a  solution to unreasonable restrictions, small businesses could continue  to suffer as they struggle to compete with large, established  companies.   We need to keep our promise to the American people. We need to focus  on creating good-paying jobs. And I believe that this bipartisan  legislation is a step in the right direction.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this important legislation.
