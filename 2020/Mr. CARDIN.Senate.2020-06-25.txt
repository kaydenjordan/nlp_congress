 Mr. President, this Sunday, we will mark a grim  anniversary. On June 28, 2018, a 38-year-old man who held a longtime  grudge against the Capital Gazette newspaper in Annapolis, MD, for  reporting about him, made good on his sworn threats. He entered the  newspaper's office, headed to the newsroom, and deliberately shot and  killed five employees of this community newspaper.   The Capital Gazette is the local paper of record in Annapolis. It is  one of the oldest continuously published newspapers in the United  States. It traces its roots back to the Maryland Gazette, which began  publishing in 1727, and the Capital, which was founded in 1884.   Two years later, the senseless loss of life remains so personal to so  many people in Annapolis and around the State. You need to understand  that the Capital Gazette is as much a part of the fabric of Annapolis  as the State government that it covers better than anyone in the  business. Today, it still carries out that mission better than anyone  else, with an added priority of covering the gun violence that  continues to plague this country and efforts to reduce gun violence and  increase public safety.   As I did 2 years ago, I want to take a moment to mourn those we lost  and to thank the first responders who appeared on the scene literally  60 seconds after the 9-1-1 call. On this day 2 years ago, Anne Arundel  County police officers happened to be down the street from the offices  when the shooting started. Their location and fast response most  definitely saved lives.   According to Anne Arundel Police Chief Timothy Altomare, within 2  minutes, the Anne Arundel County Police Department, the Annapolis  Police Department, and the Anne Arundel Sheriff's Office rushed into  the offices and into the newsroom and apprehended the gunman.  [[Page S3299]]    State and Federal law enforcement personnel from the Federal Bureau  of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco Firearms, and  Explosives and many other agencies quickly arrived to support local  officials in their efforts to clear the building and meticulously  investigate the scene.   I want to thank, again, Chief Altomare and every one of those law  enforcement officers who did their job and contributed to the emergency  response. I want to acknowledge, again, the victims.   Gerald Fischman, 61, was an editor with more than 25 years of service  with the Capital Gazette, well known at the newspaper and throughout  the community for his brilliant mind and writing. Most often, it was  his voice and his insightfulness that came through on the editorial  pages of the Capital Gazette.   Rick Hutzell, the Capital Gazette's editor, described Fischman as  ``someone whose life was committed to protecting our community by  telling hard truths.''   Rob Hiaasen, 59, was a columnist, editor, teacher, and storyteller  who brought compassion and humor to his community-focused reporting.  Rob was a coach and a mentor to many. According to the former Baltimore  Sun columnist Susan Reimer, he was ``so happy working with young  journalists. . . . He wanted to create a newsroom where everyone was  growing.''   John McNamara, age 56, was a skilled writer and avid sports fan. He  combined these passions in his 24-year career as a sports reporter at  the Capital Gazette. Former Capital Gazette sports editor Gerry  Jackson, when remembering ``Mac,'' said:         He could write. He could edit. He could design pages. He       was just a jack of all trades and a fantastic person.    Rebecca Smith, age 34, was a newly hired sales assistant known for  her kindness, compassion, and love for her family. A friend of her  fiance described ``Becca'' as ``the absolute most beautiful person''  with the ``biggest heart'' and called her death ``a great loss to this  world.''   Wendi Winters, age 65, was a talented writer, who built her career as  a public relations professional and journalist, well known for her  profound reporting on the lives and achievements of people within the  community. She was a ``proud Navy Mom'' and Navy daughter. Wendi saved  lives during the attack. She confronted and distracted the gunman,  throwing whatever she could find around her at him.   As the newspaper noted:         Wendi died protecting her friends, but also in defense of       her newsroom from a murderous assault. Wendi died protecting       freedom of the press.    My heartfelt condolences and prayers go out to the families of these  five wonderful people.   The surviving staff members also deserve our continued prayers and  praise for their resilience and dedication to their mission as  journalists. During and after the attack, staff continued to report by  tweet, sharing information to those outside, taking photos and  documenting information as they would any other crime scene. Despite  their grief, shock, anger, and mourning, the surviving staff--with the  help of their sister publication the Baltimore Sun, Capital Gazette  alum, and other reporters who wanted to lend a hand to fellow  journalists--put out a paper the next morning, as they have done every  day since.   The staff fittingly left the editorial page blank the day after the  shooting, but for these few words:         Today, we are speechless. This page is intentionally left       blank to commemorate the victims of Thursday's shootings at       our office.    The staff promised that on Saturday, the page would ``return to its  steady purpose of offering our readers informed opinion about the world  around them, that they may be better citizens.'' And they carried that  out.   Our Constitution, which establishes the rule of law in this country,  grants us certain rights and responsibilities. Freedom of the press,  central to the very First Amendment of the Constitution, has often been  under attack, figuratively speaking, since our Nation's founding.  Today, those attacks have become more frequent, and they are not just  figurative anymore. They are physical. These attacks are spurred on by  dangerous rhetoric that has created an open season on the media for  doing its job--asking questions that need to be asked, investigating  stories that need to be investigated, and bringing needy transparency  to the halls of power, whether they are in Annapolis, Washington, DC,  or anywhere in this country.   In 2018, after the shooting at the Capital Gazette, the United States  was, for the first time, added to the list of ``the most deadly  countries for journalists'' in an annual report by the group Reporters  Without Borders.   President Trump's rhetoric--calling the media ``a stain on America''  and the ``enemy of the American people''--certainly has been harmful. I  have said this before and I will keep saying it: The President's  language is dangerous. It has gone beyond the pale, and he needs to  stop it.   As Jason Rezaian wrote in the Washington Post after the Capital  Gazette shooting, Donald Trump ``didn't create the problem of hostility  to journalists, but he exploits and exacerbates it.''   He went on to say:         That's true, too, of the leaders in other countries who       routinely call reporters enemies of the state, terrorists and       national security threats. And we must be vigilant to       standing up to these empty accusations.    In the United States, physical attacks on media have grown so  troublesome that the Committee to Protect Journalists, an independent  nonprofit that promotes freedoms globally, actually started a U.S.  freedom tracker to show the scope of the problem. So far, in 2020,  there have been 107 journalists attacked and 36 arrested in the United  States.   Instead of attacking the free press, we need to be honoring it.  Toward that end, I have introduced a bill, S. 1969, to establish the  fallen journalists memorial here in Washington, DC. I am pleased that  the Natural Resources Committee ordered the bill to be reported  favorably by voice vote. The changes the committee made reflected input  from stakeholders, including the National Park Service, which supports  the bill.   The legislation is bipartisan, noncontroversial, and does not impose  any additional costs on taxpayers. The memorial will serve as a fitting  tribute to the Capital Gazette staff and to all journalists who have  died in the line of duty and to our Nation's commitment to the free  press.   My hope is that we will all agree that building a new memorial to  honor the fallen victims is appropriate and should be done and should  be passed.   As Walter Cronkite remarked, ``Freedom of the press is not just  important to democracy, it is democracy.''   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
