 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, obviously, a big problem before the  country right now is, What do we do about rising healthcare premiums?   What we know under the Affordable Care Act--or the un-Affordable Care  Act--or ObamaCare, as some call it, is that premiums are rising more  and more. One of President Trump's campaign pledges was that premiums  would come down and, actually, come down with, as he said in one place,  beautiful coverage--that it is actually good coverage and premiums are  lower. So let's kind of set the stage.   I just got a message on my Facebook page. I will read it. By the way,  anybody can post on our Facebook page these sorts of stories, if they  are interested in them.   Brian from Louisiana sent a message saying: My family plan is $1700 a  month for me, my wife, and two children--so roughly about $20,000 a  year. The ACA, or the Affordable Care Act, has brought me to my knees.  I hope you can get something done as my credit cards are all maxed out.  And 80 percent of my friends are in the same situation. The middle  class is dwindling away. Can everyone just come together and figure  this out?   Think about this: $1,700 a month. He did not write this, but what  would be standard for this sort of policy is a $13,000 family  deductible.   I say that because I have an acquaintance in San Francisco. San  Francisco is so expensive for housing, transportation, and food, and  the premium for their young family is $20,000 a year, with each family  member with their own separate $6,000 deductible. This is under the un- Affordable Care Act, as I call it, or the Affordable Care Act, as  others do.   A friend of mine back in Baton Rouge, whom I have quoted many times,  put this on my Facebook page because people would not believe it: He  and his wife, 60 and 61, their quote for their insurance last year was  $39,000. Their quote for their insurance was $39,000.   Then I spoke to a fellow who is an insurance consultant here in  Washington, DC--an insurance consultant. If anyone can get their  premiums down, it would be he. For his family, their premium is $24,000  a year with a $13,000 family deductible. If they get in a car wreck,  their family will be out $37,000 before the insurance kicks in. Who can  afford this? We must do something better.  [[Page S3089]]    When President Trump ran for office, President Trump clearly  recognized this. On the campaign trail, he said over and over that he  wished to lower premiums. It is the President's genius, if you will,  that he knew how to do so. You do so by expanding the risk pool. He  said he wanted to continue coverage for all.   He gets away from the ObamaCare mandates, which people hate. The  American people don't like being told what to do.   He also said he would care for those with preexisting conditions.  This is how it works. When you cover many, you have a bigger risk pool.  Those with preexisting conditions have the cost of their illness spread  out over the many. So premiums come down for all.   My hat is off to the President for coming up with that. In fact, 5  days before he was sworn in, he echoed this, because one way to lower  premiums is to give poor coverage. One way to lower premiums is to give  folks such terrible coverage that it doesn't cost anything. On the  other hand, it doesn't cover anything. The President seems to know  this.   Five days before he was inaugurated, he said to the Washington Post  about people covered under his replacement for ObamaCare:         [They] can expect to have great healthcare. It will be in a       much simplified form. Much less expensive and much better.        We're going to have insurance for everybody. There was a       philosophy in some circles that if you can't pay for it, you       don't get it. That's not going to happen with us.    I am a physician, a doctor. Again, I admire President Trump's  insights. As a physician, I know that whoever wants healthcare gets  healthcare. Twenty or so years ago, Congress said that if you walk into  an emergency room, the emergency room has to take care of you. It  doesn't matter if you are an American citizen. It doesn't matter how  much it costs. The hospital has to take care of you.   I told folks when I was practicing--it would be the middle of the  night--that as long as that emergency room was open--and it was open  24/7--in through the door came folks vomiting blood, heart failure  patients, folks with drug overdoses, schizophrenics, diabetics,  asthmatics--you name it. They came through that door, and we cared for  them all--and somebody paid.   President Trump understands that even if you say you can't afford it,  everybody is going to be treated. That is our current system, and that  is not going to happen under his watch.   We mentioned that one way to lower premiums is to give poor coverage.  I think everyone knows, or many people know, of Mr. Kimmel, the late  night comedian who pointed out that when his child was born, instead of  celebrating and handing the baby to the mother so the mother could kiss  and the father, Mr. Kimmel, could cuddle the baby, the nurses and the  doctors looked at the baby and immediately recognized that something  was wrong. They recognized that this child was blue. He didn't have  oxygen, and if something wasn't done immediately, this child would die.   Folks criticized Mr. Kimmel for being emotional. I totally get it.  Instead of cuddling, you are signing a release waiver so your child can  be transferred across the city of Los Angeles for emergency surgery. In  his emotion, he asked that all children--and I would expand to all  Americans--have the ability to get that sort of emergency care done.   Again, the President was about that. I came up with what I called the  Kimmel test. Again, it echoes President Trump's contract with the  American voter--that we would protect those with preexisting  conditions, that we lower premiums, but as we lower premiums, we make  sure that the coverage is adequate.   The Kimmel test, making sure there is adequate coverage while  lowering premiums and caring for those with preexisting conditions, is  so compatible with what President Trump said, because Americans need  lower premiums.   Let me echo that one more time. We need to lower premiums. The  President's approach, the contract he made with the voters on the  campaign trail, is the right approach. You get a bigger risk pool, lots  of younger people, so those who are older and sicker have the cost of  their care spread out among the many.   We have a plan, the Cassidy-Collins plan, or the Patient Freedom Act,  which I introduced with Senator Susan Collins and four other Senators.  We have a way to go about it. One way to get young, healthy folks  involved is to do something that we do on Medicare. If you are  eligible, you are enrolled unless you call up and say you don't want to  be. That is what we do with Medicare. By the way, that is what Fortune  500 companies do with their employees for 401(k) plans, and it works  really well.   Ninety-five percent of employees are likely to participate in a  401(k), and they love it. As to people on Medicare, 99 percent stay on  Medicare, and 1 percent call up and say: I don't want it. Usually they  have better coverage someplace else. As a rule, no one feels coerced  because they all know they can call up and say: I don't want it; I  don't get it. As it turns out, most do.   The plan we have taken with Cassidy-Collins, in our attempt to  fulfill President Trump's contract with the American voter, is that we  allow a State to automatically enroll for this, and you would be in.  The credit you receive would be sufficient to pay for the annual  premium.   If you don't want it, call up. Make it easy. Get out of here. I don't  want it.   As a rule, we think folks would be in. By doing this, you expand that  risk pool so those old and sicker, those with preexisting conditions,  can have their conditions cared for, but we fulfill President Trump's  campaign pledge. We also lowered those premiums.   Ultimately, to lower the cost of insurance, you have to lower the  cost of healthcare. Cassidy-Collins does that with some conservative  approaches that even liberals will like. One way is that we put in what  is called price transparency. You would know the price. A mother would  know the price of a procedure--an x-ray, a blood test--before she gets  it for her daughter, as opposed to finding out 6 months later when she  gets the final bill.   Let me give one example. We have all seen those urgent care centers.  Some are run by hospitals. Typically, a visit there will cost you $500  to $1,500. Others are run by a group of physicians, or maybe a small  business decides to set up an urgent care center. The same visit might  cost you as little as $75 to $150. The patient doesn't know that until  she gets the bill.   One door has exactly the same appearance and exactly the same type of  facility with the same capabilities. In one door and it can cost $500  to $1,500, and in the other door and it can cost $75 to $150, and the  patient never knows.   I think we can lower the cost of healthcare by giving the patient the  power of knowing what is the price of healthcare.   Think of it. You walk up to a French restaurant in a city you are not  familiar with, and you look at the menu posted on the door. You see the  prices of the food. Oh, the food is pretty good, but look how expensive  it is. Let me go down the street. You go down the street. The food  looks good, and it is less expensive.   The power of price informs the patient of what is the best deal for  both our health and for our pocketbook. One way we can lower the cost  of health insurance is by lowering the cost of healthcare. There are  other ways of doing so as well.   Let me return once more to what I said earlier. Americans need lower  premiums. President Trump, during the campaign--his contract with the  voter, I think, is the right approach to get there.   I will summarize with this. He said he wanted to maintain coverage  for those who have insurance, lower premiums, that preexisting  conditions would be cared for, and eliminate the ObamaCare mandates. If  we fulfill President Trump's goals--and these are goals that folks on  the right and left can get behind. By the way, if we do get behind  them, premiums will be lower. If we can fulfill President Trump's  campaign contract with the American voter, we will lower those  premiums, and we will do so by achieving these other great goals.   I yield back.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
