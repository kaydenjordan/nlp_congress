 Madam Speaker, I rise in outrage that extreme  Republicans seek to control women and their most intimate healthcare  decisions by banning abortions. These cruel efforts will hurt the  already vulnerable women in our communities the most, especially poor  women.   Madam Speaker, there are more than 800,000 women of reproductive age  with incomes under 100 percent of poverty who live in States that  haven't expanded Medicaid.   These women are being left without access to comprehensive healthcare  coverage, and now many are being stripped of their abortion rights.  These women are less likely to access birth control, will struggle to  receive wellness exams, and now will not have access to abortion.   This is the vision Republicans have for America. This is what the  rightwing wants. Well, I won't stand by quietly, and Democrats will not  stand by quietly. I plan to fight for women because I trust women to  make their most personal, intimate healthcare decisions.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for including  my two amendments in this en bloc.   Madam Speaker, I rise in support of two of my amendments that are  included in this en bloc. The first authorizes Federal funds for two  grant programs under the Maritime Administration.   My amendment focuses on the often overlooked but critical maritime  industry. It is especially important to my district, which includes the  Maritime Center of Excellence campus and the Port of Houston.   My amendment authorizes $30 million for a grant program to colleges  which offer high-quality maritime workforce education and training  programs. It also authorizes $30 million for the small shipyard grant  program which supports training programs for shipbuilding and ship  repair workers.   Congress must support the next generation of maritime workers, and  Congress must support our supply chain workers. This amendment does  that. It is just that simple.   The second amendment I led supports a pilot program on the sharing of  suspicious financial activity. This pilot program allows financial  institutions to share any suspicious information with their foreign  branches, subsidiaries, and affiliates. Put simply, this program is  designed to promote transparency and prevent illegal financial  activity. It became law as part of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of  2020 included in the NDAA. Currently this pilot program is authorized  for 3 years with a start date of January of 2021. Regrettably, the  program is yet to begin.   With the adoption of my amendment, which is just a technical fix, the  pilot program will be authorized for 3 years following its actual  inception. This allows ample time to implement and to also measure its  success.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the en bloc amendments  and the underlying bill.    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend and colleague,  Mr. Green, for his leadership on this very important amendment.   I am not shocked by this amendment. I am pleased with this amendment.  This is something that is desperately needed because this amendment  would permanently authorize the Community Development Block Grant  Disaster Recovery Program.   This important program does provide States and communities like mine  in Houston with flexible, long-term recovery resources for building  affordable housing and infrastructure after a disaster.   This amendment would ensure that these essential services go to the  most deserving communities, those hit hardest by a disaster. It builds  safeguards to ensure that funds are not diverted away from the lowest- income survivors.   Further, it reforms disaster recovery allocation formulas and  protocols to ensure equity, prioritizes transparency and oversight and  discovery, disaster recovery, protects civil rights in fair housing,  and supports disaster mitigation efforts.   Mr. Green and my hometown of Houston is no stranger to disasters, and  Mr. Speaker, I would submit that if the folks on the other side of the  aisle think that this is not a good program, and they don't want the  dollars because it takes too long to get them, we will gladly accept  them in Houston because we get hit almost every year or every other  year. We get hit hard, and we get hit in the most vulnerable  populations.   So, again, I urge support of this amendment, and I urge all my  colleagues to do the same.                                time  0120
