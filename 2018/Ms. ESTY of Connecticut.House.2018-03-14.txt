 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the STOP  School Violence Act. Mark Barden and Nicole Hockley each had a child  killed in the first grade classroom at Sandy Hook Elementary School in  the district where I live 5 years ago. They and other parents took  their grief and formed a group called the Sandy Hook Promise. That  group has been working tirelessly for over 5 years now, and the bill we  address here today is largely a testament to the hard work that they  have put in working with mental health professionals, school officials,  and law enforcement to come up with real steps that will help save  lives.   The STOP School Violence Act will not save every life threatened by  gun violence, but it will save some, and we need to do what we can. But  let me be very clear. This needs to be the first step of many steps we  can and should be taking in this House to address the scourge of gun  violence. We have enormous support for bipartisan comprehensive  background checks, for a Fix NICS bill, and for banning of bump stocks.  This needs to be the first of a long line of steps that this Congress  owes to the American people and owes to the students gathered on the  lawn of the Capitol today and in every classroom throughout America.
