 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 7214, the Cybersecurity Education Integration Act.   As co-chair of the House Career and Technical Education Caucus, I am  proud that we continue to provide the resources necessary to have a  dominant and prosperous workforce. For instance, this past June, we  reauthorized the Carl D. Perkins Act to advance career and technical  Education.   We must continue developing a 21st century workforce to meet the  technical demands our country is facing now and in the future. That is  why, together with my friend, Congressman Langevin, we introduced a  bill to help protect sensitive data and our critical infrastructure  from bad actors.   Our legislation directs the Department of Education to create a  competitive grant program to integrate cybersecurity education into new  and established CTE programs. With over 16 critical infrastructure  sectors in our country, we must prepare our next generation of learners  to have the most sophisticated and comprehensive educational programs  to protect our Nation's most dire assets, systems, and networks.    I encourage my colleagues to support this bill and thank Mr. Langevin  for his work and leadership on this issue.                            ____________________
