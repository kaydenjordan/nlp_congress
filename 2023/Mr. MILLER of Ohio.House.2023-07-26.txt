 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the 50th  anniversary of the annual Blue Tip Festival in Wadsworth, Ohio.   The Blue Tip Festival is a longstanding community celebration. The  festival's name pays tribute to the city's former largest employer, the  Ohio Match Company and their famous blue tip matches.   Each year, the Blue Tip Festival begins the Tuesday after Father's  Day with a 2\1/2\-mile parade. The parade leads to the ceremonial  lighting of a 17-foot blue tip match sculpture that holds the record  for the world's largest matchstick sculpture. The next 5 days are  filled with family fun like amusement rides, carnival games, festival  food, and more.   I commend the city of Wadsworth and the Blue Tip Festival Committee  for their commitment to make the Blue Tip Festival one of the best  celebrations in Ohio's Seventh District. Year after year, their  dedication has created a space for our community to recognize and enjoy  Ohio's rich history. Here is to another safe and fun 50 years of the  Blue Tip Festival.                            ____________________
