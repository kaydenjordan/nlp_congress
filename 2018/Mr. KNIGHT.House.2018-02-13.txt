 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4376, the  Department of Energy Research Infrastructure Act of 2018.   This legislation authorizes important upgrades to DOE light sources  that support the research infrastructure needed to conduct leading  initiatives in chemistry, physics, biology, medicine, and  manufacturing. In addition, this bill authorizes a unique user facility  that will allow researchers to study rare isotopes and their  properties. These upgrades at DOE's best-in-the-world user facilities  will facilitate discovery science and bring the best and brightest  scientists in the world to the U.S.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Smith and the Energy  Subcommittee for introducing this important legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3397) to direct the National Science Foundation to support  STEM education research focused on early childhood, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3397         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Building Blocks of STEM       Act''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         The Congress finds the following:        (1) The National Science Foundation has made the largest       financial investment in STEM education of all Federal       agencies, and plays a very powerful role in helping to set       research and policy agendas.        (2) Studies have found that children who engage in       scientific activities from an early age develop positive       attitudes toward science and are more likely to pursue STEM       expertise and careers later on.        (3) However, the majority of current research focuses on       increasing STEM opportunities for students in middle school       and older.        (4) Women remain widely underrepresented in the STEM       workforce and this gender disparity extends down through all       levels of education. Strategic funding of programs is needed       in order to understand and address the root cause of this       gap.       SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.         In this Act:        (1) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of       the National Science Foundation.        (2) Early childhood.--The term ``early childhood'' applies       to children from birth through the age of 10.        (3) Institution of higher education.--The term       ``institution of higher education'' has the meaning given the       term in section 101(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965       (20 U.S.C. 1001(a)).        (4) Local educational agency.--The term ``local educational       agency'' has the meaning given the term in section 8101 of       the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 USC       7801), except that such term also includes preschools, after-      school programs, and summer programs.        (5) STEM.--The term ``STEM'' has the meaning given the term       in section 2 of the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of       2010 (42 U.S.C. 6621 note).

SEC. 6. COMPUTER SCIENCE IN THE ROBERT NOYCE TEACHER                     SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM.         Section 10 of the National Science Foundation Authorization       Act of 2002 (42 U.S.C. 1862n-1) is amended--        (1) by striking ``and mathematics'' each place it appears       and inserting ``mathematics, informatics, and computer       science'';        (2) in subsection (a)(3)(B), by striking ``or mathematics''       and inserting ``mathematics, informatics, and computer       science'';        (3) in subsections (b)(1)(D)(i), (c)(1)(A), (d)(1), and       (i)(7), by striking ``or mathematics'' each place it appears       and inserting ``mathematics, informatics, or computer       science''; and        (4) in subsection (i)(5), by striking ``or mathematics''       and inserting ``mathematics, or computer science''.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 3397, as amended, the bill now  under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on an  important policy to improve our Nation's STEM education.   H.R. 3397 is a bipartisan bill that I am proud to sponsor with Ms.  Rosen, and it fits in with a larger set of education and workforce  improvement legislation the Science, Space, and Technology Committee  has recently reported to address critical challenges to our STEM  workforce.   Investing in our children and their futures is always an opportunity  for good. Strategically expanding the reach of our STEM education  programs to children of all ages will improve more individuals with  aptitude are engaged and stay on their educational path.   Research shows that kids as young as 1, 2, or 3 are capable of  absorbing STEM concepts. And any parent can tell you that shortly after  kids learn to talk, the questions can be endless. Children have a  natural curiosity that can be fostered into an interest in science,  technology, engineering, math, and computer science.   This bill directs NSF to more equitably allocate funding for research  in studies that focus on early childhood. Investing in children early  ensures we are laying the groundwork to develop young innovators in  STEM.   I would like to thank Ms. Rosen for her work on the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Smith), who is the chairman of the  [[Page H1099]]  Science, Space, and Technology Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, investing and encouraging early education in STEM are  needs that we know are here now and even more in the future. I want to  thank Ms. Rosen for her leadership in this role. It is absolutely  something that is bipartisan. It is something that Congress is behind.    I can tell you, just on a personal note, Lancaster High School came  out with their robotics team more than a decade ago, 100 percent boys.  Just a short period after that, about 4 or 5 years, they were 50  percent girls, 50 percent boys, and they were winning awards all over  the country. That was because we had great teachers there who pushed  and made sure that girls knew that they could be on the robotics team  and pulled them in. That is exactly what we are talking about:  investing and encouraging.   I urge passage of this good bill. This is bipartisan.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
