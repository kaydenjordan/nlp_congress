 Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Johnson and Ranking  Member Lucas for their extraordinary bipartisan leadership on these  bills. These two bills recognize the urgency of Federal scientific  investment.   Over the past few decades, Federal spending on R&D flatlined as a  share of our economy, and it has fallen in absolute terms. Meanwhile,  global competitors jump-started their economic growth through such  investments that spur innovation.   Maintaining our leadership in research and development is arguably  more important than ever. Now is the time to be bold in our vision of  what is possible. We shortchange the Nation every year when we refuse  to fund a rich portfolio of research opportunities.   I want to talk about the NSF for the Future Act. It is part of the  remedy, and it strikes the appropriate balance of expanding popular and  effective projects and programs while expanding the Foundation's role  and mandate to new areas of evolving technologies.   The approach to the creation of a new directorate outlined in the  bill sets an appropriate benchmark as we engage with the Senate, and it  has received overwhelming support from the academic, scientific, and  business communities.   We need to make sure we get this right.   The bill would allow NSF to improve the speed and scale of its core  mission to advance basic and fundamental research while promoting  innovative solutions to the challenges we face as a nation.   We must support this effort, the NSF bill, as well as the Department  of Energy Science for the Future Act. I strongly urge my colleagues to  support these two pieces of legislation. I commend the committee for  its excellent work.
