G.  Russell III, a dear friend and respected entrepreneur and innovator who  called Arkansas home and built a renowned knife and cutlery business  that continues to thrive today. He passed away last month at the age of  85, leaving behind his devoted wife Goldie and many who admired and  respected him from near and afar.   A.G. Russell was born in Eudora, a small town in southeast Arkansas.  Like my own father, A.G.'s dad served in World War II, and the family  moved around several times throughout his childhood. From an early age,  he became interested in knives, so much so that he even recalled  sketching designs in the margins of his schoolbooks.   At 9 years old, A.G. made his first knife with the help of his  grandfather. He continued practicing the craft as a hobby into  adulthood and eventually turned his passion into a business that grew  exponentially, vaulting him to celebrity status among knife producers  and collectors. By the mid-1960s, Russell had set up shop in  Springdale, AR, and began a journey that would define his life's work  and calling.   What first began as an operation selling Arkansas whetstones used for  sharpening knives grew to include production of pocket knives and  cutlery, first through a mail-order operation and then expanding to  internet sales. A.G. worked tirelessly to launch the enterprise and  perfect his craft as a knifemaker, enjoying tremendous success and  always emphasizing quality over quantity. Excellent customer service  has been a hallmark of A.G. Russell Knives from day one.   A.G. was a pioneer in the industry, earning the respect and  admiration of his peers while receiving numerous awards and  recognition, including his induction into the Knife Digest Cutlery Hall  of Fame in 1974. He also helped found the Knifemakers' Guild and was  named its honorary president in 1970.   While he accomplished so much in his career, A.G. Russell also had a  big heart and enjoyed giving back. He loved Goldie. He marveled at how  quickly she learned the ins and outs of the retail knife business and  was overjoyed as she helped the company reach new heights of success.   Drawing from his own military experience and that of his dad's, A.G.  was a patriot who recognized how vital it is to support our troops. In  2004, he organized the ``War on Troop Boredom,'' an effort to provide  care packages that included books, DVDs, pocket-sized Constitutions,  and other items to servicemembers stationed in the Middle East.   No one can accuse A.G. Russell of not having lived a full life. He  built a remarkable career out of his passion, helping to reshape an  industry and become one of its icons. Through it all, he stayed humble,  genuine, and fulfilled. He perfected the craft he loved so much while  continually meeting and exceeding his customers' expectations.   We will miss A.G. terribly. His warmth and humility are sometimes  hard to come by these days. Simply put, there was no one quite like  A.G. Russell III, and we mourn this tremendous loss. His family, his  community, and the industry he stood atop of now know a void that  cannot be easily filled, if ever, but his legacy will endure for many  years to come.   I extend my sincere condolences to them and join with so many in  celebrating A.G.'s life and career. I will fondly remember his impact,  his story, and most importantly, his character and generosity as a  lasting tribute to my friend and a man I respected so much.                            ____________________
