 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I am here for my customary ``Time to  Wake Up'' speech, but before I get into it, given the events of the  day, I just want to express my satisfaction with the turn of events in  the Judiciary Committee.   As the Acting President pro tempore may know, yesterday was a rather  bitter day in the Judiciary Committee, with there being a lot of anger  and tribal belligerence and a nominee who was full of partisanship and  conspiracy theory and invective. It really was not a good day. Yet this  is a funny place, and sometimes, right after we have been at our worst,  something breaks that turns things in the right direction.   Something happened in the Judiciary Committee today, much due to the  concerns and the fortitude of Senator Flake, so I want to give him  primary credit. I understand the Republican leadership has agreed there  will be a weeklong delay in the Kavanaugh vote on the floor and that  the FBI will be given a chance to do its job and take a look at the  allegations that are out there about his conduct.   This is not only a good thing for the Senate--because I think it  releases a lot of pent-up pressure and anxiety and hostility--but it is  also a really good thing for the process because the worst possible  outcome would be that we would push this candidate through, that he  would then get on the Supreme Court, and it would be subsequently shown  that these allegations would have been, in fact, true and that he would  not have been truthful with us about it and would have lied to the  Senate. To clear as much of that cloud off of him as possible, I think,  is good for us, good for the Court, good for the country--good for all.  So, after a grim and battering day yesterday, I think we had a  productive day today. I feel I earned my pay in the Senate over in the  Judiciary Committee.                            ____________________     Mr. President, what I want to talk about is a new  form of political weapon that has emerged onto the political  battlefield in America, and it is a political weapon for which the  American system is not very well prepared yet. The new political weapon  we see is systematic and deliberate misinformation, what you might call  weaponized fake news.   Vladimir Putin's regime, in Russia, uses weaponized fake news all the  time for political influence in the former Soviet Union and the modern  European Union. Our intelligence agencies caught them using  misinformation to help Trump win the 2016 American election. Some also  is homegrown. In America, the original weaponized fake news was climate  denial, spun up by the fossil fuel industry. The fossil fuel industry  used systematic, deliberate disinformation to propagandize our politics  and fend off accountability for its pollution of our atmosphere and  oceans.   So, for both national security and political integrity reasons, we  need to better understand this misinformation weaponry. Guess what.  Science is on the case. A comprehensive array of peer-reviewed articles  appeared last year in the Journal of Applied Research in Memory and  Cognition and, I am sure, is on the Acting President pro tempore's  bedside table for light reading. Dozens of scientists contributed to  this report, and I list their names in an appendix to the speech.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my appendix be added at  the end of my speech.   What they found is interesting. One piece--tellingly subtitled  ``Understanding and Coping with the `Post-Truth' Era''--describes how  ``the World Economic Forum ranked the spread of misinformation online  as one of the 10 most significant issues facing the world''--the top  10.   ``An obvious hallmark of a post-truth world is that it empowers  people to choose their own reality, where facts and objective evidence  are trumped by existing beliefs and prejudices,'' concludes one  article--not a good thing.   This is not your grandfather's misinformation. This is not ``JFK and  Marilyn Monroe's Love Child Found in Utah Salt Mine.'' This is not  ``Aliens Abducted My Cat.'' This is not fun and entertainment. This is  also not people just being wrong. Indeed, ``misinformation in the post- truth era can no longer be considered solely an isolated failure of  individual cognition that can be corrected with appropriate  communications tools,'' they write.   In plain English, this isn't just errors; there is something bigger  going on. Scientists from Duke University agreed.   ``Rather than a series of isolated falsehoods, we are confronted with  a growing ecosystem of misinformation.''   In this ecosystem, misinformation is put to use by determined  factions.   ``The melange of anti-intellectual appeals, conspiratorial thinking,  pseudoscientific claims, and sheer propaganda circulating within  American society seems unrelenting,'' write Aaron M. McCright of  Michigan State and Riley E. Dunlap of Oklahoma State.   They note: ``Those who seek to promote systemic lies'' are ``backed  by influential economic interests or powerful state actors, both  domestic and foreign.'' Let me highlight those key phrases--``systemic  lies . . . backed by influential economic interests.'' Like I said, it  is not your grandfather's misinformation.   An author from Ohio State writes that this creates artificial  polarization in our politics that is not explained by our tribal social  media habits. His subtitle, too, is telling: ``Disinformation Campaigns  are the Problem, Not Audience Fragmentation.'' He notes these  disinformation campaigns ``are used by political strategists, private  interests, and foreign powers to manipulate people for political  gain.''   ``Strategically deployed falsehoods have played an important role in  shaping Americans' attitudes toward a variety of high-profile political  issues,'' reads another article.   In a nutshell, Americans are the subjects of propaganda warfare by  powerful economic interests.   So how is all of this misinformation deployed?   ``The insidious fallouts from misinformation are particularly  pronounced when the misinformation is packaged as a conspiracy  theory,'' they tell us--insidious, indeed. By wrapping deliberate  misinformation in conspiracy theory, the propagandist degrades the  target's defenses against correction by  [[Page S6376]]  legitimate information. Conspiracy theories, the articles notes, ``tend  to be particularly prevalent in times of economic and political  crises.''   Pulling emotional strings is another technique. Emotionally  weaponized fake news is reflected in ``the prevalence of outraged  discourse on political blogs, talk radio, and cable news.''   These powerful interests also take advantage of ``the  institutionalization of `false equivalence' in so-called mainstream  media.'' They sophisticatedly leverage media conventions to their  private advantage.   Another tactical observation: To be effective, the misinformation  campaign does not have to convince you. It can simply barrage, confuse,  and stun you.   One of these articles related the Bangor Daily News assessment of  falsehoods coming from the Trump White House: ``The idea isn't to  convince people of untrue things, it is to fatigue them, so that they  will stay out of the political province entirely, regarding the truth  as just too difficult to determine.''   This, of course, is a well-known political propaganda strategy. What  the Bangor Daily News saw, the researchers note, is ``mirrored by  analysts of Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns.''   McCright and Dunlap describe how weaponized fake news--what they call  ``the intentional promotion of misinformation''--is made into  systematic propaganda by amplification of what they call the ``powerful  conservative echo chamber.'' It is systematic, it is deliberate, and it  is supported by a purposeful private apparatus.   This brings us back to what the authors call the ``utility of  misinformation . . . to powerful political and economic interests.''  What they conclude, basically, is that the weaponization of fake news  is done for profit and with purpose. It has an apparatus of  amplification. It needn't convince but simply stun or confuse. Like an  insidious virus, it can carry its own conspiracy theory and emotional  payload countermeasures against the ordinary antibodies that ordinarily  protect us from being misled.   The scientists urge that we must examine these systematic campaigns  of false misinformation ``through the lens of political drivers that  have created an alternative epistemology that does not conform to  conventional standards of evidentiary support.''   Let's unpack that language for a minute. Let's begin with the fact  that it is ``political drivers'' that are behind the scheme. This is a  tool in a larger battle for political supremacy.   To help win this battle, political actors have ``created an  alternative epistemology,'' a separate way of looking at the world;  obviously, a way of looking at the world that aligns with their  economic interests.   That ``alternative epistemology'' is untethered from the truth. It  ``does not conform to conventional standards of evidentiary support.''  It stands on falsehood, on prejudice, and on emotion, not on fact.   What the authors call ``post-truth politics'' has motive and purpose.  They write: It is ``a rational strategy that is deployed in pursuit of  political objectives.''   In these propaganda campaigns by powerful economic interests, some  stuff right now happens a lot more on one political side. Scientists  track an uneven distribution of emotion-ridden fake news and  misinformation. They say: ``The prevalence of outraged discourse on  political blogs, talk radio, and cable news is 50% greater on the  political right than the political left.''   Other authors write ``if the political context were to change, we  might expect the distribution of misperceptions across the political  spectrum to change as well,'' but for now, the weaponized fake news  virus predominantly infects the political rightwing and modern  conservative politics.   McCright and Dunlap writes: ``The Right seems especially adept at  using Orwellian language to promote their ideological and material  interests via what we would argue are systemic lies.''   So who does this? Weaponized fake news is not cheap. It is not cheap  to test. It is not cheap to manufacture, and it is not cheap to  distribute. It is also not cheap to maintain a network to put  weaponized fake news out there in a way that masks the identity of the  economic forces behind the network. This takes money, motive, and  persistence, and that means big industrial players.   What authors call the ``800-pound gorilla in the room'' is ``a  political system that is driven by the interests of economic elites  rather than the people.'' That is big economic elites playing a game of  masquerade and manipulation in our politics. The scheme may look like  populism. Indeed, part of the masquerade is, it is designed to look  like populism, but that is what is going on.   The disinformation campaign is ``largely independent of the public's  wishes but serves the interests of economic elites.'' The populist  masquerade is part of the disinformation exercise.   These economic elites take methods developed decades ago by one  industry to use for another industry today. We see this in the fossil  fuel industry-weaponized fake news about climate change--climate denial  we call it.   The stakes are very high, with the International Monetary Fund  calculating that fossil fuel exacts a subsidy from the American people  of $700 billion per year. To protect an annual subsidy of $700 billion  per year, you can cook up a lot of mischief.   Where did the fossil fuel climate denial mischief begin? It began in  the tobacco industry's fraudulent schemes to deny the health risks of  tobacco. Did Big Oil shy away from those tobacco tactics, knowing those  tactics were actually found in court to be fraud? No.   Indeed, to quote an article: ``The oil industry has worked to promote  doubt about climate change science using tactics pioneered by cigarette  manufacturers in the 1960s.''   To protect a $700 billion annual subsidy, you can build a bigger  denial scheme even than Big Tobacco, and they did. McCright and Dunlap  call this the ``climate change denial countermovement.'' They say its  message ``may be the most successful systemic lies of the last few  decades.''    They continue:         Briefly, this countermovement uses money and resources from       industry and conservative foundations to mobilize an array of       conservative think tanks, lobbying organizations, media       outlets, front groups, and Republican politicians to ignore,       suppress, obfuscate, and cherry-pick scientists and their       research to deny the reality and seriousness of climate       change.    Other authors write that ``the current polarization of the climate  debate is the result of a decades-long concerted effort by conservative  political operatives and think tanks to cast doubt on the overwhelming  scientific consensus that the earth is warming from human greenhouse  gas emissions.''   ``To cast doubt'' is the key phrase in that last quote. The authors  emphasize that ``climate science denial does not present a coherent  alternative explanation of climate change. On the contrary, the  arguments offered by climate denial are intrinsically incoherent.  Climate-science denial is therefore best understood not as an  alternative knowledge claim but as a political operation aimed at  generating uncertainty in the public's mind in order to preserve the  status quo.''   How did that play out in Republican policymaking? ``[W]hile climate  change used to be a bipartisan issue in the 1980s, the Republican party  has arguably moved from evidence-based concern to industry-funded  denial.''   Let's be clear. Climate denial is not a search for truth. As the  evidence piled up that early climate change warnings were accurate, the  climate denial campaign did not relent in the face of those facts.  Indeed, the scientists relate, ``the amount of misinformation on  climate change has increased in proportion to the strength of  scientific evidence that human greenhouse gas emissions are altering  the Earth's climate.''   It is a fossil fuel upgrade of the fraudulent Big Tobacco strategy.  One example is the so-called Oregon Petition, a bogus petition urging  the U.S. Government to reject the 1997 Kyoto Protocol on global  warming. One article points out that ``the Oregon Petition is an  example of the so-called `fake-experts' strategy that was pioneered by  the tobacco industry in the 1970s and 1980s.''   Of course, since this scheme isn't real science, it doesn't use real  scientific outlets. ``[M]uch of the opposition to  [[Page S6377]]  mainstream climate science, like any other form of science denial,  involves non-scientific outlets such as blogs.''   Another article notes that this is done on ``websites that obfuscate  their sponsor by mimicking the trappings of nonprofits and other more  trusted sites.'' Again, masquerade--even camouflage--is part of the  problem. I think it goes without saying that in real science it is not  necessary to mask the real proponent.   Another signal of the scheme is repetition of falsehood. ``Dozens of  studies document an illusory truth effect whereby repeated statements  are judged truer than new ones.''   In real science, when someone realizes what they are saying is wrong,  they stop saying it. In the weaponized disinformation scheme, you just  keep saying it. You maybe even say it more to capitalize on this  ``illusory truth effect.''   This, of course, recalls the infamous Big Tobacco declaration:  ``Doubt is our product.'' That is a quote from a tobacco memo.   The heart of the fossil fuel industry's scheme is to undermine  legitimate science with false doubts. To chip away at the scientific  consensus on climate change, they chip away at the foundations of truth  itself.   One author sees this as ``the willingness of political actors to  promote doubt as to whether truth is ultimately knowable''--think of  the President's lawyer, Giuliani, saying ``truth isn't truth''--or  ``whether empirical evidence is important''--think of climate denial  trying to drown out the truth through repetition of false statements-- third, ``and whether the fourth estate has value''--think of the  President attacking the legitimate media as ``fake news'' and the  ``enemy of the people.''   The scientific paper concludes: ``Undermining public confidence in  the institutions that produce and disseminate knowledge is a threat to  which scientists must respond.''   Sadly, real science is poorly adapted to defending itself against  weaponized disinformation in the public arena.   Let me conclude with what one article calls a case study in the  spread of misinformation. Last year's ``Unite the Right'' rally in  Charlottesville, VA, which led to the murder of Heather Heyer, killed  by a White supremacist speeding into a crowd, a witness recorded on  film the car plowing into that crowd of people. The authors wrote:  ``Within hours, conspiracy theories began floating around the internet  among people associated with the alt-right,'' attempting to undermine  and discredit the witness. Social media posts then appeared  ``suggesting [the driver] staged the attack, was trained by the CIA,  and funded by either George Soros, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama or the  global Jewish mafia. . . . [T]hose conspiracy theories migrated into  more mainstream media. Variations appeared on info wars and Shawn  Hannity's show on Fox.'' FOX News, by the way, is a common venue for  fake news.   Here is what the scientists chronicle as the ``Fox News effect'':         It has repeatedly been shown that people who report that       they source their news from public broadcasters become better       informed the more attention they report paying to the news,       whereas, the reverse is true for self-reported consumers of       FOX News. . . . [F]or self-reporting viewers of Fox News . .       . increasing frequency of news consumption is often       associated with an increased likelihood that they are       misinformed about various issues.    In a nutshell, the more you watch real news, the more you know; the  more you watch FOX News, the less you know--great for the elite  merchants of doubt.   The effects of misinformation become measurable by looking at  provable falsehoods that people are made to believe.         [A] 2011 poll showed that 51 percent of Republican primary       voters thought that then-president Obama had been born       abroad. . . . [Twenty percent] of respondents in a       representative U.S. sample have been found to endorse the       proposition that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by       corrupt scientists. The idea that the Democratic Party was       running a child sex ring was at one point believed or       accepted as being possibly true by nearly one-third of       Americans and nearly one-half of Trump voters.    All provably false. All propagated until significant numbers of  people believed.   So how do we fight back? The researchers offer an array of  approaches. ``Russian propaganda can be `digitally contained' by  supporting media literacy and source criticism,'' says one.   ``Our recommendation,'' wrote another, ``is to begin by generating a  list of the skills required to be a critical consumer of information.''  In essence, we have to adapt new citizenship skills to protect  ourselves from weaponized fake news.   Another recommendation is to teach people about the tactic of sewing  doubt through disinformation. Where ``typical cues for credibility have  been hijacked,'' understanding the tactics will help inoculate people  against being taken in by the scheme.   The researchers reported:         Participants read about how the tobacco industry in the       1970s used ``fake experts''--people with no scientific       background, or doctors and scientists with beliefs       unrepresentative of the rest of the scientific community--to       create the illusion of an ongoing debate about smoking's       negative health consequences. Participants who read about the       ``fake experts'' type of argument were less affected when       later reading a passage on climate change that quoted a       scientist who referred to ``climate change . . . [as] still       hotly debated among scientists.''    Other authors argued that a comprehensive approach will be needed to  debunk climate denial. They note that ``climate denial typically  masquerades as `pro-science' skepticism and paints the actual science  of climate change as being `corrupt' or `post-moderate.' It is possible  that those carefully crafted forms of misinformation will require  continued human debunking as well as increased media literacy.''   Last, there is a role for the media. ``At present,'' authors point  out, ``many representatives of think tanks and corporate front groups  appear in the media without revealing their affiliations and conflicts  of interest. This practice must be tightened, and rigorous disclosure  of all affiliations and interests must take center stage in media  reporting.'' Again, once you out the participants and show the scheme,  people can figure it out for themselves.   Recommended media reforms include a ``counter fake news editor [to]  highlight disinformation'' or a ``[r]ating system for disinformation''  or ``a Disinformation Charter.''   Science itself is beginning to examine the growing threat of  misinformation in American society, which is appropriate since science  is so often the target of weaponized misinformation campaigns. More and  more, real science must face up to the fact that a new predator roams  its territory and adapt new defenses against this predator. The  predators may not want to defeat all science. They probably still wants  to use their iPhones and drive cars and live in safe buildings and  enjoy products and services that science gives us. But they do seek to  defeat whatever science challenges the economic interests that fund  them.   As I said at the start, the Journal of Applied Research in Memory and  Cognition is not exactly grocery-store checkout-line reading. Few  Americans have read this volume. I am probably the only one in  Congress. But its message is important, and that is why I came to the  floor to share it today.   Campaigns of lies are dangerous things, like an evil virus in the  body politic, and if we want to be a healthy country, we will have to  defeat the weaponized disinformation virus. Curing our body politic of  the ongoing fraud of climate denial would be a very good start.   I note the deputy majority leader is here on the floor. I apologize  for continuing my speech while he is here. I appreciate his productive  role in the happy events that I described at the beginning of these  remarks.
