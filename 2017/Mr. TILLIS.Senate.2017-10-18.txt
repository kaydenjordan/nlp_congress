 Mr. President, while Senator Enzi is on the floor, I want  to thank him for his leadership in the Budget Committee and taking us  through this very important vote today.   I want to talk a little bit in terms that maybe people can understand  what is going on here and what will be going on over the next few days.   What we are doing right now is passing a budget. Our budget is no  different than your household budget, when you sit down and you figure  out, over some period of time, how much money you have and how much  money you need to spend, where maybe you need to spend more and maybe  you need to spend less. That is all we are doing with this budget.   This budget is not the tax reform bill. That will come after we pass  a budget, but if we don't pass this budget, there is no possible way we  can actually pass tax reform. That is why I support this budget. That  is why I will work to defeat any amendments that will prevent this  budget from being passed. Then we can start having an honest discussion  about what we need to do around tax reform.   I know the Senator from South Carolina did a great job, as he always  does on the floor, talking about why he supports tax reform. He is  somebody we should really listen to. He is somebody who came up through  truly humble means. You have people come on this floor and they talk  about how the people who are supporting tax reform are just doing this  for the billionaires and the rich.   I would encourage you to go out to the internet and take a look at  Senator Scott's story and tell me if that is somebody predisposed to  helping the rich. He is here to help the little guy. He is here to get  the economy going so people can get back to work. He is here to  actually create opportunities for wages to go up. He is here to  actually do what we have been promising for 20 years and haven't done-- almost 30 years.   Over that span of time, America has lost traction as the greatest  economy that has ever existed. This tax reform measure, after we pass  the budget, is to really get to a point to where States like West  Virginia--you heard Senator Capito talk about 95 percent of the jobs  created in West Virginia are small businesses. How could anybody  sincerely come to this floor and say Senator Capito is only supporting  this for the wealthy corporations? They just don't exist in any large  number in West Virginia.   In my State, 80 percent of the jobs that are created are small  businesses as well. So how anybody could suggest that there are those  of us coming to the floor just talking about tax breaks for the rich  and for corporations really need to go back and look at our States.  Look at who is struggling and whom we are here trying to help. We get  to the tax reform bill after we pass the budget. That is why I am going  to support the budget.   Now, to some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, the Founding  Fathers did strive to create a more perfect Union, but they created an  imperfect democratic process. This is the sausage factory we call  democracy. It is not intended to be perfect, nor does it ever produce  anything that is perfect legislation--something that is done and you  never come back to it.   Those who come to this floor and say: Unless I can have that perfect,  I am not willing to support the good, they really need to go back and  rethink why they are here. We are here to start fulfilling promises.  You don't do it by coming onto this floor and saying: I really want to  do tax reform but only if it is my perfect solution. You start by  making progress. Then you build on that progress. You start getting the  economy to grow, and you use those resources to better fund the most  challenged people we have in this Nation, use those resources to grow  the economy and give younger people an opportunity to realize the  American dream the way I did back in the 1980s.   That is why we have to pass this budget. That is why we have to set  aside our personal preferences for something far better than probably  will ever come out of this Chamber but something good that begins to  fulfill the promises we made to the American people.   When we get past the budget, we are going to do something called  vote-arama tomorrow. Vote-arama is an interesting process, mainly  because it is a bunch of votes that don't mean anything. There are  going to be people who come up here, and they will file a bill. It will  go up or down. Even if it goes up, it doesn't have the force of law.   Tomorrow, if you are here, it is a lot like going to good theater. At  the end of the day, the only thing that matters is the final vote, and  that is the vote on the budget. That is something every single person  in this Chamber should support. Then we need to move on to tax reform  that has a meaningful, lasting impact for the poorest, most challenged  people in this country. It is not about tax breaks for the rich. It is  not about tax breaks for corporations. It is about small businesses in  West Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina or across this Nation  that need help. It is about those employees that, if we do this right,  will be making more money. They will have more money to pay their  bills. It is about making a conscious decision about how much money we  can spend on Medicaid and to be absolutely certain we can fulfill the  promise to people challenged by it. It is about fulfilling the promise  to people on Social Security and Medicare, to make sure those programs  can fulfill the promises we made.   This isn't about absolute cuts to Medicaid. This is about how much it  should grow every single year to be absolutely certain those programs  are going to be there 10, 15, and 20 years from now. If you have an  opportunity to sit up in the Gallery and pay attention to these words,  go back and really fact check some of what is being said. Go back and  look at the backgrounds of some of the Members on this side of the  aisle who support tax reform. They grew up as the little guy. They grew  up in challenged situations. They represent States where the vast  majority of the people in those States are, themselves, challenged.  Anybody who can sincerely come down here and say this is about the  rich, this is about the corporations, come spend time in North  Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, Georgia, Alabama, and  Tennessee, States across this Nation. I come from the Southeast, but  they are the ones that come out of my mouth.   I worry about all those little businesses. I worry about all those  challenged people. This budget lays the groundwork for us to actually  put meaningful policy in place for the first time in about 30 years  that is sincerely attempting to fulfill the promises the politicians  make in this Chamber every single day.   I hope all of our Members will come down here and accept the fact  that perfect doesn't happen, but some good can happen. Good begins by  passing this budget, and it continues by passing tax reform that will  help the most challenged among us.   I yield the floor.  [[Page S6521]]    The PRESIDING OFFICER.
