 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so  ordered.    Mr. President, it was 16 years ago that I introduced a  bill known as the DREAM Act. The purpose of the DREAM Act was to give  undocumented young people brought to the United States under the age of  18 an opportunity to go through a background check and to earn their  way to legal status--16 years ago. The bill passed the Senate at  various times and it passed the House, though never quite in the same  year at the same time.   Now we face a crisis, literally. It is a crisis involving hundreds of  thousands of these young people across America. It was just September 5  when the President of the United States announced that he was going to  eliminate DACA.   DACA was the Executive order of President Obama that allowed these  Dreamers to come forward, pay a filing fee of about $500 or $600,  submit themselves to a criminal background check, and, after that  background check, if they cleared it, to be given a 2-year allowance to  live in the United States without fear of deportation--2 years at a  time--and the legal capacity to work. That was what DACA was about.   So 780,000 young people did it. They came forward. They surrendered  the information about themselves and their families. They submitted  themselves to criminal background checks, and they ended up getting the  protection of DACA. They went on to go to school, to go to work, to  become teachers or engineers, to go to medical school, and to do things  that really mean that they will have a future in this country that will  be a benefit to them and to all of us.   So President Trump said that program will end on March 5, 2018, and  he established a deadline, for those who were going to see their DACA  eligibility end during that period of time, for them to renew. The  deadline was October 5. It meant that they had to come forward with the  filing fee and at least apply to go through the process again. It was  quite a hardship on many of these young people to come up with the  money for the filing fee and to realize that the clock was ticking in a  very meaningful way about their ability to protect themselves. Many of  them stepped forward and asked for help from families, from churches,  and from friends to come up with the filing fee to make sure that they  renewed their DACA eligibility in time.   Let me tell you what happened to some of them who went through this  process.   Here is one case. On September 14, Allison Baker, a lawyer for the  Legal Aid Society in New York, sent one of these young individuals'  application to renew this permit that would let him stay and work in  the United States legally as part of DACA. The date of September 14  should be remembered because the deadline for filing was October 5. To  be sure, this lawyer sent this renewal application for this young man  by certified mail. Back in the day when I practiced law, that was one  way to make sure you had written proof of when you actually mailed  something far in advance of a deadline. Tracking data from the U.S.  Postal Service showed that the envelope arrived in Chicago on September  16. It was mailed from New York on September 14 and arrived in Chicago  September 16, on its way to a regional processing warehouse of the U.S.  Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that administers the  program known as DACA.   Then the packet started circling the Chicago postal system in a  mysterious holding pattern. From September 17 to September 19, it was  in transit to destination, according to the Postal Service. Then its  tracking whereabouts disappeared until October 4, where, once again,  the Postal Service assured the sender that it was ``on its way.''   On October 6, the day after the deadline, this certified application,  which was sent on September 14, arrived, and the application for this  24-year-old man was rejected by our government.   He wasn't alone. We know of at least 33 other cases just like this.  Congressman Luis Gutierrez, of my State of Illinois, told the story of  another application renewal sent on September 13 for an October 5  deadline. It arrived on October 6, as well. Another sent their  paperwork on September 21. It wasn't received until October 9. What  Congressman Gutierrez said is very obvious: Because somebody else did  not do their job correctly, we are taking innocent young immigrants and  making them deportable. That is unacceptable, Congressman Gutierrez  said.   What does the U.S. Postal Service have to say about what I just read  to you, those two or three cases? On Thursday, in a rare admission from  a Federal agency, the U.S. Postal Service took the blame. David  Partenheimer, a spokesman for the Postal Service, said that there had  been ``an unintentional temporary mail processing delay in the Chicago  area.''   Remember what I am saying here. Young people, undocumented had  applied successfully and had been accepted into the DACA Program. The  President announced he was going to end  [[Page S7187]]  the program, and those--many of them--had to re-sign up, renew, by  October 5. They did it. They mailed it. Their application didn't arrive  in time.   It doesn't take a big leap of faith or intelligence to realize what  should be done. Clearly, this agency should be giving these young  people a chance. Once again, they have done everything they can think  of to comply with the law and trust our government. They trusted our  government to give them DACA status to allow them to stay in the United  States, and they trusted the Postal Service, in a matter of 2 weeks, to  be able to deliver a letter.   Yesterday I spoke to the USCIS Director, Francis Cissna, and I asked  him about this. I said to him: There must be a way for us to  acknowledge the obvious. These young people, in good faith, did  everything we could ask of them to comply with the law, and now they  have been rejected. Now they are subject to deportation because the  Postal Service didn't do its job. I asked him: Are you prepared to at  least reconsider this decision and give them a chance to renew their  DACA status?   He said he was aware of the situation and that it was being  considered at the highest levels of the Department of Homeland  Security.   I raise this issue because real lives are at stake. These are real  people. These are young men and women who are doing everything they can  think of to become part of America's future. They are hiring lawyers,  they are raising money, and they are filing the documents that are  asked of them in the hopes they can stay in the United States of  America, and the system is fighting them every step of the way. In this  situation, this is totally unfair.   Our government is better than this. Our people are better than this.  Our values are better than this. I am pleading with the Department of  Homeland Security and those who are seeking positions in that  Department to show some common sense and a little bit of heart when it  comes to these young people who are simply trying to make a future for  themselves and a better United States of America.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Menendez), and the Senator from  Maryland (Mr. Van Hollen) are necessarily absent.

The motion is agreed to.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I want to take a few moments to  acknowledge former mayor of Evanston, IL--and my friend--Liz Tisdahl.   Liz began her service to Evanston in 1989 on the Evanston Township  School Board. After 2 years as president of the board, Liz was  appointed to the Evanston City Council in 2003 by Mayor Lorraine  Morton. Mayor Morton had met Liz years earlier when she was picking up  her youngest granddaughter from softball practice. She didn't recognize  the new coach and asked about her. It was Liz Tisdahl. Liz didn't have  a child on the team, but she wanted to lend a helping hand in the  community.   When Lorraine Morton became mayor, she always remembered how Liz  stepped up just to help other people, so when it came time for Mayor  Morton to decide whom she wanted to replace her, the first and only  name that came to mind was Liz Tisdahl. When Liz was first approached  to run, her answer was ``absolutely not,'' but after giving it more  thought, Liz answered the call to run to help out Evanston's residents  who were leaving the community due to the increasingly high cost of  living. Liz Tisdahl wasn't running for mayor to help herself, but like  her time coaching that softball team years earlier, she was doing it  for other people.   Early in Liz's tenure as mayor, she quickly learned what it meant to  be the ``face of Evanston'' and the good she could accomplish. At the  time, too many Evanston residents struggled to afford housing, so Liz  wrote a Federal grant application and flew to Washington, DC, to lobby  for money to expand affordable housing in her community--and it worked.  Evanston received an $18 million grant. I remember calling her with the  good news. Liz later said that was ``the day that I realized that there  really was something to this `being a mayor' thing.''   Liz Tisdahl also has successfully lobbied to secure a designation for  a Federal qualified health center in Evanston, resulting in the  establishment of the Erie Evanston/Skokie Health Center. Since 2012,  the Erie Evanston/Skokie Health Center has treated nearly 12,000  patients and provided immediate care for the residents of Evanston.   In 2009, when Liz Tisdahl first ran for mayor of Evanston, she  campaigned under a simple platform: ``Diversity, Sustainability, and  Economic Development.'' First, Liz set out to increase employment. She  expanded the Mayor's Summer Youth Employment Program, which had 167  jobs in 2009. Since 2012, the program has grown by 100 jobs each year,  employing 750 young people in 2016. Liz also created partnerships with  Northwestern University, NorthShore University HealthSystem, and other  businesses to establish job training and apprenticeship programs for  the community's most vulnerable people. In 2009, the unemployment rate  of Evanston was 8 percent. When Mayor Tisdahl left office earlier this  year, unemployment was down to 4.1 percent.   Liz Tisdahl also worked to make Evanston greener and--as promised-- brought changes to the city's sustainability efforts. According to a  2015 emissions report, Evanston reduced its greenhouse gas emissions by  more than 18 percent between 2005 and 2015. In 2014, Evanston became  one of America's first two cities to receive a four-star rating from  the Sustainability Tools for Assessing and Rating Communities  Initiative. For her environmental work and focus on sustainability  issues, Liz received the Climate Protection Award from the U.S.  Conference of Mayors.   Earlier this year, after two terms in office, Liz Tisdahl decided not  to run for a third. When asked why, her answer was simple. Although she  loved being mayor, she had accomplished her goals. Liz Tisdahl went out  on top.   Despite her many achievements, Liz's proudest accomplishment is her  family. Now that she is retired, I know she is enjoying more time with  her children and grandchildren, but this isn't the last we have heard  from Liz Tisdahl. She will continue to be a fearless advocate for the  people of Evanston. Since retiring, Liz has joined the board at Curt's  Cafe, an Evanston coffee shop that trains at-risk youth, prepares them  to become job-ready, and helps them to transition into full-time  employment. One thing is clear, Liz Tisdahl is not done helping the  community she loves.   I want to congratulate Liz Tisdahl on her distinguished career and  thank her for her outstanding service to the people of Evanston. Now as  she enters the next chapter in her life, I wish her and her family all  the best.   (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered  to be printed in the Record.)                            ____________________
