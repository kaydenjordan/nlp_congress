 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman  and my good friend from California for yielding me the customary 30  minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the rule before us provides for consideration of four  pieces of legislation that are, once again, nothing but missed  opportunities to address the multiple crises facing our country under  the Biden Presidency.   Rather than working with Republicans to actually address the  unmitigated crisis at our southern border, to address the cold war we  have with China, the proxy war we have with Russia, or the historic  levels of inflation, Democrats are rushing to the floor these half- baked legislative items that will create more problems than they aim to  solve.   Look no further than S. 3905, the Preventing Organizational Conflicts  of Interest in Federal Acquisition Act. Instead of making meaningful  reforms to Federal acquisition policy, this legislation is duplicative,  and it is contradictory to existing policies. It also tells the Federal  Acquisition Regulatory Council to do something that it is already  required to do.   Additionally, this rule provides for consideration of H.R. 1948, the  VA Employee Fairness Act. This legislation would put veteran patients  at risk by shifting questions of professional conduct to collective  bargaining.   The Secretary of the VA has been and should continue to be directly  accountable for the quality of care provided to our veterans at the VA.   While we are focusing on these unnecessary bills, China has recently  signed a $50 billion trade deal with our ally Saudi Arabia; Putin, once  again, threatened to launch a nuclear war on the West; and the wealth  of the average American has dropped to the lowest level ever recorded.   The chief of the U.S. Border Patrol reported that over the weekend  there were over 16,000 migrant encounters at the border--and wait for  it--that was in a 48-hour period, 16,000 in less than 2 days, but  President Biden hasn't stepped foot on the southern border since he  took office.   Last week, when he was not visiting the border while in Arizona,  President Joe Biden was asked about that, and his response was ``There  are more important things going on.''   Yet, during the administration there have been nearly 5 million  illegal immigrant crossings at our southern border, and that includes 1  million got-aways. These are individuals that we have no record of that  we just know escaped into the interior of the country.   Yet, Biden has failed at protecting our southern border just as he  failed in America's prisoner swap with President Putin. The  administration effectively surrendered to Putin by swapping a woke  celebrity basketball player for the ``Merchant of Death,'' an  international arms smuggler with the blood of Americans on his hands.    This disastrous negotiation is just another failed foreign policy  decision that was based on Russia's terms, not ours. This rash decision  left two other Americans detained in Russia: Pittsburgh history teacher  Marc Fogel, and U.S. Marine Paul Whelan. They have no clear chance of  returning home now. We have lost all leverage unless--I am going to be  surprised to discover that--we have two ``merchants of death'' in a  Federal prison in the U.S. Something tells me that is not the case.   What we should be doing is we should be immediately acting to protect  our national security. We should be ensuring the safe return of all  Americans that are wrongfully detained abroad. We should be working to  secure the southern border. We should not be passing ill-conceived and  unnecessary legislation. To be frank, our time is too precious, and our  challenges are too great.   Mr. Speaker, for those reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this  rule, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, instead of addressing any of the  crises that are actually facing this Nation, House Democrats are  allowing the Senate to ram through a huge omnibus spending bill that  was written without the input of House Republicans and was written  behind closed doors.   In September, House Republicans were very clear in opposition to  postponing a government funding fight to the Democrat-controlled lame- duck session. Once again, House Democrats failed to meet the  fundamental duty of funding the government despite spending most of the  year passing trillions of dollars in wasteful spending that has fueled  inflation and driven up our debt.   That is why if we defeat the previous question, I will personally  offer an amendment to the rule to immediately strike sections 8 and 9  from the rule, which would strike the omnibus vehicle from this rule.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my  amendment in the Record, along with any extraneous material,  immediately prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Roy), to explain the amendment.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I really can't stand the cliche that history repeats  itself, but that is true. To prove that, let me just read some excerpts  from a Joe Biden speech from 2006. Joe Biden said: ``The world is going  to Hades in a handbasket. We are desperately concerned about the  circumstance relating to the avian flu. We do not have enough vaccines.  We do not have enough police officers. And we are going to debate, the  next 3 weeks, I am told, gay marriage, a flag amendment, and God only  knows what else. I can't believe the American people can't see through  this. We already have a law, the Defense of Marriage Act. We all  voted.''   That was Joe Biden in 2006. It sounds awfully familiar to what my  colleagues across the aisle are doing now with these fluff bills, bills  that are already on the books and nothing but a distraction from the  real crises that are facing this Nation.   To talk more about that, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Once again, this rule provides for four pieces of legislation that,  once again, are just missed opportunities to actually address the  problems we are facing.   Let's talk about one of the biggest problems, and that is the  southern border. To contextualize this, let me give you some stats.  This year, 98 suspected terrorists have been apprehended attempting to  cross the southern border. Think about that.   It took 19 hijackers on 9/11 to pull off the largest terrorist attack  in this country. In this year alone, we have let 98 suspected  terrorists walk across the southern border.   In October, there were over 230,000 illegal immigrant encounters at  the southern border. That is just in October. To put that into context,  that is a 334 percent increase from the average number of October  encounters under President Trump.   In November, there were more than 70,000 known got-aways at the  southern border. That is a historic record.   What is really worse is the fentanyl crisis, the fentanyl that is  coming across the southern border. There were more than 14,000 pounds  of illicit fentanyl seized in fiscal year 2022. That is a record.   As a reminder, a lethal dose of fentanyl is only 2 milligrams.  Fentanyl was responsible for two-thirds of all drug overdoses last  year.   There has been a 94 percent increase in fentanyl deaths since 2019.  To put that into more context, that is one fentanyl overdose every 7  minutes in the United States.   Just 5 to 10 percent of the drugs coming across the southern border  are seized by our Border Patrol agents.   What does the administration say on this? It is classic gaslighting.  I will quote Joe Biden once again. He said, ``There are more important  things going on.'' Kamala Harris, the so-called border czar, said the  border is secure. DHS Secretary Mayorkas said, look, the border is  secure.   They are either gaslighting, or they have no connection and no  grounding in reality.   As far as the omnibus, let's just go back to September. In September,  House Democrats were clear in their opposition to postponing a  government funding fight to the Democrat-controlled lame-duck session.  We didn't want it then; we don't want it now.   Unfortunately, on September 30, a continuing resolution was passed  funding the government through December 16. So, here we are today.   This 1-week continuing resolution is an attempt to buy additional  time for a massive lame-duck spending bill in which House Republicans  had no seat at the negotiating table.   We will soon be in the majority. Republicans will soon be in the  majority. We will be in the driver's seat to fight for our priorities.  That is why every Republican should be a ``no'' on the Democrats' lame- duck omnibus spending bill.   To talk more about the omnibus, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  for closing.   Lives are being lost while President Biden and Congressional  Democrats continue to ignore the crisis at our southern border.  Tragically, just last week, on December 7, United States Border Patrol  Agent Raul Humberto Gonzalez, Jr., was killed while chasing a group of  migrants across the border.   To go back to that quote from President Biden about the southern  border and about why he hasn't visited, despite the fact that he was  just in Arizona, ``There are more important things going on.'' That is  what President Biden has to say; stinging words  [[Page H9751]]  given the deaths and casualties that we are seeing at the southern  border and the fentanyl deaths and overdoses in the interior of this  country.   It is absolutely maddening to see such a flagrant disregard not only  for our hardworking Border Patrol agents but our Nation's immigration  system as a whole. For that reason, we must bring the border crisis to  an end.   But President Joe Biden and Congressional Democrats have manufactured  this historic crisis on our southern border by halting the construction  of the border wall, ending Trump's remain in Mexico policy, and  refusing to visit the border.   U.S. Border Patrol facilities are becoming overrun with thousands of  illegal immigrants in custody. This crisis is only getting worse. On  December 21, title 42 ends, a powerful tool that allowed border  officials to expel more than 2 million migrants during the pandemic.  There now have been 20 straight months of over 150,000 illegal border  crossings.   Yet, with today's rule, House Democrats continue to ignore this  historic disaster at our border. This crisis could not be more  devastating to the sovereignty and the security of our Nation.   Mr. Speaker, for those reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no''  on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   This is a 5-minute vote.
