 Mr. Chairman, the EPA has imposed these substantial  competitive barriers, despite the industry's significant reduction in  methane emissions through their own initiatives and innovation.   What is not known is that through the EPA's own analysis, it shows  that methane emissions from hydraulically fractured gas wells have  actually fallen dramatically. According to EPA data--not my data, but  EPA data--methane emissions from oil and gas production declined by 38  percent from 2005 to 2012, and methane emissions from hydraulically  fractured natural gas wells have plummeted 73 percent since 2011.   Total methane emissions from natural gas systems actually are down 11  percent since 2005, despite the significant production increases over  this time period. This is a prime example of market forces at work.   American producers developed innovative means of capturing additional  methane because doing so means they have more product to sell.  Profitability, rather than a top-down Washington regulation, drove this  unprecedented emissions reduction.   In fact, in 2012 alone, voluntary methane emission reductions  activities by the U.S. oil and gas industry generated $364 million in  additional revenue.   Unfortunately, the methane rule represents the kind of one-size-fits- all policy that will actually stifle innovation and discourage further  investment in emission reduction technology.   Actually, as a result, the EPA's methane rule, if allowed to stand,  will not only lead to economic harm, but environmental harm as well.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, garbage in equals garbage out. We have heard  this on numerous occasions.   And in this instance, the international--or correction--the  Interagency Working Group has chosen to disregard the policy decisions  from OMB Circular A-4 regarding how they set the modeling. And as a  result of that, they have--interestingly, the analysis generated by  them would have been 80 percent lower than the mean SCC value if they  had followed the guidance. And the result overstates the benefits by at  least four times relative to what it would be if only the national  benefits were considered as OMB directs.   This is a blatant pattern of disregard, Mr. Chairman, for the OMB  guidance in order to inflate the SCC and begs the question how many  input decisions were responsible where responsible people could  disagree were selected in order only to inflate the SCC value.   Let's restore the faith and vote for this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment prohibits the use of funds to  take retaliatory actions against individual States. Importantly, this  amendment would not prevent the EPA from working with States to restore  the bay.   In 1985, the States in the Chesapeake Bay region recognized the need  to address pollutants in the bay and, through their own initiative,  came together to conduct cleanup efforts. These State-driven efforts  were largely successful. As a matter of fact, water quality improved  almost 50 percent from 1985 to 2010.   However, in 2010, the EPA seized the States' authority to determine  their own continued compliance and threatened to dictate Federal  requirements if the States were unable to comply. This 2010 power grab,  known as the Chesapeake Bay TMDL, directly contradicts the intent of  the Clean Water Act.   The Clean Water Act clearly acknowledges State authority in water  quality and requires cooperation rather than coercion between the  States and the Federal Government.   These coercive methods have been tried and imposed and have failed.  Actually, water quality has not improved since the federalization of  the bay cleanup efforts.   It is simply imperative that we return the constitutional rights of  the States to make their own water quality improvement decisions and  restore the State control that has been shown to actually improve water  quality. The future of the Chesapeake Bay depends on it.                                time  1730     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I want to start by thanking Chairman Calvert  for this opportunity.   Mr. Chair, this amendment prohibits the EPA from using funds for  actions pursuant to section 115 of the Clean Air Act. Section 115 of  the Clean Air Act allows the agency to mandate State emissions levels  to whatever level the agency deems appropriate if, in collaboration  with a foreign government, they determine endangerment and if the other  government has a reciprocal agreement to prevent or control these  emissions in their own nation.   Now, this is a backdoor provision that allows the agency to vastly  expand its regulatory authority and encroach on the constitutional  rights of the States to regulate their own energy sectors, based on the  actions of a foreign nation and the whims of the executive branch.   It is irresponsible to allow unelected bureaucrats at the EPA to  retain the ability to seize such an expansive authority. If the U.S.  government wants to pursue such a policy, one that, in my opinion, is  constitutionally suspect, it should be done through an explicit  congressional delegation of authority on a case-by-case basis.   A similar amendment has passed the House during the interior and  environmental appropriations packages for the  [[Page H6517]]  previous 2 fiscal years, Mr. Chairman. I urge my colleagues to take  back our Article I authority and support this amendment.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, are we or are we not a sovereign Nation? I  think that most people would agree that we are, and, as such, we don't  take issue with the Congress, with the administration doing its job to  keep our air clean and to make treaties and provisions with other  nations.   But what we do take issue with is other nations working with,  potentially, this administration, any administration, that comes up  with an agreement not ratified by the American people, not ratified by  this body or the body on the other side of the Capitol to encroach upon  the constitutional rights of States to regulate their own environmental  emissions, as provided.   So it is not a question of whether we think that the climate isn't  changing, man has something to do with it, or whether it should be  regulated or how it should be regulated. It is a question of the  authority vested in the Constitution, in these bodies, and the ones  that are not.   It is not the place of unelected bureaucrats or individuals to make  an agreement with some other nation, then to impose itself on the  States individually. That is all we are saying here. It has passed on  numerous occasions because it is good.   The President got us out of the Paris climate agreement, but that  doesn't mean that some other administration in the future might make  another agreement that, yet again, the American people had no part in;  neither did this body. So this just ensures that if that is the case,  we have the protection that this body should provide.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
