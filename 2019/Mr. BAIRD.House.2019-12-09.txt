 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 737, the Building  Blocks of STEM Act.   I was proud to join my colleague, the Chair of the Research and  Technology Subcommittee, Representative Haley Stevens in introducing  the House version of this legislation, which unanimously passed this  Chamber in July, and am pleased to be speaking today on the nearly  identical Senate version of the bill.   As one of only two members of Congress with a PhD in science, I  understand the importance of teaching STEM concepts and principles at  an early age.   Fostering the natural curiosity that children possess is critical to  expanding their interests in science, technology, engineering, and  math. Research confirms that kids as young as one, two, or three are  capable of absorbing STEM concepts.   Equally important is ensuring that we get more girls involved in the  STEM fields, so that we have as many people as possible contributing to  the knowledge base of our society.   Like the House version, S. 737 directs NSF to fund research and  grants that focus on early childhood and young women in STEM at the K  through 12 level.   This bill helps ensure we are preparing our future workforce to fill  the jobs of the future.   By passing this important legislation we will continue America's  global leadership in science and technology.   I ask my colleagues to support the bill and send it to the  President's desk for his signature.
