 Mr. President, I rise to support the nomination of Judge  Neil Gorsuch to the U.S. Supreme Court. Hopefully, we will see his  confirmation in the weeks to come.   As I have come to the floor and talked about before, Judge Gorsuch is  a fourth-generation Coloradan who serves on the Tenth Circuit Court of  Appeals, which is the U.S. circuit court that is housed in Denver, CO.  It is the circuit court that oversees about 20 percent of the land mass  in the States of Colorado, Oklahoma, and places in between. Once he is  confirmed to the Supreme Court, Neil Gorsuch will become the second  Coloradan to have served on the Court.   We have a great history of another Supreme Court Justice who served  on the highest Court. Associate Justice Byron White had the distinction  of being the only Supreme Court Justice to lead the NFL in rushing, and  he was also from Colorado.   If Judge Gorsuch is confirmed, Justice Gorsuch will join Byron White  as another Coloradan on the High Court. Justice Rutledge also received  his bachelor's of law degree from the University of Colorado. So we do  have a great history of Colorado westerners joining our Nation's  highest Court.   Mr. Gorsuch was confirmed to the Tenth Circuit Court a little over 10  years ago--11 years ago--in 2006, by a unanimous voice vote. He was so  popular and so well supported that there was not even a rollcall vote  taken in this Chamber. It was a simple acclamation by a voice vote. In  fact, Gorsuch's nomination hearing was deemed so noncontroversial that  the last time, Senator Graham was the only committee member to attend.   One may ask oneself what made and continues to make Judge Gorsuch  such a mainstream nominee. I do not think we need to look any further  than his original Judiciary Committee questionnaire to see that Judge  Gorsuch possesses the right temperament and the right view of the role  of judges.   I thought it was important that I read this from 11 years ago when  Judge Gorsuch was confirmed to the Tenth Circuit Court. The  questionnaire he filled out for the Judiciary Committee included then- Neil Gorsuch's--trying to be Judge Gorsuch--response to judicial  activism and what it meant to Neil Gorsuch prior to his confirmation to  the Tenth Circuit Court.   Here is what he replied to the Judiciary Committee in that committee  questionnaire:         The Constitution requires Federal judges to strike a       delicate balance. The separation of powers embodied in our       founding document provides the judiciary with a defined and       limited charter.        Judges must allow the elected branches of government to       flourish and citizens, through their elected representatives,       to make laws appropriate to the facts and circumstances of       the day.        Judges must avoid the temptation to usurp the roles of the       legislative and executive branches and must appreciate the       advantages these democratic institutions have in crafting and       adapting social policy as well as their special authority,       derived from the consent and mandate of the people, to do so.        At the same time, the Founders were anxious to ensure that       the judicial branch never becomes captured by or subservient       to the other branches of government, recognizing  [[Page S1717]]       that a firm and independent judiciary is critical to a well-      functioning democracy.        The Constitution imposes on the judiciary the vital work of       settling disputes, vindicating civil rights and civil       liberties, ensuring equal treatment under the law, and       helping to make real for all citizens the Constitution's       promise of self-government. There may be no firmly fixed       formula on how to strike the balance envisioned by the       Constitution in specific cases, but there are many guideposts       discernible in the best traditions of our judiciary.        A wise judge recognizes that his or her own judgment is       only a weak reed without being fortified by these proven       guides.        For example, a good judge recognizes that many of the       lawyers in cases reaching the court of appeals have lived       with and thought deeply about the legal issues before the       court for months or years. A lawyer in the well is not to be       treated as a cat's paw but as a valuable colleague whose       thinking is to be mined and tested and who, at all times,       deserves to be treated with respect and common courtesy.        A good judge will diligently study counsels' briefs and the       record and seek to digest them fully before argument and then       listen with respectful discernment to the arguments made by       his or her colleagues at the bar.        A good judge will recognize that few questions in the law       are truly novel, that precedents in the vast body of Federal       law reflect the considered judgment of those who have come       before us and embody the settled expectation of those in our       own generation.        A good judge will seek to honor precedent and strive to       avoid its disparagement or displacement.        A good judge will listen to his or her colleagues and       strive to reach consensus with them. Every judge takes the       same judicial oath; every judge brings a different and       valuable perspective to the office.        A good judge will appreciate the different experiences and       perspectives of his or her colleagues and know that reaching       consensus is not always easy but that the process of getting       there often tempers the ultimate result, ensuring that the       ultimate decision reflects the collective wisdom of multiple       individuals of disparate backgrounds who have studied the       issue with care.        Throughout the process of adjudicating an appeal, a good       judge will question not only the positions espoused by the       litigants but also his or her own perceptions and       tentative conclusions as they evolve.        And a good judge will critically examine his or her own       ideas as readily and openly as the ideas advanced by others.        A good judge will never become so wedded to any view of any       case so as to preclude the possibility of changing his or her       mind at any stage--from argument through the completion of a       written opinion.        Pride of position, fear of embarrassment associated with       changing one's mind, along, of course, with personal politics       or policy preferences have no useful role in judging; regular       and healthy doses of self-skepticism and humility about one's       own abilities and conclusions always do.    This is the response that then-Neil Gorsuch, prior to his becoming  Judge Gorsuch, gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee and in response  to a questionnaire about judicial activism and about what makes a good  judge in his talking about fidelity to precedent, talking about the  ability to reach a conclusion that may be in disagreement with one's  own personal opinions, making sure that we respect the different  branches of government, making sure that one listens to one's  colleagues who are arguing a case and who have spent years in their  getting to know the case and its every detail, and scrubbing your mind  to question the positions that you thought you had to make sure that  they mesh with the law, not with opinion.   Judge Gorsuch, when he was introduced at the White House when being  nominated by the President, said that a judge who agrees with every  opinion he reaches is probably a bad judge.   The institution we serve has that fidelity to the Constitution that  we must preserve, that we must guard. Guardians of the Constitution,  which judges represent, is something we confirm. It is our job to make  sure the kind of judges we place on courts represent the kind of judge  Neil Gorsuch truly is.   It is this temperament, this fidelity to the Constitution, this  appropriate temperament, and remarkable humility that has made Judge  Gorsuch a consensus pick in the past and, I believe, that could be a  consensus pick in the near future.   It is reflected in the fact that, on February 23, Senator Bennet and  I, along with the Judiciary Committee, received a letter from  Colorado's diverse legal community in support of Judge Gorsuch's  nomination to the Supreme Court.   The letter reads as follows:         As members of the Colorado legal community, we are proud to       support the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be our next       Supreme Court Justice. We hold a diverse set of political       views as Republicans, Democrats, and Independents. Many of us       have been critical of actions taken by President Trump.       Nonetheless, we all agree that Judge Gorsuch is exceptionally       well qualified to join the Supreme Court. He deserves an up-      or-down vote.        We know Judge Gorsuch to be a person of utmost character.       He is fair, decent, and honest, both as a judge and as a       person. His record shows that he believes strongly in the       independence of the judiciary. Judge Gorsuch has a well-      earned reputation as an excellent jurist. He voted with the       majority in 98% of the cases he heard on the 10th Circuit, a       great portion of which were joined by judges appointed by       Democratic Presidents. Seven of his opinions have been       affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court--four unanimously--and       none has been reversed.        We ask that Colorado's Senators join together and support       this highly qualified nominee from Colorado. Regardless of       the politics involved in prior confirmation efforts,       including what many consider to be the mistreatment of Judge       Garland's nomination, a filibuster now will do Colorado no       good.        Judge Gorsuch deserves a fair shake in the confirmation       process. Please vote against a filibuster and vote for Judge       Gorsuch's confirmation to the Supreme Court.    This letter from James Lyons is another such letter talking about the  importance of the confirmation of Judge Gorsuch. I couldn't agree more  with this letter and the letter that I read.   Judge Gorsuch is an exceptionally qualified jurist, to use their  words, and he deserves a fair shake in the confirmation process that  includes a timely up-or-down vote.   I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                   February 7, 2017.      Hon. Chuck Grassley,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,      U.S. Senate.        Dear Senator Grassley: I write this letter in strong       support of the nomination and confirmation of Judge Neil       Gorsuch for Associate Justice of the United States Supreme       Court.        Judge Gorsuch has been known to me professionally for over       twenty years, and his family even longer. In the mid-      nineties, we were counsel together in successfully       representing co-defendants in a major securities matter       involving class action and derivative lawsuits in several       jurisdictions across the country as well as SEC and       Congressional investigations. Over the course of that complex       representation in the following years, I came to observe       first-hand his considerable lawyering skills, intellect,       judgment and temperament. He was one of the finest trial       lawyers with whom it has been my pleasure to be associated in       my career. We also became personal and good friends which       continued during the following years at his firm, later       during his time at the Department of Justice and since       returning to Denver to serve on the bench.        I was delighted by his appointment to the U.S. Court of       Appeals for the Tenth Circuit based here in Denver. (He       honored me by having me be one of two lawyers to introduce       him to the court at his formal investiture.) Over his years       of service on that court, he has distinguished himself with       his work ethic, keen and thorough understanding of the case       under review, his formidable analytical ability, and the       clarity of his opinions. I have read many of his opinions and       watched him in oral argument. He is engaging, courteous to       counsel and demonstrates a full and unusual appreciation for       the human impact of his decisions on the people involved.       These are the qualities of an outstanding jurist.        Judge Gorsuch has been active and an important voice in the       legal community and academy. He has written extensively,       lectured and taught in continuing legal education seminars       and served on the important federal Rules Committee, among       others. He also has found time to sit on student moot courts       and teach both ethics and federal jurisdiction at the       University of Colorado Law School. He is regularly regarded       by his students as one of their very best law professors--      effective, challenging and personable.        Judge Gorsuch's intellect, energy and deep regard for the       Constitution are well known to those of us who have worked       with him and have seen first-hand his commitment to basic       principles. Above all, his independence, fairness and       impartiality are the hallmarks of his career and his well-      earned reputation.            Sincerely,                                                    James M. Lyons.     Mr. President, I look forward to working with my  colleagues across the aisle to make sure we fill this vacancy on the  Supreme Court with one of this Nation's truly brilliant legal minds.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
