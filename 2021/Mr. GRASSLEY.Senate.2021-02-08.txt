 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, in his inaugural address, President  Biden said his ``whole soul'' was in the cause of ``Bringing America  together. Uniting our people. And uniting our Nation''--very worthy  things to speak and especially in an inaugural address.   He also recognized that Americans have serious disagreements.  Everyone knows that our country is deeply divided politically. I know  from his time in the Senate that President Biden understands that  people of good will can have honest disagreements about policy.   So he knows that unity does not mean dropping deeply held beliefs and  accepting his own policy agenda. As he said--and I have two quotes  here--``Every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause of total war''  and ``Disagreement must not lead to disunion.'' Real unity requires  rediscovering what binds us together as Americans even when we have  strongly disagreed politically.   As I have often said, our Nation is unique in human history in that  it was founded not on the basis of common ethnic identity or loyalty  to, let's say, a Monarch but on certain enduring principles. Those  principles are best articulated in the simple but elegant words of the  Declaration of Independence. And you all read these regularly, I am  sure.         We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all Men are       created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with       certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life,       Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.    It is a common commitment to this ideal that has bound us together as  Americans from the beginning. Our patriot forefathers concluded that  these principles were worth fighting for and took up arms in an  improbable quest to defeat the largest and best trained military at  that particular time. This included many Black patriots who fought for  American independence--a unifying fact that I believe deserves a  monument on the National Mall, something that I have been working  toward for years.   I want to quote Margaret Thatcher. She once observed this. It is a  fairly long quote, so bear with me.         Americans and Europeans alike sometimes forget how unique       is the United States of America. No other nation has been       created so swiftly and successfully. No other nation has been       built upon an idea--the idea of liberty. No other nation has       so successfully combined people of different races and       nations within a single culture. Both the founding fathers of       the United States and successive waves of immigrants to your       country were determined to create a new identity. Whether in       flight from persecution or from poverty, the huddled masses       have, with few exceptions, welcomed American values, the       American way of life and American opportunities. And America       herself has bound them to her with powerful bonds of       patriotism and pride. The European nations are not and can       never be like this. They are the product of history and not       of philosophy.    End of Thatcher's quote.   This quote from a British leader is one of the best summaries that I  have read about American exceptionalism. The term ``American  exceptionalism'' is often misunderstood, perhaps due to  [[Page S562]]  a quirk of the English language. Merriam-Webster's dictionary gives  three definitions of ``exceptional": one, ``forming an exception,'' as  they give an example: ``RARE, an exceptional number of rainy days'';  or, two, ``better than average: SUPERIOR, exceptional skill'' are the  words they expand on ``average''; ``deviating from the norm, such as  having above or below average intelligence'' or physical disability.   Many people here and abroad assume that those who talk about American  exceptionalism are just using the second definition and simply  asserting that the United States is better than any other country, and  that is a wrong interpretation   American exceptionalism is an assertion of the plain fact that  America's foundation is very different from that of most other nations.  However, our foundation is increasingly under attack from both the  right and the left. Both the 1619 Project and White nationalists assert  that America's founding principles are alive and that the United States  was founded along ethnic lines.   Oddly enough, this was a position taken by John C. Calhoun in the  U.S. Senate when he articulated an alternative to the founding  principles intended to justify maintaining slavery in perpetuity.  Fortunately, Abraham Lincoln, who revered the Declaration of  Independence, prevailed.   The notion that our founding principles are a lie isn't just bad  history; it breaks the bonds that unite Americans of all backgrounds.   The 1776 Commission was established specifically to ``enable a rising  generation to understand the history and principles of the founding of  the United States in 1776 and to strive to perform a more perfect  Union.''   The introduction to ``The 1776 Report'' states that ``a rediscovery  of our shared identity rooted in our founding principles is the path to  a renewed American unity and a confident American future.''   I could not agree more. That is why I was disappointed to see  President Biden terminate this commission the same day he took office  after making his call for unity. The call to unity is exactly what the  President asked for in his inaugural address.   What specifically in that 1776 Commission document does President  Biden disagree with? Yes, the report is critical of far-left efforts to  denigrate our founding principles, but it is also an important  corrective to the alt-right effort to import European-style ethno- nationalism, which is also deeply un-American in every sense.   ``The 1776 Report'' calls for ``a restoration of American education,  which can only be grounded on a history of those principles that is  `accurate, honest, unifying, inspiring, and ennobling.' ''   By contrast, California has proposed an ethnic study curriculum that  is rooted in the fundamental divisive tenants of critical race theory,  with its focus on separate groups of Americans into different degrees  of oppressor and oppressed.   Interestingly, despite the California curriculum's focus on victims  of prejudice, discussion of anti-Semitism is omitted in favor of  criticism of Israel. This curriculum also totally skips over the life  and work of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Remember his dream? I quote  that statement that he made:         It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a       dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the       true meaning of its creed: ``We hold these truths to be self-      evident, that all men are created equal.''    Now, that is a very unifying statement. I encourage all Americans to  read ``The 1776 Report'' for yourself. See if you don't agree with the  central message that shared attachment to our timeless founding  principles is what binds us as a nation.
