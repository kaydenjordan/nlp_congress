 Mr. Speaker, as a Christian, a father, and conservative  Member of Congress, I make no secret about it. I am absolutely 100  percent, unapologetically pro-life. I believe life begins at  conception, and I believe that we must do everything we can to protect  the innocent children living in their mother's wombs who are unable to  protect themselves.   This week, House Republicans and the House will be considering H.R.  4368, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration,  and Related Agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 2024. This  bill not only funds many valuable programs on which our farmers and  families rely to get food and fiber to our tables, but it also funds  the Food and Drug Administration which plays a vital role in the food  and drug safety of our country.   Recently, under President Joe Biden, the Food and Drug  Administration, or FDA, has done the unthinkable: It has approved and  expanded the use of mifepristone--a drug that induces a chemical  abortion--for delivery by mail.   This is wrong on so many levels. For starters, let me be clear: this  is a deadly drug not only for the baby in the womb, but it can also be  deadly for the expectant mother taking it.   According to a scholarly article in ``Issues in Law and Medicine''  titled: ``Deaths and Severe Adverse Events after the use of  Mifepristone as an Abortifacient from September 2000 to February  2019,'' out of 2,660 codable adverse reactions, 20 resulted in deaths,  529 were life-threatening to the mother, and 1,957 were severe adverse  reactions.   Given the potentially deadly side effects, what possible  justification does the FDA have to approve such a dangerous drug for  distribution through the mail, allowing patients to self-administer it  without close medical supervision given the potentially dangerous side  effects?   Giving a political payback to the abortion industrial complex is not  a justification. In fact, there is no justification whatsoever, in my  view. Regardless of where you stand on the debate about abortion, this  is truly abhorrent.   I don't believe anyone in their right mind would say that this drug  is safe  [[Page H3902]]  for human consumption. We already know for sure that consuming this  drug ends one human life and it has the potential to actually end two  lives every time a pregnant woman takes it.   That is why Republicans have included language in the appropriations  bill that funds the FDA that prohibits the use of this dangerous and  deadly mail-order chemical abortion drug. I hope my colleagues on the  other side of the aisle can recognize the clear and present danger this  FDA policy represents and make the commonsense decision to support this  provision rather than trying to strip it out in the amendment process.   We can only hope for a future where these practices finally come to  an end. Until then, conservatives like me will continue fighting to  rein in the FDA's reckless approval of dangerous drugs that put women's  health in danger and to keep all innocent and voiceless children safe  from this abhorrent practice.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, this week House Republicans and the House of  Representatives will be considering the fiscal year 2024 Agriculture,  Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies  appropriations bill that prioritizes agencies and programs that protect  our Nation's food and drug supply and support America's farmers,  ranchers, and rural communities, like the ones I represent in  Tennessee.   As a farmer and former State agriculture commissioner, I cannot  overly stress the importance of the programs in this bill and how  farmers and families rely on them. Whether it is rural broadband, WIC,  or supplemental nutrition, the programs in this bill go a long way to  make sure folks have enough food and fiber to be productive citizens in  our society.   That is not all this bill does: it reins in wasteful Washington  spending, protects the lives of unborn children, and prohibits  agricultural land purchases by those associated with foreign  adversaries.   Mr. Speaker, I applaud the work of the Appropriations Committee to  include these provisions.                            ____________________
