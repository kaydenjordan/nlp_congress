 Mr. President, devotion, commitment,  resilience--these are just a few of the words that describe the  professionals who comprise Maryland's 24 local boards of education.   The dedicated public servants who lead the school systems in Maryland  counties and Baltimore City act with deep commitment to their  communities and their time-intensive school board duties. Maryland  school board members make critical budget and planning decisions, adopt  policies to create supportive learning environments for all students,  engage with parents, students, school staff, and other community  stakeholders, work closely with superintendents, respond to crises, and  undergo ongoing training to carry out effective governance, continue to  grow as leaders, and stay up-to-date on the latest best practices.   As devoted professionals who serve students, school systems, and  their communities at large, Maryland school board members face an array  of daunting challenges every day, challenges made significantly more  difficult and complex during the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet Maryland's 24  school boards have consistently risen to these challenges, working to  ensure excellence in public education throughout the State.   School board members come from all backgrounds and professions. They  may not agree on every issue, but they unite and volunteer to serve  under the strong conviction that Maryland students come first.   Because of the extraordinary, continuing commitment of those who  serve on our school boards to helping Maryland students grow, thrive,  and excel each day--and with my ongoing commitment to Maryland public  education in mind--I am proud to recognize January as Maryland School  Board Recognition Month.                            ____________________
