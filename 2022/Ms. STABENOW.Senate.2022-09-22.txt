 Mr. President, I first want to echo Senator Coons'  comments on the DISCLOSE Act and how unfortunate it was we could not  get just 10 Republicans to join us to be able to end dark money and  foreign--the potential of foreign dollars going into elections. So I  want to thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership both in the House  and in the Senate on this real important issue.                            ____________________     Mr. President, as everybody in the Chamber knows, I am  extremely proud to be from Michigan. Our State leads the world in  innovation. We created and built the automobile, the automotive  assembly line, and the American middle class along with it.   And today, our workers are still putting the world on four wheels-- and really amazing wheels right now.   I got to show one of our Nation's foremost car guys, President Biden,  some of Michigan's latest and greatest creations during last week's  Detroit Auto Show. He was so happy behind the wheel of Chevy's new  Corvette that I was a little worried he was going to put on his  aviators and drive right out of the exhibition center. It took a lot to  get him out of that car, he was so into it.   He was inspired, and we all were. Of course, the auto show is always  inspiring, but this year it was even more, and that is because our  Nation is in the middle of a manufacturing renaissance. And I don't say  that lightly. We are in the middle of a manufacturing renaissance.   Democrats in Congress, along with President Biden and Vice President  Harris, are helping to revitalize American manufacturing. With tiny  House and Senate majorities and the car guy in the White House,  Democrats have done more to advance manufacturing in America than at  any point in the past 70 years. We are not just bringing back the jobs  lost during the pandemic; we are going far beyond that. Already, nearly  700,000 new manufacturing jobs have been created under the Biden  administration. This represents the strongest manufacturing job growth  since the 1950s--in our lifetime. In 2021 alone, more manufacturing  jobs were created. Just last year, more manufacturing jobs were created  than in any single year, any 1 year in nearly 30 years, which is  extraordinary, and it is exciting.   And over the past year, the construction of new manufacturing  facilities in the United States has grown by over 100 percent--116  percent. Meanwhile, 80 percent of our CEOs in a recent survey were  either in the process of moving manufacturing operations from China or  were seriously considering doing so. So we are seeing a real shift  about bringing jobs home, and we have been providing the incentives and  the support to do that. So that is really great news because we know if  you are going to have an economy, somebody has to make something-- somebody has to make something. And, frankly, that is what we do in  Michigan. We make things. We innovate. And then we make things even  better and then we do it over and over again.   Of course, we can't make much of anything if we don't have the  semiconducting chips--these little microchips the size of a nail.  Whoever thought that not having microchips would shut down a whole  plant, and that is what has happened in Michigan, unfortunately, during  the height of the supply chain breakdowns.   A lack of chips means that auto manufacturers have to idle plants.  Assembly lines shut down, and workers get sent home. Parking lots at  plants fill up with cars that can't be sold because of these missing  chips. And I see many of them not very far from my home in Lansing, MI.   Car lots that normally are full of different makes and models sit  empty, and the price of new and used cars goes up and up without these  chips--all because of a tiny piece of technology no bigger than a  thumbnail.   That is why the legislation that we passed, the CHIPS and Science  Act--this legislation that was signed into law is really a big deal.  This law is bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to the United  States where it belongs. Instead of the majority of what we need being  overseas, it is now going to be coming home and creating millions of  jobs in the process, and that is, frankly, great news. Currently, U.S.  manufacturers only have 12 percent of the world's semiconductor  manufacturing--12 percent. And it actually was down from 37 percent in  the nineties.  [[Page S4957]]  And now we are going to reverse that and bring those jobs home.   We are already seeing it make a difference. Intel is building new  semiconductor fabricator plants in Ohio and Arizona. This year, Micron  Technologies is breaking ground for a new $15 billion factory in Idaho,  and we would love to see them come our way. It is a great beginning,  and we are just getting started.   The American manufacturing boom goes far beyond semiconductors,  though. The investments we have made in research and development will  ensure that the next generation of clean energy of telecommunications  and transportation technologies will be developed and manufactured  right here in America as well.   President Biden got a taste of what that was like in the auto show  when he got behind the wheel of an all-electric Cadillac Lyriq and  drove it across the floor. Again, we were hoping he was going to  restrain himself from driving it off the exhibition floor.   Democrats provided a huge boost to manufacturing, including clean  energy manufacturing, through the Inflation Reduction Act, which  unfortunately none of our Republican colleagues voted for. It created  new and expanded tax incentives for the next generation of clean energy  technologies. I have constantly been talking about the importance of  battery production tax credits--production tax credits, meaning you  don't get the credit unless it is actually produced in the United  States. We have done that now. That is now law.   And the new solar manufacturing tax credit is going to help American  manufacturers like Hemlock Semiconductor create new products and good  jobs as well. They create one-third of all the polysilicon materials  for solar panels, but the production has been in other countries,  primarily, China. Now, with the production tax credit, the incentive  will be to build them, to make them here in America.   The CHIPS and Science Act also provided $11 billion to develop  cutting-edge technologies, including up to three new Manufacturing USA  initiatives. We are proud to have two Manufacturing USA initiatives  already in place from the Obama administration. There is the  Lightweight Innovations for Tomorrow, or LIFT, and Michigan State  University's Scale-Up Research Facility, or SURF. Both are located in  the same facility in Detroit, and LIFT projects include research into  better welding processes for Navy ships and an anti-rollover system for  military humvees. SURF is partnering with the Department of Energy and  Ford and GM to make sure that America is a leader in advanced  technologies--advanced vehicle technologies.   And the CHIPS and Science package also more than doubled funding to  develop technologies that are crucial to our national and economic  security. That includes cyber security and biotechnology and artificial  intelligence and quantum computing, advanced materials science, and 6G  communications.   Now, if we are going to be inventing all of this new stuff, we also  need workers. You hear that all the time. We need workers who are  skilled to produce these things, and that is something that we as  Democrats have been laser-focused on also. In everything that we have  done, there has been a workforce development piece of it, which is so  critical. The CHIPS and Science Act includes dedicated funding for the  development of semiconductor workforce opportunities.   The Inflation Reduction Act includes incentives for clean energy  manufacturers to create high-paying jobs and apprenticeship programs,  which we know are so successful and so needed. And we have also  invested in workforce development programs in regions all around the  country.   The Build Back Better regional challenge awarded $1 billion to 120  projects across 24 States to help people get the skills that they need  for these great new jobs. These projects are building a sustainable  mariculture workforce in Alaska, training aerospace workers in Kansas,  and ensuring that Michigan has the highly skilled workers needed to  build the advanced vehicles on display at the Detroit Auto Show.   One thing I am also particularly proud of in all that we have been  doing around manufacturing as well is that we have worked to ensure  that our tax dollars are spent on American products made by American  workers and American companies. Now, that sounds like a no-brainer. I  know, Mr. President, you agree with that, but we have had laws on the  books for a long time that have not been enforced. There has not been  transparency about what was going on, and now they are going to have to  be accountable and transparent.   ``Buy American'' needs to be more than a slogan on a bumper sticker,  and now it is. We have ushered in the most significant expansion of  ``Buy American'' policies in decades, including a new Made in America  office at the Department of Commerce that is working with each Agency  to make sure that they are exhausting all the possibilities to buy  American before they are allowed to have a waiver to that provision,  which is very important.   Decades from now, people are going to look back at the past 2 years  as a real turning point. I really believe that. It is the point when we  really truly stopped talking and started acting to rebuild American  manufacturing. It is the point when we created hundreds of thousands of  good-paying jobs, the kind of jobs that support families. And it is the  point when we started to really bring jobs home.   Democrats are standing on the side of American manufacturing. We are  standing on the side of good-paying American union jobs. We are  standing on the side of the American worker and our American middle  class. And we are building things in America again--building things in  America again--and that is really good news.   I yield the floor.
