 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of my bill, the Global Hope  Act. I am proud to have introduced this bill with my good friend,  Chairman Eliot Engel. I thank the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr.  Phillips) for his strong support and his personal story. I also thank  the co-chair of the Childhood Cancer Caucus, Jackie Speier, for her  tireless work with me in the caucus to help these children.   I have been a tireless advocate for these children with cancer since  I first came to Congress. In 2010, I helped found the Childhood Cancer  Caucus really to give a voice to patients, advocates, and the children.   This endeavor is deeply personal for me, as well. Growing up in  elementary school, my best friend passed away from leukemia. Back then,  it was a death sentence.   Since founding the caucus, we have been very successful. Congress  passed bipartisan legislation to improve cancer treatment options,  boost research opportunities, and address health issues of the nearly  500,000 long-term childhood cancer survivors.   Today, childhood cancer is largely treatable with an 80 percent, 5- year survival rate in the United States.   Unfortunately, in developing countries, the opposite is true.  Children diagnosed with cancer in developing countries have an 80  percent mortality rate.   Madam Speaker, in sub-Saharan Africa, the mortality rate of children  diagnosed with cancer is as high as 90 percent. This says nothing of  the tens of thousands of cases that are believed to go undiagnosed  every year.   I truly believe that a child's birthplace should not determine their  fate from cancer. That is why I introduced the Global Hope Act.   My bill authorizes the Secretary of State to pursue public-private  partnerships, increase access to treatment options, train health  professionals, and, ultimately, improve care for children with cancer  in developing countries. These partnerships will leverage decades of  U.S. investments to strengthen health infrastructure and build the  capacity of health ministries.   This legislation does not take away funds from other critical global  health interventions and infectious disease efforts. Rather, these  public-private partnerships will build on existing programs to improve  childhood cancer survival rates.   Organizations such as Texas Children's Hospital and St. Jude, private  sector partners such as Bristol-Myers Squibb and Teva, and nonprofits  such as ACCESS are already starting this important work and are now  seeing results in Botswana and other nations. These efforts are also  supported by the World Health Organization's Global Childhood Cancer  Initiative.   Launched in 2018, the WHO aims to build political support and  institutional capacity to treat childhood cancer in developing  countries. The initiative set a goal of saving an additional 1 million  lives by 2030.   For the past two decades, the United States has been a global leader  in funding health programs around the world, and I am proud to support  this lifesaving work.   Most recently, we passed a resolution affirming the U.S. commitment  to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and secured  robust funding in the fiscal year 2020 appropriations bill.   Our work to fight HIV/AIDS and eradicate other infectious diseases is  far from over. But there is a critical opportunity to build on the  successes of these global health programs and integrate projects aimed  at improving childhood cancer care and available treatment options.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important,  lifesaving measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I yield myself  such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, let me thank my dear friend, Jackie Speier, for her  leadership on this issue and as the co-chair of the caucus. I think we  can prove that, in this toxic, partisan, difficult time in this  Congress, we can work across the aisle, Republican and Democrat, but  most importantly as Americans, to get good things done for not only the  American people but for the world and save the children of the world.   I think Congresswoman Speier is correct. We passed a lot of bills  together that have saved lives, but I  [[Page H590]]  think this one probably is the most profound one. It is very difficult  to pass a bill in the Congress, much less get it signed into law, but  when you pass a bill and see it saving lives, that is perhaps the most  remarkable and gratifying experience I have personally had in my eight  terms in Congress.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman so much for her friendship.   Madam Speaker, in closing, I remember being in Texas Children's  Hospital in September 2018 to hear from the President of Botswana about  the project Global HOPE initiative inspired by Baylor College of  Medicine and their early work against HIV/AIDS and the epidemic in  Africa. Global HOPE is starting to deliver childhood cancer care in  sub-Saharan Africa, as I speak.   At the event, when I met the President of Botswana, where the Global  HOPE Act was recently constructed in a new pediatric facility in  Botswana, which I will be visiting next month with my little, childhood  cancer survivor, Sadie Keller. It is starting to train a new generation  of Botswanan oncologists.   What I was most impressed by was when he told me about the legacy of  PEPFAR and what we did as a Nation. He said: PEPFAR saved a generation  of my people from extinction--from ``extinction.''   It is my hope that this bill saves a generation of children from this  dreaded disease. I believe that childhood cancer can be the next  successful Global HOPE initiative that will save lives.   Madam Speaker, I want to thank, particularly, Dr. Poplack, who was  the chief oncologist at Texas Children's. He is the one who is  responsible for this initiative. We are taking their initiative and  turning it into law in the Congress. I will be there next month to  commemorate International Children's Cancer Day.   Madam Speaker, I do want to reference, too, my little childhood  cancer fighter and survivor, Sadie Keller. She came into my office, and  there are a lot of lobbyists in this town, but the children had no  voice. They had no power. That is why Jackie and I formed the Childhood  Cancer Caucus, to give them a voice.                                time  1400    When she entered my office--she is 7 years old here--in her pink  dress, I knew I had met somebody very special. I canceled my calendar,  my schedule for the rest of the day, and I took her on a tour of the  Capitol.   Here we are looking--we had no idea they were even taking pictures-- but I took her to the Rotunda in the Capitol. I remember we spun around  and looked at the top of the Capitol.   Then I took her out to the Speaker's balcony, one of the most  beautiful views in this Capitol building. Looking out on the horizon  toward the future, seeing the ominous dark clouds, but also a ray of  sunshine. The sunshine that is coming in, the sunshine that little  Sadie has brought to my life, the sunshine that we are trying to bring  to all these children out there who have gone through some really tough  experiences. I have met many of them, like the Congressman from  Minnesota's daughter, and it is very heartbreaking to see them in the  hospitals. Some survive, and some don't.   But this effort will take it to the next step, to take our fight  against this dreaded disease. We have done so much to help children in  the United States. The FDA's approval of CAR T, which takes your own  immune system and attacks your own cancer through your own T cells,  rather than injecting chemo--which is really a derivative of World War  I mustard gas, which has been banned from the battlefield, which kills  the cancer just before it kills you.   You can imagine the survivorship issues with these children, because  they have the rest of their lives, if they survive, to deal with.   So, I want to thank all those friends of mine on the other side of  the aisle for helping me move this forward. This is a momentous day for  our fight against childhood cancer. It is a momentous day to take it  global and take the fight globally.   I look forward to this bill's passage in the Senate and it being  signed into law.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Iranian people and our  condemnation of the Iranian regime's crackdown on legitimate protests.   I want to first thank Congressman Deutch for bringing this important  legislation, introducing this resolution. And I am proud to be a  cosponsor of it.   Twice in the past 3 months, the Iranian people have bravely raised  their voices to protest the conduct of the despotic Iranian regime. And  both times, these peaceful, popular demonstrations have been met with  utter violence.   In November, protestors across Iran voiced their anger at an abrupt  increase in gasoline prices. This soon broadened to voicing their anger  at the regime as a whole.   The Islamic Republic of Iran responded with brutal force. Security  thugs opened fire on unarmed protestors. The regime cut off the  internet in an attempt to silence the voice of the people and suppress  the evidence of the security forces' bloodshed.   Despite the regime's efforts, the world still knows about their  cruelty. We have all seen the videos of security forces shooting  innocent people on the streets. The regime killed as many as 1,500  people, by far the largest and most violent crackdown since the 1979  revolution.   Just a few weeks later, the Iranian people were once again furious  with their government. This time, it was because the regime shot down a  commercial airliner, killing 176 innocent people, many of whom were  Iranian. Even worse, the regime did not admit to having done so for 3  days. They intentionally lied to their own people and to the world.   Once again, security forces fired on peaceful protestors.   The broad frustration with this cruel, lying regime is evident. An  Iranian Olympic medalist announced she was defecting because of  ``hypocrisy, lies, injustice, and flattery.''   Iran's State TV anchor resigned, saying, ``It was very hard for me to  believe the killing of my own countrymen. I apologize for lying to you  on television for the last 13 years.''   With this resolution, we declare that the House of Representatives  stands with the people of Iran demanding accountability from their  leaders.   I thank the President for loudly and clearly supporting the rights of  the Iranian people. The President has urged the regime not to use  violence against their own people. He has also worked to hold the  Iranian regime accountable for its cruelty.   The administration has actively sought information about the  perpetrators of violence through its tip line. Using those tips, the  administration has sanctioned those with blood on their hands, such as  the IRGC commander who oversaw a massacre in November, killing as many  as 148 people. I want to thank the administration for taking concrete  action to support the people of Iran.   This resolution is our opportunity in the Congress to show the same  support. It is an important step, but we can and must do more. Our next  course of action should be to pass my bill that holds the Iranian  officials accountable for serious human rights abuses.   So let's stand together as Americans and keep the process and  pressure up on this dangerous regime.   And let me just say, I have talked to many Iranians throughout this  country, and the people of Iran are watching this Chamber. They are  watching what we say here. Our voices do matter in Iran and to the  Iranian people who are in the United States.    So I want to again thank Congressman Deutch for bringing this  important resolution that stands up for the people of Iran.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  South Carolina (Mr. Wilson), the ranking member on the Subcommittee for  the Middle East, North Africa, and International Terrorism.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McClintock).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, I met with a group of Iranian Americans just this last  weekend, and I talked to them about their friends in Iran who are  fighting this oppression. I saw the video, the internet feed that  they are able to get out of country. One of the problems has been they  shut down the internet. They control the internet in Iran because it  was built with security in mind, first.    It is very difficult to get communications both inside and outside of  Iran, but we are working on those technologies today, Madam Speaker, so  that these people can communicate with the outside world. They are  being held hostage themselves by the Ayatollah, who held our Embassy  officials hostage in 1979. They are listening to our voices here in the  Congress, and they are shooting out texts and emails, and we are  finding ways to get them to communicate.   There are 80 million people in Iran, once a great empire, the Persian  empire that brought us so many great things; and now, under this  oppressive theocracy, the majority of these people  [[Page H594]]  do not support their own oppressive, brutal killing regime.   The Islamic Republic of Iran, in my judgment, their days are limited,  and it is time for the people of Iran to take back their country. And  when I say this to the people of Iran, know that the American people  stand with the people of Iran. Know that this House stands with the  people of Iran and that this Congress and President stand with the  people of Iran.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 4331, the  Tibetan Policy and Support Act.   The Chinese Communist Party's, or CCP's, crusade against faith is the  greatest threat to religious freedom in the world today. This bill  reminds us that the religious persecution didn't begin under Chairman  Xi. The CCP has always hated and feared religion.   Since China invaded Tibet in 1950, the CCP has tried to dismantle  Tibetan Buddhism. In 1995, Chinese authorities kidnapped the second  highest Tibetan faith leader and replaced him with a fraud.   The Chinese Communist Party wants to ensure Tibetan leaders are  chosen according to their political agenda, not according to Tibetan  Buddhist religious practices.   This bill states that the United States will not accept the CCP's  destruction of Tibetan Buddhism, we will not accept fraudulent  religious leaders appointed by Beijing, and we will not accept the  CCP's control of deeply spiritual beliefs.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, let me first commend the Congressman from  Massachusetts and his great work on this issue. He has been a really  strong fighter for democracy and freedom-loving peoples around the  world, whether it be the Hong Kong Democracy Act or the Tibetan people  and their persecution in China. I thank Chairman McGovern so much, from  the bottom of my heart.   Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Yoho), the Republican leader of the Asia, the Pacific, and  Nonproliferation Subcommittee.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Again, I want to thank Chairman McGovern for strengthening U.S.  support for Tibet at this critical moment.   As the Tibetan community prepares for the Dalai Lama's succession, we  must rein in the Communist Party's attempts to destroy the autonomy of  Tibetan Buddhism.   I also want to thank the gentleman from Minnesota, and Speaker Pelosi  for her strong support for human rights and religious liberties. The  gentlewoman stood on the floor when we debated the Hong Kong Human  Rights and Democracy Act. That is what we do as Americans: We defend  freedom and we defend democracy. This Nation was formed upon the idea  of religious freedom and religious liberty.   Under the Communist Party of China's rule, religion really doesn't  exist. In fact, it almost prohibits religious freedom. It persecutes  religious freedom. It kills religious freedom.   The Dalai Lama himself was exiled to India where he is today. The  Communist Party of China is brutally murdering and oppressing the  Tibetan people; oppressing religious freedom and liberty, oppressing  the Uighurs where they sit in camps, as I speak, with no voice, and,  yes, they suppress the Christian community as well.   So, again, I want to thank my friends on the other side of the aisle,  and I thank Speaker Pelosi so much for supporting this legislation as  we stood together to support Hong Kong and the people of Hong Kong.   We spoke earlier today about supporting the people of Iran against  theocracy and oppression, and we support the Tibetan people in their  effort to exercise their religious freedom and liberty.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Keeping Girls in  School Act.   I want to thank Representative Frankel and Representative Brooks for  their leadership on this legislation.   The United States has been a global leader in funding programs to  support women and girls from around the world. We recognize the  importance of empowering women to succeed, and that starts with  receiving an education.   This legislation codifies the existing U.S. strategy to empower  adolescent girls, which coordinates efforts between the Department of  State, USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Peace Corps,  and PEPFAR to ensure that our development assistance programs are  addressing barriers to girls' attendance in schools. It also supports  efforts to ensure girls receive a quality secondary education and have  the support necessary to stay in school.   We know that when women and girls are educated and supported, they  are more likely to invest in their families and in their communities.   Last year, I was honored to travel to Cote d'Ivoire to launch the  Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative alongside Ivanka  Trump and a Senate delegation. W-GDP seeks to reach 50 million women in  the developing world by 2025 through efforts to empower and enable  women to be entrepreneurs and productive members of the workforce.  [[Page H603]]    I was also proud to be a cosponsor of the Women's Entrepreneurship  and Economic Empowerment Act which was signed into law last year. We  must continue our bipartisan efforts to ensure United States' support  for women and girls around the world is strong.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the Keeping Girls in  School Act, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Indiana (Mrs. Brooks), who is the lead Republican cosponsor of this  bill.    Madam Speaker, yesterday in this Chamber we honored the  life of a dear friend of mine, a colleague I came into the Congress  with in 2005, Michael Fitzpatrick, and it was quite an honor to know  him and to call him my friend. With that, I want to yield as much time  as he may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick),  his brother and a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Waltz), a distinguished member of the United States  military who served our country so well overseas in some very dangerous  places.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   We have heard some really powerful testimony about the rights and the  role of women throughout the world, and I think back to my own time as  a counterterrorism Federal prosecutor, to chairman of the Homeland  Security Committee, and now my role on the Foreign Affairs Committee.  Where women are oppressed, democracy and freedom is oppressed. Where  extremism exists, the rights of women are denied.   I also want to thank you, Madam Speaker, Ms. Frankel, for your  leadership in bringing this bill to the floor.   It is a national security issue. I really view it that way because,  where women are empowered, we don't have extremism.   Chairman Engel and I will be at the Canadian Embassy this night  talking about the Global Fragility Act and the ONE Campaign and Bono's  efforts to  [[Page H605]]  stabilize the world, stabilize this whole region from extremism. What  we found, whether it was Boko Haram taking 270 Catholic grade school  girls hostage, to the Taliban raining down on educated women or women  trying to get an education, to the story of Ms. Yousafzai, to killing  women in the streets, it is absolutely unacceptable.   I am proud today that we stand as Americans and not as partisans  standing for the rights of young women. I have four daughters myself,  and they live in freedom, and they know education is important. But  women around the world deserve this right. Regardless of where you are  born, women and girls around the world deserve this right.   We have seen it from Afghanistan, to the Sahel, to Pakistan and,  really, all over the world. I think the number, 130 million. I love the  quote that the biggest threat to extremism is a girl with a book. That  is what we are going to change.   Madam Speaker, thank you for your boldness and your courage and  leadership in bringing this to the floor, and I yield back the balance  of my time.
