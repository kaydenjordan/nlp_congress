 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business.    I will yield when the minority leader, Senator Schumer,  comes to the floor.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  and the Senator from New York (Mrs. Gillibrand) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  and the Senator from New York (Mrs. Gillibrand) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  and the Senator from New York (Mrs. Gillibrand) are necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  is necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker)  is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, in 1901, superintendent of Joliet Township  High School J. Stanley Brown and University of Chicago president  William Rainey Harper committed themselves to an historic experiment.  They founded Joliet Junior College, the Nation's first public community  college with six students as the initial enrollment. Brown and Harper  designed the school for students who wanted to remain in the community,  but also wanted to pursue a college education.   The community college system is vastly different than Harper and  Brown's initial work today. Community colleges are helping millions of  Americans carve a pathway to middle-class prosperity and a chance to  fulfill the American Dream.   Earlier this month, Mike Monaghan, a champion of Illinois community  colleges with more than 40 years of legislative and higher education  experience, retired from the Illinois Community College Trustees  Association. During his time there, he worked hard to make sure  Illinois has some of the finest colleges in the country. Mike will  certainly be missed.   Originally from Springfield, he earned an associate arts degree from  Lincoln Land Community College, a bachelor's degree in political  science from Bradley University, and a master's degree in legal studies  and administrative law from the University of Illinois at Springfield.   I have known Mike for decades from our days as staffers in the  Illinois State Senate. Mike was fighting for improving education in the  State as the principal staff to the State senate's higher education  committee when I was legal counsel to the State senate judiciary  committee. He also was my neighbor, living a block away from me. I  might add Mike also was a precinct captain for a couple of my races,  too.   In 1989, Mike became the Illinois Community College Trustees  Associations director of government relations. In this role, he  developed a statewide advocacy program and regularly organized trips to  Washington, DC, with students. One of his major efforts was the  successful implementation of a State insurance program for community  college retirees. In 1998, the Illinois Society of Association  Executives awarded him with their Government Relations Award for the  program.   Mike's hard work led him to become the ICCTA's executive director in  2005. For the past 14 years, he has continued fighting for resources  for community colleges. He earned the Cook County College Teachers  Union 2008 Innovation in Education Award for his leadership in  promoting community colleges.   When community colleges are not funded properly, the costs fall on  students. When Mike started, some remarked that community colleges were  13th and 14th year schooling and dismissed them as ``Tinker Toy Tech.''  This is certainly not the case today.   Today, 35,000 students are enrolled at Joliet Junior College, and  Illinois has 519,000 students enrolled in community colleges. More and  more students know community colleges are one of the best investments  in education for students and are the best alternative in the  competitive college marketplace.   Americans hold more than $1.4 trillion in student debt, making it the  largest household debt after mortgages. Community colleges, with low  tuition rates and quality educational programs, are a key to breaking  the debt stranglehold of our current higher education system.  [[Page S3837]]    I want to take this time to honor Mike for his hard work in making  Illinois one of the top community college States. The future of William  Rainey Harper and J. Stanley Brown's experiment looks bright because of  Mike's work. We thank him for his service and look forward to his next  chapter in life.                            ____________________
