 Madam Speaker, the Biden administration  intentionally opened our southern border and empowered drug cartels and  human traffickers to flood illegal immigrants into our country with no  vetting and no COVID testing or vaccine requirements.   Secretary Mayorkas admitted on Friday that the 12,000 Haitian  migrants in Del Rio, Texas, who were released into the U.S., were not  tested for COVID or subject to any vaccine mandates.   President Biden and Secretary Blinken promised rigorous vetting for  the Afghan nationals they flew into our country, but so far we have  seen several arrested for sexually assaulting children and assaulting a  female servicemember while on U.S. soil.   This is outrageous.   The Biden administration has a double standard, treating American  citizens worse than foreign nationals.   This is what it means to put America last.   Instead of addressing the root cause of Biden's border crisis, House  Democrats are now ramming through President Biden's reckless $4.3  trillion socialist agenda, which includes amnesty and free college for  illegal immigrants.    Americans want secure borders and sound immigration. Open borders and  amnesty is the end of America.                            ____________________
