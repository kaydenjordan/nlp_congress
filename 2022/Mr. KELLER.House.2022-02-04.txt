 Madam Speaker, today I recognize corrections officer and  Local 148 Union President Andy Kline, who is retiring after 25 years of  service at USP Lewisburg and FCC Allenwood.   In Congress it has been my pleasure to work with Andy on issues  related to the Bureau of Prisons. His insight has been vital for our  team in creating the Bureau of Prisons Reform Caucus and working on  legislation to improve staffing shortages, inmate security, and  emergency preparedness.   In addition to his career with the Bureau of Prisons, Andy served in  the Army Reserves for 8 years and is heavily involved in helping others  in his community. Andy is a Pennsylvania native and a dedicated servant  who always puts others before himself.   While his retirement is well deserved, Andy's impact and leadership  at the BOP will be missed.   Andy, thank you for the sacrifices you have made to keep our  community safe. Enjoy your retirement with your family and  congratulations on an outstanding career of service.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Foxx for yielding.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to amendment No. 260 which  excludes certain educational institutions from participating in Federal  Pell Grant Programs. It is absurd to prevent students from seeking an  education, a quality education from the institution of their choice  simply because that institution pays taxes. Get that. They pay taxes  and people can't go to college there.   Meaningful education reform must establish a level playing field and  give students more choice in how financial aid is used. A 4-year degree  from a public college is not for everyone. The question to closing the  skills gap and solving the labor shortage is rewarding institutions  that demonstrate success and allow students to determine their own  futures.   Instead of limiting their choices, my legislation, the CHOICE Act,  would allow students in short-term occupational programs to utilize  financial aid  [[Page H959]]  for workforce readiness programs, which are needed now more than ever.   Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I urge my  colleagues to oppose amendment No. 260.
