 Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about  inflation. And one thing is sure, Joe Biden is the President of high  prices.   New numbers are out today. This morning, we found that inflation  remains the worst it has been in 40 years--40 years. Now, we knew that  today's inflation numbers were going to be bad for Americans and bad  for the administration, but the numbers today are worse than people  thought.   Prices rose nearly 8 percent in just the last year. That means we are  now seeing more inflation in the last 13 months under President Joe  Biden than we did in the previous 4 years. And families are suffering.  Prices are going up, but wages are not keeping up. Last week, we found  out that wages, in terms of an escalation, had slowed down a bit, which  means that people are falling further and further behind. Wages just  cannot keep up with the prices that continue to go up. Month after  month after month, the American people have found themselves falling  further and further and further behind.   I remember when Joe Biden told all of us that inflation would be  ``transitory.'' He kind of laughed about it. He  [[Page S1079]]  said it over and over again. And then, in December, he said inflation  had ``peaked.'' Mr. President, inflation had not peaked. Joe Biden,  once again, dead wrong.   Now, the American people are reminded about this every time they go  to the gas station, every time they go to the grocery store, every time  they go out to purchase goods.   So why is this happening? What has happened to America under Joe  Biden and the mismanagement of this Democratic administration that has  the House, the Senate, and the White House?   Well, there are two main things. One is Democrats' spending,  excessive spending. The other, of course: Democrats' restrictions on  American energy.   One year ago, Joe Biden signed the largest spending bill in American  history. Democrats put $2 trillion on America's credit card. They  flooded the country with government cash, and prices went up. And ever  since that day, prices have been going up faster than wages. There is  still no end in sight. The painful truth of all of this is energy  prices, food prices all across the country are going to continue to go  up thanks to the mismanagement of Joe Biden and this administration.    Today, a gallon of gas in the United States is the highest it has  ever been--ever. When Joe Biden took office, the average price of  gasoline in America was $2.38 a gallon; and today, it is about $2 a  gallon more than it was then. Coming from my home State of Wyoming,  where people drive more miles per capita than any other State in the  country, people in my State are really feeling the pain of the  mismanagement by Joe Biden and the Democrats.   If we think it is bad in Wyoming, let's go to the liberal paradise of  California. I don't know what it is in the Presiding Officer's home  State of Hawaii, but in California, it is $5.60 a gallon. Summer is  coming, and people are expecting the prices to get even higher.   So what is Joe Biden's answer to this? He is blaming everything on  Vladimir Putin--everything. It is a convenient excuse. It is just  wrong. By the time that Vladimir Putin started to encircle Ukraine and  then actually invaded Ukraine, inflation had been roaring here at home  for over 10 months. Gas prices were already way up, $1.25 a gallon  higher than they were on the day Joe Biden took office. So Biden's  numbers just don't add up.   Russian oil amounts to about 3 percent of our energy use in the  United States. Gas prices haven't just gone up by 3 percent. No, no.  They have nearly doubled during Joe Biden's Presidency.   The real reason that prices are up so much for energy is Joe Biden  has restricted our use of American energy. If you listen to his--go  back to the tapes on the debate stage when he was running for  President. He said he is going to keep it in the ground, no oil and gas  or exploration or coal on public lands--none, zero. The White House  Press Secretary the other day said, Oh, we are at record high  production.   We are not. Mistake. Absolutely wrong. She should be fact-checked. We  are over a million barrels a day fewer U.S. barrels of oil produced  today than we were during the height of our production before the  pandemic--actually, 1.4 million barrels a day fewer barrels today than  we were at the height of our production before the pandemic.   Well, when supply goes down as a result of the mismanagement and the  decisions made by this Biden administration and the refusal to allow  for permits to explore for energy, prices go up; and they have. When  the price of energy goes up, the prices of everything go up as well.   What are the Democrats proposing about high prices for energy? Well,  the answer for Democrats seems to be anything except more American  energy. Democrats have essentially floated three proposals: One is  defund our roads and bridges; the second is buy more energy from our  enemies, people that chant ``Death to America''; or keep prices high.  Those are the options we hear from the Democrats.   We see some frightened Democrats worried about reelection talking  about suspending the gas tax and then bringing it back right after  election day. Well, the gas tax is what pays for the roads and the  bridges, the highways of our Nation, but bring it back right after the  election. Well, does that mean we are going to need less energy after  election day; so it is OK to raise prices after the election? Of course  not.   Even former Clinton and Obama economic adviser Larry Summers calls  this proposal being introduced in this body by Members of the  Democratic side of the aisle--he called it ``short-sighted,  ineffective, gimmicky, and goofy.'' That is Larry Summers from both the  Obama as well as the Clinton administration.   If we completely repeal the gas tax, gas prices would still be $1.75  more a gallon than they were the day Joe Biden took office. So another  option the Democrats are floating is, ``Hey, let's buy more energy from  our enemy.'' Wouldn't that be a great idea, says the President? So  officials from the Biden administration have gone hat in hand to  Venezuela last weekend as well as to Iran. Venezuela is one of the  closest allies to Vladimir Putin. I understand the current man in power  in Venezuela actually called to congratulate Vladimir Putin for what he  is doing in Ukraine--so is Iran, in terms of the world's No. 1 sponsor  of terrorism. That is who Joe Biden has chosen to talk to--Iran and  Venezuela--rather than United States energy producers.   Do we want to pay our worst enemies over $100 a barrel for each  barrel of oil they will sell to us? Do we want to send billions and  billions of dollars of hard-earned taxpayer dollars in this country to  those who hate us and burn American flags and chant ``Death to  America,'' or do we want to create jobs here at home, produce more  American energy? The answer is obvious to most American people. It may  not be obvious to the man in the White House or his administration or  those around him, but Joe Biden would rather have an enormous transfer  of wealth to our enemies than tell the climate elitists who he dances  to the tune of that we are going to produce energy at home.    Finally, some Democrats are just proposing: Let's keep energy prices  high. The Secretary of Transportation says: Just buy an electric  vehicle; that will solve all our problems. He said, You won't have to  worry about gas prices no matter how high they go. It is OK if they go  high as long as you buy an electric vehicle.   Talk about being out of touch. The average electric vehicle costs  over $55,000. Families who are struggling in this Biden economy, they  can't afford to spend $55,000. We have many, many Americans living  paycheck to paycheck, falling further and further behind.   And the Secretary of Transportation says: Hey, just go find $55,000,  buy an electric vehicle, and you can plug it in. Where do you think the  electricity comes from? It doesn't come from the wall. Talk about an  administration being out of touch. That is what we are dealing with in  this country today. Two-thirds of Americans say they are living  paycheck to paycheck.   This morning, we had a hearing in the Energy Committee that said,  What about everybody trying to buy an electric vehicle; can we do it?   What do we hear? You have to buy a lot of things from China or Russia  just to get the rare Earth minerals that are needed to build the  batteries for the electric cars. What does Elon Musk, Mr. Tesla, say?  He says, Produce more American energy.   It is time for the President of the United States to wake up. It is  really not an option for everybody to get an electric vehicle. Even if  everybody had the money, there are not enough electric vehicles to be  had anywhere in the near--not just the near future--the foreseeable  future and beyond that.   Another option is not to send billions of dollars to our enemies.  After all, as a State Department official from this administration told  us in the Foreign Relations Committee as Putin was building up--before  the invasion, but building up the army around Ukraine--said that  Putin's energy was the cash cow that was paying for his military  aggression.   The American people deserve better solutions, rational solutions,  solutions that they understand. And they understand American energy.   Just yesterday, Joe Biden said: I can't do much right now to bring  down prices.   It is not true. Last week, the morning after the State of the Union  address, I, along with every Republican  [[Page S1080]]  on the Senate Energy Committee--every Republican signed the letter,  sent it to Joe Biden, offered 10 points he could do and do now to make  a difference for American energy production to help the American  economy, to help with jobs, to help with energy production, and to help  bring down the cost of energy.   We know what we need to do. To bring down inflation, we need to stop  the reckless spending here in Washington, DC. Of course, that is gone  now. The Democrats, on a single party-line vote--no Republican voted  for it--did that last year to spark inflation and then all the rules  and regulations and limitations on Americans' use of energy has added  to and contributed to, today, a 40-year high of inflation.   Above all, we need to unleash American energy. We need to use  American energy. More American energy will bring down the prices. We  have it. When the Secretary of the Interior makes a statement that she  wants us to keep all the oil and gas in the ground, that is a statement  about this administration's lack of commitment to use American energy.   We have the opportunity in America to do it right. For more than a  year now, the American people have been paying and paying and paying  for the Democrats' anti-American energy policies, and they are sick and  tired of it. You turn on the TV, and you see what is happening out  there in the world. In Ukraine, people are getting killed by Vladimir  Putin--a maternity ward and a hospital bombed, people killed. And what  did former Secretary of State, John Kerry, the Democrats' climate envoy  say in an interview to the BBC as the Russian troops encircled Ukraine?  He said: I hope it doesn't distract from our climate agenda. That is  obscene, and it is absurd.   The American people realize how absolutely ridiculous the position  and how untenable the position of this administration is when you have  the No. 1 climate spokesman for the administration, a former Secretary  of State, somebody who was a Member of this body for years, close  colleague and friend of the President of the United States--it is time  for Joe Biden to stand up to John Kerry and to stand up to the climate  elitists who say: Oh, no, no American energy because we are so pure.   The American people know what is important to them and their lives.  We all want to make energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can,  without raising costs on American families. The administration seems to  be happy to see the prices go up on American families at a time when  their wages are not keeping up with their expenses. It is long past  time that we produce American energy and do it right here. We have the  resources. We have the know-how. We have the workers. We are only  missing one thing, and that is competent leadership in the White House  and in the Democrats in this body on Capitol Hill.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about  our Nation's energy policy and the crisis that we find ourselves in as  the cost of energy continues to go up and up and up.   Right now, gas prices are nearly double what they were the day that  Joe Biden became President of the United States.   So you ask: Why is this happening? That is what consumers, that is  what  [[Page S1097]]  people in my home State of Wyoming are asking about. What has happened?  How is it that it has gone up so much?   Sure, there is the war in Ukraine, but the prices have been going up  day by day by day after Joe Biden became President, and the reason, I  tell people at home, is because Joe Biden has declared war on American  energy--the policies of this administration, the policies of the  Democrats in this body and across the way in the House.   On day No. 1, Joe Biden shut down the Keystone XL Pipeline; he shut  down oil and gas leases on Federal lands; and he shut down the  exploration for energy in the Arctic.   My colleague the senior Senator from Alaska, who previously had  chaired the Energy Committee in the Senate, has said that we are  actually, in the United States, using more energy from Russia, more oil  from Russia than we are from Alaska, her home State, a State in the  United States.   Now we see the President's appointees making it almost impossible to  build gas pipelines. So even if you were able to explore and discover  energy--oil, gas--you can't get it to market because they are blocking  pipelines all across the country.   And the FERC--the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission--just a week  and a half ago revised its guidelines to make it even tougher.   They talk about oil and gas leases. Once you get a lease--you pay for  a lease to explore for energy--you have to come to the government for  permission to drill for it. You actually have to pay money to apply for  permission to drill. It is actually called an Application for Permit to  Drill. And the Biden administration last month said, ``We are not going  to give you any more of those,'' to anybody who wants to explore for  energy on public lands. And, in fact, there are about 4,600 of those  stuck in limbo right now.   In my home State of Wyoming and across the country, people are  asking: How can a President put such a radical and self-destructive  agenda which we have to live under?   And what I tell them and what they understand is that the Biden  administration is completely controlled by the climate elitists, the  climate alarmists who dictate the policies of the Democratic Party in  this country.   So just look at Joe Biden's climate czar. Now, that is kind of a  nickname for the position, but the reality of the title is the U.S.  Special Presidential Envoy for Climate. It is John Kerry. So this is a  very high position in this administration.   He didn't come to the Senate for confirmation. Oh, no. They wouldn't  risk putting something like that up here because then John Kerry would  have to answer questions.   But John Kerry, no question about it, does speak for the  administration. Joe Biden appointed him. John Kerry and Joe Biden  served together in the Senate, in this body. I served with both of them  on the Foreign Relations Committee. John Kerry was a previous Secretary  of State of the United States at the time that Joe Biden was Vice  President of the United States.   So the position of John Kerry is also the position of this  administration, otherwise, why would he be the Special Presidential  Envoy for Climate? When John Kerry speaks, it is Joe Biden whom he  speaks for.   Well, John Kerry and this administration have a delusional obsession,  and their delusional obsession is with climate. John Kerry and this  administration are so obsessed with our climate that they believe it is  more important than our energy security and than our national security.   Now, there are countless examples. And I just want to go through a  couple of them that have occurred just within the last 3 weeks, just  within the time that Vladimir Putin's soldiers have encircled Ukraine  and now have attacked Ukraine, continuing to kill innocent civilians.   The night before Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, with the troops at  the ready, John Kerry actually told the BBC in an interview that he was  worried about the carbon emissions that would result from the war--the  carbon emissions, not the death, not the destruction, not the  suffering; no, the carbon emissions.   He also said--I mean, it is astonishing. People listened, and they  said: This can't be the position of the administration of the President  of the United States. But yet it is the position of John Kerry, the  President's Special Envoy, that war would be a distraction, would  distract from the climate agenda.   John Kerry went on to say this. He said:         I hope President Putin will help us to stay on track with       respect to what we need to do for the climate.    Let me repeat. John Kerry, Special Envoy, speaking for the President  of the United States:         I hope President Putin will help us stay on track with       respect to what we need to do for the climate.    John Kerry believes, by his statements and others that I will get to,  that what is happening with the war in Europe is a distraction from the  real issue of the day, the key issue--climate change.   People are being murdered in the streets, Vladimir Putin is  conducting nuclear drills, and the President's key spokesman on issues  affecting energy in this country is hoping that President Putin will  help us stay on track, and what is happening there is a distraction.   This is absurd. John Kerry thinks that Vladimir Putin cares about the  climate? It is impossible. Putin just yesterday bombed a maternity  ward. Putin's forces have killed dozens of children. Yet John Kerry is  desperately waiting by the phone, clinging to the hope of a phone call  from Vladimir Putin.   I hope John Kerry isn't holding his breath waiting for Putin to  address the issue of climate.   Now, in the very same interview, John Kerry was asked about the  possibility that Russia would invade Ukraine.   John Kerry's answer is this. The former Secretary of State, former  chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said: ``I thought we lived  in a world that said no to that kind of [thing].'' What kind of a world  is John Kerry living in? Sounds like a nice place. It is not the real  world--not the world we live in, not the world that is right now  wreaking havoc on the people of Ukraine.   The fact that John Kerry, the President's spokesman on issues of  climate, said this out loud in public just shows that John Kerry and  this administration--in terms of their position on energy and energy  security and national security, it must put them in the position of  being the most naive people on the face of the Earth. John Kerry flying  around the world in his private jet, representing the administration,  worrying about the carbon emissions of a war, whereas we know as of now  that thousands of innocent people already have or will lose their  lives.   Then on Monday, just 3 days ago, I believe John Kerry made it worse.  At that point, the tanks were in the streets, Russia was on the attack,  people were dying, and millions of people have left the country of  Ukraine, seeking asylum, seeking help, seeking relief, going across the  border, seeking humanitarian care, and John Kerry, in a heartless  statement, said the 2 million Ukrainian refugees were nothing--John  Kerry--nothing in comparison to the refugees who will flee a warmer  climate someday. Someday. Two million refugees--nothing compared to  what may happen someday with climate change.   This is the world's largest refugee crisis in the last 70 years,  since World War II. There are 2 million Ukrainians now displaced,  trying to get out of the country of Ukraine, some losing their lives-- they think they are going on safe corridors--being killed by Putin as  he bombs them as they think they have safe passage.   John Kerry doesn't seem to be impressed, which, to me, means Joe  Biden is not impressed; the administration is not impressed because Joe  Biden has allowed John Kerry to continue to this very day, to this very  moment, to speak for this administration as the climate envoy.   John Kerry should be fired. If he is not, he continues to speak for  the President of the United States because John Kerry--which means this  administration is more concerned about a hypothetical event in the  future than what is happening on the face of the Earth right now.   This is an obsession. This is delusional. And the obsession explains  a lot. It explains why this White House  [[Page S1098]]  always puts environmental fantasies ahead of American security and  American energy. That is what we are seeing. This administration puts  climate ahead of jobs. It puts climate ahead of bringing prices down.  It puts climate ahead of working families. The administration puts  climate ahead of our allies. We have sky-high gas prices, the highest  of all time. You know, we see inflation is the highest in 40 years. We  got the new bad inflation numbers again today, which are hurting our  families. We can't keep up. Wages can't keep up. A 40-year high  inflation but the worst of all time highest gas prices ever. We have  the worst prices in Europe in decades and decades and decades. And the  Biden administration won't even consider--won't even consider-- producing more American energy.   Earlier today--today--Reuters reported the White House has decided  not to boost exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe. They are  pleading for it. They want it. We have it. We have it in abundance.  Now, the administration won't let us build the pipelines to move it,  won't let us explore for it, but we have plenty of it here in the  United States. They are desperate, and they are trying to break the  ties they have to Russia.   The report from Reuters today says: ``The White House was weighing  the announcement of . . . ways to boost LNG exports to Europe . . .  However''--however; wait a minute, not going to happen--``the  interagency review has been shelved . . . after some in the White House  argued''--some in the White House argued; not a supply and demand  issue--and I see the junior Senator from Maine here, who talks about a  supply and demand issue with regard to LNG. Oh, no. Those in the White  House argued that ``it would counter the administration's efforts.''  Letting our friends and colleagues in Europe who need our LNG, of which  we have an abundance--oh, no. ``[I]t would counter the administration's  efforts to wean the U.S. off fossil fuels.''   Once again, this White House, with John Kerry the spokesman and it  looks like Joe Biden the lapdog--whatever John Kerry says, we are going  to do--has put climate before our national security and before our  energy security.   It is time for the administration to get its priorities straight, and  it is time to remove John Kerry from this position. It is time for Joe  Biden to wake up and to speak up. The climate elitists have done  tremendous damage to our Nation and are continuing to do damage to our  allies. For ourselves and for our allies, it is time to produce more  American energy.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I did listen with great interest to  every word of my colleague from Maine. We spend time together on the  Energy Committee. He has lots of very good ideas, and we discuss things  constructively.   When we talk about supply and demand, I just find it very interesting  that for something like natural gas, of which we have an abundance in  Wyoming--and when I was in the Wyoming State Senate, natural gas prices  were over $16. With the renaissance of American natural gas energy and  the production of something called fracking, prices dropped  dramatically to the kind of numbers that the Senator from Maine  mentioned earlier--to about $3. It went down, way down.   That doesn't help the people in Massachusetts, where the price is  $18, because they can't get permission to have pipelines to deliver the  affordable gas that we produce here. I mean, it is fascinating to take  a look at Pennsylvania, which is half the price than in Massachusetts;  and they are not too far apart. I just went out here, as the Senator  was speaking, just to take a look and see what the differentials were  in the prices. The price of natural gas is twice as high in  Massachusetts as in Pennsylvania when they are less than 200 miles or  300 miles apart.   It has nothing to do with the availability of gas in the ground; it  has to do with the delivery to the end user. That is the result of  political decisions being made on the ground, in States, to prevent the  infrastructure to deliver the material, to deliver the natural gas,  that those people need.   It was even an issue on the ballot in my colleague's home State of  Maine to move energy from Canada down to Massachusetts, and it was  blocked by the voters in Maine, which is their right to do. They have a  right to make those decisions as to what they want to vote for or  against. And that was on the transmission of even renewable energy.  Politics and decisions by either the administration or a State or  voters make those decisions. So there is an abundance of natural gas,  and there is a limitation on how you can get it to people because of  political decisions.   I heard my colleague mention the number of leases that are out there.  There are about 9,000 leases the administration continues to talk  about, saying there are 9,000 leases of which nobody is exploring or  that drilling hasn't been done.   Well, that is just the first step of getting a lease. It is like  leasing an apartment: You pay the rent, but you need a key to get into  the building. I mean, you pay the rent, and it is your apartment, but  you can't actually get in until they give you the key. That is the same  thing that happens here. You need to apply for permission to drill, and  we know that the administration has said: We are not going to give any  of those. There is no permission. Sorry. I know you paid for the lease,  but we are not giving anybody a key. And they did that to about 4,600  recent leases.   Normally, some of those decisions are made at a local level but not  in the Biden administration. Oh, no. Some assistant secretary said:  Every one of them has to come to me.   I can get the documentation for the Presiding Officer or for my  colleague and friend, the Senator from Maine.   This is a very heavyhanded administration when it comes to exploring  for American energy, and they continue that way.   The President, when he was in Glasgow for the climate conference, I  think surprised many of us when he asked OPEC+--``plus'' being Russia-- to produce and sell more energy to the United States. Over the last  year, we have averaged about 670,000 barrels a day of oil coming in  from Russia, which is more than we get from Alaska. The Keystone  Pipeline, which the President killed on his first day in office, would  have brought in over 800,000 barrels a day.   It is not that the President has been shy about the fact that he has  done all of these things; he has taken great credit. I mean, look at  the Presidential debates when President Biden--then Candidate Biden-- said, if he got elected, there would be no oil and gas exploration on  public lands--no leasing, no use. That is why they have shut down all  of these applications for the permits to drill. That is why the  administration has said: You are not taking it out of the ground.   This is a Presidential promise.   As of today, we continue to produce a lot less oil in the United  States than we did at the height of our economic boom prior to the  pandemic. We have about 1,400,000 barrels a day less in U.S. production  today than we had during the height of the economy before the pandemic.  So we have a lot of catching up to do.   When the administration says you can't bring it in from Canada  because you are not going to have Keystone and then pounds its chest in  pride, that is a political statement. When the nominee for the  Secretary of the Interior says to leave it all in the ground--all of  it--that is a political statement. When a local community says, ``No  pipelines in here. We don't care if the people in our communities have  to pay twice what they are paying in our neighboring State,'' that is a  political statement. It is all based on climate because we have John  Kerry and his words to prove it, as well as those of the President of  the United States.    So I continue to enjoy having discussions with my colleague from  Maine, and we will continue that on the Energy Committee, where he is a  very productive member. There are areas we work together on and areas  in which we disagree. People are entitled to their opinions.   These are the facts as to what is happening with American energy  today and as of the needs of the Nation. As we have recovered and  continue to recover from the pandemic, we are still very far behind in  American energy needs, and it is the political activities of this  administration that have limited our ability to return to our full,  productive capacity.   I yield the floor.
