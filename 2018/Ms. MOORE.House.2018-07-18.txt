 Mr. Speaker, standing under the revered E Pluribus Unum, I  ardently plea for unanimous consent to amend the rules to make in order  the Quigley amendment to restore desperately needed funds to prevent  the pernicious and nefarious Russian interference in our elections.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, let me thank the committee for supporting me  in my very important amendments last evening, and I have another very  important amendment that is before the committee here today.   Mr. Chair, I urge support for my amendment that would prevent the  administration from dismantling the EPA's Great Lakes Advisory Board. I  am so pleased that this bill has again rejected the President's  proposal to gut the GLRI, and this amendment would prevent them from  dismantling the advisory board.   Mr. Chairman, this is a critical matter for anyone who drinks water.  The Great Lakes provide drinking water to some 40 million people. Let  me say that again. Forty million people depend on this resource for one  of life's basic requirements, water, not to mention anglers and  recreation.   As an old African proverb goes, water has no enemies. So, hopefully,  the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative is something that we are going  to recognize as having played a critical role in protecting and  restoring one of America's greatest national treasures, a life- sustaining element, water.   Just to mention, not to bore people with a lot of statistics, but the  Great Lakes contain about 21 percent of the world's surface freshwater  and more than 80 percent, 85 percent, of the freshwater in North  America. This is indispensable.   As critical as this funding is, it is also important that the EPA  receive advice and input from local stakeholders regarding priorities  under that program. The Great Lakes Advisory Board provides such  advice.   EPA established the board in 2013 to provide independent advice to  the EPA administration in its capacity as chair of the Federal Great  Lakes Interagency Task Force. Some of the past activities of the  advisory board have been providing the EPA with recommendations  regarding what are the most significant stressors and needs for the  Great Lakes ecosystem; providing the EPA with recommendations on ways  to ensure effective public input into the Great Lakes action plan  process; and providing advice on whether the GLRI should invest in  efforts to understand long-term, future threats and communicate them to  the Great Lakes community for action.   In light of reports of efforts to undermine the board, on a  bipartisan basis, I joined colleagues in writing to the EPA earlier  this year to make clear that we support the establishment and  maintenance of the board. My amendment would put teeth behind this  letter and make it clear to the administration what congressional  intent is regarding this important advisory board.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I want to thank the gentleman from California.  He is a very effective leader on this issue. I appreciate him.   An effective Great Lakes Advisory Board is vital to ensuring that the  GLRI remains successful and impactful today and in the years to come.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to rise today to offer an  amendment to increase resources available to help address a scourge  that is occurring in so many of our communities: lead poisoning.   My district is facing its challenges like so many in our country, and  the Federal Government must do its part by ensuring that we provide the  resources to address this scourge.   Two of the most prominent vectors are old housing and old water  infrastructure, lateral lead pipes. My amendment would attempt to  address just one of the sources of lead, old lateral lead pipes, while  recognizing the need to address housing when the appropriate funding  bill comes to the floor.   Mr. Chairman, we know that children throughout America are at risk of  a major public health crisis given aging drinking water infrastructure  and housing stock. In my district alone, there are tens of thousands of  lead service lines that pose a threat to the public health of children.   We have heard so much about Flint, Michigan, but I can tell you that  lead poisoning in my district mirrors that of Flint, Michigan. I mean,  Mr. Chairman, there just are no safe levels of lead for children.                                time  1645    As noted in a recent report by The Pew Charitable Trusts: ``In the  absence of lead, hundreds of thousands of children would be more likely  to realize their full potential thanks to higher grade point averages,  a better chance of earning high school diplomas, and graduating from  college, and a reduced likelihood of becoming teen parents or becoming  convicted of crimes.'' Yet lead exposure remains a serious threat for  far too many kids and their families in our country.   The only way to remove lead pipes as a source of lead contamination  is to completely remove them. That is the goal that I joined with my  former and dearly loved colleague, the late great Louise Slaughter, in  writing to urge the EPA in March of this year to update its lead and  copper rule to require  [[Page H6505]]  the full replacement of lead service lines.   But both public utilities and private homeowners are hard pressed to  finance this needed work. It is my understanding that the average cost  can be somewhere between $6,000 to $8,000 to replace such lines, which  is an unimaginable sum for many of the households that our constituents  live in.   My amendment would provide funding for one of the newest tools that  Congress created in the 2016 WRDA bill to help communities address lead  pipes. This program provides grants for lead reduction projects that  help reduce the concentration of lead in drinking water by, among other  uses, providing assistance to low-income homeowners to replace lead  service lines.   Recognizing the need, Congress authorized the program at $60 million  per year; yet it received only $10 million in the fiscal year 2018  omnibus appropriations bill. While I would like to get closer to the  authorized level, my amendment is modest and pragmatic and would simply  continue funding for this program at the fiscal year 2018 level.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his stewardship  and for his recognition of the importance of this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.
