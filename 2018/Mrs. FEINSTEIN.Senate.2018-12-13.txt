 Madam President, the last thing one does in life is  not necessarily the best. I have come to respect Claire McCaskill over  a long period of time. I have watched her walk in a room and watched  heads turn. I have listened to her up front, answering questions: no  nonsense, direct, truthful, to the very best of her ability. I found in  her a great sense of conscience. She has this marvelous exterior. I  think the interior is a little different.   There is a sensitivity there that is very special, Senator. I hope  you never ever lose it because it is what gives you the ability to do  what you do. Now I expect to turn on my television set and turn on my  radio and hear you many times and take a lot of good advice and have a  few laughs listening to you.   I want to say thank you. You have represented your State well. You  have stood tall. You have spoken out in our caucuses. You have let  people know what you feel. You wear your heart on your sleeve, and you  are one great woman.    Mr. President, I rise to introduce a Senate  Resolution honoring the victims of the mass shooting in Thousand Oaks,  California.   On November 7, 2018, a shooter armed with a semiautomatic pistol and  high-capacity ammunition magazine attacked the Borderline Bar and  Grill. Borderline is known as a popular meeting place for residents and  country music fans. That night was a ``college night,'' and students  had gathered there for a night of music and dancing.   What happened next was the deadliest mass shooting in California  since the 2015 terror attack in San Bernardino. Twelve people lost  their lives that night in Thousand Oaks. They included students,  military veterans, and 27 year old Telemachus Orfanos, who was a  survivor of the October 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas.   Just think about that for a moment. A survivor of the deadliest mass  shooting in our Nation's history lost his life in another mass shooting  a year later.   Ventura County Sheriff Sergeant Ron Helus also lost his life that  night. He was one of the first law enforcement officers on the scene,  and he gave his life confronting the assailant and protecting his  community. Thousand Oaks is one of the safest cities in America. If an  attack like this can happen there, it can happen anywhere.   This Resolution condemns the terrible violence experienced by the  Thousand Oaks community and honors the memory of those who we have  lost. This Resolution also recognizes the efforts of law enforcement,  firefighters, and emergency medical teams, whose steadfast dedication  and service to the victims and survivors in Thousand Oaks undoubtedly  saved lives.   Finally, this Resolution reaffirms our commitment to ensure that the  victims' families and those who were injured receive the assistance  they need.   Mr. President, our Nation suffers one mass shooting after another. We  no longer have time to grieve before gun violence devastates another  community. Thousand Oaks has now joined the ever growing list of  communities across America that are mourning the loss of loved ones  from this ongoing epidemic. I call upon all of my Republican colleagues  to work with us and do everything we can to prevent another attack.   I also ask that each member of this chamber remember the victims,  their families, the survivors, and the entire community of Thousand  Oaks, and continue to hold them in their hearts.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
