 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 430, which was received  from the House.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time.    I know of no further debate on the bill.    I ask unanimous consent that the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
