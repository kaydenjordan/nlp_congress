 Madam Speaker, I rise in honor of Ohio Tuskegee Airmen  Day.   Most know the Tuskegee Airmen as the first Black pilots in the  military who overcame the headwinds of segregation and racism to  achieve unparalleled success during World War II, flying nearly 1,600  missions and destroying over 260 enemy aircraft.   What you may not know is their success continued after the war, both  militarily and culturally, in Lockbourne, Ohio.   In 1946, the Tuskegee Airmen arrived at the Lockbourne Army Air Force  Base, where they operated the first and only Army Air Force base under  the command of Benjamin O. Davis, Jr.   Segregation continued to hinder their opportunities off base, but  Lockbourne overcame and was lauded as the best managed base in the Air  Force. Their work led President Harry Truman to issue an executive  order in 1948 that desegregated the military and mandated equal  opportunity and treatment.   I am proud to represent an area of such historical significance and  to honor the legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen.                            ____________________
