 Mr. President, each Memorial Day we, as Americans,  take time to honor the heroes who gave their lives in service to our  country, from those who died in the creation of this great Nation to  those who today risk their lives in the most dangerous corners of the  world.   As we approach this Memorial Day, I want to take a moment to honor  the heroes still among us who served in the Second World War. There are  fewer than half a million of these veterans still living, and we lose  more than 300 every day.   These men and women of the World War II era are truly heroes here  among us. In the great battle between good and evil, these heroes  advanced over rough terrain against bombs and bullets and tanks.   Today, their battle is against the unrelenting march of time and the  inescapable effects of aging. For these veterans, whose valor many of  us only know from history books or movies, we still have the  opportunity and sacred duty to express our gratitude, so we honor them  as we aspire to be greater than we are. If we desire to serve more than  ourselves, we must honor them.   On this Memorial Day, I take time to draw special attention to one of  these heroes, who is now hospitalized in Mississippi.   Ninety-four years ago, Thomas O'Loughlin was born in an Irish- Catholic community in New Jersey. When his country called him to war,  Tom responded and made his first trip to Mississippi, courtesy of the  U.S. Army, for training at Camp Shelby. He deployed to the European  Theater where, in January 1944, he was captured by the Axis forces and  held as prisoner of war for more than a year before liberation.  Following the war, Tom served as a guard during the Nuremberg Trials of  Nazi war criminals. One of the prisoners in his charge was Deputy  Fuhrer Rudolf Hess.   Following the Nuremberg Trials, Tom continued serving his country in  the Armed Forces, once again serving in combat with the 811th Engineer  Aviation Battalion assigned to the Fifth Air Force in Korea. He  returned to civilian life in 1952, eventually making his way back to  Mississippi. Keeping his Jersey accent and Irish sparkle, Tom made  Mississippi his home and married Rachel Pitts, a Southern belle. They  settled down in Laurel, MS, and like many members of the Greatest  Generation, Tom dedicated himself to serving his community as a sponsor  for those facing addiction. Even now, he calls from his hospital bed to  encourage sobriety and offer support to those who still turn to him for  help.   To honor Tom O'Loughlin, I had a U.S. flag flown over the U.S.  Capitol. I pray his health returns, and I ask we all offer prayers of  gratitude for Tom and the other World War II veterans across our  country, for they truly are heroes here among us.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am pleased to commend Woods  Eastland of Indianola, MS, for his service and contributions while  serving as the 83rd president of Delta Council.   Founded in 1935, Delta Council is a widely respected economic  development organization representing business, professional, and  agricultural leaders in the Delta region of Mississippi. I commend the  Delta Council for its continuing role in improving the quality of life  in this unique part of our Country.   Woods Eastland's tenure as Delta Council president began in June  2018. Under Mr. Eastland's leadership, the Delta region has benefitted  from his extensive experience in farm policy, water resource issues,  and economic and community development, among other major issues that  Delta Council addresses.   Mr. Eastland graduated from Vanderbilt University and earned a juris  doctorate from the University of Mississippi. A Navy veteran, Eastland  began farming following his military service. He was also CEO of  StaplCotn for over 24 years, where he led the largest cotton marketing  firm in the United States, headquartered in Greenwood, MS. Upon his  retirement, he became Chairman of the Board for another 8 years. In  addition to Delta Council, Eastland serves his church, community, and  Delta region through numerous leadership roles.   I am pleased to offer congratulations to Woods Eastland and to share  this appreciation with his wife Lynn, their two children, and  grandchildren, at the time of the 84th annual meeting of the membership  of Delta Council in June.                            ____________________
