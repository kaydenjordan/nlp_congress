 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this is a bipartisan amendment that  incorporates an interagency agreement transmitted to Congress by the  Office of National Drug Control Policy, the United States Department of  Health and Human Services, and the United States Department of Justice.   It clarifies several issues: when the Attorney General can  temporarily and permanently schedule a drug or substance to the newly  created schedule A, and it prevents the Attorney General from  permanently scheduling a drug or substance if the Secretary of HHS  determines that there is not sufficient potential for abuse.   It also clarifies when research can be conducted with a schedule A  substance while a registration application is pending. If an applicant  is registered to conduct research with a schedule I or II substance,  they can continue to do research they may be pursuing with a schedule A  substance while their application is being processed.   Likewise, if an applicant is registered to conduct research with a  schedule III, IV, or V substance, they can continue to conduct research  with a schedule A substance while their application is pending, so long  as the component that gave rise to the schedule A determination is in  the same or a less restricted schedule.   This amendment is important to research. This amendment will help  ensure that research is not impeded or stunted because of a change in  the schedule of a substance. While we all want to get dangerous  substances off the street, history has taught us that when a substance  is scheduled, many research options are taken off the table or made  prohibitively complicated.   Sometimes derivatives of dangerous substances can provide cures and  treatments for deadly diseases or chronic conditions, and we don't want  to hamstring our researchers who are equipped to discover potential  positive uses.   Though it may still need to be a scheduled substance, an analogue, in  theory, could be a less addictive term of an opioid pain relief, and if  researchers are looking at it as a possible less addictive form, I  believe we would all want to keep that research going and not impede  that research as it moves forward.   So I believe this is an important amendment, and I hope everybody  will join me in supporting it. I thank Mr. Raskin and Ms. Jackson Lee  for their assistance and support of this amendment as well.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H5216]]         Mr. Chairman, I yield as much time as he might consume  to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino).    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
