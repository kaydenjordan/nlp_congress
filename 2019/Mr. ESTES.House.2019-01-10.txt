 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the U.S. Navy's latest  littoral combat ship christened the USS Wichita.   On Saturday, the USS Wichita will be commissioned in Mayport,  Florida, where she will begin her service to our country. As the third  USS Wichita in U.S. Naval history, this ship will carry on the proud  legacy of representing Kansas' largest city around the globe.   Wichita will be represented on board by Chief Petty Officer Isaac  Davis, a graduate of Wichita Heights High School, who will serve as an  operations specialist, and Chief Petty Officer Brian Tanner, a graduate  of Derby High School, who will serve as an information systems  technician.   I am grateful for Chief Petty Officers Davis and Tanner, as well as  the entire crew of the USS Wichita. I am also thankful for the efforts  of so many people in our community who have been supportive of the work  of the USS Wichita Commissioning Committee.   Thanks in part to these efforts, I know the USS Wichita will serve  our community and country with pride.   Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing the men and  women of the USS Wichita fair winds and following seas.                            ____________________
