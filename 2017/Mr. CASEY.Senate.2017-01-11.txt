 Mr. President, this amendment deals with three basic  issues. The first is the issue of preexisting conditions, the second is  the issue with regard to discrimination as it relates to health status,  and the third issue is with regard to caps on coverage.   The first issue is we want to make sure no action is taken in the  Senate that would have the effect of limiting access to care for those  individuals with preexisting conditions. That is No. 1.   No. 2, we want to make sure we don't place any lifetime caps on  health insurance coverage for individuals with a disability or with a  chronic condition.   No. 3, we want to make sure health plans will not discriminate on the  basis of either the individual's physical health, their mental health,  or their disability status.   This is the right thing to do for health care, and I urge an  affirmative vote on this amendment.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.    Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the  Congressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive section 305(b)(2) of  that act for purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas  and nays.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive.   The clerk will call the roll.
