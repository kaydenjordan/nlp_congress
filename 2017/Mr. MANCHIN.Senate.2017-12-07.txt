 Mr. President, I rise as a Member of this great body to  say thank you to our good friend from Alabama for serving. It is such a  shame that we have so many good people in this body and some really  great people in this body who are here for such a short period of time,  and to have a person like Senator Strange come before us and be part  and try to make a difference.   I truly enjoyed his speech based on bipartisanship, which is what we  are all here for, and seeing how we have digressed to the point where  there is very little bipartisanship that goes on and then knowing that  we can make that change and make a difference.   I want to thank the Senator. It has always been a joy to be around  him. He has such a way and such a demeanor about him--his congeniality,  his camaraderie and wanting to make this place work the way it is  supposed to work and the way they have told us it did work.   With that I would say, Senator, I am grateful I got to know you. I am  grateful that you have passed through these doors for all of us to call  you our friend. I am sad that you are not staying.   I know there are bigger things in store for you. I know your life is  going to be blessed, and with that, you blessed us by being part of us  for a period of time.   Thank you, Senator.
