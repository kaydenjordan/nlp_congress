 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Pastor Loran  Livingston and his wife, Sandra, in recognition of their 40 years of  ministry at Central Church of God in Charlotte, North Carolina.   God has used the Livingstons to grow and lead a church that truly  impacts the Charlotte community and the world. Each week, over 6,000  people gather together for a wonderful praise and worship experience,  along with a dynamic biblical message from Pastor Livingston.   Under their leadership, the congregation actively serves those in  poverty, provides help for women facing an unplanned pregnancy all the  way through life, and programs to assist seniors. Central Church also  hosts an annual 5K race to raise awareness in the fight against human  trafficking.   If you want to address race relations in Charlotte, a good place to  start is Central Church, where 40-plus nationalities worship together  every Sunday hearing the love of Jesus.   Thank God for Pastor and Mrs. Livingston and their dedication to  Christ, Central Church, the Charlotte community, and their various  missions around the world.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 36, the  Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which I was among one of the  first cosponsors. God bless Representative Trent Franks for his  tireless leadership.   This is a commonsense, pro-life bill that prohibits late-term  elective abortions on unborn babies after 20 weeks postfertilization.  At this tender age, they can feel the excruciating pain of abortion.   America has always been a beacon for human rights. Yet, according to  a 2014 report by the Charlotte Lozier Institute, the U.S. is among just  seven countries that permit elective abortion  [[Page H7691]]  past 20 weeks. These countries include China and North Korea.   Our Nation suffers an egregious offense to be listed with North Korea  and China, two oppressive regimes that show no respect for human life  or human rights in allowing the killing of these precious babies as  they endure these cruel abortions.   This bill is important, as we speak for those who cannot speak for  themselves. As an engaged and active member of the Congressional Pro- Life Caucus, I fully support this bill, as I stand for life.
