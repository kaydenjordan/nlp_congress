 Madam Speaker, this week, the Trump administration is in  court, arguing before the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals to strike down  the Affordable Care Act, including taking away coverage for people with  preexisting health conditions. If the President gets his way, tens of  millions of Americans lose their health insurance, including a lot of  people I represent in Michigan.   For the 130 million Americans with preexisting conditions, insurance  companies would then again be able to discriminate against them and  deny them coverage.   That is what happens if the Trump administration prevails. If they  gut the ACA, caps on annual and lifetime coverage could come back  again, and 800,000 Michiganders will lose coverage.   While the President and his followers seek to roll back to those days  when people could be denied coverage because they are sick--think about  that, denied coverage because you are sick--we are fighting to continue  to bring down the cost of healthcare. We have an agenda that is for the  people to reduce the cost of healthcare and make sure no American has  that fear.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I thank my colleague for her leadership on  this issue, and for yielding.   This amendment is really simple. It requires polluters who have  contaminated drinking water with PFAS chemicals to clean it up. The  amendment has the support of the Armed Services Committee and the  Energy and Commerce Committee, and I thank the chairs of those  committees for their help.   It also has the support of the International Association of  Firefighters and the National Farmers Union because they know how  important it is to clean up PFAS.   Communities like the community of Oscoda, in the northern part of my  district, have waited too long for the Defense Department to act. This  is a step toward getting these dangerous chemicals out of the ground  and out of our groundwater.   I do understand that some groups are concerned about this amendment,  utilities and airports. We pledge to work with them as this legislation  moves through conference to make sure that we deal with the concerns  that they raise.   But this is simple. This says that we are going to protect public  health. Every day that we fail to act, the cost of PFAS cleanup just  gets more expensive.   I encourage my colleagues to support this important amendment and to  support the underlying bill.
