 Mr. Speaker, President Donald Trump  gave a remarkable speech yesterday during his first overseas visit.  Speaking to over 50 representatives from Muslim nations, the President  outlined the future for positive relations between the United States  and predominantly Muslim nations around the world.   The President's remarks in Saudi Arabia were extraordinary. I was  especially grateful to hear his call for unity of all people and all  regional faiths--Islam, Christianity, and Judaism--as well as a strong  condemnation of Islamic extremism and terrorism.   President Trump remarked: ``We pray this special gathering may  someday be remembered as the beginning of peace in the Middle East--and  maybe, even all over the world. But this future can only be achieved  through defeating terrorism and the ideology that drives it.'' The  President also cited 95 percent of victims of terrorism are Muslim.   I appreciate the warm welcome the President received in Saudi Arabia  as he promotes peace through strength.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Our sympathy to the family of Navy Captain Ken Clark of Swansea,  South Carolina, a Naval Academy graduate of great service.                            ____________________
