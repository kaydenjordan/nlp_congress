 Mr. Speaker, higher prices at the gas pump directly result  from President Biden's actions.   On his first days in office, he canceled the Keystone pipeline; he  ended new oil and gas leases on Federal lands; and he is attempting to  regulate the industry out of existence by way of executive orders.   But don't worry, President Biden's administration has offered some  words of encouragement for Americans struggling to pay outrageous  prices at the pump.   Last week, the Secretary of Transportation said to those Americans  upset about paying outrageous gas prices that ``communities can all  benefit from the gas savings of driving an electric vehicle.''   Did someone forget to mention to the Secretary that the average cost  of an electric vehicle is $50,000, which, frankly, is far more than the  yearly household income of many middle Tennesseans?   Even Elon Musk, the founder of the electric vehicle maker Tesla,  understands that electric vehicles cannot solve this immediate crisis.  Maybe he should lead the Department of Transportation.   Mr. Speaker, there is only one solution to President Biden's energy  crisis: reverse these disastrous executive orders and unleash America's  energy independence.                            ____________________
