 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, my  colleague Senator Scott has chosen an interesting point in this  pandemic to object to public safety measures intended to protect human  life and ensure scarce resources are not squandered.   Over 17 million Americans--17 million--have contracted COVID, that we  know of, and over 300,000 of our friends and our neighbors and loved  ones are no longer with us. Think about that.   September 11 was a great national tragedy. I know because I lost 700  of those 3,000 citizens, on that fateful day, from New Jersey. This is  100 times more than what happened on September 11.   The people we have lost are not just some nameless numbers but  mothers and fathers and grandparents. Essential parts of our hearts are  gone forever due to a pandemic that has been mishandled and mismanaged  from the start. And now, when this virus is running unchecked through  our communities, we have before us this resolution that is riddled with  misstatements of fact that I find deeply concerning.   No Governor wants to see their constituents cut off from their daily  lives, and I think we can all agree that the administration here in  Washington--their inability to guide us through this crisis--has left  our Governors holding the bag when it comes to securing resources,  providing guidance, and making the difficult calls about the right  public policy to prevent COVID-19 from rampaging like an unchecked bull  in a China shop through our States because they know, the Governors of  our States, that the lives of their residents--our neighbors, brothers,  sisters, children, and parents--rest in their hands and these difficult  decisions they must make.   We are still losing Americans from COVID-19 at an unprecedented rate.  Hospitals throughout the country are providing an amazing level of care  with exhausted providers and continued resource issues. And our economy  is cratering because we cannot fully reopen it until it is safe.   I am deeply troubled to see a false claim about my State and the  Governor banning indoor religious services. Let me be clear, houses of  worship were never ordered closed--never. In fact, today, religious  gatherings are allowed to have substantially higher capacity limits  than most other gatherings.   While New Jersey restricted the capacity of indoor religious  services, as they did with all indoor gatherings, religious gatherings  were never--never--designated as nonessential or essential, as this  resolution suggests. That distinction was only applied to retail  businesses.   Perhaps religion is different in Florida, but our houses of worship  are not retail businesses. Houses of worship and religious  organizations have been subject to neutral restrictions that equally  burden religious and nonreligious entities. They were put in place to  do what? To save lives, not under the guise of doing so and certainly  not for the purpose of targeting religious groups.   I am a man of strong faith and conviction. I have always found deep  solace in the rituals and shared worship of my church. I know many of  us have. But perhaps the most important part of my faith is the duty,  the responsibility to care for my neighbors up and down the State of  New Jersey and all across the Nation. Our faith calls us to ensure the  health and safety of this Nation before all else.   As a matter of fact, I am reminded of a passage in the Bible of James  2:14. It says:         What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if you say you       have faith but do not have works? Can faith save you? If a       brother or sister is naked and lacks daily food, and one of       you says to them, ``Go in peace; keep warm and get your       fill,'' and yet you do not supply their bodily needs, what is       the good of that? So faith by itself, if it has no works, is       dead. But someone will say, ``You have faith and I have       works.'' Show me your faith apart from your works, and I by       my works will show you my faith.    As for me, I will continue to work for the people of New Jersey, our  healthcare workers struggling to care for the thousands filling ICU  hospital beds, for the families who don't know how they will pay next  month's rent and keep food on the table, for the small business owner  trying to keep his doors open, and, yes, for the churches that want the  see their parishioners safe. I, however, do not intend to play these  partisan games. For those reasons, I object.    Mr. President, I know that my colleague, I understand,  is going to be the next chair of the Republican Senatorial Campaign  Committee, and he has every right to do that, but what he has no right  to do is misrepresent in this resolution what, at least in my State, is  going on.   You cannot say that churches were designated by the State of New  Jersey as nonessential or essential. That simply is not true. It is  simply not true. You cannot suggest that somehow these purposes are to  target religions. They are to save lives.   Now, maybe if my colleague and others here had spoken up when the  administration was asleep at the switch as this pandemic was raging,  maybe if my colleagues had spoken up when we found out that the  President knew back in January, early February of this year, of how  vicious this pandemic could be, how contagious it could be, how it was  transmitted, but said nothing to the American people--and that silence  was echoed in this Chamber--well, maybe then we wouldn't in the  position that we are in. Maybe we wouldn't have lost 300,000 of our  fellow Americans.   So I find it really, really upsetting that, in the midst of a raging  pandemic, one would seek to obtain a political value out of something  that is simply not the case--simply not the case. I think there is a  lot more to be done in this Chamber to stop this pandemic, to stop more  lives from being lost, to save our brothers and sisters, to help those  who have been ravaged by the pandemic, but not to pick a few States  that happen to be Democratic--please.    The resolution is replete with inaccuracies, and,  therefore, I will continue to object.
