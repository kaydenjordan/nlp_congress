 Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Russell and the  minority member for their work on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3398 is a bill that should be passed. I strongly  support it. I was listening to the testimony from the chairman, and he  has put it so well, I probably won't speak anymore. I do believe that  what he said is all true. It is necessary. It is needed.   This is something that was an oversight, because I was here when we  wrote the original bill in 2005. It was an oversight, and the gentleman  did a great job explaining it.   This is needed for those citizens who we consider from Palau,  Micronesia, and the other islands there, and we will do the work. I  thank the gentleman again for his work.
