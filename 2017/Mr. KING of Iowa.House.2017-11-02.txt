 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Colorado  for organizing this Special Order and recognizing me to address it.   I would like to say at the start of this that the folks that had the  Special Order ahead of us had not read the bill that they were  expounding upon, and it would be impossible for them to have done so.  So I want to remind the body of that, Mr. Speaker, and then address the  No Sanctuary Cities Act.   It is this: that we saw what happened in San Francisco when the  murderer of Kate Steinle had been deported five times. He was a seven- time felon, five-time deportee. He still came back, and he came to San  Francisco because he knew that it is a sanctuary city, and if he got  crossways with the law for whatever it might be, sleeping on the street  or shoplifting or any of the additional felonies that were brought  against him, they were not going to notify immigration officials. They  were going to turn him back loose on the streets of San Francisco. If  he was taken care of as an indigent, they would turn him loose on the  streets of San Francisco.   So Kate Steinle now lies in her grave, her family grieves for her  loss, and America felt that pain.   San Francisco is a sanctuary city, and now the entire State of  California has declared themselves a sanctuary State.   I think, Mr. Speaker, about the hole in the wall. Butch Cassidy and  the Sundance Kid, they had a spot in the canyon there where you had to  ride through a notch to get in there, and they posted a guard there.  All the bad guys that wanted to get along with the other bad guys in  the West went in that place, and if law enforcement came, then they  would line up against them and block them from coming in to enforce the  law.   That is essentially what we have got going on in city after city all  over America: sanctuary cities operating under the erroneous idea that  because their cities are so full of illegals, that if they would ever  allow Federal immigration enforcement officials to work and cooperate  with local law enforcement, those folks might not be in America.    Well, I met with some people today at the Remembrance Project. These  are the families who had their family members killed by illegal aliens  who are in America. Many of these illegal aliens who killed Americans  and killed other illegal aliens and killed people who are here and  lawfully present in America, many of them had criminal records. Many of  them had been interdicted by law enforcement, but the local  jurisdictions decided it wasn't politically correct to cooperate with  Federal law.   Well, the Constitution of the United States is the supreme law of the  land, and it is an enumerated power that Congress establish an  immigration policy. We do that, and we direct that those laws be  enforced. The executive branch's job is to do that.   All throughout law enforcement, it has been seamless throughout all  of my growing up years. I grew up in a law enforcement family. There  was no separation. There was no segregation between city police and  county law enforcement officers, the sheriff's department, and highway  patrol and DCI and FBI. When there was a crime that was committed,  everybody worked together seamlessly.   How is it that these cities and now the State of California have  carved themselves out an exception to what has been a timeless, time- honored, established cooperation between all levels of law enforcement?   So the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, which was my bill, is now  sitting on Mitch McConnell's desk with the scores of other bills that  the gentleman from Colorado has addressed, and it is one that says  there will be no sanctuary cities any longer and that we will be  cutting off funds going to these cities until they get the message.                                time  1830    I think it is about time that the Justice Department moved on all of  the jurisdiction that they actually have, but we need to help them here  in Congress. And it is about time that this bill, along with Sarah's  Law and Kate's Law, be moved off of Mitch McConnell's desk to the floor  of the United States Senate.   That is just a small piece of the broad picture we are addressing  here tonight, Mr. Speaker. We need some action over in the Senate. If  they would get rid of that filibuster rule, we would see more action  than we are seeing today.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me, and I  encourage him to continue this effort. I am going to stand with him on  this. I thank him for all he is doing.
