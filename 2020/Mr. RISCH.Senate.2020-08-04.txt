 Mr. President, as a member and former chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each  month, I recognize and celebrate the American entrepreneurial spirit by  highlighting the success of a small business in my home State of Idaho.  Today I am pleased to honor Maag Prescription and Medical Supply in  Pocatello as the Idaho Small Business of the Month for August 2020 and  congratulate them on 70 years of business.   Maag Prescription and Medical Supply is an independent, locally owned  pharmacy which has been operated by the Maag family since 1950.  Established by Irvin and Genevieve Maag, the couple ran all aspects of  the business and quickly developed a reputation for providing exemplary  service while meeting the specific needs of their customers. As the  business flourished and ownership transitioned to their son and  daughter-in-law, Greg and Kathy Maag, a fire ravaged the facility in  1977. Despite this obstacle, the Maags persevered and built a new  storefront, expanding it three times to accommodate the business's  growth. Maag Prescription and Medical Supply's resiliency and service  to the community has not gone unnoticed. For the past 2 years the  business received the Idaho State Journal's annual Reader's Choice  Award.   Today, Maag Prescription and Medical Supply plays an important role  serving the community and providing more than 20 jobs to Southeast  Idaho in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Maags have made it a  priority to support their customers while maintaining customer and  employee safety. Their business stands as a true testament to American  industriousness, exemplifying one of our Nation's most treasured  values. Now, in one of the most economically uncertain times, their  story reminds us of the importance of commitment to our communities and  resilience in the face of adversity.   Congratulations to Greg and Kathy Maag, and all of the employees of  Maag Prescription and Medical Supply on being selected as the Idaho  Small Business of the Month for August 2020. You make our great State  proud, and I look forward to your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
