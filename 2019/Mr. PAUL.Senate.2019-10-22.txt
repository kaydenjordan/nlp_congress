 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to  speak for up to 15 minutes, followed by Senators Johnson, Risch, and  Menendez, for 5 minutes each.    Mr. President, today, we will vote on whether or not to  admit North Macedonia into NATO. I, for one, think we already have  enough dead weight in NATO and that adding North Macedonia to NATO adds  absolutely nothing to our collective security.   In his farewell address, George Washington stated: ``It is our true  policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any portion of the  foreign world.'' This was echoed by Thomas Jefferson in his inaugural  address, who wished for ``peace, commerce, and honest friendship with  all nations . . . entangling alliances with none.'' As we watch the  most recent developments in Syria unfold, it is a good moment to  remember the guidance that Washington and Jefferson attempted to pass  along.   Turkey, a nation that we have been locked in a permanent alliance  with since the Cold War, has launched an offensive, a war of choice, by  further invading Syria.   While they are clearly acting in their own self-interest, their  actions place our Nation one mistake or one small incident away from a  hot war with at least one major global power. Does it make sense for  American men and women to potentially have to defend Turkey over their  war of choice?   I believe that when Jefferson spoke of entangling alliances, one  could not pick a better example than how we have expanded NATO. Since  2004, we have expanded NATO ever closer to the border of Russia. In the  process, we have added the so-called military might of countries such  as Slovenia, Latvia, Albania, Montenegro, and now, today, North  Macedonia.   What benefit is it to the United States to add countries that barely  have enough military might to defend themselves? I say that adding  North Macedonia to NATO adds absolutely nothing to our national  security.   The best-case scenario we can hope for with these countries is that  an incident that triggers a major land war never occurs. If you think  this is far-fetched, remember that World War I began when a Serbian  nationalist assassinated the heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire.  Within months, the very system of entangling alliances that our  forefathers warned about turned Europe into a killing field, which  ultimately killed upward of 19 million people. Adding yet another small  country to NATO does nothing to dissipate the chances of catastrophic  war and, in fact, encourages that possibility.   What military capabilities does North Macedonia bring to the table?  Some 8,200 active-duty soldiers. Additionally, in 2018, they spent a  whopping $120 million a year on their military. By comparison, the  Chicago Cubs spent $221 million on their payroll. Additionally, 15  other Major League Baseball teams spent more on their rosters than  North Macedonia spends on defense. Even if North Macedonia brought  their military spending in line with NATO guidelines, it would still  only be $227 million.   But if the goal of NATO is to have these countries spend 2 percent,  why don't we wait until they are spending 2 percent to admit them  instead of admitting them and saying: Please, increase your defense  spending.   If they come up to 2 percent, they would only be spending $227  million, which is $103 million less than Bryce Harper's contract with  the Philadelphia Phillies.   NATO is supposed to be about mutual defense, not just blanket  security guarantees to smaller states.   How much would North Macedonia give in monetary terms to NATO? Less  than $1 million. We foot the bill. We pay for everything. We are going  to get less than $1 million of direct contributions from North  Macedonia. It doesn't seem hardly fair; does it?   It is clear that North Macedonia adds little, if any, value to the  NATO alliance in terms of manpower or military capabilities, which  means that the only reason they are being added is to be a tripwire  that would only ensnare us in a rapidly escalating wider war in which  they would not be able to carry their own weight. So I don't think  North Macedonia adds anything to our national security, but they are  out there on the edge of Europe as a tripwire to ensnare us in a wider  war.   If the recent events involving Turkey were not enough to validate the  guidance laid down by our Founding Fathers, then adding North Macedonia  to a tangled network of permanent alliances certainly is. We would be  wise to revisit and heed our Founding Fathers, who said getting  involved in entangling alliances in Europe does not add to our  security; it threatens our security.   I urge a ``no'' vote. I don't think we need to expand NATO. We  certainly don't need more people that the American taxpayer will be  asked to pay for.    Madam President, reserving the right to object. If  Democrats want to send our young men and women to fight in the Syrian  civil war, let's have that debate. By all means, let's have a  constitutional debate today on the Senate floor, right here, right now.  If Democrats are so hungry for war, let's have that debate.   Our Founding Fathers gave us a constitutional method to go to war. If  there be a national security interest in Syria, let's hear it. The  other side does not want that debate. They want to lob invectives at  the President, but they aren't prepared to debate about whom we are to  go to war against.   Do they wish to declare war on our NATO ally, Turkey? Do they wish to  declare war on our former ally, the Free Syrian Army? Do they wish to  declare war on Syria's Assad? They don't know.   No, Democrats just want to heap abuse on the President. They don't  want to debate war because they have no clue on whom to declare war.   In reality, the President made the wise decision to move 50 soldiers  out of the way of tens of thousands of Turkish troops. Ironically, the  President's decision may finally allow the Kurds to negotiate with  Assad for a semiautonomous region in northern Syria. Perhaps, if the  Kurds pledge their battle-proven fighters to Assad, they might receive  in exchange some autonomy and a share of the oil receipts, much as the  Kurds did in Iraq. Already we are seeing promising cooperation between  the Kurds and Assad.   This week, Turkey's Erdogan met with Putin. Putin already is allied  with Assad. There is a possibility diplomacy may actually break through  here. There is a real chance that the Syrian civil war could come to an  end if Assad, with the Kurds' help, would agree to secure the border  and not allow Kurdish raids into Turkey.   The permanent war caucus on both sides of the aisle claims that  repositioning 50 troops is the end of the world. Perhaps, just maybe,  less of our presence in Syria will actually lead to diplomacy and,  ultimately, peace. Only time will tell.   I object.    Madam President, if our goal is to create a Kurdish  homeland and to defend it for them, hell yes, we need a debate and a  vote and an authorization of force.   You can't just say that we are going to stay there forever. It would  take tens of thousands of troops if you want to pacify Syria. It has  not been pacified for 8 years. It is an utter and complete mess, and it  is time we get the hell out.                            ____________________
