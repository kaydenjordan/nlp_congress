 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of my  bipartisan amendment to H.R. 4, the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018,  which would address the underrepresentation of women in aviation  careers.   Women make up 50 percent of the national workforce, but are  significantly underrepresented in the aviation industry, making up only  2 percent of airline mechanics, 18 percent of flight dispatchers, and 6  percent of pilots.   To address these shortfalls, I introduced the Promoting Women in the  Aviation Workforce Act with my colleagues, Congresswomen Walorski,  Walters, and Bustos, and our bill was recently reported unanimously out  of committee.   This bipartisan amendment will incorporate our bill into this  legislation, directing the FAA to create and facilitate an advisory  board to develop strategies that the administration can take to help  more women pursue and succeed in aviation careers.   We need only look to the extraordinary skill of Southwest pilot and  Navy fighter pilot veteran Tammie Jo Shults, who just, 1 week ago,  heroically saved the lives of 143 passengers and her crew on Southwest  flight 1380, or Ronnie Bradley from my district. Here is Ronnie at age  19, who signed up in 1942 to become one of the first female marines.  She served as an airline mechanic; now still only 2 percent. We  celebrated her life at 95 2 weeks ago in my district.   We need more Tammie Jos and more Ronnies.   Mr. Chair, I thank my colleagues for supporting this legislation.   I commend as well the excellent legislation updating our FEMA rules  for disaster resiliency and relief.   Mr. Chair, I urge support of this legislation and urge the Senate to  adopt it quickly.
