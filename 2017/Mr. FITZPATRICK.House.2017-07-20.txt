 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor Habitat for Humanity of  Bucks County, which is an organization dedicated to eliminating  substandard housing, locally and worldwide, through constructing,  rehabilitating, and preserving homes.   This global, nonprofit housing organization, with a local chapter in  my district, operates on the principles that seek to put God's love  into action. Habitat for Humanity of Bucks County advocates for fair  and just housing policies that provide training and access to resources  to help families improve their living conditions.   The Bucks County chapter of Habitat for Humanity is a motivated team,  driven towards service, where they build communities and empower  families. I am grateful for the work of Executive Director Florence  Kawoczka, Laura Blair, B.J. Breish, Colleen Brink, Stefanie Clark,  Candace Clarke, Mike Fallon, Susan Harrity, Josh Hilliker, Theresa  Leonard, Sam Martin, Tracy Mulvaney, Karen Reever, and all of the  associates and volunteers who make this organization possible.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to work with the Bucks County Habitat for  Humanity, driven by the conviction that every man, every woman, and  every child should have a simple, durable place to live in dignity and  safety, and that decent shelter and decent community should be a matter  of conscience for all of us.                            ____________________
