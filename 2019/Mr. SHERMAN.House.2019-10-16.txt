 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution, and I  rise in  [[Page H8161]]  opposition to the recent decision of the Trump administration.   We had a situation in Syria that was stable. We had a modest  deployment of American troops. We were successful in limiting American  casualties to a very low number. We had defeated the caliphate. Our  friends, the Kurds, who had incurred most of the deaths by the many  thousands necessary to destroy the ISIS caliphate, were safe. In other  words, the situation was stable and favorable to the United States.   Now we have taken an action in which America is humiliated, the Kurds  are subject to slaughter, our word means less in the world, and ISIS  stands to be revitalized. This is such an obvious mistake. It is hard  to find anyone with any knowledge of foreign policy that regards it as  anything other than an unforced error. It is such a great mistake that  it makes you wonder whether it was an intentional mistake designed to  give Russia territory in northeast Syria, for whatever reason we might  want to do that.   It is time to reevaluate our policies toward Turkey. Since the 1940s,  we have safeguarded Turkey through our membership in NATO and theirs.  We protected Turkey from subversion in the 1940s and protected it from  the Soviet Union for decades. Recently, over the last 20 years, we have  had a policy of obsequious humiliation in our approach to Turkey. We  have kowtowed to Ankara in failing to recognize the Armenian genocide.   In doing so, we have taken a foreign policy normally based on truth  and honor, and instead, humiliated ourselves through silence and  concealment. It is time to recognize the Armenian genocide by an  overwhelming vote here in the House. It is time for us to stop dishonor  in our relationship with Turkey.
