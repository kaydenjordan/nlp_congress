 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring up H.R.  724, which would rescind President Trump's refugee ban that keeps apart  families like that of Luca Freschi, who had planned to move to Harvard  Medical School in March but whose Iranian wife would not be able to  join him.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. As previously announced, that unanimous  consent request cannot be entertained.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.
