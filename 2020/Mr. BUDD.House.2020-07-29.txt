 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the amazing work  being done to produce a vaccine for the coronavirus. Some of the best  work in our country is coming from FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies'  Innovation Center in my home State of North Carolina.   On Monday, July 27, President Trump visited the Morrisville  laboratories and touted the progress that has been made in Operation  Warp Speed toward producing an effective vaccine in historic time. The  Morrisville laboratories play a crucial role in that effort because  they are working on a bulk drug substance for one of the possible  vaccines.   It is impossible to overstate how important a vaccine will be for our  Nation, and I am proud that North Carolina is on the front lines of  that research.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the President for highlighting these facilities'  exciting work, and especially thank the researchers, the doctors, and  the scientists for their tireless work, and wish them every success  possible.                           Restoring Law and Order     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to stand up for law and order and  safety and security in our country.   In an era where some in the opposition party advocate for defunding  the police, violent crime and rioting has swept across the Nation. No  city has endured more violence and less government action than  Portland, Oregon.   For 60 days, local officials have refused to protect the fundamental  rights of their citizens, mainly the right to life, to liberty, and to  personal property. I believe that if State and local officials won't  secure these rights for their fellow Americans, then the Federal  Government should do it for them at the direction of the President. I  fully support the President's deployment of Federal officers to restore  law and order and safety and security on the streets of Portland.   One of the most heartbreaking episodes of the violent crime that has  occurred recently occurred in Kansas City, Missouri, where a four-year- old, LeGend Taliferro, was shot and killed while he was asleep in his  own bed. It was just a month ago on June 29.   Mr. Speaker, the only way to deal with violent criminals is to meet  them with strength. And that is what the President is doing by  initiating a Federal law enforcement operation, appropriately named  Operation Legend. Very simply, this operation will focus on putting  more cops on the streets in high-crime cities, making more funding  available for local police departments, and use Federal officers when  local officials refuse to act.   Mr. Speaker, we are never going to defund the police. Instead, we are  going to empower them to stop this crime surge that is terrorizing our  American brothers and sisters.                            ____________________
