 Mr. Speaker, I will be glad to address the gentleman's  question.   There are a number of different areas where we actually collect  money. The LWCF is one of those. $900 million a year comes from oil  producers. It is supposed to be spent on something, but it goes back to  the Treasury.   So if we went into a colloquy back and forth, I will be glad to do  that with the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).   That being said, Mr. Speaker, we have had this debate. The ranking  member is exactly right. This is the only place you can exceed an  unlimited budget by $10 billion.   We have agreed to something, and all of a sudden what happens is now  they start to push back. They start to push back because you know what?  This priority wasn't included in the budget caps deal.   It is amazing that my colleague opposite now is, all of a sudden,  becoming a fiscal conservative. So I will give him an honorary  invitation to join the Freedom Caucus.                                time  1530    It is amazing how fiscally conservative some of the Members opposite  get when it comes to some special project that they want to overlook.   Mr. Speaker, I would just say, the truth here today is that not only  do we need to be fiscally responsible for the American taxpayer, but we  need to start showing some fiscal restraints here in this body.  Eventually, you run out of other people's money, and I think that day  is now.    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman from Oregon is suggesting  that we do not pay for that fee in the ultimate gas tax that we--you  know, he is the chairman of the Transportation Committee. As anybody  knows, he would know that it is embedded in part of that.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his kind comments. I have  often wondered, on the pharmaceutical commercials that you see on TV,  who is the individual who can speak as fast as the narrator and puts in  the disclaimers. I have now found the gentleman from Oregon to be that  individual, so it is a good day for me.   I thank the gentleman for his support. Certainly, I rise in support  of H.R. 1306, the Federal Disaster Assistance Coordination Act.   As the chairman was noting, this is a bipartisan, commonsense piece  of legislation that would amend the Disaster Recovery Reform Act and  establish a process to identify ways to streamline it and consolidate  the collection of certain disaster information.   I would be remiss, Mr. Speaker, if I didn't mention the work of the  gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves), along with the gentleman from  California (Mr. Peters), in terms of really trying to make sure that,  when we allocate dollars, they get to those people who are suffering  most. The last thing we need is for them to be caught up in a  bureaucracy that was not of their own making.   Following a disaster, many times, damage assessment needs are to be  done quickly. In North Carolina, even most recently, some of those get  into a lot of finger-pointing back and forth, Mr. Speaker.   Just last week, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure  received testimony from State and local  [[Page H8486]]  emergency managers on how that cumbersome process is and what it is  now.   So, while FEMA is certainly the lead Federal agency on disasters,  there is often an alphabet soup of Federal agencies that have to get  involved in the disaster response, and it is the local Federal  coordinators that actually have to work in this recovery.   So it is critical that we look throughout all of our agencies to  minimize the overlap, certainly as it relates to assessments, and  consider the use of newer technologies and how to streamline the  process.   Specifically, this bill will establish a Federal working group, led  by FEMA, that would work with the Council of the Inspectors General on  integrity and efficiency to determine how the damage assessment process  can be streamlined and whether new technologies can be used to speed up  the process.   Mr. Speaker, this is just a good-government bill that will improve  disaster recovery. As the gentleman knows, being from the great State  of Texas, as well as I do, when people are hurting from disasters, what  they want are fast, efficient recovery efforts. Hopefully, this  bipartisan effort will do that.   I encourage support of this bill, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Louisiana (Mr. Graves).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Louisiana for his  comments. When you think of disaster recovery and think of a champion  who has been wanting to address this, not just on this bill, but each  and every bill that he looks at, there is no greater advocate that the  American people have than the gentleman from Louisiana.   In closing, I want to thank the chairman. Many times we can have  different opinions on different particular pieces of legislation, but  the gentleman has always been thoughtful, and certainly, under his  leadership, in his chairmanship, he has worked in a bipartisan manner  to advance legislation.   I appreciate the gentleman's willingness to allow this bill to come  to the floor, and I urge its adoption.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2502, the Transparency in  Federal Buildings Projects Act. As the chairman just mentioned, it is a  commonsense piece of legislation.   I would like to thank the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Palmer) for his  leadership on this bill. I am pleased that I am actually a cosponsor of  this particular legislation.   H.R. 2502 does provide for greater transparency to the taxpayers on  the public buildings projects and leases. It actually would require the  General Services Administration, or what we refer to as GSA, to include  on its websites all project proposals and associated information and  submit that to Congress under the Public Buildings Act for approval.   This is a simple action, but it can have a significant impact on  improving the accountability and transparency that all American  taxpayers yearn for.   While GSA includes some information on its website, that information  provided is somewhat limited. This bill would ensure that taxpayers  know what projects have been proposed, how much they will cost, and  which have been actually approved.   In 2013 the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure began  filling this void by posting this information on its website. Since  that time the committee's website has become a critical resource not  only for the public and private sector but also for Federal agencies.  However, to ensure the continuity and that this information continues  to be regularly updated and maintained, this bill would place that  responsibility on GSA.                                time  1615    As I mentioned, this is a commonsense, straightforward bill. I thank  Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves for their willingness to  address efficient and effective government agency.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support this  legislation, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume the  gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Palmer), the sponsor of this particular  piece of legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I am assuming  that the gentleman opposite is. As we close, I thank the chairman once  again for his support, and I thank the sponsor of this particular bill.   We do believe that GSA, in posting this information in a searchable  fashion, will provide for a more open and transparent government.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support that, and I yield back  the balance of my time
