 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, the opioid crisis has impacted every community in America  and robbed countless individuals of their potential.   A recent poll found that more than 4 out of 10 Americans who are  young, in their 20s and 30s, personally know someone who has dealt with  opioid addiction. It is a staggering number, and it shows that this  crisis touches a huge part of our society.   All too often, we hear stories of loved ones exposed to opioids, and  then quickly addicted, from routine surgeries that may not have  required opioid treatment in the first place. This can be prevented.  That is why I rise today in support of H.R. 6, known as the SUPPORT for  Patients and Communities Act.   This bill, which incorporates legislation recently approved by the  Ways and Means Committee, addresses this crisis by putting in place  many commonsense measures to reduce the unnecessary prescription of  opioids and also to help those who have become addicted.   One important policy within H.R. 6, which has been championed by  Congressman Peter Roskam, who leads our Subcommittee on Health, will  prevent abuse by making sure folks are not able to game the system by  visiting multiple doctors' offices in order to receive an opioid. H.R.  6 ensures that patients have selected prescribers and selected  pharmacies that will be best able to address their needs.   Another important measure expands access to more forms of really  broad, holistic treatments for addiction through the use of medication- assisted treatment. Americans who are struggling with addiction must be  able to find treatment that works for them.                                time  1015    While we still have a long way to go to solve this crisis, this bill,  which is made up of many commonsense, Republican and Democrat  proposals, takes meaningful strides to help millions of Americans  recapture their lost hopes and dreams.   I thank Representatives  Mike Bishop, Dave Reichert, Carlos Curbelo,  Peter Roskam, Erik Paulsen, and Jackie Walorski for their leadership on  this important issue. And I thank all of our committee members,  Republicans and Democrats, for their hard work on this important  legislation. I look forward to working with the Senate to ensure that  we send this important bill to the President's desk.  [[Page H5520]]    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam), the leader of the Health  Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bishop), the leader of the STOP Act,  which prevents illegal smuggling of fentanyl into the United States.    Mr. Chairman, I am proud to yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Holding).    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman  from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski), a leader on the opioid crisis.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Chair, I agree with Mr. Neal. Republicans and Democrats have come  together from the Ways and Means Committee and Energy and Commerce to  help millions of Americans through prevention of overprescribing,  education for patients and prescribers, and access to treatment. This  is a major step forward.   Mr. Chair, I urge Congress to pass this bill. I look forward to  getting it to the President's desk.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
