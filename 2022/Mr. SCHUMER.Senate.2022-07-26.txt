 Mr. President, this morning--this morning--the Senate  will draw a clear line in the sand that America's chip crisis and  America's dwindling commitment to science and innovation will not  continue under our watch. Within the next hour, the Senate will vote,  finally--finally--to move toward final passage of our CHIPS and Science  bill. That is what we are calling it, the CHIPS and Science bill. That  will put us in a position to finish the work on this bill before the  end of the week. It is a major step for our economic security, our  national security, our supply chains, and, in fact, for America's  future--for America's future.   I want to be clear. The proposal we are passing this week contains  the majority of key science and innovation measures that the Senate  passed last summer. It will make historic investments to scientific  research. It will take direct aim at our Nation's chip crisis.  Alongside the infrastructure law and our recent gun safety bill, among  others, it is one of the most consequential bipartisan achievements of  this Congress. I thank all of my Senate colleagues on both sides of the  aisle who are helping to make this happen.   I am confident that future generations will look back on the passage  of this CHIPS and Science bill as a turning point for American  leadership in the 21st century, but it didn't come together overnight.  The legislation has been several years in the making.   In 2019, I approached my Republican colleague Todd Young with a  proposal  [[Page S3662]]  to work together on legislation to revive America's commitment to  science and innovation. Together, we drafted the first iteration of  many policies we are passing this week, the Endless Frontier Act.   A year later, I joined with my colleagues Senators Cornyn and Warner  to push for the authorization of new Federal chips initiatives as part  of the NDAA to address our Nation's growing chip shortage.   We all knew that America faced a choice: We could keep underfunding  science and innovation and continue to let America fall behind our  global competitors, or we could wake up to the challenges of this  century and empower the American people to unleash the next wave of  discovery and scientific achievement. We knew that if we didn't get  there first, our rivals--chief among them the Chinese Communist Party-- would likely beat us to the punch and reshape the world in their  authoritarian image.   In February of 2021, less than a month after I became majority  leader, I directed the chairs and members of our relevant committees to  start drafting a legislative package to outcompete China and create new  American jobs, with the Endless Frontier Act serving as the core of  this effort. I also instructed them to draft legislation to rebuild the  capacity of the U.S. semiconductor industry. The pandemic made clear  with unforgiving clarity how America's chip shortage was creating a  crisis in our economy and national security.   So Members on both sides of the aisle--this has been a bipartisan  effort from the get-go--got to work. We made a commitment last February  that if both sides worked together, we would bring a bill to the floor  for a vote in the spring. And that is what we did, and we passed the  U.S. Innovation and Competition Act with overwhelming bipartisan  support in June of 2021.   A year later, the legislation we are passing this week has many of  the same important measures contained in the bill we worked on last  summer. For example, last year's bill secured historic investments for  science and innovation. This bill does too.   Last year's bill offered tens of billions to encourage American chip  manufacturing and R&D. This bill does that too and even more with the  investment tax credit provisions.   Last year's bill provided funding to help build a wireless  communications supply chain to counter Huawei. This bill does too.   Last year's bill created the National Science Foundation tech  directorate and provided funding to the Department of Energy National  Labs to help compete with foreign rivals in key technologies like AI  and quantum computing. This bill does too.   Last year's bill made major new investments in Manufacturing USA and  the Manufacturing Extension Partnership to strengthen domestic supply  chains. This bill does too.   Last year's bill created the first-ever program to cultivate the tech  hubs of tomorrow in regions around the United States that have enormous  potential but have largely been overlooked--not the big megalopolises  which have a lot of tech in them, like New York City and San Francisco,  but smaller regions that have great talent but have been overlooked.  They might be in Upstate New York. They might be in Indiana and many  other parts of the country. This bill is making sure that happens.   Now, let me be clear. While this bill contains the two major  components of the Science and CHIPS bill, there are other major  proposals from both sides that are still being worked on in the  conference committee. Make no mistake that there are many Democrats and  Republicans who have provisions that will be contained in the  conference report under Chair Cantwell's leadership, and it is my  intention to put the conference committee bill on the floor of the  Senate.   As I said a moment ago, I firmly believe that passing this bill will  be a turning point for American leadership in this century. The  benefits of this legislation will reverberate across the country for  years and decades to come.   For much of the 20th century, America was without peer in our  commitment to scientific research, to innovation, and to new, cutting- edge manufacturing, and it led to tens of millions of good-paying jobs  and made the United States the unquestioned economic leader of the  world.    Today, the story is different. Nations around the world are spending  tens of billions of dollars to secure this century, much like America  secured the last one. Sadly, the Federal Government's commitment to  science has waned in recent decades. In fact, as a percentage of GDP,  we spend less than half as much as the Chinese Communist Party on basic  research--less than half--which is even more devastating given China  has spent decades stealing America's intellectual property.   With this bill, that is finally going to change. We will not only  create the good-paying jobs of tomorrow; we will not only fix our  supply chains and bring costs down for American families with this  bill; with this bill, we will reawaken the spirit of discovery,  innovation, invention, and optimism that made America the envy of the  world.   We don't mean to let the days of American leadership end on our  watch. We don't mean to see America become a middling nation in this  century. We mean for America to lead this century. For that reason, I  urge my colleagues to give a resounding vote ``yes'' on cloture at 11  a.m. today.                                   PACT Act    Mr. President, now on the PACT Act, last night, I filed cloture to  prepare the Senate to once again pass the PACT Act, the largest and  most important expansion of veteran healthcare benefits in decades and  a bipartisan issue to the core--another bipartisan issue.   As my colleagues already know, because of a technical error, the  House of Representatives was unable to take up our version of the bill  that we passed in the spring. The House has now fixed their error and  returned the PACT Act back to the Senate. We want to finish our work on  the PACT Act before the end of the week.   Our Nation's veterans have waited long enough to get the benefits  they need to treat complications from toxic exposure in the line of  duty. So we have every reason in the world to get this bill done  quickly, with the same bipartisan support as the first time around.   The need for the PACT Act is beyond question. Burn pits have affected  up to 3\1/2\ million veterans since 9/11. Yet the VA has rejected  nearly 80 percent of all disability claims connected to burn pits. That  is unacceptable and must change.   I hope Members work together to fast-track this bill as soon as  possible because there is no reason to delay a measure that the vast  majority of Senators from both parties agree is necessary. Our  veterans, their families, and our veterans service organizations have  been urging us to finish work on this bill. Let's keep our promise to  those valiant servicemembers and send the PACT Act quickly to the  President's desk.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 11 a.m.  the Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the motion to concur  with respect to H.R. 4346, the CHIPS and Science legislation.    I suggest the absence of a quorum.
