 Mr. Speaker, this week, we mark the 33rd birthday of  Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, the 11th Panchen Lama. Born in central Tibet, at  the age of six he was recognized by His Holiness the Dalai Lama as the  reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, one of the most important figures in  the Gelug School of Tibetan Buddhism, and a senior figure across all of  Tibet.   In May of 1995, just 3 days after he was recognized, Gedhun Choekyi  Nyima and his family were taken away by the Chinese Government.  Disappeared. Kidnapped.   For 27 years, Tibetan Buddhists have asked of his well-being. For 27  years, Chinese authorities have refused to provide proof of life. The  most they have said is that he is well and wants to be left alone.   Tibetans deserve an answer. The world deserves to know.   Gedhun Choekyi Nyima remains one of the world's longest-held  prisoners of conscience.   His enforced disappearance is an egregious example of the Chinese  Government's violation of the religious freedom of Tibetan Buddhists,  who have the right to choose their own religious leaders, including the  Dalai Lama, without government interference.   In honor of his birthday, I again call on the Chinese Government to  free the true Panchen Lama immediately and to uphold its international  obligation to respect the religious freedom of all persons.                            ____________________
