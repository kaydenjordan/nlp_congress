 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize my mother, Freda  Flansburg.   My mom was born on March 5, 1944, and peacefully passed away last  week, last Monday, January 2, 2023, at 12:20 a.m.   She was truly a fighter. She lost a child, my older sister, Kimberly,  just after birth. She fought the loneliness of being a mom of two boys  while my dad was away on multiple deployments to Vietnam. When the  weariness of war destroyed our family, she started a new journey in  life that traversed many unplanned hardships.   Life was truly tough as we grew up. My siblings, Jeff, John, Jayme,  and Kia, knew from an early age that our life was different from those  around us. We had no running water, no indoor plumbing. Times were  tough.   My mom worked to do the best she could to provide for us. She never  backed down from the challenges that came before her.  [[Page H117]]    She never cared much for us using our life lessons as excuses.  Rather, she pushed us to use our experiences to become better and to  keep moving on.   Like all moms, she was an encourager. As the oldest child, she looked  to me to set the example for my brothers and sisters. She wasn't  sympathetic when things weren't going my way.   The world is full of opportunities, she would say. The challenge was  always: go to school, make good grades, work hard, treat people with  respect, and see where life takes you. The government will never make  you wealthy, she said. You will have to do that on your own, she would  always tell me.   My mom became a nurse and spent long hours taking care of the elderly  in nursing homes. Many of my visits with my mom over the years were in  the skilled nursing facilities as she would take a break from the  grueling work schedule that she had that demanded so much of her.   After the long years of losing a child, raising five children, being  a grandmother of countless grandchildren, and the arduous work of being  a nurse, my mom's body had withered away.   Her heart had tired, and her eyes could no longer see. The last 4  years have been especially hard for me to watch her health rapidly  decline.   Last Monday, my mom took her last breath on this earthly world. We  all know she is in Heaven looking down upon us with Kimberly by her  side. Her heart is strong, and her eyes are new.   My mom would have never wanted me to stay home and not do my job last  week. She was with me all week as the world watched our great Nation  debate the future of our Republic.   I especially thank the nurses and doctors who cared for my mother in  her last years, months, and days. Your kindness will never be  forgotten.   I thank my congressional colleagues for their kind words, sincere  thoughts, and prayers over the last week.   I was truly moved by the outpouring of love from both Republicans and  Democrats over the past week. I thank Democratic Leader Jeffries,  Caucus Chair Aguilar, and so many of my Democratic colleagues for  setting politics aside and offering quiet condolences.   To all of my Republican colleagues, I simply want to say thank you.  From Leader Scalise, who contacted me immediately upon hearing the  news, to the members of our freshman class, thank you all.   Finally, I thank my loving wife, Tammy, and my children, Ashtyn,  Kelby, and Kaden, for their warmth and love during these difficult  times.   To my mom in Heaven above, I simply want to say, I love you, and I  miss you.                            ____________________
