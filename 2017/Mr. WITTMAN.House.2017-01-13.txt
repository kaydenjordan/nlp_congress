 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 84, a bill that  would allow for General James Mattis to be considered for an  appointment as the 26th Secretary of Defense of the United States.   Leading up to this vote, I have heard time and time again from my  colleagues that they respect General Mattis' service to our country. I  have also heard that they understand him to be an intelligent, capable  leader. Some have even gone so far as to say he is a military hero. I  don't doubt the sincerity of my colleagues' words. In fact, I echo  them.   But for some of my colleagues, this praise for General Mattis is  followed by what I believe is a flawed line of thinking. I have heard  the argument that this vote we have before us today is not about  General Mattis.   My friends, today's vote is clearly about General Mattis. Make no  mistake, a ``yes'' vote today will not permanently change the  requirements prohibiting the appointment of anyone inside of 7 years of  Active Duty service.                                time  1415    This vote will provide a one-time-only exception for General Mattis,  a man of the utmost character.   The original intent of this law was to prevent an Active-Duty  servicemember from retiring and then becoming Secretary of Defense  within the same Presidential administration. With President-elect Trump  raising his right hand in 7 days, it is clear that General Mattis does  not violate the law's original intent. The fact that we are here to  deliberate this issue only proves that the nomination and appointment  process works.   I am encouraged that we are having this debate today. But at the end  of the day, we should not deny the best candidate to become the  Secretary of Defense.   A vote of ``no'' is a vote against General James Mattis. I urge my  fellow colleagues to join me in voting in favor of an exception for an  exceptional American, General James Mattis.
