 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 736, I call  up the bill (H.R. 3299) to amend the Revised Statutes, the Home Owners'  Loan Act, the Federal Credit Union Act, and the Federal Deposit  Insurance Act to require the rate of interest on certain loans remain  unchanged after transfer of the loan, and for other purposes, and  [[Page H1148]]  ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Brat). Pursuant to House Resolution 736,  the bill is considered read.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3299           Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives       of the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.           This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Consumers'       Access to Credit Act of 2017''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.           Congress finds that--          (1) the contractual doctrine of valid when made which, as       applied to lending agreements, provides that a loan that is       valid at inception cannot become usurious upon subsequent       sale or transfer to another person;          (2) this important and longstanding principle derives       from the common law and its application has been a       cornerstone of United States banking law for nearly 200       years, as provided in the case Nichols v. Fearson, 32 U.S. (7       Pet.) 103, 106 (1833), where the Supreme Court famously       declared: ``Yet the rule of law is everywhere acknowledged,       that a contract free from usury in its inception, shall not       be invalidated by any subsequent usurious transactions upon       it.'';          (3) in 2016, the Solicitor General, in consultation with       all Federal banking regulators, filed an amicus brief in the       case of Midland Funding, LLC v. Madden, 136 S. Ct. 2505       (2016) (mem.), denying cert. to 786 F.3d 246 (2d Cir. 2015),       that described the United States Court of Appeals for the       Second Circuit in that case ``incorrect'' with an ``analysis       reflect[ing] a misunderstanding'' of section 85 of the       National Bank Act and Supreme Court precedent, because it       contradicted the contractual doctrine of valid when made;          (4) the valid-when-made doctrine, by bringing certainty       to the legal treatment of all valid loans that are       transferred, greatly enhances liquidity in the credit markets       by widening the potential pool of loan buyers and reducing       the cost of credit to borrowers at the time of origination;          (5) a joint academic study from professors at Stanford,       Fordham, and Columbia universities concluded that the Madden       v. Midland decision has already disproportionately affected       low- and moderate-income individuals in the United States       with lower FICO scores; and          (6) if the valid-when-made doctrine is not reaffirmed       soon by Congress, the lack of access to safe and affordable       financial services will force households in the United States       with the fewest resources to seek financial products that are       nontransparent, fail to inform consumers about the terms of       credit available, and do not comply with State and Federal       laws (including regulations).       SEC. 3. RATE OF INTEREST AFTER TRANSFER OF LOAN.           (a) Amendment to the Revised Statutes.--Section 5197 of       the Revised Statutes (12 U.S.C. 85) is amended by adding at       the end the following: ``A loan that is valid when made as to       its maximum rate of interest in accordance with this section       shall remain valid with respect to such rate regardless of       whether the loan is subsequently sold, assigned, or otherwise       transferred to a third party, and may be enforced by such       third party notwithstanding any State law to the contrary.''.          (b) Amendment to the Home Owners' Loan Act.--Section 4(g)       of the Home Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 1463(g)) is amended       by adding at the end the following:          ``(3) A loan that is valid when made as to its maximum       rate of interest in accordance with this subsection shall       remain valid with respect to such rate regardless of whether       the loan is subsequently sold, assigned, or otherwise       transferred to a third party, and may be enforced by such       third party notwithstanding any State law to the contrary.''.          (c) Amendment to the Federal Credit Union Act.--Section       205(g) of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1785(g)) is       amended by adding at the end the following:          ``(3) A loan that is valid when made as to its maximum       rate of interest in accordance with this subsection shall       remain valid with respect to such rate regardless of whether       the loan is subsequently sold, assigned, or otherwise       transferred to a third party, and may be enforced by such       third party notwithstanding any State law to the contrary.''.          (d) Amendment to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.--      Section 27 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C.       1831d) is amended by adding at the end the following:          ``(c) A loan that is valid when made as to its maximum       rate of interest in accordance with this section shall remain       valid with respect to such rate regardless of whether the       loan is subsequently sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred       to a third party, and may be enforced by such third party       notwithstanding any State law to the contrary.''.       SEC. 4. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.           Nothing in this Act may be construed as limiting the       authority or jurisdiction of the Office of the Comptroller of       the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the       Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Bureau       of Consumer Financial Protection, or the National Credit       Union Administration.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling)  and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters) each will  control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3299, the Protecting  Consumers' Access to Credit Act of 2017, a most important goal of this  Chamber. H.R. 3299 is an important bill that is cosponsored by a  bipartisan group of Members of the House and was approved by the House  Financial Services Committee with a very strong bipartisan vote of 42- 17.   I would like to start out by thanking my colleague, the gentleman  from North Carolina (Mr. McHenry), the vice chairman of the committee,  for introducing this legislation and leading our congressional efforts  to help create a regulatory framework which will encourage the growth  of financial technology and expand much-needed access to credit for  American small businesses and consumers.   H.R. 3299 is a legislative response to the 2015 Second Circuit Court  of Appeals decision in Madden v. Midland Funding, which clearly appears  to have not not considered the valid-when-made legal doctrine, which is  a nearly 200-year-old principle of usury law in our Republic. Again,  Mr. Speaker, 200 years of settled common law upended in one court case.   In the decision, the court held that, while the National Bank Act  allowed a federally chartered bank to charge interest under the laws of  its home State on loans it makes nationwide, nonbanks that bought those  loans could not continue to collect that interest because nonbanks are  generally subject to the limits of the borrower's State.   The Second Circuit decision has caused considerable uncertainty and  risk for many types of bank lending programs, including bank model  marketplace lending where national banks originate loans and then  transfer them to nonbank third parties.   Being able to offer consistent terms nationwide is vital to scaling  the marketplace lending business, which, in turn, allows lenders to  access cheaper investment capital and then pass the savings on to the  borrowers who may be looking to buy their first home, start a business,  send a kid to college.   H.R. 3299, again, is a commonsense bill that simply codifies the 200- year-old valid-when-made legal doctrine, which would preserve the  lawful interest rate on a loan originated by a bank even if the loan is  sold, assigned, or transferred to a nonbank third party.   This fundamental concept is the backbone of how fintech companies  partner with banks. Without it, consumers are faced with higher costs  and less availability of credit, particularly those consumers with less  access to traditional lending sources.   Mr. Speaker, don't take my word for it. According to a recent  Columbia/Stanford University study, borrowers with credit scores under  625 have seen their credit cut in half, cut in half thanks to this  decision. Again, Mr. Speaker, borrowers with less than stellar credit  scores have seen their credit cut in half in the territory comprising  the Second Circuit. We simply cannot allow this to happen.   Now, Mr. Speaker, thanks to President Trump and Congress passing the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we are beginning to see this economy start to  take off. We are finally seeing wages begin to grow after 8 years of  failed economic policy, but so much work remains to be done for working  American families.   We have heard, on our Financial Services Committee, Mr. Speaker, from  so many of these families who are trying to make ends meet, and it is  just vital that they be able to access credit.   Americans like Alan from New Hampshire, who recently had trouble  finding credit through traditional  [[Page H1149]]  banks and credit unions due to the regulatory load. As he explained:  ``But for my local dealer's efforts on my behalf, there is no doubt I  would not be driving my current car. And this was a desperate  situation, as I am the sole income earner for my family. My wife is  ill, and we have two young children in school. After my old vehicle  broke down, I needed to find reliable replacement transportation so I  could get to work and continue to provide for my family.''   Mr. Speaker, we should not let the Second Circuit prevent Alan from  getting that car loan he desperately needs in order to get to work as  the sole provider for his family.   A small-business owner from Utah named Maxine applied for a loan for  her 37-year-old established business so she could update and purchase  equipment to support a contract that would have led to the creation of  50 additional jobs. She explained: ``Three banks informed us that our  rating, according to new bank regulations imposed by Dodd-Frank,  disqualified us from loan consideration.''   Fifty jobs, poof, gone, Mr. Speaker.   So is not Dodd-Frank bad enough? Now we are going to add this Second  Circuit opinion to deny credit, which, for lower credit score  individuals, has cut credit opportunity in half?   I don't think so. I don't think so. It is not up for the unelected to  make such decisions.   We cannot continue to allow, Mr. Speaker, Washington red tape and the  Second Circuit to cut off credit opportunities for hardworking  Americans. As the bill says: ``We must preserve and protect consumers'  access to credit.''   I urge every Member to support this very important bipartisan bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1415    Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 3299, or the so- called Protecting Consumers' Access to Credit Act of 2017. There is a  good reason over 200 civil rights, consumer, faith-based, housing,  labor, and veterans advocacy organizations oppose this bill. The type  of credit that this bill helps consumers access is the kind that makes  it easier for vulnerable consumers to sink into insurmountable debt  like payday and other high-cost loans.   H.R. 3299 expands the ability of nonbanks to preempt State-level  consumer protections by stating that the interest rate on any loan  originated by a national bank that is subsequently transferred to a  third party, no matter how quickly after it is originated, is  enforceable, which incentivizes riskier and predatory lending. H.R.  3299 advances a dangerous precedent by allowing third parties that  purchase loans from national banks to collect on interest rates that  would otherwise be illegal because they exceed State caps.   Now, this bill is an attempt to overturn a court decision related to  the legal concept of ``valid when made'' from the Second Circuit Court  of Appeals in Madden v. Midland Funding, LLC. In that case, the court  held that, when loans are transferred from banks to nonbank third  parties, they must maintain the same terms, rates, and conditions as  required by the State where the originating bank is chartered.   Despite claims by proponents of the bill, legal experts have  explained in testimony that ``the valid-when-made doctrine is a modern  invention, not a cornerstone of U.S. banking law.''   The Madden decision is only the rule of law in the States under the  Second Circuit, which are Connecticut, New York, and Vermont. Some  industry advocates, particularly marketplace lender fintechs, have  argued the ruling and confusion about valid when made caused such great  market ambiguity that it has resulted in reduced lending to needy  borrowers in those States, but those claims have not been  substantiated.   The only purported evidence we have on the effect of the Madden rule  is a single, unpublished study that cannot even be peer-reviewed  because it relies on private data from a single, unidentified  marketplace lender, and the authors of that study have not endorsed  this bill. In addition, 20 State attorneys general, including the  attorneys general for all three States under the Second Circuit, oppose  this legislative change.   But do you know what? Predatory lenders are worried about the Madden  case for a different reason.   Elevate, an online payday lender, is afraid that they won't be able  to continue making predatory loans if the Madden decision stays in  place. In their public filings with the SEC, Elevate said:         To the extent that the holdings in Madden were broadened to       cover circumstances applicable to Elevate's business or if       other litigation on related theories were brought against us       and were successful, we could become subject to State usury       limits and State licensing laws in addition to the State       consumer protection laws to which we are already subject. In       a greater number of States, loans in such States could be       deemed void and unenforceable, and we would be subject to       substantial penalties in connection with such loans.    Mr. Speaker, I do not doubt the sincerity of the good actors that may  be trying to navigate a difficulty the Madden ruling potentially  caused, but this is not just about those businesses, because H.R. 3299  would go much further to allow other third parties, including payday  lenders, to evade or outright disregard State-level laws and collect  debt from borrowers at unreasonably high rates of interest if they  purchase loans from a national bank. These arrangements are called  rent-a-bank or rent-a-charter agreements, and they allow payday lenders  to use banks as a front for predatory behavior and the evasion of State  interest rate caps.   Payday loans drain wealth from low-income consumers, particularly  those in communities of color, and payday loans trap their borrowers  into a cycle of debt that it takes years to climb out of with high  interest rates that are often in excess of 300 percent.   So let's be clear. Instead of simply overturning the Madden decision,  H.R. 3299 would go far beyond that and codify an expanded preemption  power without any proof that it will benefit consumers. In fact, all we  do know is that the bill will make it easier for bad actors to evade  safeguards that States have put in place to protect borrowers.   We cannot advance a bill that will allow nonbanks like payday lenders  to ignore State interest rate caps and make high-rate loans. While  Congress has preempted some State laws for national banks, it did not  authorize national banks to extend the privilege to whatever entities  they so choose.   I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. McHenry), vice chairman of the committee and  sponsor of the legislation.   Mr. McHENRY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for his  kindness in working with me and my team on bringing this bill to the  floor today, and I want to thank his staff as well.   What we have today is the Protecting Consumers' Access to Credit Act,  a bipartisan piece of legislation that we have both Republicans and the  Democrats in the Senate in support of as well as Democrats and  Republicans here in the House of Representatives supportive of.   The issue we are dealing with is one of the biggest challenges facing  our country, which is the decline of lending to consumers and small  businesses in small towns and rural communities like the ones I  represent in western North Carolina. It is the same issue facing so  many in urban settings as well. This touches all of America.   But the story in rural America is bleak. Community banks are closing  at a rapid pace, and small businesses are struggling to find loans.  Many Americans don't have the savings to cover a common $1,000  emergency like a car repair. That is not just a rural issue; that  touches all American communities.    The good news is, after the financial crisis, innovative companies  and banks partnered together to find new ways to help hardworking  Americans and small-business owners. They call it fintech.   These innovative companies partner with banks to help small  businesses get a loan. They help young people get out of student debt.  They help everyday Americans find the financing they need to lead  better lives.  [[Page H1150]]    Now, this should be something heralded by both parties. It shouldn't  be a partisan issue. It shouldn't be left or right, conservative or  liberal. It is a good thing that is happening with innovation and  different modes of lending and borrowing in this country.   And while this era of financial innovation is brand-new, the actual  structure supporting fintech is based on one of the oldest bedrock  principles in American law. The fundamental concept is called valid  when made.   Valid when made, or what the Supreme Court referred to in 1833 as  ``the cardinal rule'' of American interest rate laws, provides the  legal foundation for how fintech companies partner with banks.   I don't have to share with the ranking member or other Members of our  Chamber that banks are heavily regulated; and if they even partner with  another firm, that, too, is a regulated thing. Yet all that changed  when the Supreme Court declined to hear the case of Madden v. Midland  Funding.   In Madden, activist judges on a Federal appeals court broke with a  longstanding legal precedent of valid when made and, instead, held that  the 1864 National Bank Act did not have a preemptive effect on loans  created under this fintech bank partnership.   Now the legal framework has been around almost for 200 years, and the  particular law that we are dealing with has been around for 150 years,  roughly speaking. This decision, though, has created uncertainty for  fintech companies, financial institutions, and credit markets  generally.   According to a study from Columbia University and Stanford  University, Madden significantly reduced credit availability in that  affected region, and this matters for all Americans because of the  effect it is having.   What we saw is loan volumes declined and the average FICO score for  borrowers to get a loan increased. That means that, if you are on the  margins of society, it got harder and more expensive for you to get  lending. So it is a bad case. Simply put, this should not be happening,  and if we are serious about financial inclusion for all Americans, we  need this bill today. A bipartisan bill, we need it.   And if we are serious about modernizing our financial system, we need  this bill passed into law. And if we are serious about helping everyday  Americans, not just the fortunate few with unblemished credit, we need  to pass this bill.   I am pleased this legislation enjoys support from my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle. I want to thank Representative Meeks,  Democrat, of New York; Senator Mark Warner, Democrat, of Virginia; and  Senator Pat Toomey, Republican, of Pennsylvania, who worked hard on  this bipartisan, bicameral legislation. It is important. It is needed.  It will have a positive impact on people's lives.   All arguments that have been made against this bill on the floor  don't actually focus on what is important and necessary about this  legislation. They are straw men that don't have anything to do with the  contents of this very simple, bipartisan piece of legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to vote for this.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to  the gentleman from California (Mr. Khanna), vice chair of the  Congressional Progressive Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds just to say to  the gentleman who says this is a majority bill, I would also point out  it is supported by Congressman Meeks, Democrat from New York;  Congressman Clay, Democrat from Missouri; Congressman Scott, Democrat  from Georgia; Congressman Cleaver, Democrat from Missouri;  Congresswoman Moore, Democrat from Wisconsin; Congressman Perlmutter,  Democrat from Colorado; Congresswoman Sinema, Democrat from Arizona,  and the list goes on.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania  (Mr. Rothfus), the vice chairman of our Subcommittee on Financial  Institutions and Consumer Credit.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger), the vice chairman of the Terrorism and  Illicit Finance Subcommittee.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger), the vice chairman of the Terrorism and  Illicit Finance Subcommittee.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton), vice chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight  and Investigations.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Emmer), a hardworking member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, number one, just for the Record, it is Mr. Rothfus from  Pennsylvania and Mr. Pittenger from North Carolina. Since we serve with  these colleagues, it would be nice to learn their names.   Mr. Speaker, what the ranking member is proposing is to take away  credit opportunities for those who need it the most.   The greatest credit program is a competitive marketplace. And,  unfortunately, the policy that she is advocating, this Second Circuit  court case, has cut credit opportunities in half. That means people are  paying more. In many respects, this is a more usurious result than what  the ranking member is otherwise claiming will happen without the Second  Circuit decision.   Again, I alluded to it in my opening statement, but we have the  definitive academic study. We don't have to guess at this, Mr. Speaker.  They studied those with lower credit scores in the Second Circuit.   And what did they find out?   I will quote from the study. The results presented in figure 3  indicate that the FICO increase was caused by a decline--a decline--in  lending to lower quality borrowers.   Thank you, Second Circuit.   The pattern is most obvious for the lowest quality borrowers, those  with FICO scores below 625. The growth rate for these borrowers in  Connecticut and New York was a negative 52 percent.   Mr. Speaker, that means they had their credit opportunities cut in  half. So exactly what the ranking member says that she wants to do to  help these people, she is hurting these people; taking away their  opportunities to buy a home or taking away their opportunities to buy a  car when they may be the sole breadwinner for their family; taking away  opportunities, perhaps, to send somebody to college.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.   And then this so-called radical bill of the gentleman from North  Carolina, I would note it is a Democrat bill in the Senate. The exact  companion bill is carried by a Democrat Senator, Senator Warner from  Virginia. It is a Democrat bill. It is bipartisan. It is supported by  at least nine Members of the ranking member's party that sit  [[Page H1153]]  with her in our hearings. Clearly, they heard something she didn't  hear.   Again, Mr. Speaker, it is important to note that what the Second  Circuit has done is change settled law that has been settled law for  over 200 years; that will completely not only cut credit opportunities  in the Second Circuit, but cut credit opportunities all over America.   We cannot allow that to happen.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I think my friend on the opposite side of the aisle, the  chairman, is right. I must make sure that I am correct in the way that  I identify my colleagues, who they are and what States they come from.   So I would like to repeat: Mr. McHenry is from North Carolina. Mr.  Pittenger is from North Carolina. The attorney general from that State  opposes this bill, and this State has banned payday lending.   Also let me just mention that Mr. Rothfus from Pennsylvania is  another one who is opposed by his attorney general. His attorney  general is opposed to this bill, is opposed to his representation, and  Pennsylvania has banned payday lending.   Of course, we were joined by Mr. Emmer, who is from Minnesota.  Minnesota is in the same position as North Carolina and Pennsylvania.  The attorney general of Minnesota opposes this bill, and Minnesota bans  payday lending.   So let's be clear. We want to make sure that everybody understands  who these Members are who are coming here in opposition to their  attorneys general, in opposition to their State. These are  Representatives from States that oppose this bill. These are  Representatives from States who have banned payday lending.   So I want to be sure that I agree with my chairman. We should let  everyone know who they are. We should pronounce their names correctly.  We should be sure that all of their constituents understand who their  Representatives are and what they are doing here today on this bill  that will help to explode predatory lending.   This is the rent-a-bank bill that would allow payday lenders to buy  up debt from national banks and be able to charge whatever they would  like, 300 percent and more, to the unsuspecting consumers.   So I thank the chairman for helping me to make that clear.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds just to say:  Apparently, Mr. Meeks is abusing these consumers, as is Mr. Clay, as is  Mr. Scott, as is Mr. Cleaver, as is Ms. Moore, as is Mr. Perlmutter, as  is Ms. Sinema, as is Mr. Heck, and as is Mr. Gottheimer, all Democrats  on the House Financial Services Committee that actually support this  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr.  Trott), a member of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 10 seconds just to say-- with the exception of the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B.  Maloney)--I don't see any of the committee Democrats on the floor, even  those who are supporting the ranking member's position.   I am now pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North  Carolina (Mr. Budd), a hardworking member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hollingsworth), another hardworking member  of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hollingsworth), another hardworking member  of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 1\1/2\ minutes  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, the ranking member has lamented that she has heard from  few Democrats on this matter, so let me take the liberty of quoting  from Congressman Greg Meeks, a Democrat from New York, the lead  Democratic cosponsor of the bill, who said, during markup:         This bill would facilitate such affordable lending to those       who need it the most.    He goes on to say:         H.R. 3299 is a community bank bill. Fintech firms have       partnered with small community banks and provided these       institutions with technological expertise needed to contend       with larger competitors. In fact, I'm aware that there are       fintech firms engaging with Black-owned banks who have       benefited tremendously from new technologies.    Congressman Meeks goes on to say:         H.R. 3299 is also a small-business bill. According to the       Urban Institute, 34 percent of my constituents in Jamaica,       Queens, who have bank accounts rely on alternative financial       service providers, including rent-to-own agreements and       refund anticipation loans because they have unmet lending       needs. Madden does little to help these underbanked       individuals. Instead, it shuts the door to more affordable       bank loans facilitated through partnership models.   [[Page H1155]]     Madam Speaker, I could go on, but what we are trying to do here is  assure that what just happened in the Second Circuit, where credit  opportunities are cut in half, doesn't happen nationwide. The  hardworking men and women of America deserve better, and so we must  support H.R. 3299.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Cheney). All time for debate has  expired.   Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the previous question is ordered on  the bill.   The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.   The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was  read the third time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the passage of the bill.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and submit extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3978, which is  a package of five strongly bipartisan bills, yet again, from the  Financial Services Committee of the House. As standalone bills, all  were favorably reported, again, with strong bipartisan support of at  least three-quarters of the committee.   The title provision of this package is the TRID Improvement Act by  Congressman French Hill. This bill amends CFPB's complex TILA/RESPA  integrated disclosure, known as the TRID rule, in order to simplify the  closing documents consumers get when they close a mortgage.   It does this by allowing for the calculation of the discounted rate  that title insurance companies provide to consumers when they purchase  a lender's and owner's title insurance policy simultaneously. This  makes it more accurate, Madam Speaker.   Title II is the Protection of Source Code Act introduced by  Representatives Sean Duffy and David Scott, a Republican and a  Democrat. This provision ensures that the Securities and Exchange  Commission cannot require financial services firms to disclose  algorithmic trading source code without first obtaining a subpoena.  Source code is among a firm's most sensitive information, and this  bipartisan provision balances privacy and due process concerns while  preserving the SEC's ability to obtain such information when necessary.   The third title is the Fostering Innovation Act which was introduced  by Representatives Sinema and Hollingsworth to provide relief to small  and emerging businesses by extending the popular onramp exemption of  the JOBS Act for emerging growth companies in a more tailored manner.  In short, it provides emerging growth companies more time to reach a  size when they reasonably can be expected to financially sustain the  legal, accounting, and compliance costs associated with the full  Sarbanes-Oxley section 404(b) compliance.   Fourth, Madam Speaker, is the National Securities Exchange Regulatory  Parity Act which was introduced by Mr. Royce and which will ensure  further clarity and competition among national security exchanges by  modernizing the blue sky exemption in the Securities Act. Modernizing  this provision will ensure all national security exchanges operate on a  level regulatory playing field and help protect retail investors from  arbitrary acts by State regulators that may bar investors in one State  from buying stock freely available to investors in every other State.  [[Page H1157]]    The final title of this bill is a provision introduced by Congressman  Stivers to allow mortgage loan originators who work as loan officers in  banks and credit unions to transition to a new job at a nonmortgage  company without losing the ability to originate loans. Without this  bill, the transition process can take weeks or months depending on the  State.   Each of these measures, Madam Speaker, will cut through layers of red  tape and help level the playing field making regulations smarter,  fairer, clearer, and more efficient, thus ensuring that there are more  competitively priced credit opportunities, more credit opportunities  for consumers, and that investors have greater investment opportunities  in competitive markets. They will provide commonsense regulatory  relief. They are practical, they are bipartisan, and they are needed.   Madam Speaker, I encourage all of my colleagues to support the  measure, and I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such  time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 3978, the TRID  Improvement Act of 2017.   H.R. 3978 has been dramatically expanded without input from Democrats  to include several highly problematic and damaging bills. If enacted,  this amended package of bills would ease the ability of high frequency  traders to manipulate the stock markets undetected, encourage a  regulatory race to the bottom in our Nation's stock exchanges, and harm  investors and small businesses by weakening efforts to prevent  accounting fraud at smaller public companies.   Taken together, this deregulatory package could significantly  undermine market stability and gut investor and consumer protections at  a time when our financial markets are already rattled.   Madam Speaker, from January 26 until last Thursday, the stock markets  plunged just over 10 percent, becoming what the financial services  industry calls ``stock market correction,'' and for the past two  trading days, markets have rebounded the most since 2016.   Although market corrections are not new, what distinguishes today's  volatility is that it is driven by complex computer strategies designed  to buy and sell stocks and options millions of times a day. As many of  us have witnessed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average may be up 500  points and then down 600 in less than a few minutes. For the average  American who was hoping to one day retire with dignity by investing her  hard-earned savings in the stock market, it can be distressing to see  such wild swings always wondering whether the markets are truly fair or  whether she is going to be fleeced. Unfortunately, the passage of H.R.  3978 would likely make those swings more extreme and increase the  likelihood of problems going forward.    I am going to walk through each of the problematic provisions in this  bill. Beginning with title IV, this provision is identical to H.R.  4546, the National Securities Exchange Regulatory Parity Act, which  would weaken the standards for listing public companies for trading at  U.S. stock exchanges. Today, exchanges listing standards set minimum  requirements for a company's shares to be sold to the public without  having to comply with State law. Exchanges can only revise these  standards if the Securities and Exchange Commission first finds that  new standards are substantially similar to the listing standards of the  New York Stock Exchange.   This bill would remove any separate analysis for changing the  standards and, thus, automatically preempt State oversight. As a  result, the bill would encourage a race to the bottom of listing  standards as exchanges compete with each other to attract companies  with less restrictions, even if the standards are beneficial to the  investors.   I believe that we should be strengthening the current analysis to  promote fair and rigorous listing standards and only preempt State law  when companies meet high standards. This is why I worked with the  cosponsors last Congress to strike a bipartisan compromise which passed  the House unanimously to require the SEC to develop a core qualitative  listing standard. Unfortunately, my Republican colleagues have reversed  their position in favor of empowering the industry over the investing  public.   Turning to title III which is identical to H.R. 1645, the so-called  Fostering Innovation Act, this provision would eliminate the  independent audit of a company's financial reporting controls for up to  10 years for newly public companies provided that they have $50 million  or less in gross revenues and less than $700 million in outstanding  shares. Passed in the wake of the Enron and WorldCom accounting  scandals, the requirement that public companies conduct an independent  audit of financial controls is one of the many accounting provisions  required by the bipartisan Sarbanes-Oxley Act that directly benefits  investors and public companies by improving the accuracy of their  financial reporting.   In fact, companies that are not subject to such review by an  independent auditor are more likely to issue corrections to their  financial reports leading to investor losses and higher losses for the  company.   Investors like these audits because they improve the veracity of the  reports they rely on to make investment decisions. Today, truly small  public companies--those with less than $75 million worth of shares--are  already exempt from the audit requirement. But this bill would extend  the exemption to large companies that are nearly ten times that size.  The law already provides newly public companies with an exemption for 5  years. Extending it to a decade would harm investor confidence and all  such companies, hurting the very companies the bill's supporters  purport to help.   Title II of this bill is the same language as H.R. 3948, the  Protection of Source Code Act. This bill bans the SEC from inspecting  source code used by regulated entities to engage in algorithmic or  computer-driven trading and other activities that impact the securities  markets and investors without first obtaining a subpoena. This  provision would severely hamper the ability of the SEC to effectively  examine persons like high-frequency traders and to investigate market  disruptions.   The recent stock market volatility, which has seen all of the major  stock indices decline by more than 10 percent in less than 2 weeks, has  been exacerbated by high-frequency traders using complex computer  algorithms to determine when to buy and sell millions of trades per  second by making it harder for the capital markets COP to detect and  stop bad actors and rein in fraudulent trading schemes. This provision  will inevitably harm everyday Americans and retirees who rely on fair  capital markets to invest their hard-earned savings.   To make matters worse, Republicans added a provision to pay for the  cost of the bill by taking $2 million from the Securities and Exchange  Commission's reserve fund. As a result, our financial watchdog will  have less resources to support its capacity to oversee the markets  through investments in IT and to respond to unforeseen market events  like the flash crash.   In short, this bill asks taxpayers to pay for the costs of diminished  capital market oversight by taking away SEC's funding to respond to  emergency market situations that threaten market stability. This  provision doubles down on the irresponsible policymaking we often see  by the opposite side of the aisle.   The bill before us today would also make two less significant changes  which I believe the Republicans included to garner additional support  for the legislation. Nevertheless, even with these provisions, the  package should be soundly rejected.   Title I, which includes the version of H.R. 3978, TRID Improvement  Act of 2017, that the committee previously considered, would amend a  mortgage disclosure known as TRID or the know-before-you-owe disclosure  that informs home buyers of the terms and conditions of their mortgage.  Responding to the concerns of some in the real estate industry, this  provision would amend the disclosure to account for the discounts paid  to borrowers in States where simultaneous lender and buyer title  insurance is issued. However, the revised form does nothing for bars in  States that do not provide such special rates to home buyers, and the  provision eliminates the Consumer Bureau's ability to fix this aspect  of the form even if a problem arises in the future.  [[Page H1158]]    The final provision, title V, is identical to H.R. 2948, the SAFE  Mortgage Licensing Act. This title would ease the ability of  individuals employed as mortgage originators to change employers by  creating a temporary 120-day licensing regime so that they can continue  to work at their new employer.    This bill would effectively treat mortgage originators who work for  State registered firms the same as federally registered firms and was  unanimously supported by committee Democrats. Unfortunately, because  this legislation has been packaged with other deeply problematic and  destructive bills, sensible relief to these individuals that has broad  bipartisan support is being held hostage by Republicans' efforts to  roll back as many safeguards as they can this year.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 3978, as amended, threatens many of the important  reforms Democrats made to restore investor confidence to our capital  markets after the worst financial crisis in generations. As the stock  markets continue to wobble ominously in ways that threaten the savings  of hardworking Americans, Congress should be strengthening oversight of  the financial system, not weakening it.   Not surprisingly, H.R. 3978 is strongly opposed by the North American  Association of Securities Administrators who serve on the frontline  combating securities fraud on the State level and by nonpartisan  organization who speak on behalf of our Nation's consumers, investors,  and unions, including Consumer Federation of America, Center for  American Progress, Americans for Financial Reform, AFL-CIO, and Public  Citizen, and so do I.   Madam Speaker, I urge everyone to reject this harmful package of  bills and to vote ``no'' on H.R. 3978.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1530     Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman  from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), the majority whip of the committee and the  sponsor of the legislation.    Madam Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing  and Insurance and the sponsor of title 2 of the Protection of Source  Code in this bill.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentleman from Wisconsin.    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to  the gentleman from Wisconsin.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds to say the  widespread opposition to the bill alluded to by the ranking member  doesn't include roughly half the Democrats on the committee, including  the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Foster), who was quoted in our markup  as saying: ``As someone who can code in at least seven languages, I  understand that source code is qualitatively different from other  documents that a firm might have and that our regulators should have  legitimate access to. They are truly the crown jewels of an electronic  trading firm, and there are obvious dangers that have been exposed in  transferring things really not just to the government, to any entity.  The first line of defense in cybersecurity is to keep the data as  closely held as reasonable and still be able to do your job.''   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve  the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Illinois (Mr. Hultgren), the vice chairman on the Subcommittee on  Capital Markets, Securities, and Investment.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Texas (Mr. Williams), the vice chairman of our Subcommittee on  Monetary Policy and Trade.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), a hardworking member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), a hardworking member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from New York (Mr. Zeldin), another member of the Financial Services  Committee.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman  from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk), another proud member of the Financial  Services Committee.    Madam Speaker, I would tell the ranking member that I  have potentially two speakers, if they make it. They are on their way  from a hearing, but they are not here now.                                time  1600    Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the  balance of my time.   Madam Speaker, it has become par for the course for the majority to  recklessly advance harmful deregulatory packages like H.R. 3978. My  friends on the other side of the aisle are moving forward with  regulatory roadblocks at a furious pace, pushing dangerous bills  through the House nearly every week.   It appears that they may have already completely forgotten a way that  lacks financial regulation and allowed the crisis in 2008 to occur.  That crisis badly damaged the whole economy and harmed all of our  constituents. The impact was enormous: $13 trillion in household wealth  was lost; 11 million people lost their homes to foreclosure; and the  unemployment rate reached 10 percent.   Democrats responded by enacting Wall Street reform to ensure that  consumers, investors, and our economy are protected from reckless  actors and bad practices, but now Republicans cannot wait to take us  back to the bad old days. It makes no sense.   As we have discussed, the package of bills now before us guts  important financial protections at a time when markets are already  experiencing turmoil. It would allow high-frequency traders to  manipulate the stock markets undetected, encourage a regulatory race to  the bottom at our Nation's stock exchanges, and harm investors by  weakening efforts to detect accounting fraud at smaller public  companies. This package of bills threatens important progress we have  made to reduce risk in the financial system and return investor  confidence.   In recent weeks, we have seen volatile markets that threaten the  savings of hardworking American families. These circumstances should  serve as a clear reminder that Congress should be strengthening  oversight of the financial system, not weakening it by undermining or  removing important protections.   H.R. 3978 is strongly opposed by our State's security cops, who are  at the front line of combating fraud, and it is opposed by groups  representing consumers, investors, and unions.   Madam Speaker, for all of these reasons, I urge Members to oppose  H.R. 3978, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 7 minutes  remaining.    Madam Speaker, there may be other Members coming, so,  at the moment, I yield myself 4 minutes.   Madam Speaker, again, all over America today, fortunately, because of  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, people are waking up to new opportunities.  They are finally seeing their wages begin to grow. We have seen the  greatest wage growth in almost a decade, Madam Speaker, again, thanks  to President Trump and thanks to a Republican Congress, a bill that was  opposed by every single Democrat.   But as they wake up to these new opportunities, Madam Speaker, they  also need new credit. As their incomes rise--this is good--they still  need credit in order to buy a home, in order to purchase that car, and  sometimes just to put groceries on the table. Unfortunately, over the  last 8 years of the Obama administration where we saw probably one of  the greatest increases in the cost, expense, and burden of costly  Washington red tape, we have seen fewer credit opportunities.   So now, fortunately, today there are good men and women on both sides  of the aisle who are trying to work together to bring some rationale  and reason to the regulatory burden. Many Members on the other side of  the aisle do realize that Dodd-Frank did not come down as tablets from  Mt. Sinai, that it isn't chiseled into stone, and that maybe there are  some improvements that could be made.   So today, we are taking a number of very bipartisan bills to the  House floor. The Protecting Consumers' Access to Credit Act, which we  debated earlier, Madam Speaker, passed by 42-17.   The TRID Improvement Act by Mr. Hill from Arkansas passed through our  committee 53-5--90 percent. Almost all of the Democrats but the ranking  member supported the bill. The Protection of Source Code Act, 46-14;  the Fostering Innovation Act passed by a vote of 48-12, a Democratic  bill; the National Securities Exchange Regulatory Parity Act, 46-14.   We have a lot of bipartisan bills, but with one exception, title V of  the TRID Improvement Act, none of them were supported, unfortunately,  by the ranking member.   So there is, again, a lot of bipartisan work we are trying to get  done here. Unfortunately, very little of it is supported by the ranking  member.   And why is this important? It is important, Madam Speaker, because  every day we are still hearing from our constituents who need access to  competitive affordable credit. And because of this Washington red tape  and regulatory burden, they are not getting it.   It wasn't that long ago we heard from Ann of Wisconsin, who said:         My husband and I had very high credit scores. We have       plenty of equity in our home. But because my husband has a       seasonal job and finds other employment in the winter, many       banks we contacted rejected our loan request. They based our       annual income only on the job he has currently and said that       was part of the new regulations.    Part of the new regulations--there is somebody who won't buy a home;  they can't get a home.   I heard from a mortgage banker in North Carolina who said:         Last year, we declined a young man and his family fixed       rate financing to purchase a primary home. The applicant       recently relocated to work for a family business. Prior to       Dodd-Frank, it would have been easy to qualify, but no more.    Another potential American home buyer denied credit because of this  regulatory burden. Madam Speaker, that is what many of us, on both  sides of the aisle, are trying to remedy today.    Madam Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman  from Arizona (Ms. Sinema), a sponsor of title III of the Fostering  Innovation Act.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Yoder). The gentleman from Texas has 1  minute remaining.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Yoder). The gentleman from Texas has 1  minute remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I want to hear the voices of hardworking  Americans, not just Washington, D.C., letterhead groups.   We heard from a community banker, who said:         A local union member wanted to refinance his primary       residence. He was currently laid off due to the winter       season. His tax return showed he was generally laid off for       about 6 weeks each year during the extreme cold but was       always called back when weather improved. Since he was laid       off, we could not meet the requirement to validate his       current income that would continue for 3 years. We had to       deny the loan.    Yet again, Mr. Speaker, more Washington red tape taking away home  opportunities from hardworking Americans. It is wrong. We must do  something about it. It is why, on a bipartisan basis, so many of us  have gotten together to pass H.R. 3978.   Yes, we want to make sure that people can buy homes, they can buy  cars, they can put groceries on the table, and right now, when the  economy is finally starting to improve, thanks to President Trump and  the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we want them to have opportunities.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage all Members to support H.R. 3978, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record  the following letters of opposition.                                   Center for American Progress,                                  Washington, DC, February 13, 2018.      Hon. Paul Ryan,      Speaker, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy Pelosi,      Democratic Leader, House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: The Center for       American Progress (``CAP'') is writing today to express       opposition to H.R. 4061, the Financial Stability Oversight       Council Improvement Act of 2017, which is included as Title       VI of the revised H.R. 3978 package. It is our understanding       that the revised H.R. 3978 package will be considered on the       floor of the House of Representatives this week, so we       welcome the chance to share our concerns regarding this       legislation with you and your Members.        In short, this bill erodes a vital new financial regulatory       tool implemented following the devastating 2007-2008       financial crisis. If enacted, the U.S. financial regulatory       structure will be less equipped to handle risks that build up       outside of the traditional banking sector--making the       financial sector as a whole more vulnerable to another shock       and economic downturn. Americans paid for the last crisis       with their jobs, homes, and savings, while banks and other       financial institutions were bailed out. This bill       inexplicably makes a repeat of that economic calamity more       likely.        The 2007-2008 financial crisis demonstrated that excessive       risk could build up outside of the traditional banking       sector. Nonbank financial institutions like Lehman Brothers,       Bear Stearns, and AIG did not face the type of oversight and       regulatory standards warranted by their systemic importance.       The failure or near-failure of these institutions threatened       the stability of the U.S. financial sector. AIG and Bear       Stearns were bailed out accordingly, while the failure of       Lehman Brothers brought the global financial system to the       brink of collapse. The crisis also revealed that no one       financial regulator had a system-wide mandate, meaning       individual regulators were only focused on their respective       segments of the financial sector. This left financial       regulators in the dark regarding risks that built up across       different parts of the sector or that emerged in       underregulated parts of the sector.        In the wake of the financial crisis, President Obama worked       with Congress to pass the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and       Consumer Protection Act--the most significant financial       regulatory reforms enacted since the Great Depression. One       important pillar of Dodd-Frank was the creation of the       Financial Stability Oversight Council (``FSOC''), a new       systemic risk regulatory body. The FSOC was created to bring       the disparate financial regulators together to identify and       mitigate threats to financial stability. The most important       tool given to the FSOC to fulfill this mission is the       authority to subject a nonbank financial company to enhanced       oversight and regulation by the Federal Reserve Board if       material distress at the company, or the company's       activities, could threaten financial stability. The FSOC has       used this designation authority sparingly and only after a       thorough, multi-stage review process in which the FSOC       communicates extensively with the company and the company's       primary regulators.        H.R. 4061 would add multiple additional hurdles to the       FSOC's already-rigorous designation process. The proposed       changes would add an estimated two years to the designation       process, meaning it would take roughly four years for the       FSOC to designate a nonbank financial company that could       threaten U.S. financial stability. The four-year estimate       does not even factor in the time it will take for the legal       proceedings to play out when a company challenges the       designation in court. The legal challenge by MetLife took       years, and likely would have taken longer if the Trump       administration didn't agree to stop pursuing the case. If       anything, this bill increases the procedural issues a       designated company could raise in court. H.R. 4061       practically invites a legal filibuster of the designation. It       renders the designation authority nearly useless. Hollowing       out this crucial post-crisis authority makes it far more       likely that an underregulated systemically important nonbank       will cause or aggravate the next financial crisis.        Contrary to critics of the FSOC, it is not a rigid body and       has in the past responded to legitimate process and       transparency suggestions. In 2015, after soliciting public       comment, the FSOC adopted 17 changes to its designation       process and transparency policies The current designation       process in place is rigorous and appropriately thorough. H.R.       4061 would add no less than nine new bureaucratic steps.       These proposed changes are excessive, and the intent is       clear: To prevent the FSOC from using this vital tool.        This legislation is even more concerning given the actions       Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, Chairman of the FSOC, has       taken since the start of the Trump administration. The FSOC,       under Mnuchin's leadership, has: (i) rescinded the       designation of AIG, the company that received a $182 billion       bailout during the crisis; (ii) slashed the FSOC's budget and       staff; (iii) dropped the legal proceedings regarding       MetLife's designation; (iv) signaled that Prudential's       designation may be rescinded this year; and (v) recommended       some deeply concerning additional changes to the FSOC's       designation process in a report published in late 2017.       Further restricting the FSOC's authority at a time when it is       being dismantled from within would be a grave mistake.        For these reasons, CAP recommends that Members vote ``NO''       when the revised H.R. 3978 package of bills, which includes       H.R. 4061, is considered on the floor.        If you have any questions about this letter or would like       to discuss these issues further, please contact Gregg       Gelzinis.            Sincerely,                                                 Gregg Gelzinis,                                        Research Assistant, Economic      Policy, Center for American Progress.                                   ____                                                  February 13, 2018.        Dear Representative, The undersigned organizations urge you       to vote against H.R. 3978, the TRID Improvement Act. The       bill, which amends Section 2603 of RESPA, would create       confusion and undermine consistency in mortgage disclosures.       In particular, the bill would make it harder for consumers to       understand how much they are paying for title insurance, a       required fee that already lacks a transparent, functioning       market.        In 2007, a GAO report concluded that borrowers ``have       little or no influence over the price of title insurance but       have little choice but to purchase it.'' Instead, the lender       typically chooses the insurer. As a result, the fees are       grossly inflated in relation to the value of the insurance.       Recent studies have found that barely 5% to 11% of premiums       are paid out in claims. Almost the entirety of a title       insurance premium goes to commissions, not insurance       coverage. In contrast, for health insurance, minimally 80% of       premiums are returned to consumers in claim payouts and the       loss ratios for auto insurance fluctuate between 50% and 70%.       Borrowers already pay inflated title insurance costs.       Increased confusion in title insurance price disclosures       would only serve to exacerbate the problems in the market       with transparency and fairness.  [[Page H1165]]         The method required by the Consumer Financial Protection       Bureau for disclosing title insurance premiums reduces       consumer confusion and enhances consistency between the       estimated and final loan cost disclosures. The bill would       change the final loan disclosure, decreasing consistency with       the initial disclosure. As a result, it would increase       consumer confusion, especially where the consumer opts not to       purchase both lender and owner policies (only the lender       policy is required) after getting the early disclosure       containing both.        The bill's requirement to disclose the ``actual'' cost of       the insurance will lead to confusion in almost half of the       states because the calculation of premiums is not       standardized under state law and title companies within those       states do not provide comparable rates. In contrast, the CFPB       regulations take into account that comparison shopping in       such states is not possible and provides a standardized       approach. Further refinement of the title insurance       disclosures can be addressed by the CFPB itself in       cooperation with stakeholders to ensure any outstanding       issues are addressed with the input of all affected parties.        We urge you not to undermine the CFPB's careful rules for       restoring transparency and market competition to the title       insurance market. Please vote no on H.R. 3978.            Sincerely,      Americans for Financial Reform.      Center for Responsible Lending.      National Association of Consumer Advocates.      National Consumer Law Center (on behalf of its low-income       clients).                                   ____                                   Consumer Federation of America,                                                  February 12, 2018.        Dear Representative: We understand the House is scheduled       to vote this week on H.R. 3978, the ``TRID Improvement Act.''       While we did not take a position on this bill when it came       before the House Financial Services Committee, we urge you to       oppose it now that it includes the following extraneous,       anti-investor bills: H.R. 3948, the ``Protection of Source       Code Act;'' H.R. 1645, the ``Fostering Innovation Act;'' and       H.R. 4546, the ``National Securities Exchange Regulatory       Parity Act.'' Each of these bills would harm investors and       undermine the integrity of our capital markets.        H.R. 1645, the ``Fostering Innovation Act,'' would make       financial accounting fraud more likely.        This legislation would extend the period of time in which       certain public companies would be exempt from a requirement       that provides important protections against financial       reporting errors, including errors that are the result of       fraud. That is the requirement under Section 404(b) of the       Sarbanes-Oxley Act that requires auditors, as part of their       audits of public company financial statements, to assess and       attest to the adequacy of the company's internal controls to       ensure accurate financial reporting. This bill would extend       this exemption for up to five years to a class of companies,       including those that have gone public but may be struggling       to produce significant revenues, that could have a particular       incentive to manipulate their financial statements in order       to attract more capital. Companies should not be permitted to       raise capital in the public markets if they do not have       adequate controls in place to prevent financial reporting       errors and fraud. And auditors cannot reasonably attest to       the accuracy of a company's financial statements without       carefully assessing those controls. Requiring auditors to       attest to the adequacy of those controls as part of the       financial statement audit contributes to the market       transparency and integrity that is essential to a healthy       capital formation process. Moreover, the number and severity       of financial restatements has declined since the requirement       was adopted, which demonstrates that these requirements have       benefited the market significantly. Because this legislation       would make financial accounting fraud more likely, we oppose       it. Furthermore, because this legislation is being attached       to the TRID bill, we urge you to oppose the entire package.        H.R. 3948, the ``Protection of Source Code Act,'' would       weaken SEC oversight of algorithmic trading and hamstring the       agency from responding quickly to flash crashes or other       market breakdowns.        At a time when algorithmic trading is taking on increased       importance in our capital markets, this bill would make it       more difficult for the SEC to properly oversee such trading.       The bill would require the SEC to first issue a subpoena       before it could compel a person to produce or furnish to the       SEC algorithmic trading source code or ``similar intellectual       property.'' This would undermine the SEC's examination       authority by creating a gaping hole in its ability to gain       access to firm records relevant to the examination. It would       also have a devastating effect on the agency's ability to       respond quickly in the event of another ``flash crash'' or       other such events in the future. In order to oversee the       markets effectively, the SEC needs to be able to accurately       and efficiently reconstruct order entry and trading activity,       including for algorithmic traders. Because this legislation       would weaken SEC oversight of algorithmic trading and       hamstring the agency from responding quickly to flash crashes       or other market breakdowns, we oppose it. Furthermore,       because this legislation is being attached to the TRID bill,       we urge you to oppose the entire package.        H.R. 4546, the ``National Securities Exchange Regulatory       Parity Act,'' would drastically weaken standards for       securities to be listed and traded on exchanges.        H.R. 4546 would change the terms on which securities are       deemed ``covered securities,'' and thus exempt from state       oversight. It would do so by removing any requirement that       these securities have to meet conditions comparable to the       current listing standards on leading national exchanges.       Instead, any security listed on an exchange that is a member       of the National Market System (NMS) would be exempt from       state regulation and oversight. Because the bill would not       establish any core quantitative or qualitative requirements       for covered securities to replace those eliminated by the       bill, it would likely accelerate an already troubling race to       the bottom in listing standards among NMS members. Moreover,       the bill does not sufficiently protect against the       possibility that a venture exchange could eventually be       established specifically to meet the bill's requirements for       state preemption. If this were to occur, smaller, more local       offerings typically overseen by states could be ``designated       as qualified for trading'' on such an exchange without any       assurance that they can meet basic quantitative and       qualitative standards designed to ensure investors are       appropriately protected. In short, this bill would eliminate       protections afforded by state oversight, fail to replace the       current meaningful protections afforded by high listing       standards with a comparable alternative, and leave investors       without any reasonable hope that the SEC will be able to       provide effective oversight at the federal level. Because       this legislation would drastically weaken standards for       securities to be listed and traded on exchanges, we oppose       it. Furthermore, because this legislation is being attached       to the TRID bill, we urge you to oppose the entire package.        The TRID bill should not be used as a vehicle to pass       extraneous, anti-investor bills. Because the bills attached       to the TRID bill would harm investors and undermine the       integrity of our capital markets, we urge you to vote no on       the entire package when H.R. 3978 comes to the floor this       week.            Respectfully submitted,      Barbara Roper,        Director of Investor Protection.      Micah Hauptman,        Financial Services Counsel.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the bill has expired.                    Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Foster     Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order on the  gentleman's motion.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order on the motion is reserved.   The Clerk will report the motion to recommit.   The Clerk read as follows:         Mr. Capuano moves to recommit the bill H.R. 3978 to the       Committee on Financial Services with instructions to report       the same back to the House forthwith with the following       amendment:        Page 5, line 13, strike ``and''.        Page 5, line 14, strike the period and insert ``; and''.        Page 5, after line 14, insert the following:        ``(D) has claw back policies to require any executive       officer incentive-based compensation to be clawed-back in the       event that the issuer is required to prepare an accounting       restatement due to the material noncompliance of the issuer       with any financial reporting requirement under the securities       laws (as defined in section 3(a) of the Securities Exchange       Act of 1934), regardless of whether such compensation was       paid to an officer who was a party to the actions that       resulted in such restatement.''.    Mr. CAPUANO (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous  consent that the motion be considered as read.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Massachusetts?    I object.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Objection is heard.   The Clerk will continue to read.   The Clerk continued to read.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Massachusetts is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion.    Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of a point of  order.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The reservation of a point of order is  withdrawn.    Mr. Speaker, I claim time in opposition.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5  minutes.    Mr. Speaker, I listened very carefully to my  colleague on the Financial Services Committee. I lost track of how many  times he mentioned Wells Fargo. That has nothing to do with an early  growth company. That has nothing to do with this title of the bill.   So the Fostering Innovation Act by the gentlewoman from Arizona is  all about allowing emerging-growth companies the opportunity to  actually grow. What a novel concept.   What we know is, Mr. Speaker, in 8 years of Obamanomics, they were  only able to produce about 1.8 percent economic growth, for all intents  and purposes. Nobody's savings account came back. Wages were stagnant.  And now that we have sensible regulation, now that we have passed the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, now we have 3 percent economic growth, which is  economic growth for America's working families. Unemployment is at a  17-year low. It remains at a 17-year low.   Again, wages grew at 2.9 percent last year, the fastest in almost a  decade. Two million Americans have gone back to work, Mr. Speaker, and  this is not by accident.   So what the gentleman is doing with his motion to recommit is sending  us back. He is rolling the clock back to an era where working Americans  didn't get ahead, where entrepreneurship was at a generational low,  where small businesses were finding it hard to access lines of credit.  So the bill that he so much maligns from the gentlewoman from Arizona,  who happens to reside on his side of the aisle--at markup, the ranking  member of the relevant subcommittee, the gentlewoman from New York  (Mrs. Maloney), supported the provision and said: This is a sensible  compromise that provides a narrowly targeted relief to only the  companies that truly need it.   Researching a new drug and getting FDA approval is a very, very long  process, which is exactly what we heard in our committee. For example,  we have heard from John Blake, senior vice president of finance at Atyr  Pharma, who testified before the Subcommittee on Capital Markets,  Securities, and Investments. He said: It remains the case that the  biotech development time line is a decades-long affair. It is extremely  likely that Atyr will still be in the lab, in the clinic, when our EGC  clock expires, our early growth company.   In other words, they may have revenues, but they don't have profits.  They don't have profits. This is something that is especially common in  the biotech area. They need this capital for innovation.   So once again, we have heard this rhetoric on the other side of the  aisle before. This is all about Dodd-Frank revisited. They aim at Wall  Street, but they are hitting Main Street, Mr. Speaker. The MTR, the  motion to recommit, hits Main Street in the gut. It will mean fewer  early growth companies. It will mean fewer jobs. It will mean lower  wage growth. And it will mean, again, a decimated and declining  American Dream.                                time  1630    Mr. Speaker, we should reject the motion to recommit, and we should  support the underlying bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is  ordered on the motion to recommit.   There was no objection.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.   The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that  the noes appeared to have it.
