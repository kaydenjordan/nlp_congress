 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding,  and I thank her for her leadership. I am sure she is leading on this  devastating day and devastating loss in her district that she would  much prefer not to do.   As I listened to my colleagues, each of us giving our own separate  story of where we were the day of Sandy Hook, all I can say, and what I  remember, is that I became breathless; I became unbelieving. It was a  very painful day. It was a sickening day, horrifying, and I was  questioning: Is this really happening, or did this really happen?   As a member of the Judiciary Committee, and as I have listened over  the years of some of the more descriptive accounts of Sandy Hook, some  of the stories of such bravery of the principal and teachers who lost  their lives, or those who tried to intervene on this deranged gunman-- who, by the way, killed his mother before he came to that school--there  is nothing more that you can say. Breathless. Similar to the actions of  former President Barack Obama.   I can distinctly remember him being before the national audience, the  people of the United States, as I recall, in the White House, and  wiping a tear, or tears, away from his eyes. I think the whole Nation,  at that time, crumbled. A Commander in Chief, known for his strong,  stoic leadership, could not comprehend what had happened to these  children at Sandy Hook.   I think all of us believe this would be a galvanizing call to action.  All of us took notice. We never expected Las Vegas with 50-plus killed  in 2017, never expected Orlando in 2016 with 50 killed, or Virginia  Tech that happened a few years before.   It amazes me that we are here in commemoration and not here in  celebration of what we accomplished for those who yet live: the little  ones who go every day to school, the college students, the people who  go to clubs, the church-going people. What did we accomplish? Why are  we being rebuffed?   Mr. Speaker, I want to say to the Sandy Hook families, of whom I met  as well, what brave men and women. Here they are spending their time  trying to be the soldiers of reason around gun safety. It is horrifying  to admit that gun violence now seems to be a staple of American life.   The United States ranks number one in the world in terms of firearms  per capita, with 88.8 guns per 100, and has the highest homicide by  firearm rate in the developed world. The problem is so endemic that gun  violence is now the third leading cause of death for children in the  United States.   How many parents crumble themselves or fall over a casket of a dead  child? We know in Chicago that children die by drive-by shootings  through no fault of their own. Chicago has tough gun laws, and there is  a mockery being made by those who oppose gun safety laws, but you  recognize that the surrounding areas that Chicago is in the midst of-- the States--they have no constraints of much, so the guns are  transported into States like Illinois and cities like Chicago.   An average of 1,297 children die annually from gun-related injuries.  And our colleague and friend, Robin Kelly, reminds us all the time of  the gun violence that continues in cities like Chicago.   Guns are linked to roughly 33,000 deaths in the United States per  year. About two-thirds of them are suicides.   According to the Pew Research Center, a majority of Americans across  partisan lines support gun policy proposals, such as barring people  with mental illness from buying guns, prohibiting gun purchases by  people on Federal no-fly or watch lists, something we have been trying  to pass forever--a reasonable response to the safety of Americans.   As a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I cannot imagine why  that would not be a unifying legislative initiative--and background  checks for private gun sales and sales at gun shows and universal  background checks.   There is always the rebuttal: ``Guns don't kill, people do.'' But  people with varying conditions take up guns because they are allowed to  do so with unfettered gun purchases. It is well known--the percentage  of membership of the NRA. That is why I was glad to listen to Chairman  Thompson, who is a gun owner, a gun user, but how fortunate we are to  have him lead the committee, because he can unabashedly, as a war  veteran, combat war veteran, say that it doesn't make sense in America  to be able to have unfettered gun use.   The majority must cut its close ties to the powerful gun lobby to  facilitate useful gun control legislation necessary immediately.  America has six times as many firearm homicides as Canada and nearly 16  times as many as Germany.   The United Nations data shows that America far and away leads other  developed countries when it comes to gun-related homicides. America has  4.4 percent of the world's population, but almost half of the civilian- owned guns around the world.   In December 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School  in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 20 children, 6 adults, and  himself--someone who had killed his mother before he came. Since then,  there have been at least 1,518 mass shootings, with at least 1,715  people killed, and 6,000 wounded.   Who would have ever imagined that a man would be at the top of a  hotel and massively kill so many. Who would ever imagine that there is  a law on the books that prevent the Centers for Disease Control and the  NIH to study the impact of gun violence as a health crisis. This  Congress has. Republicans have.    So, in spite of mass shootings, we have unfortunate opposition and  downright obstructionism on getting good gun safety legislation on the  floor of the House.   I am not a stranger to this. I come from Texas. There are a lot of  guns in  [[Page H9894]]  Texas. And I would like to think that a majority of my fellow Texans  handle their guns safely and understand the value of gun safety  legislation.   But when I introduced the first city ordinance to hold parents  responsible for children that got guns and shot each other, it was an  uprising, a revolution. It was a packed chamber. People were wearing  their colonial clothing, playing flutes, singing patriotic songs, and  saying that we were stepping on the Second Amendment.   But medical doctors and parents who had lost children because those  children had gotten guns and shot their sibling, they understood that  it was a small measure to stop children from getting their parents'  guns on a summer day, or after school, and injuring or killing their  little brother or sister.   Is there any common sense?   So today, I join in honoring the Sandy Hook families, an honor that I  know they did not wish to have. They would rather have their precious  little ones.   As I close, I want to make two points:   There is no doubt that people are dying because of gun violence, that  we exceed the rational civilized perspective of how many guns are in  this country, and that our children are dying. Seven children and  adolescents lose their lives to gun violence each day, 75 percent of  which are under the age of 12 years old. A lot of these are through  accidental shootings where children get guns.   I leave you with this perspective: a great nation. Yes, we send young  people into war. That is one of the arguments: 18-year-olds have guns,  yes, as they stand up for their country, in an organized, regularized  manner to defend this Nation, and we thank them for their young  patriotism.   But I venture to say, as I visit faraway places--war zones--young  soldiers understand the difference of an AR-15 or an AK rifle in war,  as opposed to being on the streets. And our officers, who are doing  their duty, good officers, who are in the course of good police work,  who have to do a stop, and they run into someone who now has been given  latitude to the concealed carry reciprocity bill, to just carry a gun  any way you want, and if you come to a State that has strict and  positive gun safety laws, that officer has to be able to be judge and  jury to determine whether your random license from somewhere else is  credible.   As my colleague said: That is the Christmas gift that they are giving  to the children of America, rather than the universal background check  or the forbidding of individuals on a terrorist list carrying guns.  That is not the gift that they are willing to give.   They are giving our children, under the twinkling of the lights,  rather than the loving arms of safety and security--they are giving  them bullets and automatic weapons and the right for people to go on  the streets and kill in churches, like that in Texas and that in South  Carolina.   Mr. Speaker, I finish by saying that even the smallest of amendments,  when we did the concealed weapons carry, the one that would disallow  those with convictions of domestic violence and stalking, my Republican  friends voted it down. Or an amendment that said that if you committed  a hate crime, and convicted of such, my Republican friends voted it  down.   So I am not giving up, and I thank the gentlewoman for having us come  today. My celebration tonight is of the courage of families who  suffered so much to continue their journey to stand up and be counted  for what is right in America, and that is real gun safety legislation.   Mr. Speaker, on October 1, 2017 the deadliest mass shooting in the  history of the United States occurred in Las Vegas, Nevada when, in a  heinous act of terror and hatred, 58 persons were killed and 515 others  were injured in a shooting at an outdoor concert near the Mandalay Bay  Resort and Casino in Las Vegas.   Until then, June 13, 2016 marked the deadliest mass shooting in the  history of the United States in Orlando, Florida, when, in another  heinous act of terror and hatred, 49 persons were killed at Pulse, a  popular nightclub, meeting place, and sanctuary for Central Florida's  vibrant and dynamic LGBTQ community; sadly, the Las Vegas mass shooting  surpassed that dreadful shooting in numbers of dead and injured.   The horrifying events in Las Vegas mark the 273rd mass shooting in  the U.S. in the 275 days that have passed so far in 2017, according to  Gun Violence Archive.   Mass shootings are a near daily occurrence in America, but what  happened in Las Vegas stands out: It was the deadliest such incident in  U.S. history, with more than 58 killed and 515 injured.   Including that massacre, the four deadliest U.S. mass shootings have  occurred over the past 10 years.    A mass shooting is defined by Gun Violence Archive as any incident  in which four or more are shot and/or killed in a single event, at the  same general time and location not including the shooter.   Recent U.S. mass shootings include:   1. Las Vegas, 2017: 50+ killed   2. Orlando, 2016: 50 killed   3. Virginia Tech, 2007: 32 killed   4. Sandy Hook, 2012: 27 killed   5. San Ysirdo, 1984: 21 killed   6. San Bernadino, 2015: 14 killed   7. Edmond, 1986: 14 killed   8. Fort Hood, 2009: 13 killed   9. Columbine, 1999: 13 killed   There have been more than 11,600 deaths linked to gun violence so far  in 2017, which is roughly equivalent to nearly four 9/11 attacks in  terms of the total number killed on September 11, 2001.   Comparatively, more than 15 thousand were killed by gun violence in  2016, and there were 383 mass shootings.   It is horrifying to admit that gun violence now seems to be a staple  of American life.   The United States ranks No. 1 in the world in terms of firearms per  capita--with 88.8 guns per 100 people--and it has the highest homicide- by-firearm rate in the developed world.   The problem is so endemic that gun violence is now the third leading  cause of death for children in the U.S.   An average of 1,297 children die annually from gun-related injuries.   Guns are linked to roughly 33 thousand deaths in the U.S. per year;  about two-thirds of them are suicides.   According to Pew Research Center, a majority of Americans (across  partisan lines) support gun policy proposals such as barring people  with mental illnesses from buying guns; prohibiting gun purchases by  people on federal no-fly or watch lists; and background checks for  private gun sales and sales at gun shows.   The majority must cut its close ties to the powerful gun lobby to  facilitate useful gun control legislation necessary immediately.   America has six times as many firearm homicides as Canada, and nearly  16 times as many as Germany.   United Nations data shows that America far and away leads other  developed countries when it comes to gun-related homicides.   America has 4.4 percent of the world's population, but almost half of  the civilian-owned guns around the world.   In December 2012, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School  in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 20 children, six adults, and  himself.   Since then, there have been at least 1,518 mass shootings, with at  least 1,715 people killed and 6,089 wounded.   The fairly broad definition of ``mass shooting'' includes not only  shootings in which four or more people were murdered, but shootings in  which four or more people were shot at all (excluding the shooter).   Even under this broad definition, mass shootings make up a tiny  portion of America's firearm deaths, which totaled more than 33,000 in  2014.   On average, there is more than one mass shooting for each day in  America.   Whenever a mass shooting occurs, supporters of gun rights often argue  that it is inappropriate to bring up political debates about gun  control in the aftermath of a tragedy.   For example, former Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal, a strong  supporter of gun rights, criticized former President Barack Obama for  ``trying to score cheap political points'' when Obama mentioned gun  control after a mass shooting in Charleston, South Carolina.   But if this argument is followed to its logical end, then it will  never be the right time to discuss mass shootings.   Under the broader definition of mass shootings, America has nearly  one mass shooting a day.   So if Congress is forced to wait for a time when there is not a mass  shooting to talk gun control, Congress could find itself waiting for a  very long time.   States with more guns have more gun deaths.   Within the United States, a wide array of empirical evidence  indicates that more guns in a community leads to more homicide.   Higher populations, more stress, more immigrants, and more mental  illness does not correlate with more gun deaths.   States with tighter gun control laws have fewer gun-related deaths.  [[Page H9895]]    A 2016 review of 130 studies in 10 countries, published in  Epidemiologic Reviews, found that new legal restrictions on owning and  purchasing guns tended to be followed by a drop in gun violence--a  strong indicator that restricting access to guns can save lives.    The good news is that all firearm homicides, like all homicides and  crime, have declined over the past two decades--although that may have  changed in 2015 and 2016, with a recent rise in murders nationwide.   There is still active debate among criminal justice experts about why  this crime drop is occurring--but one theory that researchers have  widely debunked is the idea that more guns have deterred crime--in  fact, the opposite may be true, based on research compiled by the  Harvard School of Public Health's Injury Control Center.   Although America's political debate about guns tends to focus on  grisly mass shootings and murders, a majority of gun-related deaths in  the U.S. are suicides.   Research that shows greater access to guns dramatically increases the  risk of suicide.   The states with the most guns report the most suicides.   Perhaps the reason access to guns so strongly contributes to suicides  is that guns are much deadlier than alternatives like cutting and  poison.   Reducing access to guns can be so important to preventing suicides:  stalling an attempt or making it less likely to result in death makes a  huge difference--it opens the opportunity for someone to help or for  the suicidal person to reach out to someone to help.   That is why limiting access to lethal means is so powerful.   Since police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, on  August 9, 2014, police have killed at least 2,902 people as of May  2017.   Given that states with more guns tend to have more homicides, it is  not too surprising that, as a study in the American Journal of Public  Health found, states with more guns also have more cops die in the line  of duty.   Researchers looked at federal data for firearm ownership and  homicides of police officers across the U.S. over 15 years.   They found that states with more gun ownership had more cops killed  in homicides: Every 10 percent increase in firearm ownership correlated  with 10 additional officers killed in homicides over the 15-year study  period.   The findings could help explain why U.S. police officers appear to  kill more people than cops in other developed countries.   For police officers, the higher rates of guns and gun violence in  America means they not only will encounter more guns and violence, but  they can expect to encounter more guns and deadly violence, making them  more likely to anticipate and perceive a threat and use deadly force as  a result.   Over the past 20 years, Americans have clearly shifted from  supporting gun control measures to greater support of ``protecting the  right of Americans to own guns.''   This shift has happened even as major mass shootings, such as the  attacks on Columbine High School and Sandy Hook Elementary School, have  received more press attention.   Although mass shootings are often viewed as some of the worst acts of  gun violence, they seem to have little effect on public opinion about  gun rights.   That helps explain why Americans' support for the right to own guns  appears to be rising over the past 20 years even as more of these mass  shootings make it to the news.   Although Americans say they want to protect the right to bear arms,  they are very much supportive of many gun policy proposals--including  some fairly contentious ideas, such as more background checks on  private and gun show sales and banning semi-automatic and assault-style  weapons.   This type of contradiction is not exclusive to gun policy issues.   For example, although most Americans in the past said they do not  support Obamacare, but most of them also said they like the specific  policies in the health-care law.   On average, 7 children and adolescents lose their lives to gun  violence each day, 75 percent of which are under the age of 12 years  old.   So many people die annually from gun violence in the United States  that the death toll between 1968 and 2011 eclipses the total lives lost  in all the armed conflicts in the history of the United States.   On June 7, 2015, a gunman shot and killed nine people at the Emanuel  African Methodist Episcopal Church Charleston, South Carolina, one of  the oldest and largest black congregations in the South.   On November 11, 2009, at Fort Hood, near Killeen, Texas, a gunman  shot and killed 13 people, and wounded 30 others.   On August 5, 2012 in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, a gunman shot and killed  six people, and injured three others, at the Sikh Temple of Oak Creek.   On July 7, 2015 in Chattanooga, Tennessee a gunman shot and killed  five people, including two U.S. Marines and a Naval Officer, and shot  and injured two others at a recruiting center and U.S. Naval Reserve  Center.   On December 2, 2015 in San Bernardino, California, two gunmen killed  14 people and injured 21 others at the Inland Regional Center.   On December 14, 2012, a gunman murdered 26 persons, including 20  children and 6 school administrators and teachers, at Sandy Hook  Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut.   On August 8, 2015, a gunman brutally murdered his ex-girlfriend and  her six children and husband in one of the most notorious cases of  domestic violence in the history of Houston, Texas.   On April 16, 2007, a gunman killed 32 persons and injured 17 others  at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in Blacksburg,  Virginia.   Mass shootings occur more frequently in states that do not require  background checks for all gun sales.   Analyses of mass shootings in the United States between 2009 and 2015  document that the majority of mass shootings occur in venues where the  carrying of firearm is not restricted.   In states that require background checks for all handgun sales,  including guns offered in unlicensed sales online and at gun shows,  there are 52 percent fewer mass shootings.   Congress must take action to prevent other incidents such as the  recent act of terror and hatred in Las Vegas, Nevada that resulted in  the tragic loss of 58 innocent lives.   We extend our deepest sympathies to all those affected by this  tragedy and recognize the skill and heroism of the law enforcement  officers and first responders who came to the aid of others.   We commend the efforts of those who are working to care for the  injured and investigate this horrific incident.   We extend our heartfelt condolences and prayers to the families of  the fallen, and to all those affected in the community of Las Vegas and  in the United States.   And I pledge to continue to work to reduce gun violence and prevent  mass shooting.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding  to me and for her leadership on this very important issue.   She is standing in the gap because all that we have heard from  Republicans and their media advocates is that their intention, of  course, is to create a 21st century Saturday night massacre.   In my questioning of the Deputy Attorney General, that is the exact  terminology that I utilized, which is: Was the Deputy Attorney General  and the Department of Justice prepared to defend Special Counsel  Mueller against a potential Saturday night massacre?   Of course, that is the Watergate massacre perpetrated by President  Nixon in firing the Attorney General, and then requiring and firing the  special prosecutor and--getting someone to fire--literally creating a  institutional crisis.   Madam Speaker, it is clear, as evidenced by the words of Sean Hannity  on December 5, FOX News, who led off his broadcast with the outrageous  charge that Mueller is frankly a disgrace by the American justice  system and has put the country now on the brink of becoming a banana  republic.   Not surprisingly, disgraced former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who  enthusiastically praised the appointment of Robert Mueller as special  counsel as a superb choice to be special counsel because his reputation  is impeccable for honesty and integrity, has done a complete 180-degree  turn and now declaims falsely that the very top at the Justice  Department and the FBI have become corrupt.   I was pleased to join this letter and to join with Congresswoman  Waters, along with my other colleagues, for a very important statement.   I also believe that this statement must be backed up with  legislation, such as H.R. 3654, which I have offered, the Special  Counsel Independence Protection Act.   But basically I think we have a situation where if we do not make  this a public announcement of indicating that between the  administration, the President, and others, along with Republicans in  this House, there is an entrapment being set up for Special Counsel  Mueller to be considered biased because of the staffing actions of  which, by the way, those individuals have been replaced or they have  been transferred to other positions.   There is no doubt that a man who served in Vietnam, a man who came  [[Page H9899]]  back to the Justice Department as an entry-level employee to be able to  serve his country, there is no question that there is no evidence of  any corruption.   Madam Speaker, I would conclude my remarks by saying the importance  of this legislation and this letter is because Director Mueller is  working his way into the White House, and the issues of Russian  collusion and the issues dealing with criminality are approaching the  front door. We must protect this investigation.   Madam Speaker, in recent days, the shrill but politically-charged  attacks on Special Counsel Robert Mueller have reached a deafening  roar.   For example, on December 5, Fox News host Sean Hannity led off his  broadcast with the outrageous charge that `Mueller is frankly a  disgrace to the American justice system and has put the country now on  the brink of becoming a banana republic.   Not surprisingly, disgraced former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who  enthusiastically praised the appointment of Robert Mueller as Special  Counsel as a `superb choice to be special counsel' because `his  reputation is impeccable for honesty and integrity' has done a complete  180-degree turn and now declaims falsely that at ``the very top, the  Justice Department and the FBI became corrupted.''   These despicable accusations by Trump acolytes and ultraconservative  zealots against a distinguished public servant and veteran who has  served his country with honor and unimpeachable integrity for more than  a half-century are outrageous.   But the public sees them for what they are: a thinly disguised  attempt by a panicked White House and its right-wing media allies to  inflame and persuade base Trump supporters to question the impartiality  of the Special Counsel's investigation that daily uncovers more  evidence of wrongdoing and collusion by operatives of the Trump  campaign, transition, and White House.   In light of the barrage of baseless attacks against Special Counsel  Mueller by Trump apologists and right-wing media, it is urgent that  Congress act immediately to protect the independence and integrity of  Special Counsel Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in  the 2016 Presidential election, including questions surrounding  collusion between Russian operatives and Trump campaign officials.   That is why I am calling upon the House leadership to bring H.R.  3654, the `Special Counsel Independence Protection Act,' to the floor  for debate and a vote by the full House at the earliest time possible.   This legislation, which I introduced on August 15, 2017, insulates  the Special Counsel from the whims of this President by permitting the  removal of the Special Counsel only where:   The attorney general files an action in federal district court in  Washington, D.C., and files a contemporaneous action with the House  Judiciary Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee; and   A panel of three federal judges sitting in Washington, D.C., finds  removal appropriate based on a finding of misconduct, dereliction of  duty, incapacity, conflict of interest or other good cause.   We are on the verge of a constitutional crisis as Trump operatives  try to dismantle, destroy, and undermine Special Counsel Mueller's  investigation.    This cannot be allowed to happen.   The state of our democracy hinges upon our ability to ensure the  integrity of our elections and the rule of law.   And the necessary and ongoing work of the Special Counsel must be  insulated against outside influence and interference.    Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 11 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, December 14, 2017, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
