 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight this week as the  first-ever Modernize the Truck Fleet Week.   Currently, the average age of heavy-duty trucks on the road is nearly  10 years old. That is a decade's worth of technology and improvements  that have effectively been sidelined.   One big reason for this is the 12 percent Federal excise tax, known  as the FET, on the sale of most heavy-duty new trucks.   This tax was implemented over 100 years ago as a means of paying for  World War I and is now the highest percentage tax Congress imposes on  any product.   It can tack on an additional $20,000 to the price of a new truck,  which most truck owners simply cannot afford.   This severely outdated tax discourages the purchase of newer, safer,  more fuel-efficient, environmentally friendly trucks.   It is time to get rid of this tax. That is why I have introduced H.R.  2381, the Modern, Clean, and Safe Trucks Act, which repeals the FET.   The FET maybe made sense when it was implemented 100 years ago, but,  just like the trucks that were designed in 1917, it is no longer viable  in the modern world.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill.                            ____________________
