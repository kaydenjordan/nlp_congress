 Madam President, as chairman of the Senate  Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, each week I recognize  a small business that exemplifies the American entrepreneurial spirit  at the heart of our country. It is an honor to recognize a family-owned  small business known for its industry leadership and local  philanthropy. Today, it is my pleasure to name Anna Maria Oyster Bar of  Bradenton, FL, as the Senate Small Business of the Week.   As a student at Clemson University, John Horne spent his summers  working at a restaurant on the Florida shore. Drawn to the hospitality  industry, John chose to pursue a business degree and establish his own  restaurant. After earning his degree, he worked in several hospitality  roles, gaining both managerial and front-line experience. John achieved  his goal in 1997, opening the original Anna Maria Oyster Bar--AMOB--on  the Anna Maria City Pier. Its family-oriented atmosphere and delicious  food proved a hit, leading to a second location in 2002.   Twenty years later, Anna Maria Oyster Bar has expanded to four  locations in the Bradenton area and has become a local favorite. The  business remains family-owned, with John's wife, Amanda, directing  marketing and community involvement. Their strong sense of family has  built a tight-knit and supportive team that still includes some of  their first employees.  [[Page S6651]]    John is a champion of Manatee County's hospitality industry, a strong  advocate of his trade and his work on philanthropic projects. AMOB has  been recognized as Small Business of the Year by the Manatee, Sarasota,  and Longboat Key Chambers of Commerce. John was also named the 2018  Anna Maria Island Rotary Club Small Businessperson of the Year. AMOB  also received the Champion of Tourism Award from the Bradenton Area  Convention & Visitors Bureau and the 2020 Travelers' Choice Best of the  Best Award from TripAdvisor.   In 2017, John and Amanda founded Dive Into Reading, a summer reading  and mentorship program. Collaborating with local elementary schools,  AMOB has provided more than 500 underprivileged schoolchildren free  meals, one-one-mentorship, and free books. For its impact, Dive Into  Reading earned the National Restaurant Educational Foundation 2018  Restaurant Neighbor Award and the 2019 Leadership Florida Impact Award.   Like many Florida small businesses, Anna Maria Oyster Bar temporarily  closed its doors due to the coronavirus pandemic. In April 2020, the  U.S. Small Business Administration launched the Paycheck Protection  Program, a small business relief program that I was proud to author.  The PPP provides forgivable loans to impacted small businesses and  nonprofits who maintain their payroll during the COVID-19 pandemic.  John and Amanda used their PPP loan to keep their more than 320  employees on the payroll until their restaurants reopened in May.   Anna Maria Oyster Bar is a notable example of the critical role of  relationship-driven small businesses in building community. Through  their philanthropy and industry leadership, AMOB has provided dignified  work and invested in the next generation. Congratulations to John,  Amanda, and the entire team at Anna Maria Oyster Bar. I look forward to  watching your continued growth and leadership.                            ____________________
