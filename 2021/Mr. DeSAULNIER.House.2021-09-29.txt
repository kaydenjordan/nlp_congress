 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the  ordering of the yeas and nays on the motion that the House suspend the  rules and pass the bill (H.R. 978) to require the head of each agency  to establish a safety plan relating to COVID-19 for any worksite at  which employees or contractors are required to be physically present  during the COVID-19 pandemic, and for other purposes be vacated, to the  end that the motion be considered as withdrawn.
