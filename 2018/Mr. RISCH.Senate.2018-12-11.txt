 Mr. President, along with my colleagues Senator Mike Crapo  and Representative Mike Simpson, today I recognize and congratulate Mr.  Richard B. Provencher on his upcoming retirement after more than 32  years of distinguished Federal service consisting of Active-Duty  military service, service with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NRC,  and more than 29 years of service with the U.S. Department of Energy,  DOE.   Mr. Provencher began his Federal career in 1986 as a health physicist  for the NRC Headquarters Office of Nuclear Material Safety and  Safeguards. Rick transferred to NRC Region 1 in King of Prussia, PA,  where he was a materials inspector. In 1990, he joined the DOE as a  health physicist and began his Senior Executive Service career as  deputy director at West Valley Demonstration Project in New York. In  1998, he served as the director of the Miamisburg Closure Project in  Ohio.   In 2003, he transferred to the Idaho Operations Office in Idaho as  the deputy manager for environmental management, where he had a  profound impact on DOE's mission to address Idaho's environmental  cleanup efforts. Mr. Provencher provided strong leadership to the  Federal and contractor workforce, making Idaho's cleanup performance  one of the most successful in the Nation.   Among his many accomplishments, Mr. Provencher was instrumental in  negotiating and executing an agreement between the DOE and the State of  Idaho to implement a cleanup plan for buried waste in the subsurface  disposal area at the Idaho National Laboratory, INL, significantly  reducing the scope of work from the original plan and saving taxpayers  $5 billion.   Most recently, Mr. Provencher served as the Office of Nuclear Energy  Manager for Idaho Operations Office and Contractor Assurance,  responsible for overseeing the INL--our Nation's flagship nuclear  energy laboratory. This responsibility includes managing over 200  Federal technical personnel and oversight of over 6,000 contractor  employees with an annual budget in excess of $1 billion. Under his  leadership, the INL completed major infrastructure improvements and  significantly improved research and development capabilities with  state-of-the-art equipment and facilities that will ensure a bright  future for the laboratory.   Mr. Provencher's remarkable ability to foster collaboration has  strengthened partnerships internal and external to DOE. He repeatedly  demonstrated his ability to build coalitions through his interactions  with the State of Idaho and other elected officials regarding the  operation of the INL. With multiple Departmental organizations present  on the site, as well as many strategic partners across the government,  it is a testament to Rick's leadership that all the various business  functions are seamlessly integrated to support the INL's missions.   Mr. Provencher's performance has improved public trust and confidence  in the DOE's mission work. He has partnered with environmental cleanup  and laboratory participants in carrying the message of cleanup success,  laboratory growth, and contributions to the region which have improved  public perception of the INL and overall DOE mission work.   Through his years of dedicated service, Mr. Provencher exemplifies  the best qualities of Idaho. Senator Crapo, Representative Simpson, and  I thank Rick for his service and wish him well in all of his future  endeavors.                            ____________________     Mr. President, agriculture has always been of  outsized importance to my home State of Idaho. Dairy farming has always  had a presence in the State and has grown considerably over the past  several years, and agricultural co-ops play a vital role in making sure  our State's agricultural products make it to market. As the chairman of  the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, it is my  distinct privilege to recognize High Desert Milk as the Small Business  of the Month for December 2018. High Desert Milk is committed to  building longlasting relationships and providing opportunities for  dairy farmers across, southern Idaho.   Located on the banks of the Snake River in Burley, ID, High Desert  Milk is a cooperative partnership, committed to serving its farmer- owners while also remaining flexible in a competitive market. Founded  in 2001, High Desert sought to create a more efficient dairy market for  local farmers. In 2008, High Desert opened a purpose-built milk  dehydration plant which is capable of processing up to 2.2 million  pounds of milk per day. In 2013, the company was able to expand its  operations and began producing butter to meet increased demand in the  United States. From an initial team of 30 employees, High Desert Milk  has grown into a multimillion-dollar operation with over 150 full-time  employees. In 17 short years, High Desert Milk has become a fixture in  the community by providing reliable milk pickup services and  professional milk marketing.   Presently, High Desert Milk works with 23 family-owned dairies across  70,000 acres of southern Idaho farmland. The company's operations  support more than 1,000 related dairy jobs in the area. Annually, the  company produces almost 60 million pounds of powdered milk, more than  40 million pounds of butter, and 4 million pounds of buttermilk powder.  High Desert Milk's products are shipped all across the country and all  over the world. The company has a reputation for meeting and even  exceeding U.S. Department of Agriculture and customer standards due to  careful technician monitoring during processing. High Desert Milk has  been named one of the top 100 dairy operations in the United States due  to its cleanliness, high quality control standards, and good  relationships with its members.   Despite its worldwide presence, High Desert Milk is still a local  Idaho company with close ties to Burley and rural southern Idaho. High  Desert Milk has a positive presence in the area and takes an active  role in its community. The company hosts several annual charity  fundraisers, including an annual fundraiser for the American Cancer  Society. The company also supports local 4-H and Future Farmers of  America clubs and even sponsors an annual high school-age rodeo. These  community-building practices aim to encourage youth to take an interest  in their local communities and to encourage them to seek careers in  Idaho's vibrant agricultural industry. Each year, High Desert Milk  presents talented local high school students with scholarships to  continue their education. The generous scholarship program encourages  students to excel in the fields of agribusiness and dairy science.  Scholarships are also made available to High Desert employees who want  to continue their studies.   High Desert Milk's tenacious commitment to its member-farmers and  community is preparing the way for a new generation of Idaho dairy  farmers and entrepreneurs. The company's commitment to quality and  efficiency while building a positive relationship with their members  and community is a perfect example of Idaho's entrepreneurial spirit.  The company has become an economic anchor in southern Idaho, creating  new market opportunities for local farmers and providing jobs for local  community members.   I would like to extend my sincere congratulations to High Desert Milk  and all its farmer-members for being named the Small Business of the  Month for December 2018. I wish you all the best of luck, and I look  forward to watching your continued growth and success.                            ____________________
