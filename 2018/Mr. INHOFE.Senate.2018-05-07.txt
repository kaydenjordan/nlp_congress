 Mr. President, today I would like to recognize  Rohan Rajeev, of Edmond, OK, a young man of exemplary character and  talent. Rohan made history as the runner-up at the 2017 Scripps  National Spelling Bee. In his first appearance at the bee, Rohan earned  his position by qualifying from a pool of over 11 million students from  around the world. In 2016, Rohan earned the distinction as the first  speller from Oklahoma to win the Association of Christian Schools  International Spelling Bee.   Rohan has used his skills to help and teach others. He has served as  the first grand marshal of the Eastern Oklahoma State Spelling Bee, a  nonprofit competition whose mission is to help students develop  spelling and vocabulary skills. He has contributed to the community by  volunteering and taking leadership positions in programs and  organizations, including Oklahoma Student Voices and Youth and  Government.   While his honors are many, I am most impressed by Rohan's humility  and courage. He attributes his success to his faith in Jesus Christ,  knowing that He has brought him thus far in life. Despite enduring the  loss of his sister, Raina, to a severe neurological condition, Rohan  continues to honor her memory by dedicating his performances to Raina,  and she continues to inspire Rohan to pursue his dreams.   Congratulations, Rohan. I wish you well in your future endeavors, and  I know your future is bright.                            ____________________
