 Mr. Speaker, I thank my esteemed colleague for yielding.   Here are some facts you need to know about the abysmal record of the  Chinese Communist Party on human rights and against our American way of  freedom.  [[Page H1754]]    China has carried out the torture, forced sterilization, and sexual  abuse of over 1 million Uyghurs.   China has ranked 175 out of 180 countries that lack free press, and  it is notorious for jailing journalists with dissenting voices. Chinese  officials have detained, tortured, and executed protestors with  impunity.   Since 2013, U.S. colleges and universities have received more than $1  billion in gifts and contracts from the Chinese Communist Party and its  affiliated sources.   As a result, professors, student groups, and guest speakers critical  of the Communist Party's human rights abuses have been silenced,  threatened, and de-platformed. The China regime is spreading anti- democratic, anti-American propaganda by funneling large sums of money  into education.   Sadly, we have Americans who have and continue to think that turning  their back on our Nation for self-aggrandizement is okay. This profit  over patriotism culture that has infested our country and our  institutions of higher learning is okay.   This must end.   It is a national security issue when the Communist Party simply buys  onto platforms that manipulate our children, their education, the  vision and ability to appreciate this great country.   We have for years allowed the Chinese Communist Party to find a home  in our high schools and colleges with their Confucius Institutes.                                time  2110    Granted the credibility of our institutions and the pipeline of our  children, they indoctrinate them into their form of government, one  that can only survive through tyranny, is good, and that our form of  government, a representative republic that thrives on freedom, is bad.   It is on these college campuses where the stealing of our  intellectual property, technology, and national security secrets is not  looked upon as betrayal, which it is at the highest, but instead deemed  a necessity to build bigger, more spacious buildings and to hire more  bureaucrats committed to teach our impressible and trusting children  that Marxism is okay after all.   The manipulation of our children on American soil, paid for by  American taxpayers, is unacceptable. Again, the profit over patriotism  culture that has infested too many of our higher education institutions  must stop now.   As we watched a slow-moving Communist spy balloon that took a week to  lumber over our Nation, doing figure eights over our military bases;  then, as we learned this morning of the secret Communist Chinese police  station spying on, intimidating, and disrupting free speech of Chinese  Americans in New York City, we have to wonder what is really being  taught or not taught in our educational system.   It is indeed broken if our past generations taught by these  institutions can see the blatant attacks on our American culture and  think there is nothing wrong; that the presence of misery, chaos,  hopelessness, and divisiveness throughout our Nation is normal and  acceptable.   From establishing a bipartisan select committee on China, to reducing  reliance on foreign adversaries for our American energy needs, the  House GOP has delivered on its promise outlined in our Commitment to  America; that is, to counter the malignant influence of China in  corporate boardrooms, social media, and on college and high school  campuses. We have done so in our first 100 days.   As the chairman of the Higher Education and Workforce Development  Subcommittee, I am proud to lead the charge in ensuring the freedom of  speech of every American on every college campus and to preserve the  integrity of America's higher education.   I am committed to championing the freedom and liberty we enjoy as  Americans. As was the statement made by a Japanese Admiral after the  attack on Pearl Harbor and the deaths of close to 3,000 Americans, ``I  fear we've awakened a sleeping giant.''   To the Biden administration that has for 2 years been asleep as our  Nation has faced threats from within and without, the American people  will not stand by and let our children be indoctrinated out of our  belief in freedom, our American way, and the history of proud Americans  who sacrificed their blood, sweat, and tears to grant us this great  gift.   You have awakened a sleeping giant, a freedom-loving we the people.
