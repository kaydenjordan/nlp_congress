 Madam President, I come to the floor today to celebrate  what we say annually is Sunshine  [[Page S1204]]  Week, a very important week in our system of self-government. For the  last 17 years, advocacy groups, good-government watchdogs, media  organizations, and many Members of this body have joined forces to  observe the importance of transparency in government and freedom of  information. As a longtime champion for open, accessible government, I  speak today in support of what we all ought to consider enduring  principles.   Sunshine Week coincides each year with March 16. That is the day one  of our Nation's Founding Fathers and fourth President of the United  States James Madison was born. Madison is widely known as the father of  the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. From his writings,  particularly in the Federalist Papers, you might say he was the  architect who framed our system of checks and balances. Madison  believed all powers of the government are derived of, by, and for the  people, and that is what brings me to the floor today.   The public has a right to know what their government is doing and how  it is spending tax dollars. There are very few things in government  that should be kept secret: national security, so we don't tell our  enemies what we are going to do; the privacy of American citizens; and  some intelligence-gathering information. I will bet that is 1 percent  of everything the government is involved in. Yet there are some people  who think that a lot more ought to be classified or secret, et cetera,  et cetera.   So we have the Freedom of Information Act that is to protect the  public's right to know. Through Freedom of Information Act requests,  everyday Americans can ask a Federal Agency for information.  Unfortunately, now--and it is a growing problem--Federal Agencies seem  to have the unstated goal of releasing as little information as  possible to the public.   Agencies rely on exemptions to FOIA, the Freedom of Information Act,  to withhold information. A 2021 Government Accountability Office study  found this: that Federal Agencies use FOIA exemptions to avoid  disclosing documents. That problem has doubled between 2012 and 2019.   Most Americans may not be familiar with the section of the code that  we call the (b)(3) FOIA exemption, and, of course, they don't have to  be aware of this, but they should know that it is the most used  justification by the Federal Government to withhold information from  the public.   The increase in the use of this FOIA exemption to withhold  information from the public is unacceptable to me, and it ought to be  unacceptable to anybody who believes that we should not have secrecy in  government.   In another recent report, the Government Accountability Office found  that FOIA request backlogs increased by nearly 20 percent in just the 1  year of 2019 to 2020. In fact, backlogged FOIA requests are up 97  percent since 2012. Sixteen Federal Agencies had more than 1,000  backlogged FOIA requests. They account for 94 percent of backlogged  requests across the entire government.   Federal Agencies ought to do better--must do better--and we must all  work to ensure that they are responding appropriately and within a  reasonable time for FOIA requests.   Congressional oversight is part of our constitutional assignment: to  protect the power of the purse and ensure laws are faithfully enforced.   Finally, we must acknowledge the important role that citizens play  who bravely come forward, often at great professional risk, to report  wrongdoing in our efforts to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse. I have  often said that whistleblowers are the best line of defense against  government waste. No one shines a brighter light on waste, fraud, and  abuse than whistleblowers. And why might that be? Because they are down  in the bowels of the government where maybe the heads of the Agencies  don't know something wrong is going on, and they are able to point it  out--the whistleblowers are.   That is why I introduced legislation this Congress to strengthen the  False Claims Act. I got the False Claims Act passed in 1986. Since  then, that act has helped government recover $70 billion in fraud.   Last year, I asked the Department of Veterans Affairs about  allegations that VA employees leaked potentially market-sensitive  information, and then do you know what they did? They retaliated  against these whistleblowers. Nearly 1 year later, I haven't received  any answers, and I assume I am not going to receive any answers because  it is an embarrassment to the VA.   As a cofounder and cochairman of the Whistleblower Protection Caucus,  I lead efforts from Capitol Hill to strengthen protections and raise  awareness for what often is an uphill battle for whistleblowers.   I want you to know how I feel whistleblowers are treated by their  very own government, how they are treated just because they want the  government to do what the government is supposed to be doing under the  laws, and they want the money spent the way Congress intends for the  money to be spent. These whistleblowers who point out that wrongdoing  are treated by the bureaucracy like skunks at a picnic.   This U.S. Senator will continue shining spotlight on waste, fraud,  and abuse at the Pentagon, and I am going to do it elsewhere, as well.  I will continue advocating for whistleblowers with every tool at my  disposal.   And as an Iowa farmer, I know why farmers make hay when the sun  shines, and that is a good lesson for good government. Sunshine helps  hold government accountable to the people.   Let me repeat that again: Transparency brings accountability.                    EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022    Madam President, I have another point I would like to make. We were  able to pass something with the Omnibus appropriations bill that I have  been working on in a bipartisan way for years. It was a program that  was abused, and we finally got together--Senator Leahy and I--to  finally win what we have been trying to do for years.   So I am here to speak about reforms to the EB-5 investor visa program  that were included in last week's Omnibus bill. I also addressed this  issue before the vote, but I would like to follow up on that statement  with some brief remarks about how important this is after years of  fighting to get it done.   First, this wouldn't have been done without working with my friend  and colleague Senator Leahy. So I thank him. He worked with me for  several years on reforming this EB-5 program. Senator Leahy, as well as  his staff, have put in a great deal of time and work on a number of  legislative efforts to reform the EB-5 program. I appreciate the  partnership that we had on this issue for those many years.   As I mentioned in my previous statement on the day the bill passed,  Congress originally authorized the EB-5 Regional Center Program in 1992  as a pilot program and as an outgrowth of the EB-5 investor visa that  was created by Congress 2 years before that, in 1990.   When the EB-5 visa and regional center programs were established,  Congress intended for them to spur investment in, No. 1, rural areas,  and, No. 2, in economically depressed areas. I emphasize rural and  economically depressed areas because this whole program, over a period  of the next 20 years, evolved into a program far removed from the  original goals. Senator Leahy and I recognized that 5 or 6 years ago.  But to get around all of the interest groups that have something to do  with the EB-5 program, and particularly those who are enriching  themselves from it, it is hard to get changes made here in the Congress  of the United States.   Thank God we were fortunate not to get the EB-5 program extended from  year to year because that is what happened for 4 or 5 years as we were  working on these reforms. You just extended it and let the fraud and  abuse of the law go on. But, finally, about a year ago, we kept that  program from being extended year to year and forced people to sit down  and talk to us in a responsible way to get to where we are today.   It is unfortunate that the EB-5 Regional Center Program, in  particular, has been plagued with all this fraud and abuse. Rampant and  abusive gerrymandering of the EB-5 program's targeted employment areas  also undermined congressional intent that lower investment thresholds  be a tool for channeling investment into areas that truly need it.  Those are the rural areas and the economically depressed areas  [[Page S1205]]  of our country. Gerrymandering undermined the whole purpose of the  program.   Another problem that the reforms addressed was that EB-5 investment  levels had not been adjusted by Congress since 1990, and they should  have been adjusted for the inflation that has taken place since then,  and our act does make some adjustment in that area. It doesn't quite  make up for all the inflation we have had since 1990, but it is still  better than if we had gone with those 1990 figures.   The EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022, which was included in the  Omnibus bill, will address a number of these issues. The bill, which  Senator Leahy and I primarily authored, formally repeals the pilot  program created by Congress in 1992 and codifies in its place a new  Regional Center Program reflecting a number of reforms that we pursued  for many years. These reforms will help to crack down on fraud and  abuse that have plagued the program for far too many years.   As I said in my previous statement, all EB-5 regional centers that  had operated under the lapsed and repealed pilot program will be  expected to seek a new regional center designation. In that process,  they will have to certify compliance with all the relevant requirements  and reforms laid out in our bill, now law, in order to receive such a  designation.   Additionally, for the first time since 1990, the bill statutorily  raises EB-5 investment levels and mandates that they be adjusted for  inflation every 5 years so we don't have what has happened in the last  30 years using 1990 figures for investment.   The legislation also codifies certain aspects of the 2019 EB-5  Immigrant Investor Program modernization rule. Specifically, the bill  codifies the 2019 rule's definition of a ``high unemployment'' targeted  employment area and allows only the Department of Homeland Security to  make such a designation.   The so-called ``doughnut'' targeted employment area model from the  2019 rule will significantly limit the number of census tracts that may  be used to seek designation as a high unemployment area.    This targeted employment area model, combined with exclusive  authority of the Department of Homeland Security to make ``high  unemployment'' targeted employment area designations, should then crack  down on the targeted employment area gerrymandering, which  gerrymandering has long deprived the rural and the economically  distressed areas of the investment that Congress intended when Congress  passed that legislation--now, I guess, 30 years ago.   Listen to this next point. I want the Department of Homeland Security  to pay attention to this. It is also my belief and expectation that the  Department of Homeland Security should reserve ``high unemployment''  targeted employment area designations for census tracts that have  experienced persistently high unemployment for a number of years rather  than just brief spikes in unemployment due to temporary and  extraordinary circumstances, such as what you could have because of the  COVID-19 pandemic, as just one example.   Finally, the legislation puts in place specific visa set-asides for  rural area projects, high unemployment area projects, and  infrastructure projects. The visa set-aside for infrastructure projects  is limited to true public infrastructure projects; that is, in further  explanation, those that benefit the public and the American people, not  public-private partnerships or projects for private businesses.   I will continue to monitor the implementation of this bill, as well  as developments in the EB-5 program over coming months and years.   This bill was titled the EB-5 Reform and Integrity Act of 2022. It is  the result of years of hard work, and I hope it brings real reform to a  program badly in need of that reform. I am grateful that it was  included in the Omnibus bill and was happy, after all of these years,  to see meaningful reform of the EB-5 program finally signed into law.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
