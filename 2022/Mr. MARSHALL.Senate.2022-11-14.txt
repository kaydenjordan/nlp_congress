 Mr. President, I rise today to honor and  recognize Mr. John R. Cyr, the inaugural recipient of the NCRPC's  Lifetime Public Service Award.   The North Central Regional Planning Commission--NCRPC--was formed in  1972 following the establishment of planning and development districts  through executive order of the Governor of Kansas. The NCRPC serves 12  rural counties in Kansas, with the mission of advancing rural Kansas  through comprehensive planning and development services. In 1980, the  U.S. Economic Development Administration designated the NCRPC as an  Economic Development District--EDD--which established the commission as  the regional leader in economic and community development.   In 2022, the NCRPC established its Lifetime Public Service Award, to  be presented to John R. Cyr on November 10, 2022. Mr. Cyr has not only  been instrumental in the founding and growth of the NCRPC, but has been  a leader in regional planning, economic development, and rural  community revitalization. Henceforth, this award will be presented  annually to distinguished north central Kansans who most exemplify the  lifetime commitment to strengthening our rural communities.   The establishment of this prestigious award, and the recognition of  Mr. Cyr as its inaugural recipient will serve not just as an ongoing  tribute to those that have given so much to better their communities  but also as an inspiration to people of all ages to public service and  strengthening our rural communities.   I now ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mr. John R. Cyr for  a lifetime of public service, as well as honoring his work to advance  rural communities in Kansas.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor and  recognize Ms. Julie Scott of Sedgwick, KS.   Julie is one of nine principals receiving the Terrel H. Bell Award  for Outstanding School Leadership for 2022. She is the principal of  R.L. Wright Elementary School and is to be honored during the National  Blue Ribbon Schools Awards Ceremony on Thursday, November 3, 2022.   During her 4 years as principal of R.L. Wright, Ms. Scott has made it  her mission to make the school a safe learning environment for all  students, where everyone feels a sense of community. Through her  outstanding leadership, the school has launched several programs to  help achieve these goals.   To promote early learning, she created the school's full-day Cardinal  Kids Pre-K Program. Ms. Scott also launched Cardinal Connect, an  afterschool program for students, and Cardinal Boost, a tutoring  program focusing on improving students' reading and math skills. Julie  values the opinions of her students and works to incorporate them into  bettering the school. To help accomplish this, she introduced the  principal advisory team, which brings fourth, fifth, and sixth graders  together to provide their input on school improvements.   Ms. Scott also led the creation of the school's family activity  building. This program encourages a strong community by bringing  students from different grade levels together for monthly bonding  activities. Each group is led by an R.L. Wright faculty member,  providing students with a consistent adult contact throughout their  time in elementary school. Julie also introduced a ``community build  day'' when the school received new playground equipment. Members of the  Sedgwick community came together to help with the installation of the  equipment.   She also strives to make the best environment possible for others at  the school. Julie introduced R.L. Wright's Morning Community, where the  entire school comes together to say the Pledge of Allegiance and listen  to daily announcements. Julie formed collaborative teams with the  introduction of Professional Learning Community times. These  collaborations are designed to build team spirit and connection with  the community. She launched a learning community for paraprofessionals,  providing them with additional training and support in monthly  meetings.   Julie's passion for her students and the additions she's brought to  R.L. Wright are a shining example for educators everywhere. She is more  than deserving of this award. I ask my colleagues to join me in  recognizing the wonderful impact Ms. Julie Scott has had on the  Sedgwick community and to honor her for her dedication to serving the  students of R.L. Wright Elementary School.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to honor and  recognize the Kansas 4-H all-star meat judging team.   The Kansas 4-H all-star team won the national championship at the  2022 4-H meat judging contest championship. The exceptional work ethic  and dedication of the Kansas 4-H all-star team led to the first ever  national title for a Kansas team since the contest started in 1970.   To be selected for the all-star team, students must have excellent  evaluation, as well as strong decision-making skills and outstanding  oral communication. This team of Kansans have dedicated significant  amounts of time to studying and preparing for the championship, working  with their coaches and studying independently leading up to the  contest.   The team placed first in several categories, including retail cut  judging, retail cut identification, oral reasons, and overall judging.  They also placed second in pork judging and beef judging. Their efforts  are a great illustration of the dedication and hard work seen across  the Kansas agriculture community.   A strong agricultural industry is not only important to the State of  Kansas, but also to our country. That is why it is so encouraging to  see young people throughout Kansas that are so committed to advancing  the agricultural industry and proudly representing the next generation  of Kansas farmers.   I now ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the Kansas 4-H all- star meat judging team for their exceptional work and their efforts in  bringing the first meat judging national title to the great State of  Kansas.                            ____________________
