 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for  participating in the Congressional Children's Caucus hearing this past  Monday on the Uvalde murder of children.   I rise to join my colleagues in supporting the Global Food Security  Reauthorization Act of 2022 and compliment Representative McCollum and  others who have strongly supported this legislation over the years.   It is particularly timely because I have just finished meeting with  the Foreign Minister of Pakistan and was able to visit in Pakistan in  early September after the catastrophic and momentous floods of biblical  proportion that went on.    What we saw was the potential of extreme starvation of families and  children. Thirty-three million people were displaced. The families in  the region had lost their wheat, their cotton, and their livestock.    Madam Speaker, the idea of the emphasis on the issue  of food security is so crucial, both in terms of the climate change  such that is impacted in Eritrea and Ethiopia, and the issues of  catastrophic flood conditions, so I rise to support this with the idea  that we have right in our midst conditions that would suggest food  insecurity.   This legislation that focuses on ensuring that people of the world  can eat, and the children of the world will not starve is a crucial and  needed legislation, which I support, and which emphasizes, again, the  important element in foreign affairs of food. Food helps save the  world.   I support this legislation, and I commend my colleagues to continue  to work, with devastating conditions around the world, to ensure the  safety and security of children and particularly food security.
