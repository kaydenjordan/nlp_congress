 Mr. Chair, I want to respond to what was just  said.   It is absolutely important that we set straight that diversity does  not mean we are talking about people who are less qualified. We are not  talking about reducing standards. We are talking about recognizing one  part of the decision as one part of many.   This is not a situation where it is the overriding factor. I agree  with what Chairman Banks said, which is that we want the best and  brightest, but what we recognize when it comes to our service  academies, in particular, is that this is a situation where we are  trying to also build a force.    This is not just about an individual. Yes, we want the best and  brightest, but we also want the most cohesive and effective fighting  force for our country.   We recognize we are building an entity where our servicemembers are  part of something bigger than all of them.    I think about this brief that was put forward  to the Supreme Court that was written by former military officials that  said: ``The importance of maintaining a diverse, highly qualified  officer corps has been beyond legitimate dispute for decades. History  has shown that placing a diverse Armed Forces under the command of  homogenous leadership is a recipe for internal resentment, discord, and  violence.''   This is written by former military leaders who are advising us to  make sure that we let the military be able to control and be able to  have the tools they need to build a force that our country needs.
