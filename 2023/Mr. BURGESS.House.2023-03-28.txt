 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to extend congratulations to  the American Flood Coalition. They celebrated 5 years of driving  solutions to build resilience in the face of flooding just this past  Sunday.   As a nonpartisan group of cities, elected officials, military  leaders, businesses, and civic groups, the American Flood Coalition  provides a platform to advocate for a unified voice for solutions to  flooding.   My district in north Texas knows firsthand the destruction caused by  extreme weather and floods, including in 2015, when Ray Roberts,  Grapevine, Lewisville Lakes flooded after sudden heavy rainfall.   I recently joined the coalition as a Federal champion, and I look  forward to working with the American Flood Coalition and other Members  of Congress on long-term solutions that speed up the recoveries, boost  local economies, and prepare us for what lies ahead.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I do  want to rise in support of the rule and in support of the underlying  bill.   It is interesting that our Secretary of Energy, Secretary Granholm,  came to Austin, Texas, 3 or 4 weeks ago and talked about how we should  learn from the communist Chinese and their approach to climate change.  Talk about putting polluters over people. If she would consult her own  energy information agency, she would see that China gets 55 percent of  its energy from coal, whereas the United States gets 11 percent of its  energy from coal.   Guess what? China is building more and more coal-fired plants each  and every week that goes by.   So who, indeed, is putting polluters over people?   I submit it is this administration, and in the last Congress it was  congressional Democrats.   This bill before us today is a culmination of years of hard work by  the Committee on Energy and Commerce, the Committee on Natural  Resources, and the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. It  is a critical step forward.   One of the things that I have worked on for a number of years is the  Promoting Interagency Coordination for Review of Natural Gas Pipelines  Act. It is included in this bill. I think it is critically important,  not just for a State like Texas but, literally, the entire country. I  am grateful that other Republicans Members saw fit to include this  legislation as we seek to address the obstacles preventing Americans  from actually achieving lower energy costs.   In less than 2\1/2\ years, we have gone from relative energy  abundance to energy scarcity. We have gone from energy affordability to  energy unaffordability.   Why in the world would we want to continue down that pathway?                                time  1230    H.R. 1 also contains the repeal of section 50131 of the Inflation  Reduction Act. This provided a billion dollars to coerce State and  local governments into adopting costly energy codes. If these grants  were allowed to stand, they would take away local control over energy  code adoption and Federalize these overreaching mandates.   Efforts to push costly and restrictive energy codes across the  country overburden new construction and largely ignore the energy  performance of the existing housing stock. New homes built to modern  codes are already energy efficient, and further increases in that  stringency must be carefully considered because, in fact, we are not  doing that with these grant programs.   Mr. Speaker, 2 years ago the Congress started with what was called  the American Rescue Plan. It brought us high inflation and it brought  us high prices. This is truly the American Rescue Plan. Let's put  energy affordability back within the reach of the average American.
