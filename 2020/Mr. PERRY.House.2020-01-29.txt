 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer my heartfelt  congratulations to the Camp Hill Lions Girls Soccer Team for their  victory at the PIAA Class A State Soccer Championship, and for their  excellence throughout their undefeated 2019 season.   Led by Coach Jared Latchford--who, to no one's surprise, was just  named the Pennsylvania Soccer Coaches Association Girls Class A Coach  of the Year--the Lions dominated the season, achieving a stunning  overall record of 25 wins, zero ties, and zero losses.   This is the Lions' second appearance at the state championship in the  last 3 years. They took an early lead in their contest against Shady  Side Academy and held it throughout the game.   Aggressive and selfless offense, vigilant defense, and stellar  goalkeeping earned the Lions a 2-0 victory and their first State  championship trophy in school history.   These amazing athletes are the epitome of remarkable dedication and  discipline, outstanding skill, exceptional sportsmanship, and an  unyielding team spirit. Their dedication to excellence, to say the  least, earned them this championship.   On behalf of Pennsylvania's 10th Congressional District, I  congratulate the Camp Hill Lions for their incredible performance. We  are proud of you.                            ____________________
