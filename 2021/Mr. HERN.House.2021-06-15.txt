 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the topic of this Special Order.    Madam Speaker, our country is facing a crisis of our own  making. Republicans and Democrats alike have contributed to the rampant  spending in Washington over the last several decades. But it is time  for someone to stand up and say enough is enough.   I am here tonight with some of the greatest minds in Congress to talk  about our floor-ready plan to tackle wasteful spending and restore  fiscal responsibility to the Federal Government.   In December, Republican Study Committee Chairman   Jim Banks asked me  to lead the Budget Task Force for the 117th Congress, and I gladly  accepted. I put together a team of incredible fiscal conservatives to  help repair our fiscal year 2022 budget.   I thank these intelligent, hardworking colleagues for rising to the  occasion, working diligently to meet our ambitious goals, and putting  together a fine product that will serve all Americans. They are  Chairman   Jim Banks, Roger Williams, Trent Kelly, Ralph Norman, Ron  Estes,   Michael Cloud, Ben Cline, Byron Donalds, and  Bob Good. Thank  you, gentlemen.   In addition to my task force members, I would like to thank a man who  is integral to the work of the task force and is a huge reason for the  success of this final budget, Richard Stern.   When I said yes to drafting the budget for fiscal year 2022, I  committed to creating a thorough, floor-ready budget that reflects the  conservative values that gave us the greatest economy in the history of  the world before the pandemic. I believe, as do my colleagues, that the  pro-growth policies of the Trump administration are proven tactics to  grow the economy and give Americans more control of their own money.   Everyone in Washington seems to forget that we have no money of our  own. Everything we appropriate in this Chamber, every dollar, comes  from the American taxpayers. None of it belongs to us.   In the last year, we spent $7.6 trillion, largely due to an  unprecedented global pandemic. The Biden administration has shown no  sign of slowing down and is starting to alarm more than just  conservatives. It is our responsibility to hold this administration  accountable and prove to the American people that there is someone left  on Capitol Hill who cares about our debts.   We need to return to federalism, where the Federal Government, the  State, and the individual have their own distinct roles.   In order to combat aggressive spending, we need an aggressive plan.  That brings us to this year's budget, aptly named ``Reclaiming Our  Fiscal Future.''   President Trump's budget proposal to Congress would have balanced in  15 years. That was our starting point, and we knew we were capable of  balancing in less than 10.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to say that our budget will balance in just  5 years. Many of you would ask how that is even possible. There are two  parts to that answer. The first part is due to changes in inflation and  interest costs following the COVID-19 pandemic. The second is due to  pro-growth policies like the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.   When we give Americans more control of their own money, the result is  market growth, wage growth, consumer confidence, and, yes, increased  revenues for the Federal Government.   We are making provisions from the Tax Cuts and Job Cuts Act  permanent, reducing the tax burden by $1.9 trillion, almost $16,000 per  household.   We are shielding the middle class from capital gains taxes,  eliminating the death taxes, and repealing market-distorting tax carve- outs.   Our budget is the most pro-life budget ever introduced, with 17  pieces of pro-life legislation included. Our budget stands strong for  the issues Americans care about, and we are crystal clear about how to  pay for it.   We are securing our border and building the wall. We are protecting  your Second Amendment rights. We are supporting our police officers and  ensuring our communities remain safe for everyone.   Our budget includes over 30 specific deregulation bills ensuring  liberty for American job creators and workers alike.                                time  1815    We are putting Medicare and Social Security on a path to solvency  without cutting immediate benefits. Whether you call them earmarks or  community project funding, we are getting rid of it for good. We are  reforming the budget process to be transparent and effective. To put it  simply, we are fighting for Main Street America.   Tonight, you will hear from me and my colleagues who helped shape  this budget, whether as a member of the task force or by contributing  legislation that is included in our budget. These Members all have  something very important in common, a deep respect for the American  taxpayer.   It is our job to ensure that Americans' tax dollars are being spent  wisely, that the government is making every effort to prevent waste and  promote efficiency. It is pretty clear this hasn't been the case in  Washington for a long time.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Roy), my dear  friend from the 21st Congressional District.  [[Page H2804]]         Madam Speaker, I would yield to the gentlewoman from  Illinois (Mrs. Miller), the 15th Congressional District.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr.  Babin), the co-chair of the Border Caucus from the 36th Congressional  District.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Davidson).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the great  State of Louisiana (Mr. Higgins).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the Fourth  Congressional District of Iowa (Mr. Feenstra).    Madam Speaker, may I ask how much time is remaining.    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the Fifth  Congressional District of Virginia (Mr. Good). He is also a task force  member who gave us a tremendous amount of input on our process, and I  want to thank him for his work. It was a 5-month journey that we went  through to arrive at this budget and a lot of sleepless nights. I  really appreciate the gentleman's inputs and his thoughts.    Madam Speaker, Speaker Pelosi reminded us about 3 years ago  when she infamously said: Show me your budget, and I will show you your  values.   That phrase and that statement have been made so many times by  leaders talking about budgets.   In America, individuals have budgets, counties have budgets,  communities have budgets, cities have budgets, schools have budgets,  businesses have budgets, and States have budgets. The United States of  America has gone 3 years now without a budget from the Budget Committee  that is run by my colleagues from the Democratic Party, the people in  power.    We have a budget that we are asking to get on the floor, a budget  that is built on the pro-growth policies that we saw 16 months ago  yield the greatest economy in our lifetime, the lowest unemployment  rate, the most people employed with all diversity, of all ethnicities,  of all countries of origin, women, African Americans, and Hispanics.  Everywhere, people have seen the greatest jobs they have ever seen.  There were double-digit increases for the lowest earning wage earners  among us.   We know these policies work. This budget builds upon them. The  American people are demanding that we be accountable for the dollars  they send us. What we are seeing now in the budget that was just put  out by the President in a piecemeal fashion is a budget that sends jobs  overseas and that destroys jobs in our energy-producing companies, some  of the highest wage earners we have in this country. We see our defense  budget being cut below the inflation rate.   As we speak about inflation, the President promised the American  people that he wouldn't raise taxes on anybody making less than  $400,000 a year. Madam Speaker, I will tell you the greatest hidden tax  in America is inflation, and what we are seeing right now is inflation  rising at an annualized rate of 5, 6, and 7 percent that spans  everybody in America on top of the proposed tax increases that the  President is talking about.   He is proposing looking at changing the tax rates for our  multinational companies, our companies that were starting to move jobs  back to America. Now we are seeing a deal is being struck by Secretary  Yellen to try to take the G7 to tax our companies to the point that we  are going to see jobs leave our country and return back to where they  moved their headquarters overseas, to lower tax nations.   To my colleagues out there, all we are asking for is to put a budget  on the floor, our budget, to get your vote to be responsible to the  American taxpayers so that we can see, once and for all, where everyone  is on doing the right thing for the American taxpayers.                                time  1845    For all of my colleagues that joined us tonight, what we have heard  over the last hour was a clear vision for America, an outline of how  conservatives intend to govern. It is sad that we have to call it a  conservative budget. It is a budget for the American people. This is  the future of our Nation. This is the hope of democracy.   Before I finally close, I would like to yield to the gentleman from  Kansas  [[Page H2807]]  (Mr. Estes), my dear colleague, a member of the task force, to give his  thoughts on what he saw and worked on, on our budget.    Madam Speaker, the Biden administration has put themselves  on the side of Big Government, big taxes, and big bureaucracy.   To paraphrase the great President Ronald Reagan, he said: You can't  be for Big Government and still fight for the little guy.   Our budget is a clear outline for middle and working-class Americans  that their government hasn't left them behind. We have a plan and it  will benefit all Americans.   I am proud of the budget we put together this year, and I am ready to  defend it in front of any committee and any Member of this House.   We have spent the last hour talking about conservative principles.  Well, I want to make it clear that this budget is not just for  conservatives. It is not just for Republicans. It is a budget for all  Americans.   It doesn't matter if your children grow up to be Republicans or  Democrats. They will be paying for our debts regardless, long after we  are gone. That is why it is important to have leaders who are thinking  about our grandchildren and great-grandchildren's future.   It is clear that Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi, and Chuck  Schumer would rather auction off that future in order to pay for an  unpopular radical agenda.   The American people need to know that we are the captains of this  ship and we will not let economic doomsday destroy America's future.   Fiscal responsibility does not have to be partisan, which is why I am  calling on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to help us bring  this budget to the floor for a vote.   I thank everyone who supported this budget tonight and to everyone  who helped us put it together.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
