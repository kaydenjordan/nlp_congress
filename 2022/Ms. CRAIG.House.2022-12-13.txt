 Mr. Speaker, yesterday I was proud to watch the House pass  my bill naming the South St. Paul, Minnesota Post Office after fallen  South St. Paul police officer Leo Pavlak.   In 1933, after only 4 months on the force and at just 38 years old,  Officer Pavlak was shot and killed by the notorious Barker-Karpis gang  while assisting in a payroll delivery. To this day, he is the only  South St. Paul officer to have been killed in the line of duty.   In the 89 years since his death, Leo's children, grandchildren, and  great-grandchildren have continued building the impressive Pavlak  legacy in law enforcement in our community.   Leo's son, Robert Leo Pavlak, Sr. was a St. Paul police officer. One  of his grandsons, Robert, was a Ramsey County deputy, while another  grandson, David, worked in St. Paul as a police officer.   And now Leo's great-grandson, Ryan, is following in those very  footsteps.   So today, I applaud my colleagues in passing this bill to honor not  only Leo's dedication and service but that of the entire Pavlak family.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my Senate colleagues to pass this bill in a  timely manner.                            ____________________
