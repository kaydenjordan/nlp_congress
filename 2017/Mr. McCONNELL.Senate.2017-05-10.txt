 Mr. President, I move to proceed to H.J. Res. 36.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Democratic  leader and I be allowed to give our leader remarks at this time.    Mr. President, today it is my privilege to welcome a  distinguished group of Kentuckians to our Nation's Capital. Because of  the incredible work of the Honor Flight Program, over 80 World War II,  Korea, and Vietnam veterans from across my home State will travel to  Washington. Here they will see the memorials built to honor their  service.   The Bluegrass Chapter Honor Flight has brought hundreds of veterans,  most of them Kentuckians, to Washington for this purpose. Despite the  significant logistical and financial planning that goes into these  trips, Honor Flight works to make sure veterans have the opportunity to  travel at no cost to themselves.   The program organizes travel and food for these veterans, many of  whom would never be able to visit our Nation's Capital or see the  memorials at all without Honor Flight.   The national monuments built on the Mall pay tribute to those who  sacrificed for the cause of freedom. I wish to add my voice to those  who welcome these veterans and thank them for their service to our  country.                            Healthcare Legislation     Mr. President, on another matter, I am glad to see  many of our Democratic friends here with us today. Yesterday they sent  me a letter indicating they want to participate as we work on  legislation that can bring relief from ObamaCare. In that letter, they  acknowledged the need to ``improve and reform the health care system.''   After 8 years of defending this failing law and its higher costs,  reduced choices, and dropped coverage, I am glad to hear that Senate  Democrats are finally willing to concede that the status quo is simply  unsustainable. I appreciate their willingness to acknowledge that  ObamaCare hasn't lived up to its promises.  [[Page S2852]]    That is certainly a reality that Senate Republicans entirely agree  with. It is why we are working to keep our commitment to the American  people to move beyond the failures of ObamaCare.   If our friends on the other side of the aisle want to join us in  replacing ObamaCare with commonsense reforms, I welcome their input. It  is disappointing that it has taken our Democratic colleagues this long  to come around, but I look forward to hearing their ideas now, and I  look forward to joining in a robust debate on the Senate floor as we  pursue smarter healthcare solutions.   As we continue working to address this critical issue, it is  important to remember why we need to act in the first place. Across the  country, more and more Americans are feeling the pain of ObamaCare.  Listen to these recent headlines.         Thousands of Obamacare Customers Left Without Options As       Insurers Bolt.        More Insurers Abandon Obamacare: Who Might Be Next?        Obamacare Choices Could Go From One to Zero in Some Areas.    ObamaCare is failing the American people, and it keeps getting worse.  Families face skyrocketing premiums, fewer choices, and the risk of  losing the doctors or plans they like. Just this week, we saw even more  troubling news out of States like Maryland, where one major insurer  proposed a premium increase of more than 50 percent, warning that the  ObamaCare market is ``in the early stages of a death spiral.''   We saw similar stories out of Connecticut too. There, insurers have  also requested double-digit increases, which could top out at 52  percent amid worries that the last two insurers on the exchanges ``may  leave.''   These States aren't alone. I continue to hear from Kentuckians who  are desperate for relief from ObamaCare. Take this Campbellsville woman  who purchased insurance on the ObamaCare exchanges after researching  the best policy to fit her needs. Only then did she find out how hard  it would be for her to actually get care. Here is what she had to say.         Today I am making payments for a health care plan that does       not cover my doctors, [and] does not cover all my       prescriptions. It is almost totally useless.        I am only one person but I'm sure I speak for many people       who are finding themselves in this difficult situation.    ObamaCare is a failed law that continues to hurt Americans every  single day. It is taking a bigger bite out of their budgets while, as  too many have discovered, covering fewer services they actually need.   We have all received letters from our constituents like the one I  just shared. These families are the ones shouldering the burdens of  ObamaCare. They are the ones counting on us to act and move past the  failures of ObamaCare. If we don't, this situation will only get worse.   That is why we continue to engage in productive conversations with  each Member of our caucus on the way forward on providing relief from  ObamaCare. I look forward to continuing these talks and welcoming our  Democratic colleagues to the conversation if they are ready to join us.  It certainly is an important step for the entire Democratic caucus to  acknowledge that the status quo is failing the American people and that  Congress cannot sit by while Americans suffer the consequences of this  failed law.                            Removal of James Comey     Mr. President, one final matter, whatever one thinks  of the manner in which Director James Comey handled the investigation  into Secretary Clinton's unauthorized use of a private server and her  mishandling of classified information, it is clear what our Democratic  colleagues thought of it--both at that time and consistently  thereafter.   Last year, the current Democratic leader said it appeared to be an  ``appalling act,'' one that he said ``goes against the tradition of  prosecutors at every level of government,'' and the prior Democratic  leader, when asked if James Comey should resign given his conduct of  the investigation, replied ``[o]f course, yes.''   It is also clear what our Democratic colleagues think of the man who  evaluated Mr. Comey's professional conduct and concluded that the  Bureau needed a change in leadership. The Democratic leader just a few  weeks ago praised Mr. Rosenstein for his independence and said he had  developed a reputation for integrity.   What we have now is our Democratic colleagues complaining about the  removal of an FBI Director whom they themselves repeatedly and sharply  criticized; that removal being done by a man, Rod Rosenstein, whom they  repeatedly and effusively praised--when Mr. Rosenstein recommended Mr.  Comey's removal for many of the very reasons they consistently  complained about.   Two investigations are currently ongoing: The Senate Intelligence  Committee's review of Russian active measures and intelligence  activities and the FBI investigation disclosed by Director Comey.   Today we will no doubt hear calls for a new investigation, which  could only serve to impede the current work being done to not only  discover what the Russians may have done but also to let this body and  the national security community develop the countermeasures and  warfighting doctrine to see that it doesn't occur again. Partisan calls  should not delay the considerable work of Chairman Burr and Vice  Chairman Warner. Too much is at stake.   Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein was just confirmed on a bipartisan  vote, 94 to 6--94 to 6--and that sort of fair consideration should  continue when the Senate receives an FBI Director nominee. As I said  yesterday, once the Senate receives a nomination to fill this position,  we will look forward to a full, fair, and timely confirmation process.  This is a critical role that is particularly important as our country  continues to face serious threats at home and abroad.                      Recognition of the Minority Leader     Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 52, Robert Lighthizer to be United States  Trade Representative.    Mr. President, I have 13 requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They include the Armed  Services Committee briefing on capabilities to counter Russian  influence in cyberspace, a Banking Committee hearing on North Korea,  and a Homeland Security Committee hearing on cyber threats facing  America. These committees and all the other committees are doing  important work; therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the 13  committees be allowed to meet.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 37, Jeffrey Rosen to be Deputy Secretary of  Transportation.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call with respect to the cloture motion be waived.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Mr. President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 35, Rachel L. Brand to be Associate Attorney  General.    Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  mandatory quorum call with respect to the cloture motion be waived.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  be in a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak  therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m. on  Thursday, May 11; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the  morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later  in the day, and morning business be closed; further, that following  leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session to resume  consideration of the Lighthizer nomination, with the time until the  cloture vote equally divided in the usual form.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order, following the remarks of Senator Whitehouse  and Senator Tillis.
