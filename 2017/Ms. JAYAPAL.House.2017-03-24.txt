 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman for  yielding and for his tremendous leadership.   Mr. Speaker, this reckless Republican plan is a betrayal of the  American people. How is it a betrayal?   Callously stripping 24 million people of health care is a betrayal.   Putting an age tax on people aged 50 to 64 who will pay up to $14,000  more in annual premiums is a betrayal.   Gutting essential benefits like maternity care, prescription drug  coverage, emergency services, and fundamentally destroying protections  for Americans with preexisting conditions is a betrayal.   Slashing Medicaid by $880 billion and stripping the safety net for  our seniors, our kids, and people with disabilities is a betrayal.   The burden of all of this, Mr. Speaker, will fall on the States, who  will have to come up with billions of dollars.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is not about freedom or choice. This bill is a  travesty, and the American people will pay the price.   This is not a healthcare bill. The only people who benefit are  millionaires, billionaires, and insurance companies, who will get $1  trillion in tax benefits while working Americans pay more and get  nothing.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is pure greed, and real people will suffer and  die from it. Vote ``no,'' and protect our care.
