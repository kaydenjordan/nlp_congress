 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I thank the  gentleman for yielding, and for his incredible leadership.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on  my bipartisan legislation, H.R. 943, the Never Again Education Act,  which has over 300 cosponsors.   On this day, 75 years ago, Auschwitz-Birkenau was finally liberated,  but not before more than 1 million people were murdered there. We mark  this day International Holocaust Remembrance Day as we witness the rise  of anti-Semitism, racism, and bigotry across our country and around the  world.   In fact, we observe this day of remembrance just weeks after a rise  of violent anti-Semitic attacks in New York, including an attack at a  rabbi's home during the festival of Hanukkah.   An Anti-Defamation League report recorded that over 1,800 of these  acts happened in 2018 alone. And yet, as we speak out against these  attacks and stand against hate with our Jewish communities, we are also  called to act.   Condemnation alone is not enough. We need to do all we can to create  communities in which these incidents don't happen in the first place.   We need to make a better future, one of understanding, acceptance,  and mutual respect.   We must make sure our children and students understand the dangers of  rising anti-Semitism.   In the resolution establishing today as International Holocaust  Remembrance Day, the United Nations asked each member Nation to  ``develop educational programs that will inculcate future generations  with the lessons of the Holocaust in order to help prevent future acts  of genocide.''   As a former teacher, I know that our children are not born with hate  in their hearts, and it is up to us to make sure that they never learn  it.   We need to give our teachers the resources they need to teach about  the Holocaust and the dangers of bigotry and hate. This is not an easy  subject matter for our students to understand, and our teachers need  support, lesson plans, guest speakers, and training.   So along with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I introduced  H.R. 943, which will expand the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's  already impressive educational programs by requiring the museum to  develop and disseminate accurate, relevant, and accessible resources to  improve awareness and understanding of the Holocaust, and educate  individuals on the lessons as a means to promote the importance of  preventing genocide, hate, and bigotry against any group of people.   By providing $10 million over 5 years to support key programs like  having traveling exhibits, expanding a centralized website, a database,  where educators can find curriculum and lessons plans that are  appropriate for every age group; to develop and disseminate and  implement principles of sound instruction; and to increase engagement  with State and local education leaders.   This was a huge effort over 20 years. I first introduced this bill in  1999, and I have been working on it in a bipartisan way ever since.   I particularly want to thank the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum,  Hadassah, the Jewish Federations of North America, and the Anti- Defamation League for all of their work that they have done, not only  to support Holocaust education, but to support the passage of this  bill.   I especially want to thank my coleads on this bill, Representatives  Stefanik, Bacon, and Carbajal for all of their hard work in gaining the  300 cosponsors.                                time  1715    As we recommit ourselves to the promise of ``never again,'' I am  reminded that the lessons of the Holocaust do not apply just to anti- Semitism but to all forms of hate and bigotry. I can think of no better  way to honor the memories of those murdered than to make sure our  students know their stories, for if we do not learn from history, we  are doomed to repeat it.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote together in  support of this legislation. I thank all of my colleagues who have  signed on to this legislation for their support, especially Chairman  Scott for his leadership and support. I thank my own staff,  particularly Kelly Hennessy, and the staff of Chairman Scott.    MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise to  congratulate leaders in Virginia for their historic vote to become the  38th State to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment today.   For decades, ERA advocates across the country have been fighting so  that equality for women and men is constitutionally protected. The  momentum behind the effort has never been stronger.   I have sponsored the Equal Rights Amendment for many years because I  believe it is the only way to make lasting progress on the goals we  consistently fight for, like equal pay for equal work, ending pregnancy  discrimination, and combating gender-based violence.   The ERA is a legal foundation that can withstand changing political  whims of legislators, judges, or occupants of the White House.   Women are long past due equal treatment under the law. We will  persist until it is firmly guaranteed. We demand full equality now. We  demand that it be spelled out in the Constitution. And you spell it E- R-A.                            ____________________     MALONEY of New York: Committee on Oversight       and Reform. H.R. 964.
