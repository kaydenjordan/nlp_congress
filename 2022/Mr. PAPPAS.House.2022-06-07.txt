 Madam Speaker, I thank the Representative for her  leadership in organizing this bipartisan Special Order hour.   It is important for us to be together here to commemorate the 30th  anniversary of the 340B program. We know that it has helped to ensure  that rural communities and low-income individuals in districts like  mine and across the country have access to the lifesaving healthcare  and prescription drugs that they need.   I am also here in strong opposition to what these drug companies are  doing. They are undermining the 340B discounts. I believe it is a  violation of the law, and it is hurting families in my district.   There are at least 13 pharmaceutical companies right now that are  unlawfully withholding or limiting discounts under the 340B program,  and it impacts providers and patients in New Hampshire, including our  hospitals, our community health centers, and other providers who serve  our most vulnerable neighbors.   I have heard about this from my constituents who have talked about  the importance of this program, and I think their words tell a pretty  powerful story.   In Rockingham County in my district, one of my constituents requires  daily medication. Without 340B, not only would she not be able to  afford her medication, but she would also be forced to choose between  affording her home or affording her own health.                                time  2000    In Strafford County, in my district, there is another New Hampshire  resident who uses the 340B program for insulin for their diabetes. They  pay just $45 a month for three vials of insulin instead of $400 a month  for just one vial. According to them, ``Everything would get turned  upside down for me if the program ended.''   And because of the 340B program, staff at a community health center  in my district have been able to reduce the cost of treatments  significantly. Specifically, for one patient who has lived with a  condition since they were 12 years old, costs were reduced from $400 to  just about $100. They shared this with me: ``I can't imagine what I  would do if it weren't for the 340B program helping with the price of  my medication. Please do everything you can to protect this.''   Last year, I signed a letter with over 220 House Members to protect  the 340B program and oppose the actions of these drug companies. We  called on HHS to take action to stop these companies from denying these  340B discounts.   In February, I was very proud to join so many of my colleagues in  cosponsoring the PROTECT 340B Act. This would stop health insurers and  pharmacy benefit managers from discriminating against 340B providers,  and it would protect the health and well-being of my constituents and  so many others across this country that depend on this program.   At a time when pharmaceutical companies are reaping record profits,  when the cost of prescription drugs continues to skyrocket, it is just  unconscionable that there are corporate actors who continue to ignore  the law and stick it to our consumers, our constituents, the patients  across this country and hand them an astronomical bill.   We have all got to join together and commit ourselves to fighting to  lower the cost of prescription drugs. This is one area where I think  Republicans and Democrats can come together and pass something  meaningful. I hope our colleagues will heed the stories they have heard  here tonight. I thank Representative Spanberger for her leadership.
