 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, every day  Americans communicate with loved ones, receive medication, and during  this pandemic, millions more than usual will vote all by mail.   Yet drastic, negative changes are being made by new Postal Service  leadership.  [[Page H4151]]    Mail is being delivered later than normal, overtime is being  eliminated, and carriers are being told to leave mail at distribution  centers.   The Administration's new Postmaster General is treating the Postal  Service like a company, not a constitutionally mandated service for all  Americans.   My amendment would stop the Postal Service from implementing new  standards that will result in later mail delivery and worse service.   Now more than ever it is critical that the Postal Service continue to  perform its mission without having to worry about cutting corners to  cut costs.   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
