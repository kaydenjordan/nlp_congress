 Madam Speaker, I am so excited to vote today for this  climate and healthcare bill, and here is why: This bill is the answer  to the questions that my constituents have been asking since day one.   Here is what I am hearing:   Dr. Schrier, you have diabetes, too. I can't afford my insulin. I am  having to ration at the end of the month. Won't you do something about  it?   Well, here is the answer: $35-a-month insulin.   Dr. Schrier, I am a senior. I have a fixed income. I can't afford  these high drug prices. Why can't Medicare negotiate them?   Well, here is your answer: Medicare getting the power to negotiate  the cost of prescription drugs.   Also: Dr. Schrier, I am a senior. There are too many out-of-pocket  costs for me.   This caps them at $2,000.   And finally, right now, we have fires burning in Washington State.  And I have farmers who have seen reduced crop yields because of extreme  heat.   They say: Dr. Schrier, can't you do something about climate?   And here is the answer: The biggest investment in climate solutions  that we have ever had.   This bill brings relief. It brings financial relief to families who  are feeling the high inflation in gas prices.   And you know how it does it? By finally making sure that the  wealthiest corporations pay their fair share of taxes, and it does it  without raising tax on middle-class families.   Madam Speaker, I am so excited about this bill because it answers the  requests of the people I represent, and that is why I am so excited to  vote for it today.                                time  1515
