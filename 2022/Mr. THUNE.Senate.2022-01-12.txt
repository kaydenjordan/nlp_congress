 Madam President, the Democrats' campaign to break the  Senate continues.   I want to read a quote:         The ideologues in the Senate want to turn what the Founding       Fathers called the cooling saucer of democracy into the       rubber stamp of dictatorship.    Not my words--those are the words of the current Senate Democrat  leader back in 2005 when filibuster changes were under discussion. The  current Democrat leader was once, in fact, a defender of the filibuster  and the role it plays in ensuring that the minority party in the Senate  and the Americans it represents have a voice. In fact, the minority  leader at various times has described trying to get rid of the  filibuster as ``doomsday for democracy.'' He described those who were  behind the effort to try to get rid of the filibuster as being in  support of turning America into ``a banana republic.'' Those were  statements made by the current Democrat leader when he was defending  the filibuster in years past.   In fact, a lot of my colleagues across the aisle have defended the  filibuster and used the filibuster repeatedly when they were in the  minority. In the last Congress alone, Democrats filibustered COVID  relief legislation until they got a bill that they could support. They  filibustered police reform legislation. They filibustered Israel  legislation. They filibustered pro-life legislation--and on and on.   While Republicans certainly didn't enjoy it when Democrats used the  filibuster when we were in the majority, we recognized that it meant  that our Senate was working the way that the Founders intended--as a  place of compromise and deliberation, where the minority, as well as  the majority, was represented. That is why we resisted repeated calls  from the former President, our party's President, when we had the  majority to abolish the filibuster.   Abolishing the filibuster certainly would have made it easier for us  to advance important legislation--legislation that was of value to  Members on our side, things that we wanted to see get done--but we knew  that sacrificing the long-term good of the Senate and the country for  short-term gain was not an acceptable course of action.   Let's be very clear that the gain would have been short term. If we  had abolished the legislative filibuster, we could have passed a lot of  important legislation, only to see it overturned as soon as Democrats  took control of the legislative and executive branches. Once we  returned to unified Republican government, we could, of course, have  put our original legislation back in place. That is the kind ping- ponging that would be terrible for our country.   Sharp changes in Federal policy every few years would mean endless  confusion for Americans. Plus, free of the moderating influence of the  filibuster, legislation would almost unquestionably become more  extreme, which would harden and intensify partisan division not just  here in Congress but in the country as a whole. Ordinary citizens would  look ever more distrustful at government, which would quickly come to  be seen as government for Americans of one party only--the party of  power.    Democrats should know all of the things that I am saying. After all,  they were in the minority just 1 year ago. It is hard for me to  understand how they could forget that. Do they think that because they  have the majority now, that they will always have it? History would beg  to differ.   I realize the Democrats have hopes that if they pass their election  legislation, it will help them stay in power, but surely--surely-- Democrats don't believe that they can maintain a permanent hold on  government. There have been some pretty robust Senate majorities in  American history, but sooner or later, power has always shifted, and  the Presidency has shifted too.   Even if Democrats succeed in all of their election machinations, the  day will come--and probably sooner rather than later--when their party  will return to the minority, and I suspect that at that point, they  would bitterly regret the loss of the legislative filibuster.   Democrats have already had cause to regret the loss of the filibuster  for judicial nominations. More than one Democrat Senator has openly  admitted regretting Democrats' move to abolish the filibuster for  judges and other nominees.   The unravelling of the filibuster for judicial nominations should be  a lesson to both parties on how well weakening the filibuster or  creating a filibuster carve-out would work. Democrats carved out a  filibuster exception for executive and judicial nominees, and  Republicans took it to its logical conclusion.   A legislative filibuster carve-out would be the end of the  legislative filibuster, period.   If Democrats' carve out an exception for election legislation, a  future Senate would be likely to carve out an exception for something  else and so on and so forth, until the filibuster was carved out of  existence completely.   In fact, I strongly suspect that a filibuster carve-out solely for  election legislation wouldn't even survive the coming year. I can  imagine my Democrat colleagues quickly deciding that some other  priority of theirs was also worthy of a special exemption. It is  possible that the legislative filibuster would be gone before the end  of this Congress.   Again, I urge my Democrat colleagues to remember their decision to  remove the filibuster for judicial nominations and how quickly that  came back to haunt them. They may like the idea of forcing through  their legislation now, but sooner or later--and probably sooner--I can  guarantee that they will regret it.   The filibuster and its protection for the rights of the minority are  safe so long as neither party starts to chip away at it. Once one party  starts weakening the filibuster, especially on a totally partisan  basis, that will be the end of the filibuster and the end of real  representation for the minority in Congress.   It is deeply disappointing that the Democrat leader and the President  have abandoned their previous support for protecting representation for  the minority. It is even more astonishing, really, that they have done  so when they enjoy the narrowest majorities in Congress. It should be a  reminder of how quickly Democrats could once again return to the  minority and be in need of the legislative filibuster.   But I know that there are Democrats out there with serious doubts  about their leadership's course of action. Some would express this  doubt openly, but I suspect there are others who haven't spoken up who  also have serious reservations. After all, a majority of the current  Senate Democrat caucus signed a letter just 4 short years ago  expressing their belief in the importance of the filibuster. I cannot  believe that all of them would change their position merely because the  political winds have shifted.   So I urge all of my Democrat colleagues to resist this blatant power  grab by the Democrat leadership and preserve our longstanding  commitment to representation for the minority in the U.S. Senate, the  purpose for which this institution was created, and the Americans it  represents.   Madam President, I yield the floor.
