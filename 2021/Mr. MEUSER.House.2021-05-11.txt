 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Kentucky, my  good friend, Representative Guthrie; and my good friend from Maryland,    David Trone, for their work on this bill.   Madam Speaker, the plight of addiction continues to affect  communities across the country and in our great Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania. Substance use disorder, like any disease, doesn't just  affect the individual. Their family, spouse, children, and friends also  suffer alongside them, hoping for recovery. The critical support system  they comprise is a potent tool in combatting addiction and an effective  partner we should aim to empower.   That is why this bill, the Family Support Services for Addiction Act,  is so essential and why I am truly very proud to be working with my  good friend, Representative   David Trone, to see it become law. His  commitment to this cause is impressive and honorable.   Our bill provides grants for community organizations, providing  critical support to families trying to navigate the complex insurance  coverage and treatment options.   Too often, this system overwhelms concerned families looking for the  best option for their loved one. By passing this bill, we ensure more  families will be connected to a lifesaving treatment option tailored to  their needs.   Unfortunately, Madam Speaker, this crisis has only become more acute  during the pandemic. According to the CDC, 81,000 drug overdose deaths  occurred between May 2019 and May 2020, the highest number recorded in  a 12-month period. To combat this epidemic of drug use, we must use  every tool we have; and the network of support that families provide is  an essential tool to overcoming addiction and restoring our  communities.   I, again, want to thank Representative Trone for his work on this  bill, on this very important issue; and the committee leaders for  moving this much-needed measure to the floor today.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
