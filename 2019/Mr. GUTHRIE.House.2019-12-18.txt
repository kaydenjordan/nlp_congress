 Madam Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the  Articles of Impeachment on President Trump.   My Democratic colleagues have been planning to impeach President  Trump since he took office. After months of wasting House time on  partisan investigations, they have been unable to produce evidence that  President Trump committed a crime.   I will vote ``no'' on today's Articles of Impeachment. I look forward  to getting back to the business on behalf of Kentuckians.
