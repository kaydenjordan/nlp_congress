 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  6311, the Increasing Access to Lower Premium Plans and Expanding Health  Savings Accounts Act.   This bill gives all Americans the option to purchase a catastrophic  plan if they so choose, which, under current law, is restricted to a  limited population. This bill will increase health insurance plan and  pricing options as we continue our work to address the underlying  problems of ObamaCare.   Nebraskans continue to tell me that they are desperate for more  options to buy health insurance for their families. We are down to only  one insurer in Nebraska, in Nebraska's exchange; and with premiums for  a family, which can exceed $30,000 before even factoring in four- and  five-figure deductibles, families need more options, Nebraskans need  more options.   The way to create access to healthcare for more people is by  understanding better the buyer-seller relationship.   If you want to reduce costs through increasing participation, whoever  is doing the selling must create products the consumer is willing to  buy. The more barriers are wedged between the buyer and seller, the  more transparency and competition will decrease and the more healthcare  costs for consumers will increase.   It is obvious that ObamaCare policies, which have restricted choice  through one-size-fits-all requirements for insurance products, continue  to fail, and this bill will help give Nebraskans and all Americans the  choices they need and deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Roskam for bringing us this bill, and I urge  support for it.
