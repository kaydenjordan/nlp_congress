 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, all postcloture time on  the Branch nomination expire at 4 p.m. today and the Senate vote on the  nomination with no intervening action or debate. Finally, if confirmed,  the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and  the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  stand in recess as under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 12:18 p.m., recessed until  2:15 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer  (Mr. Portman).                            ____________________     Mr. President, I would like to talk today about two  [[Page S1229]]  brave Ohioans who were tragically killed while serving their community  and all of us.   On Saturday, February 10, Ohio lost two of its finest when  Westerville Police Officers Anthony Morelli and Eric Joering were  fatally shot responding to a 9-1-1 call. They rushed to the scene. When  they arrived, they were under fire. Officer Joering was killed at the  scene. Officer Morelli died in surgery later that day.   Officer Morelli was a 29-year veteran of the Westerville Police  Department. He leaves behind his wife Linda, their daughter Beth, and  son Chris. Officer Joering was a 16-year veteran of the Westerville  Police Department, where he was a K-9 officer partnered with his dog  Sam.   Eric loved working with Sam, but what he really loved were his kids  and his wife. His most important job, he said, was being a husband and  a father. He is survived by his wife Jami and his beautiful daughters  Eva, Elena, and Ella.   Both men were loved and respected members of the Westerville  community, and both will be sorely missed. I had a chance to talk to a  number of their fellow officers, their colleagues, over the weekend and  heard many stories about them, their bravery, and their commitment to  service.   I also had the great honor to meet with the families of both of these  fallen officers over this past weekend in Columbus, OH. Linda Morelli  and Jami Joering are incredibly strong women and incredibly strong  mothers. I expressed my thanks from all Ohioans for their husbands'  service. I also had a chance to talk to four of the five children about  their fathers' exemplary service; that they had fallen in service to  all of us and how much we appreciated them.   The U.S. Capitol has flags that are flown for special occasions, and  two flags were flown in honor of the sacrifices these two good men made  protecting the people of Ohio.   Throughout this tragic situation, I will say the people of Central  Ohio and, frankly, across the Nation have stepped up in big ways to  support and assist these two families. I am encouraged by the kindness  and generosity we have seen.   I want to take a moment to just say that these two brave officers,  Tony Morelli and Eric Joering, were the best. They made the ultimate  sacrifice for all of us. Today, we hold their families up in prayer.   (The remarks of Mr. Portman pertaining to the introduction of S. 2456  are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills  and Joint Resolutions.'')    I yield back.    Mr. President, I want to address a critical issue today  in Westerville, OH, and, frankly, every community I represent in my  State and communities all over the country. Today, I want to talk about  the opioid epidemic that is gripping our country.   Every State represented in this Chamber has had too many communities  devastated, families broken apart, and lives taken by the opioid  overdoses. The Centers for Disease Control now tells us more than  63,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2016, the last year for  which they have records. It also looks like it was worse in 2017. More  Americans are dying from drug overdoses than the total number of  casualties during the Vietnam war. Every year, more Americans are dying  from drug overdoses than the total number of casualties from the  Vietnam war. Think about that. It is a staggering statistic.   On average, more than 174 Americans died every single day from a drug  overdose in 2016. That is up from 143 Americans in 2015 and 105  Americans in 2010. In other words, it is getting worse, and 2016 was  the deadliest year on record. Initial estimates for 2017 suggest it is  going to be even deadlier, including in my home State of Ohio.   Opioids--prescription drugs, heroin, and synthetic forms of heroin-- are increasingly the reason why. Opioids were involved in about two- thirds of all overdose deaths in 2016. Opioid overdose deaths were five  times higher in 2016 than they were just back in 1999. In the past 17  years, we have seen a fivefold increase in these overdose deaths. It is  a national epidemic.   It has unfolded in three different waves. It started with  prescription drugs, overprescribing of prescription drugs--pain pills.  The pill mills we saw in Southern Ohio and around our State exploded  about 15 to 20 years ago. Next, there were the heroin deaths. Heroin  moved in and spiked as people moved to less expensive and more  accessible alternatives than prescription drugs. Now, I hate to tell  you, there is a new danger and a threat, and it is deadlier than ever.  It is these synthetic opioids--fentanyl, carfentanil--that have moved  into our States, overcoming our law enforcement, and the results have  been deadly.   By the way, it is a crisis that does not discriminate. Opioid  addiction affects everybody, regardless of age, area code, class, or  color. In Ohio, drug addiction and acts committed to support it have  now become the No. 1 cause of crime in our communities--probably the  same in your community.   Employers, of course, are increasingly pointing to the inability to  find workers who can pass a drug test. They can't fill vacant  positions. There is new data out with regard to people who are not  showing up on the unemployment rolls but have given up looking for work  altogether. There are probably 9 million men between 25 and 55 who are  considered to be able-bodied who aren't even looking for work. Some  really troubling statistics out there indicate that maybe as many as  half--one study says 48 percent--of those individuals are taking  opioids on a daily basis.   This is affecting all of us. Every aspect of our communities is  affected. Everybody has a role to play overcoming this epidemic. There  is an urgency coming up with better strategies to turn the tide on  addiction. Although I believe progress has been made recently--and it  is starting to be made in my State and other States--much more needs to  be done and done urgently.   Part of that starts with understanding that addiction is a disease,  and it is treatable. Too often it is not treated like that. The  appropriate response should include much more aggressive prevention and  education, absolutely, and more aggressive law enforcement keeping  deadly fentanyl out of our communities through the STOP Act and other  means, of course, but we also have to get more effective treatment  strategies. We have a couple hundred thousand people in Ohio who are  addicted. We need to get them into treatment, including more effective  detox, medication-assisted treatment, and longer term recovery. We  know, coupled with the right kind of therapy, the right kind of support  and help, people can get into recovery and get back to their families,  get back to work, and get back to being productive citizens.   We also know recovery results are a lot better with that kind of  continuous support. Closing the gaps that occur is key to overcoming  addiction. There is a gap between the crisis response, which is often a  first responder--like the two brave officers I talked about earlier-- finding someone who has overdosed. Often it is firefighters as well  providing Narcan, this miracle drug that reverses the effect of the  overdose. That is incredibly important to saving lives.   Narcan alone is not sufficient. The key is to get those people into  detox and into treatment and longer term recovery. The gaps we have out  there between the crisis response and Narcan,  [[Page S1246]]  then going to detox, then going to treatment, and then going to  recovery are creating a lot of the inability to solve this problem.   I have probably met a couple of thousand addicts or recovering  addicts in the last few years. What they tell me is: I tried treatment,  but it was for 6, 7, 8 weeks, and then there was nothing for me. It  didn't work for me. Then there are people who overdosed, not once or  twice but several times, and they had never been in detox and  treatment.   One young man I spoke to last weekend has been an addict for 7 years.  Finally, his brother convinced him to seek help. The last time he  overdosed, he did go into detox. He did go into treatment, to a  facility where those gaps were closed, where there was no waiting time,  where he was able to get the help, rather than going back to his old  community and his old friends and a situation that was going to lead  him back into more use and more addiction.   The key, again, is to get those who have overdosed into the treatment  they need. Overdose reversal provides a second chance at life. Let's  face it. Some of these people who are overdosing come out of this after  Narcan is administered. They have seen their life flash before their  eyes, and they are ready for something. We have to be ready for them.  Just as the overdose reversal provides a second chance at life, it is  treatment and longer term recovery that provides that second chance to  live addiction-free--again, to get back with your family, get back to  work, and get back to a productive life. It takes a comprehensive  solution because it is a comprehensive problem.   That is what led some of us in this body, including my colleague  Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and me, to introduce the Comprehensive  Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, back in 2015. We developed that  bill over time by relying on experts in the field and those most  affected by addiction.   Beginning in 2014, when we were in the process of putting together  the legislation, we hosted five national forums here in Washington, DC.  We brought experts and practitioners in from around the country-- prevention, treatment, law enforcement, and recovery communities. We  wanted to get the best practices to find out what was working, what  wasn't working, and how we could improve the response. What role could  the Federal Government play in all of this? We had forums focused on  the science of addiction to understand it better, evidence-based  prevention strategies that actually work; treating pregnant women who  are addicted and babies at risk of being born drug-dependent. There is  nothing more heartbreaking than going into the neonatal units in the  hospitals in my home State and seeing these babies who were born  dependent and watching them go through the painful withdrawal process  as infants Every neonatal unit in our country has seen this. If you go  to your own hospital, they will tell you this is an increasing problem.    We had veterans come in, and we had experts come in to help veterans  make that transition because, sadly, the use of opioids among veterans  is also increasing. They sometimes use opioids for injuries, for  accidents, for PTSD, and they become addicted. How do you build support  around those veterans? We also had people come in and talk about longer  term recovery and housing and how, over time, you can get better  results if you provide those kinds of services. Our goal was to  leverage the expertise and perspectives of everyone involved in this  epidemic, to find best practices, and to create an evidence-based  education, treatment, and recovery bill that works.   With strong bipartisan support, we moved from hearings, to a  unanimous committee markup, to Senate passage of this legislation. By  the way, it passed with a vote of 92 to 2. That is not typical around  here, certainly not for something so comprehensive. Yet everybody has  experienced this back home and is desperate to figure out strategies to  help. In July of 2016, President Obama signed CARA into law. It was the  first comprehensive addiction reform in more than 20 years. It was the  first time Congress had ever provided any support or help for this  longer term recovery piece.   The CARA law targets prevention and education resources to prevent  abuse before it even starts--the most effective way. It helps first  responders reverse overdoses to save lives. It devotes resources to  evidence-based treatment and recovery programs. It expands prescription  drug take-back programs to get addictive pain pills off the bathroom  shelves. More than $180 million was authorized to assist communities in  these efforts to combat this epidemic. Frankly, because of this crisis,  the appropriators decided: You know, we need this so badly, we are  actually going to appropriate more than the $180 million. Last year, as  an example, they appropriated $267 million--almost $100 million beyond  our authorization.   Again, I think it is beginning to make a difference. I see it back  home in Ohio. I see some of these strategies beginning to work. It is  going to take some time, and we need to do more. In Ohio, we received  about $4 million. When I say ``we,'' I mean groups, people who are in  the trenches doing the hard work.   We have also made progress in this fight with separate opioid  legislation that was part of the 21st Century Cures legislation. That  legislation was for substance abuse and mental health. Many of us  successfully fought to help secure a 2-year commitment there of $500  million a year, totaling $1 billion. It goes directly to the States.  This money goes to States that are hardest hit, and States are allowed  to decide how to spend that money. The first installment of funding  from that legislation awarded my State of Ohio with $26 million, and we  are using every penny of it.   I was at a facility over the weekend that gave me hope. It is called  the Maryhaven Addiction Stabilization Center, and it is in Columbus,  OH. They talked about the gaps, where people who overdose are provided  Narcan, and then they go back to their community, and what first  responders will tell you is that sometimes in the same week or even on  the same day on some occasions, there is another overdose. The  revolving door continues without any treatment and without any  solution. Maryhaven Stabilization Center is a response to that. They  used the Cures money we talked about, they used some CARA funding from  the county--the county is a part of the broader strategy of where the  CARA money went--and they said: Let's put together an institution where  there is an emergency room that focuses on overdoses.   I have been to other emergency rooms in Columbus, OH, and I have seen  what they do with the people who overdose. They save lives, and that is  fantastic, but frankly these emergency rooms are equipped for  everything, and they have to be--for gunshot wounds, car accidents,  trauma.   This emergency room would be focused specifically on overdoses, which  makes it more cost-effective but also more effective for those  recovering addicts, those addicts who are coming in. But most  importantly, in that same facility, there is a detox center. In that  same facility, there are 50 treatment beds. Whereas in the typical case  when somebody overdoses, they go to the emergency room and end up going  back to their community, back home, back to the gang, back to the  family, in this case, 103 people who have gone through in the last  month--it has only been open a month--80 percent of them have gone into  treatment. I had the opportunity to meet someone who had been through  that process, and we talked about the difference this makes. You  literally walk through the door into treatment, there is strong  encouragement to do it, and it is working.   These are the kinds of things that are going to make a difference in  our communities. It seems to be common sense, but frankly it is not  happening in other places. Programs like these are what are going to  help us overcome addiction and are examples of how Federal funds can be  used more effectively to leverage, in this case, a lot of private  dollars, some State dollars.   Both of these landmark laws--the CARA Act that we talked about and  the Cures Act--are providing increased resources to local communities,  but this problem is not getting better, it is getting worse.   One of the problems is the availability and the low cost of these  highly addictive, even more dangerous drugs coming in. There are  synthetic opioids. Fentanyl is 50 times stronger than heroin on  average. It is coming in through  [[Page S1247]]  the mail. We need to do more to stop it through law enforcement, but we  also need to acknowledge that it has been sprinkled in other drugs and  is creating a lot of these addiction overdoses and higher rates of  death.   The degree of damage this is causing to our communities, our  families, our local budgets, and our criminal justice system requires  us to take a more aggressive stance, to do more to figure this out. We  need to strengthen our resolve. We made progress recently with the  bipartisan budget agreement President Trump signed into law just a few  weeks ago. We included in there an additional amount of funding--$6  billion over 2 years--to help combat the opioid epidemic. So instead of  the $500 million a year and the $260 million a year that I talked  about, it would be $3 billion a year and then $3 billion the year  after.   I believe that the evidence-based programs we set out in the  Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act provide a good framework as to how  to spend that money effectively. That is why I am pleased to stand here  today as we introduce the next stage of this--CARA 2.0--to help provide  a framework for how these funds to combat opioid addiction can be spent  wisely. It is a roadmap for Congress to build on CARA's successes since  becoming law.   The bipartisan CARA 2.0 act is being introduced by Sheldon Whitehouse  and me and also by six other colleagues--Senators Shelley Moore Capito,  Amy Klobuchar, Dan Sullivan, Maggie Hassan, Bill Cassidy, and Maria  Cantwell--a bipartisan group of four Republicans and four Democrats who  are passionate about this issue. It authorizes $1 billion a year for  specific evidence-based drug prevention, education, treatment, and  recovery programs.   It is very important to have this $6 billion of funding over the next  couple of years. We need it. But we have to be sure it is spent wisely.  It is not a matter of just throwing money at a problem; it is a matter  of being sure we are effectively addressing the real issues.   As I mentioned earlier, the longer term recovery programs are what  really help those gripped by addiction to overcome this disease. That  is evidence that we have. I have certainly seen a lot of evidence of  that firsthand and countless examples of this, where this longer term  recovery and the support networks are what get people back on track,  back with their families, back to work. We need to expand access to  them to those communities that are in need and give everyone a second  chance of living up to their own God-given potential. That is why, in  this new CARA 2.0, we increase funding for recovery.   In addition to expanding the reach of CARA's evidence-based programs,  this bill puts in place new policy reforms to strengthen the  government's response in so many ways. We take what some would consider  a pretty dramatic step by limiting opioid prescriptions to 3 days for  acute pain. Some will push back against that, but this is based on good  evidence and good research. When someone goes in for a simple  procedure--say, a wisdom tooth extraction--and that young person is  given a bottle of opioids when he or she leaves, too often, that leads  to addiction. I don't want more parents coming up to me and saying: My  kid, when he or she was a teenager, was given these opioids by a doctor  or a dentist, so we thought they were safe. Our child then turned to  heroin because the pills became too expensive and less accessible and  then turned to fentanyl and overdosed and died.   I have had two such parents from Ohio come to me and tell me their  story. You probably know others. We need to ensure that these  prescriptions are limited. For those who have chronic pain and those  who have cancer, it wouldn't apply. And after those 3 days, you can go  back to that doctor and tell them why you need it and explain it.   Experts say that about 80 percent of those who overdose from heroin  started on prescription drugs. I am sure the same is true with regard  to fentanyl. Four out of five heroin addicts in my State of Ohio who  overdosed started on prescription drugs. We do need to deal with this  overprescription problem.   By the way, the evidence is that after that fourth day, fifth day,  sixth day--that is when you get into the bigger risk of becoming  addicted to prescription drugs.   As I mentioned, this epidemic started with an explosion of pain pill  use 15 to 20 years ago. We need to stop the addiction at the source,  and for most people that begins with prescription drugs. By ensuring  that clinicians prescribe the appropriate strength and supply of pain  pills for non-life-threatening injuries, we can keep so many more  people from becoming addicted.   The bill also includes legislation very similar to that which passed  the Senate in 2015 but was dropped out in the House-Senate conference.  It is very simple. It requires doctors and pharmacists to use the  prescription drug monitoring programs to ensure that we are not  overprescribing opioids for certain individuals. That helps us identify  where the problems are and to get people into treatment. It also  requires States to share data with other States to prevent people from  crossing State lines to get prescriptions. One of our big problems in  Ohio is people can cross the State lines in West Virginia, Kentucky, or  other States and get their prescription filled even though it has  already been filled once in Ohio. Across State lines, we need to have  prescription drug monitoring programs that work.   CARA 2.0 is going to help turn the tide of this epidemic. The bill  increases Federal funds for specific evidence-based programs to better  protect vulnerable groups--including infants, young adults, pregnant  and postpartum women, and veterans--as well as resources for community  programs, medication-assisted treatment, and first responders.   As the title indicates, it is a comprehensive solution. Every aspect  of our communities is affected, so every aspect of our communities  needs assistance. The opioid epidemic is one of the most urgent  challenges we face as a country.   By the way, ultimately, this crisis is not going to be solved here in  Washington, DC. It is not going to be solved by legislation we pass  here. We get that. It is going to be solved in our communities. It is  going to be solved in our families. It is going to be solved in our  hearts. But this is a national crisis, and the national government  needs to be a much better partner with State government, local  government, communities, and nonprofits--those who are out there doing  the hard work.   The $6 billion commitment over the next 2 years is a real opportunity  to help turn the tide--not by just throwing more money at the problem  but by being sure that money is well spent on an epidemic that is  taking too many lives and devastating too many communities.   CARA 2.0 will build on our accomplishments and continue to give  communities the resources they need to address this issue. Yes, we have  made some progress around here, and that is good, but we need to do  much more. CARA 2.0 gives us that opportunity. It represents the next  step toward helping our communities address this epidemic and helping  our communities heal.   Thank you.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Mr. Boozman, and Mr. Tester):   S. 2457. A bill to provide a work opportunity tax credit for military  spouses and to provide for flexible spending arrangements for childcare  services for military families; to the Committee on Finance.    Mr. President, I want to address a critical issue today  in Westerville, OH, and, frankly, every community I represent in my  State and communities all over the country. Today, I want to talk about  the opioid epidemic that is gripping our country.   Every State represented in this Chamber has had too many communities  devastated, families broken apart, and lives taken by the opioid  overdoses. The Centers for Disease Control now tells us more than  63,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2016, the last year for  which they have records. It also looks like it was worse in 2017. More  Americans are dying from drug overdoses than the total number of  casualties during the Vietnam war. Every year, more Americans are dying  from drug overdoses than the total number of casualties from the  Vietnam war. Think about that. It is a staggering statistic.   On average, more than 174 Americans died every single day from a drug  overdose in 2016. That is up from 143 Americans in 2015 and 105  Americans in 2010. In other words, it is getting worse, and 2016 was  the deadliest year on record. Initial estimates for 2017 suggest it is  going to be even deadlier, including in my home State of Ohio.   Opioids--prescription drugs, heroin, and synthetic forms of heroin-- are increasingly the reason why. Opioids were involved in about two- thirds of all overdose deaths in 2016. Opioid overdose deaths were five  times higher in 2016 than they were just back in 1999. In the past 17  years, we have seen a fivefold increase in these overdose deaths. It is  a national epidemic.   It has unfolded in three different waves. It started with  prescription drugs, overprescribing of prescription drugs--pain pills.  The pill mills we saw in Southern Ohio and around our State exploded  about 15 to 20 years ago. Next, there were the heroin deaths. Heroin  moved in and spiked as people moved to less expensive and more  accessible alternatives than prescription drugs. Now, I hate to tell  you, there is a new danger and a threat, and it is deadlier than ever.  It is these synthetic opioids--fentanyl, carfentanil--that have moved  into our States, overcoming our law enforcement, and the results have  been deadly.   By the way, it is a crisis that does not discriminate. Opioid  addiction affects everybody, regardless of age, area code, class, or  color. In Ohio, drug addiction and acts committed to support it have  now become the No. 1 cause of crime in our communities--probably the  same in your community.   Employers, of course, are increasingly pointing to the inability to  find workers who can pass a drug test. They can't fill vacant  positions. There is new data out with regard to people who are not  showing up on the unemployment rolls but have given up looking for work  altogether. There are probably 9 million men between 25 and 55 who are  considered to be able-bodied who aren't even looking for work. Some  really troubling statistics out there indicate that maybe as many as  half--one study says 48 percent--of those individuals are taking  opioids on a daily basis.   This is affecting all of us. Every aspect of our communities is  affected. Everybody has a role to play overcoming this epidemic. There  is an urgency coming up with better strategies to turn the tide on  addiction. Although I believe progress has been made recently--and it  is starting to be made in my State and other States--much more needs to  be done and done urgently.   Part of that starts with understanding that addiction is a disease,  and it is treatable. Too often it is not treated like that. The  appropriate response should include much more aggressive prevention and  education, absolutely, and more aggressive law enforcement keeping  deadly fentanyl out of our communities through the STOP Act and other  means, of course, but we also have to get more effective treatment  strategies. We have a couple hundred thousand people in Ohio who are  addicted. We need to get them into treatment, including more effective  detox, medication-assisted treatment, and longer term recovery. We  know, coupled with the right kind of therapy, the right kind of support  and help, people can get into recovery and get back to their families,  get back to work, and get back to being productive citizens.   We also know recovery results are a lot better with that kind of  continuous support. Closing the gaps that occur is key to overcoming  addiction. There is a gap between the crisis response, which is often a  first responder--like the two brave officers I talked about earlier-- finding someone who has overdosed. Often it is firefighters as well  providing Narcan, this miracle drug that reverses the effect of the  overdose. That is incredibly important to saving lives.   Narcan alone is not sufficient. The key is to get those people into  detox and into treatment and longer term recovery. The gaps we have out  there between the crisis response and Narcan,  [[Page S1246]]  then going to detox, then going to treatment, and then going to  recovery are creating a lot of the inability to solve this problem.   I have probably met a couple of thousand addicts or recovering  addicts in the last few years. What they tell me is: I tried treatment,  but it was for 6, 7, 8 weeks, and then there was nothing for me. It  didn't work for me. Then there are people who overdosed, not once or  twice but several times, and they had never been in detox and  treatment.   One young man I spoke to last weekend has been an addict for 7 years.  Finally, his brother convinced him to seek help. The last time he  overdosed, he did go into detox. He did go into treatment, to a  facility where those gaps were closed, where there was no waiting time,  where he was able to get the help, rather than going back to his old  community and his old friends and a situation that was going to lead  him back into more use and more addiction.   The key, again, is to get those who have overdosed into the treatment  they need. Overdose reversal provides a second chance at life. Let's  face it. Some of these people who are overdosing come out of this after  Narcan is administered. They have seen their life flash before their  eyes, and they are ready for something. We have to be ready for them.  Just as the overdose reversal provides a second chance at life, it is  treatment and longer term recovery that provides that second chance to  live addiction-free--again, to get back with your family, get back to  work, and get back to a productive life. It takes a comprehensive  solution because it is a comprehensive problem.   That is what led some of us in this body, including my colleague  Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and me, to introduce the Comprehensive  Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, back in 2015. We developed that  bill over time by relying on experts in the field and those most  affected by addiction.

We had forums focused on  the science of addiction to understand it better, evidence-based  prevention strategies that actually work; treating pregnant women who  are addicted and babies at risk of being born drug-dependent. There is  nothing more heartbreaking than going into the neonatal units in the  hospitals in my home State and seeing these babies who were born  dependent and watching them go through the painful withdrawal process  as infants Every neonatal unit in our country has seen this. If you go  to your own hospital, they will tell you this is an increasing problem.    We had veterans come in, and we had experts come in to help veterans  make that transition because, sadly, the use of opioids among veterans  is also increasing. They sometimes use opioids for injuries, for  accidents, for PTSD, and they become addicted. How do you build support  around those veterans? We also had people come in and talk about longer  term recovery and housing and how, over time, you can get better  results if you provide those kinds of services. Our goal was to  leverage the expertise and perspectives of everyone involved in this  epidemic, to find best practices, and to create an evidence-based  education, treatment, and recovery bill that works.   With strong bipartisan support, we moved from hearings, to a  unanimous committee markup, to Senate passage of this legislation. By  the way, it passed with a vote of 92 to 2. That is not typical around  here, certainly not for something so comprehensive. Yet everybody has  experienced this back home and is desperate to figure out strategies to  help. In July of 2016, President Obama signed CARA into law. It was the  first comprehensive addiction reform in more than 20 years. It was the  first time Congress had ever provided any support or help for this  longer term recovery piece.   The CARA law targets prevention and education resources to prevent  abuse before it even starts--the most effective way. It helps first  responders reverse overdoses to save lives. It devotes resources to  evidence-based treatment and recovery programs. It expands prescription  drug take-back programs to get addictive pain pills off the bathroom  shelves. More than $180 million was authorized to assist communities in  these efforts to combat this epidemic. Frankly, because of this crisis,  the appropriators decided: You know, we need this so badly, we are  actually going to appropriate more than the $180 million. Last year, as  an example, they appropriated $267 million--almost $100 million beyond  our authorization.   Again, I think it is beginning to make a difference. I see it back  home in Ohio. I see some of these strategies beginning to work. It is  going to take some time, and we need to do more. In Ohio, we received  about $4 million. When I say ``we,'' I mean groups, people who are in  the trenches doing the hard work.   We have also made progress in this fight with separate opioid  legislation that was part of the 21st Century Cures legislation. That  legislation was for substance abuse and mental health. Many of us  successfully fought to help secure a 2-year commitment there of $500  million a year, totaling $1 billion. It goes directly to the States.  This money goes to States that are hardest hit, and States are allowed  to decide how to spend that money. The first installment of funding  from that legislation awarded my State of Ohio with $26 million, and we  are using every penny of it.   I was at a facility over the weekend that gave me hope. It is called  the Maryhaven Addiction Stabilization Center, and it is in Columbus,  OH. They talked about the gaps, where people who overdose are provided  Narcan, and then they go back to their community, and what first  responders will tell you is that sometimes in the same week or even on  the same day on some occasions, there is another overdose. The  revolving door continues without any treatment and without any  solution. Maryhaven Stabilization Center is a response to that. They  used the Cures money we talked about, they used some CARA funding from  the county--the county is a part of the broader strategy of where the  CARA money went--and they said: Let's put together an institution where  there is an emergency room that focuses on overdoses.   I have been to other emergency rooms in Columbus, OH, and I have seen  what they do with the people who overdose. They save lives, and that is  fantastic, but frankly these emergency rooms are equipped for  everything, and they have to be--for gunshot wounds, car accidents,  trauma.   This emergency room would be focused specifically on overdoses, which  makes it more cost-effective but also more effective for those  recovering addicts, those addicts who are coming in. But most  importantly, in that same facility, there is a detox center. In that  same facility, there are 50 treatment beds. Whereas in the typical case  when somebody overdoses, they go to the emergency room and end up going  back to their community, back home, back to the gang, back to the  family, in this case, 103 people who have gone through in the last  month--it has only been open a month--80 percent of them have gone into  treatment. I had the opportunity to meet someone who had been through  that process, and we talked about the difference this makes. You  literally walk through the door into treatment, there is strong  encouragement to do it, and it is working.   These are the kinds of things that are going to make a difference in  our communities. It seems to be common sense, but frankly it is not  happening in other places. Programs like these are what are going to  help us overcome addiction and are examples of how Federal funds can be  used more effectively to leverage, in this case, a lot of private  dollars, some State dollars.   Both of these landmark laws--the CARA Act that we talked about and  the Cures Act--are providing increased resources to local communities,  but this problem is not getting better, it is getting worse.   One of the problems is the availability and the low cost of these  highly addictive, even more dangerous drugs coming in. There are  synthetic opioids. Fentanyl is 50 times stronger than heroin on  average. It is coming in through  [[Page S1247]]  the mail. We need to do more to stop it through law enforcement, but we  also need to acknowledge that it has been sprinkled in other drugs and  is creating a lot of these addiction overdoses and higher rates of  death.   The degree of damage this is causing to our communities, our  families, our local budgets, and our criminal justice system requires  us to take a more aggressive stance, to do more to figure this out. We  need to strengthen our resolve. We made progress recently with the  bipartisan budget agreement President Trump signed into law just a few  weeks ago. We included in there an additional amount of funding--$6  billion over 2 years--to help combat the opioid epidemic. So instead of  the $500 million a year and the $260 million a year that I talked  about, it would be $3 billion a year and then $3 billion the year  after.   I believe that the evidence-based programs we set out in the  Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act provide a good framework as to how  to spend that money effectively. That is why I am pleased to stand here  today as we introduce the next stage of this--CARA 2.0--to help provide  a framework for how these funds to combat opioid addiction can be spent  wisely. It is a roadmap for Congress to build on CARA's successes since  becoming law.   The bipartisan CARA 2.0 act is being introduced by Sheldon Whitehouse  and me and also by six other colleagues--Senators Shelley Moore Capito,  Amy Klobuchar, Dan Sullivan, Maggie Hassan, Bill Cassidy, and Maria  Cantwell--a bipartisan group of four Republicans and four Democrats who  are passionate about this issue. It authorizes $1 billion a year for  specific evidence-based drug prevention, education, treatment, and  recovery programs.   It is very important to have this $6 billion of funding over the next  couple of years. We need it. But we have to be sure it is spent wisely.  It is not a matter of just throwing money at a problem; it is a matter  of being sure we are effectively addressing the real issues.   As I mentioned earlier, the longer term recovery programs are what  really help those gripped by addiction to overcome this disease. That  is evidence that we have. I have certainly seen a lot of evidence of  that firsthand and countless examples of this, where this longer term  recovery and the support networks are what get people back on track,  back with their families, back to work. We need to expand access to  them to those communities that are in need and give everyone a second  chance of living up to their own God-given potential. That is why, in  this new CARA 2.0, we increase funding for recovery.   In addition to expanding the reach of CARA's evidence-based programs,  this bill puts in place new policy reforms to strengthen the  government's response in so many ways. We take what some would consider  a pretty dramatic step by limiting opioid prescriptions to 3 days for  acute pain. Some will push back against that, but this is based on good  evidence and good research. When someone goes in for a simple  procedure--say, a wisdom tooth extraction--and that young person is  given a bottle of opioids when he or she leaves, too often, that leads  to addiction. I don't want more parents coming up to me and saying: My  kid, when he or she was a teenager, was given these opioids by a doctor  or a dentist, so we thought they were safe. Our child then turned to  heroin because the pills became too expensive and less accessible and  then turned to fentanyl and overdosed and died.   I have had two such parents from Ohio come to me and tell me their  story. You probably know others. We need to ensure that these  prescriptions are limited. For those who have chronic pain and those  who have cancer, it wouldn't apply. And after those 3 days, you can go  back to that doctor and tell them why you need it and explain it.   Experts say that about 80 percent of those who overdose from heroin  started on prescription drugs. I am sure the same is true with regard  to fentanyl. Four out of five heroin addicts in my State of Ohio who  overdosed started on prescription drugs. We do need to deal with this  overprescription problem.   By the way, the evidence is that after that fourth day, fifth day,  sixth day--that is when you get into the bigger risk of becoming  addicted to prescription drugs.   As I mentioned, this epidemic started with an explosion of pain pill  use 15 to 20 years ago. We need to stop the addiction at the source,  and for most people that begins with prescription drugs. By ensuring  that clinicians prescribe the appropriate strength and supply of pain  pills for non-life-threatening injuries, we can keep so many more  people from becoming addicted.   The bill also includes legislation very similar to that which passed  the Senate in 2015 but was dropped out in the House-Senate conference.  It is very simple. It requires doctors and pharmacists to use the  prescription drug monitoring programs to ensure that we are not  overprescribing opioids for certain individuals. That helps us identify  where the problems are and to get people into treatment. It also  requires States to share data with other States to prevent people from  crossing State lines to get prescriptions. One of our big problems in  Ohio is people can cross the State lines in West Virginia, Kentucky, or  other States and get their prescription filled even though it has  already been filled once in Ohio. Across State lines, we need to have  prescription drug monitoring programs that work.   CARA 2.0 is going to help turn the tide of this epidemic. The bill  increases Federal funds for specific evidence-based programs to better  protect vulnerable groups--including infants, young adults, pregnant  and postpartum women, and veterans--as well as resources for community  programs, medication-assisted treatment, and first responders.   As the title indicates, it is a comprehensive solution. Every aspect  of our communities is affected, so every aspect of our communities  needs assistance. The opioid epidemic is one of the most urgent  challenges we face as a country.   By the way, ultimately, this crisis is not going to be solved here in  Washington, DC. It is not going to be solved by legislation we pass  here. We get that. It is going to be solved in our communities. It is  going to be solved in our families. It is going to be solved in our  hearts. But this is a national crisis, and the national government  needs to be a much better partner with State government, local  government, communities, and nonprofits--those who are out there doing  the hard work.   The $6 billion commitment over the next 2 years is a real opportunity  to help turn the tide--not by just throwing more money at the problem  but by being sure that money is well spent on an epidemic that is  taking too many lives and devastating too many communities.   CARA 2.0 will build on our accomplishments and continue to give  communities the resources they need to address this issue. Yes, we have  made some progress around here, and that is good, but we need to do  much more. CARA 2.0 gives us that opportunity. It represents the next  step toward helping our communities address this epidemic and helping  our communities heal.
