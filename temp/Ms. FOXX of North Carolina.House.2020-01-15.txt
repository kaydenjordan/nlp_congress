 Madam Speaker, life is the most precious  gift from God. From conception until natural death and every moment in  between, we must recognize, celebrate, and bear witness to the sanctity  of life.   Next Friday tens of thousands of people from across the country will  come to Washington and participate in the March for Life. This event  serves as a clear reminder that preserving and protecting the lives of  the most vulnerable is not simply an option, it is a mandate that we  all must uphold.   Madam Speaker, I refuse to stand idly by as the unborn are brazenly  targeted. Amidst the shroud of rancor and divisiveness that hangs over  this House at present, I will continue to fight for their right to  life. They deserve nothing less than unwavering advocates.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1230, the Protecting  Older Workers Against Discrimination Act.   Let me be clear: every worker, including older workers, should be  protected from workplace discrimination at his or her job. This is why  Congress has passed a number of laws to protect Americans of all ages  against discrimination in the workplace. The Civil Rights Act of 1964,  CRA; the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967, ADEA; the  Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Rehab Act; and the Americans with  Disabilities Act of 1990, ADA, makes employment discrimination because  of an individual's race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or  disability unlawful.   Although I appreciate the stated purpose behind H.R. 1230, the rushed  approach taken by committee Democrats and the lack of evidence and data  to prove that this legislation is needed have led to a seriously flawed  bill. Careful examination and scrutiny of any legislative proposal is  necessary to determine whether it is needed and whether it  appropriately and effectively addresses the relevant issues.  Unfortunately, in developing H.R. 1230, the committee majority failed  miserably in this regard.   Committee Democrats chose not to hold a single hearing solely  dedicated to examining either age discrimination or H.R. 1230; rather,  they examined this bill during a hearing that covered multiple topics  and several other pieces of legislation completely unrelated to the  bill.   As we have seen many times during the 116th Congress with other  legislation, H.R. 1230 was rushed through the Education and Labor  Committee without necessary examination, discussion, or consideration.  As a result, we are here debating yet another one-size-fits-all  ``government knows best'' mandate that rewards special interests and  disregards real-world workplace experience and decades of Supreme Court  precedent.   However, the flawed process is far from the only issue with this  legislation. The committee also has no evidence or data indicating this  bill is necessary. In fact, the lone Democrat-invited witness who  testified on H.R. 1230 at a committee hearing covering many bills and  topics admitted the impact of the Supreme Court's 2009 decision in  Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc. is unknown. She also admitted  there is no data indicating workers have been discouraged from filing  age discrimination charges with the EEOC or bringing cases.   The data simply does not indicate workers have been discouraged from  filing discrimination or retaliation charges with the EEOC.  Additionally, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment  numbers for older workers have trended upwards in recent decades.   In 2018 older workers earned 7 percent more than the median for all  workers, a large increase from 20 years ago. For workers age 65 and  older, employment tripled from 1988 to 2018, while employment among  younger workers grew by about one-third. Likewise, over the past 20  years, the number of older workers on full-time work schedules grew  2\1/2\ times faster than the number working part-time.   Rather than considering misguided proposals such as H.R. 1230 which  furthers government intervention, we ought to be empowering all  workers, including older workers, to continue participating and  thriving in America's workforce to build upon, not stifle, these  impressive trends. Unfortunately, H.R. 1230 does the opposite. This  legislation will actually harm older workers while simultaneously  enriching trial lawyers.   H.R. 1230 overturns Supreme Court precedent by allowing a plaintiff  to argue that age was only a motivating, not decisive, factor that led  to an employer's unfavorable employment action, and it allows these  kinds of mixed-motive claims across four completely different  nondiscrimination laws. Moreover, allowing mixed-motive claims in cases  alleging retaliation puts employers in an untenable position of trying  to prove that a legitimate employment decision was not in response to a  prior complaint. The only party who will be paid in nearly all mixed- motive cases is the plaintiffs' attorneys because most employers will  be able to demonstrate that they would have taken the same action in  the absence of the impermissible motivating factor. So the very people  this legislation is intended to help will not receive any monetary  damages under H.R. 1230.   H.R. 1230 will also increase frivolous legal claims against  businessowners. Such undeserving claims will take valuable resources  away from efforts to prevent workplace harassment and discrimination.   Finally, committee Republicans offered amendments to advance  important priorities and practical solutions for older workers and  highlight fundamental flaws in H.R. 1230. Unfortunately, our  commonsense amendments were defeated on a party-line vote in committee.   Mr. Chairman, all workers should be protected from workplace  discrimination, but by rushing today's legislation to the House floor  in an attempt to make up for an abysmal first year in the majority,  Democrats have failed older workers.   I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 1230, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chair, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle contend that  the 2009 Supreme Court decision in Gross v. FBL Financial Services has  weakened age discrimination protections. They also contend the decision  had deterred workers from seeking relief from age bias. Let's look at  the data.   In the 9 years preceding the 2009 Supreme Court decision in Gross,  the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the EEOC, the primary  agency that enforces Federal laws that make it illegal to discriminate,  received an average of 19,320 charges of discrimination per year  relating to age discrimination--19,320.   An EEOC charge is a signed statement asserting employment  discrimination. In the 9 years following Gross, the EEOC received an  average 20,973 charges per year relating to age discrimination, a  slight uptick from the previous 9 years.   There is clearly no evidence workers have been discouraged from  filing age discrimination charges with the EEOC since the 2009 Supreme  Court decision.   We also found that age discrimination charges as a percentage of all  charges filed with the EEOC are approximately the same for the 9 years  before and after the Gross decision, 23.2 percent before and 22.8  percent afterward.   Again, this does not indicate workers are discouraged from filing age  discrimination charges. Congress should make fact-based decisions. In  this case, the facts do not support what H.R. 1230's proponents have  asserted.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chair, older workers are doing quite well in today's modern  economy. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, BLS, employment  for workers age 65 and older tripled from 1988 to 2018, while  employment for younger workers grew by a third. The number of employed  people age 75 and older nearly quadrupled from 461,000 in 1988 to 1.8  million in 2018.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle paint a bleak picture of  these valued workers standing in the workforce, when, in fact,  employment trends for older workers are positive in recent decades.   According to BLS, in 1998, the median weekly earnings of older full- time employees was 77 percent of the median for workers age 16 and up.  In 2018, older workers earned 7 percent more than the median for all  workers.   The labor force participation rate for older workers has been rising  steadily since the late 1990s. Participation rates for younger age  groups either declined or flattened over this period.   Over the past 20 years, the number of older workers on full-time work  schedules grew 2\1/2\ times faster than the number working part time.   As I said, the picture is bright.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chair, I really find it puzzling that our colleagues paint such a  dismal picture of employers. We hear this over and over and over again  from the other side of the aisle.   As my colleague from Michigan said a little while ago, we have 7  million unfilled jobs in the country right now. Every employer I know,  before I came to Congress and since I have been in Congress, cherishes  his or her employees. They don't dismiss employees out of hand just  because of their age. They just don't do that. They value their  employees.                                time  1415    But the other side of the aisle has a real distorted picture of what  happens in the private sector.   I want to say that H.R. 1230 doesn't achieve the goals espoused by  the bill's sponsors, and let me provide much-needed truth in  advertising about this bill.   Under the bill as written, most plaintiffs, even if they are  successful, will not be entitled to receive any monetary damages,  payments, or reinstatement. Here is why.   Generally, a victim of discrimination is entitled to be made whole,  to be put in the position the individual would have been in without the  discrimination. This can include monetary damages, back pay,  reinstatement, attorney's fees, and court costs.   The Supreme Court, in the 2009 Gross case, eliminated the defense  that allows an employer to demonstrate it would have taken the same  employment action regardless of age. H.R. 1230 restores this employer  defense.   An overwhelming majority of employers will be able to make this  demonstration to the court, and when they make that demonstration,  under H.R. 1230, the plaintiff will not be entitled to receive any  monetary damages, payments, or reinstatement, although the plaintiffs'  attorneys will be entitled to fees. So the only party who wins in these  cases are the trial lawyers.   In addition, H.R. 1230 is specifically written to allow plaintiffs to  survive a summary judgment motion that would end their case. But the  plaintiff is in for a surprise later when, after going to court, he or  she receives no monetary damages, and the only one getting paid is his  or her attorney. To add insult to injury, the employee may have to pay  income taxes on the fees that are awarded to his or her attorney.   The bill's sponsors never explain how adding the provisions that  include mixed-motive claims and restoring the employer defense allowing  employers to demonstrate they would have taken the same action  regardless of the impermissible factor, such as age, will benefit  employees. In fact, these provisions will only help trial lawyers.   H.R. 1230's title and provisions are yet another case of false  advertising and empty promises for older workers.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   It is encouraging to see more and more older Americans continue to  make invaluable contributions in the workplace, and committee  Republicans are committed to eliminating discrimination in the  workplace to ensure a productive and competitive workforce.   Unfortunately, H.R. 1230 is an unnecessary and misleading bill that  does not ``protect older workers'' and is yet another case of false  advertising and empty promises.   Committee Democrats failed to allow a proper examination of H.R.  1230, depriving Members of the opportunity to review the legislation  appropriately before it was considered by the committee, and, as a  result, we are left  [[Page H263]]  with the ill-advised bill before us today.   This one-size-fits-all, government-knows-best approach is not the  answer and will significantly benefit trial lawyers at the cost of  older American workers.   I strongly encourage a ``no'' vote on H.R. 1230, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, as my colleague from  California and my colleague from Illinois know, I respect both of them  greatly, and I would have thought that they would have come up with an  amendment that would have helped us understand this issue before we  pass such a bill instead of after we pass it.   As I understand it, this amendment requires the GAO to report on the  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's ability to investigate and  process age discrimination cases after H.R. 1230 unnecessarily reduces  the burden of proof in these cases and nullifies decades of Supreme  Court precedent.   This amendment is not needed. The EEOC already reports on its  workload management and ability to respond to age discrimination  charges in the agency's annual budget request and recurring strategic  plans. We should not mandate that GAO waste resources on an  unnecessary, redundant report.                                time  1430    In addition, assuming this GAO report discovers new information, such  information would be useful before the House votes to expand liability  in four employment statutes. The new law will be in place, and the  horse will have already left the barn by the time we receive the  information.  [[Page H266]]    We all agree, American workers should be protected from  discrimination in the workplace in every form possible. It is already  against the law to discriminate based on a workers' age, as it should  be. Congress has enacted separate nondiscrimination statutes, including  the Age Discrimination in Employment Act because age discrimination  includes issues that are different from other forms of discrimination  addressed in other statutes.   Under H.R. 1230, a plaintiff can argue that age was only a  motivating, not a decisive factor that led to an employer's unfavorable  employment action. Allowing such mixed-motive claims will lead to more  frivolous litigation and upset the careful balance Congress enacted in  the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.   Unfortunately, H.R. 1230 will not help workers. Under the bill, a  plaintiff is very unlikely to receive any monetary damages from a  defendant because most employers would be able to show to the Court  that they would have taken the same employment action, regardless of  the worker's age. The only parties who will win in nearly all cases in  H.R. 1230 are trial lawyers.   Disappointingly, Democrats have chosen to further their pro-trial- lawyer agenda by bringing H.R. 1230 up for consideration, a bill  falsely advertised as a protection for workers. H.R. 1230 is yet  another one-size-fits-all mandate that fails to address the purported  problem, ignores real world experiences, and disregards decades of  Supreme Court decisions.   This amendment does nothing to address the fundamental flaws in H.R.  1230, is redundant with other government reports, and will not provide  the House with timely information. I urge my colleagues to oppose it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I simply will say again  that I think we should vote ``no'' on this amendment. I think it is  redundant and unnecessary.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, as I understand it, this  amendment requires the Chair of the EEOC, the primary agency that  enforces Federal laws that make it illegal to discriminate, to submit  five annual reports to congressional committees on the number of age  discrimination claims brought to the EEOC under this act.   These reports will come after H.R. 1230 unnecessarily reduces the  burden of proof in these cases and nullifies decades of Supreme Court  precedent.   Before discussing my concerns with this amendment, I admit I am  puzzled that it requires a study on how this legislation will affect  future age discrimination claims when evidence is sorely lacking that  there is a need for H.R. 1230 in the first place.   The lone witness who testified on H.R. 1230 before the Committee on  Education and Labor acknowledged that EEOC data has not shown workers  are discouraged from filing age discrimination charges with the EEOC  following the Supreme Court's 2009 decision in Gross v. FBL Financial  Services.                                time  1500    This witness testified that: ``It is difficult to quantify the impact  that the Gross decision has had on the number of older workers who  bring cases and the number of those who win them.''   More information on whether H.R. 1230 is needed would have been  useful, but Democrats were unable to provide it.   With respect to this amendment, I have concerns about the feasibility  of the mandated reports. The amendment requires the EEOC to report each  year for 5 years on charges filed with the EEOC under H.R. 1230.   H.R. 1230 expands liability by allowing mixed-motive claims in cases  involving the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, ADEA, and three  other statutes. However, when a worker files charges with the EEOC, the  worker will likely not indicate whether the charge involves mixed  motives, nor is the EEOC likely to be able to classify charges as mixed  motive or not. The EEOC, therefore, will be unable to determine whether  charges have been filed pursuant to H.R. 1230.   I am very doubtful the EEOC would be able to comply with this  amendment's requirements, and Congress should not include an  unrealistic mandate on an agency.   As I said before, we don't need to be doing studies after the bill is  passed, Mr. Chair. We need to know whether this bill is necessary. We  don't think it is necessary, and doing the studies afterward seems a  little ridiculous.   The amendment does nothing to address the fundamental flaws in H.R.  1230 and places an unrealistic mandate on the EEOC. Therefore, I urge  my colleagues to oppose it.   Since the gentleman has yielded back, I believe, I will yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to  the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, this amendment requires the U.S.  Commission on Civil Rights to produce a report on mixed-motive claims  in age discrimination cases filed by Federal employees against their  Federal agency employers. I have several concerns with this amendment.   First, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights is a small agency that is  not well equipped to undertake such a study. This amendment requires  ``funds appropriated in advance,'' otherwise known as taxpayer dollars,  to be spent to do the report, which means the agency doesn't have the  resources to take on this mandate.   Second, while H.R. 1230 was only referred to the Committee on  Education and Labor, this amendment involves the interests of two other  committees that are not represented in this debate. The Judiciary  Committee has jurisdiction over the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights,  which is tasked with doing the report directed by the amendment, and  the Oversight and Reform Committee has jurisdiction over the employment  relationships between Federal agencies and their employees.   Third, this report will be submitted to Congress no later than 5  years after the bill goes into effect. I am not sure what good a report  published 5 years from now will do for us who are being asked to vote  on H.R. 1230 now.   Fourth, perhaps most importantly, there is a lack of evidence that a  report is needed on age discrimination claims in Federal agencies. The  Committee on Education and Labor received no evidence on this matter.   With H.R. 1230, Democrats have chosen to further their pro-trial  lawyer agenda with legislation that masquerades as a protection for  workers.   H.R. 1230 is yet another one-size-fits-all approach that fails to  address the purported problem, neglects the experience of workers and  employers, and disregards decades of Supreme Court precedent.   This amendment does nothing to address the fundamental flaws in H.R.  1230, and it directs a small agency to conduct a study without a clear  basis of the need for that study.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, this is a solution in search  of a problem.   We all know that it is almost impossible to fire a Federal employee.  In fact, I think the number is less than 1 percent who are fired each  year.   Maybe the reason we haven't had an updated report is because there  hasn't been the need for an updated report. I think, again, this is a  totally unnecessary amendment, and I am totally opposed to it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
