 Madam Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to  thank Chairwoman Waters for promoting access to capital for minority  borrowers.   Since the murder of George Floyd, our Nation has embarked on a true,  broad-based push to defeat institutional racism. America is coming to  realize that racism did not end with emancipation, and it did not end  with civil rights. It is still very much with us all today.   So, as we commit ourselves to Black Lives Matter, we need to also  ensure Black communities matter, Black homeownership matters, Black  wealth matters, and Black businesses matter.   My hometown of south St. Petersburg, Florida, is blessed by a large  and vibrant Black community where, despite their strength, pride,  character, and entrepreneurial spirit, we are still working to overcome  institutional racism. Underinvestment in the community, food deserts,  and redlining exist.   This past weekend, I witnessed the unveiling of the Black Lives  Matter mural in front of the Dr. Carter G. Woodson African American  Museum. It is right near one of my favorite restaurants on the south  side, Chief's Creole Cafe.   While the art moved me beyond words, reality quickly set in. The  owners of Chief's Creole, the Brayboys, were told by their bank that  they couldn't get a PPP loan, not because they didn't qualify, but  because the big banks are leaving behind the smallest businesses,  businesses overrepresented by Black, women, and veteran owners.   If the banks aren't making PPP loans to Black-owned businesses when  they don't have skin in the game, how can we trust them to do the right  thing when it is their own money at risk?   That is why the Community Reinvestment Act is so vitally important.  That is why we need it to work for the communities it was actually  designed to serve.   The OCC got it wrong. Vote ``yes'' to repeal the rule.
