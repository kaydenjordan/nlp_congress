 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from  Florida for bringing us together to bring awareness and to never forget  the folks who still need to be returned home.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to demand the immediate release and safe return  of the remaining hostages in Gaza held by Hamas terrorists.   I am grateful for President Biden's leadership that has led to the  release of hostages. However, many remain captive, including 22-year- old Omer Neutra.   Omer was born in the United States and is the son of Ronen and Orna  and now has spent over 50 days in captivity. He grew up in Long Island,  where he was the regional president of the United Synagogue Youth and  captain of many sports teams.   His friends and family describe Omer as a natural-born leader known  for his compassion, seeing the best in people, and bringing communities  together, a peaceful soul. His kindness and sense of duty led him to  defer his future at Binghamton University to defend his grandparents'  land with the hope of bringing communities together. Putting his future  on hold to serve others, that is Omer.   His drive to lead and to serve now puts him last in line to be  released from captivity. His family, who are with us here this evening,  have been in agony for the past 7 weeks with no word if Omer is even  alive. We will continue to pray for him.   As the mother of an Air Force veteran, I can only imagine their  agony. This is something that no parent, no mother, no father, no  grandparent could ever imagine would happen to their loved one.   I join my colleagues in calling for the immediate release of hostages  held by Hamas, and I urge the administration to continue to do  everything in their power to help free hostages like Omer and ensure  their safe return home.
