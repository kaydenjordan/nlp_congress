 Mr. Speaker, today, I have the privilege of recognizing  one of the millions of hardworking, taxpaying Americans who form the  foundation of our Nation's economy through their employment in small  business--in this particular case, the healthcare industry.   Mrs. Teri Topping of Elkins, West Virginia, has served her patients  exceptionally well throughout her distinguished career as an orthopedic  nurse manager.   As a result, Mrs. Topping is beloved by her community for the  conscientious care that she has provided to those in need. Her  outstanding performance has helped her local hospital, the Davis  Memorial Hospital in Elkins, West Virginia, become one of the best  hospitals for joint care in the entire Mountain State.   It is hardly surprising that Mrs. Topping's patients illustrated  their deep appreciation for her incredible efforts when the Inter- Mountain's 2021 People's Choice Awards opened balloting to the public.  In a heartwarming display, those graced by Mrs. Topping's skill and  dedication voted in droves to grant her this year's award for Best  Nurse. This tremendous honor is well deserved.   I extend my thanks and congratulations to Nurse Topping for her  phenomenal service to the people of West Virginia. I encourage  everyone, especially young nurses, to follow her extraordinary example.   Teri Topping and her husband, Ret Topping, are the mother and father  of three beautiful daughters. They also are grandparents. They have  their first grandchild, fortunately, living nearby them in West  Virginia. I consider them personal friends, and they are pillars of the  community.   Congratulations to Nurse Teri Topping for her Nurse of the Year  award.                            ____________________
