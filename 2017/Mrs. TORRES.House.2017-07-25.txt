 Madam Speaker, I rise to express my disappointment that  Republican leadership has added something as controversial as funding  for the border wall to a critical bill funding our Nation's defense.   There is a reason those who live on the border and know the region  best don't want this wall. They know this wall won't keep us safe, and  they know it won't stop illegal immigration.   Instead of wasting $1.6 billion in taxpayer dollars on a piece of  security theater, DHS should focus its limited resources on its  declared mission, which is ``to safeguard the American people, our  homeland, and our values.'' This wall does none of that.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stop playing politics with our  security and bring a clean bill to the floor.                            ____________________
