 Mr. Chair, I rise today to speak in favor of H.R. 268, the  Emergency Disaster Appropriations bill.   This bill would appropriate funds for programs supporting communities  rebuilding after suffering through numerous natural disasters  throughout 2018. My home State of Hawai'i is in particular need of  assistance. It was hit hard by multiple devasting storms over the  islands and by the sustained eruption of Kilauea Volcano.   Among the impacts on Hawai'i Island by the volcanic eruption were:   716 dwellings destroyed by lava;   Roughly 30 miles of roads covered by lava; and   About 60,000 earthquakes striking the area from April through August,  with the largest a magnitude 6.9 earthquake.   Additionally, Hurricane Lane wreaked havoc across Hawai'i in late  August. Up to 50 inches of rain fell in parts of Hawaii Island and 35  inches on the island of Kaua'i. This caused massive unprecedented  flooding that these communities in Hawaii continue to deal with.   The natural disasters of the past year affected all parts of our  Hawai'i, from major damage throughout O'ahu and the Neighbor Islands to  disruption of our tourism and agriculture industries and beyond. These  sorely needed funds will assist those affected to recover and carry on  with their lives.   The programs and funding in H.R. 268 is a step in the right direction  of how government should be working and responding to the needs of our  constituents.   I urge my colleagues to support this bill to help residents across  the country rebuild and move forward after these devastating natural  disasters.
