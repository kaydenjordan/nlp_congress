 Mr. President, I rise today to discuss two bills  addressing oral health, which I am introducing today. These bills will  provide incentives for dental and dental hygiene graduates to remain as  dental school faculty and make the Children's Health Insurance Program  (CHIP) more affordable for at-risk patients and families. We rely on  dental faculty to train the next generation of oral health providers,  but too often, these educators find themselves pushed to work in  private practice in order to pay off their student loans. The Dental  Loan Repayment Assistance Act will ease some of this financial burden  and allow faculty members to stay where they are needed most by  eliminating certain loan assistance benefits from counting as taxable  income. For low-income children, the CHIP program provides access to  affordable oral health care. The Ensuring Kids Have Access to Medically  Necessary Dental Care Act makes oral  [[Page S893]]  health more affordable by eliminating annual and lifetime dollar limits  for dental care provided under CHIP and requires that CHIP wraparound  dental coverage be the same as dental coverage for CHIP enrollees.   The ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has decreased  access to oral health care. Though patient volumes have improved since  last spring, recent surveys from the American Dental Association (ADA)  indicate that since August many private practices have been operating  at around 80 percent of pre-COVID-19 patient volumes while public  health practices have been operating at around 60 percent of pre-COVID- 19 patient volumes. Patients nationwide have experienced restrictions  throughout the pandemic impeding their ability to visit health  professionals like oral health practitioners, while dental practices  have experienced financial difficulties brought on by the pandemic.  Increases in operating costs to enable safe operations, such as  purchasing personal protective equipment (PPE), have strained dental  practices' financial resources. These added costs, coupled with reduced  patient volume, have led to nearly 60 percent of dental practices  applying or planning to apply for small business loans under the  Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).   As patients and providers alike currently struggle with oral health  access issues, it is critical that the pandemic not compound access to  care inequities. In particular, these challenges are cause for concern  for at-risk populations such as communities of color, who experienced  oral health disparities before the pandemic began. As families and  patients nationwide struggle to access care at this incredibly  challenging time, I am introducing these two bills to ease the  financial burden of dental professionals and promote increased access  to oral health for low-income beneficiaries.   There are nearly 6,500 dental health professional shortage areas  nationwide. These are areas where nearly 60 million Americans,  including 835,000 Marylanders, struggle to find a dental provider, even  with insurance coverage. By 2030, the Department of Health & Human  Services (HHS) projects that the United States will have a national  shortage of 16,000 dentists. We can only hope to solve this problem if  we can recruit and retain enough faculty to train the next generation  of dentists and dental hygienists. Crippling educational debt should  not prevent our Nation from having the oral health care providers it  needs, and the Dental Loan Repayment Assistance Act will help address  that   I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge that  February is National Children's Dental Health Month. Since 1981, this  month has afforded us the opportunity to acknowledge the importance of  children's dental health. We recognize the significant strides we have  made, but we also acknowledge the work that remains to be done. I  invite my colleagues to join me to use this month to renew our  commitment to ensuring that all children in our country have access to  affordable and comprehensive dental services. As former U.S. Surgeon  General C. Everett Koop said, ``there is no health without oral  health.''   Tooth decay--despite being largely preventable--is the single most  common chronic health condition among children and adolescents in the  United States. It is four times more common than early-childhood  obesity, five times more common than asthma, and 20 times more common  than diabetes. Among children in families living below the federal  poverty line, 52 percent have cavities. Children with cavities in their  primary or ``baby'' teeth are three times more likely to develop  cavities in their permanent, adult teeth, and the early loss of baby  teeth can make it harder for permanent teeth to grow in properly. If  tooth decay is untreated, it not only can destroy a child's teeth; it  can have a debilitating impact on his or her health and quality of  life.   Many of my colleagues have heard me speak before about the tragic  loss of Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old Prince George's County resident,  in 2007. Deamonte's death was particularly heartbreaking because it was  entirely preventable. What started out as a toothache turned into an  abscess and then severe brain infection that an $80 extraction could  have prevented. After multiple surgeries and a lengthy hospital stay,  Deamonte tragically passed away--fourteen years ago and just a few  miles from where we gather here in the Senate Chamber.   Even in less tragic cases, tooth and gum pain can impede a child's  healthy development, including the ability to learn, play, and eat  nutritious foods. Recent studies have shown that children with poor  oral health are nearly three times more likely to miss school due to  dental pain, and children reporting recent toothaches are four times  more likely to have a lower grade point average than their peers who do  not suffer from dental pain. Tooth decay and oral health problems also  disproportionately affect children from low-income families and  minority communities. According to the National Institutes of Health,  approximately 80 percent of childhood dental disease is concentrated in  25 percent of the population. These children and families often face  inordinately high barriers to receiving essential oral health care and,  simply put, the consequences can be devastating.   In 2009, Congress reauthorized the Children's Health Insurance  Program with an important addition: a guaranteed pediatric dental  benefit. Today, CHIP provides affordable comprehensive health  coverage--including dental coverage--to more than 9 million children.  Thanks to CHIP, we now have the highest number of children with medical  and dental coverage in history. In addition, in 2010, Congress included  pediatric dental services in the set of essential health benefits  established under the Affordable Care Act. I am pleased to say that our  actions have been working, and our numbers are improving. In 2004,  nearly 23 percent of all children had untreated tooth decay. In 2016,  that number had dropped to 13 percent.   I am very proud that my State of Maryland is recognized as a national  leader in pediatric dental health coverage. In a 2011 Pew Center  report, ``The State of Children's Dental Health,'' Maryland earned an  ``A'' and was the only State to meet seven of eight policy benchmarks  for addressing children's dental health needs. In addition, in the  Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, very qualified health plan now  includes pediatric dental coverage, so families do not have to pay a  separate premium for dental coverage for their children and do not have  a separate deductible or out-of-pocket limit for pediatric dental  services.   I am also proud to say that Maryland Medicaid does not place a  lifetime or annual limit on pregnant women or children receiving dental  benefits under CHIP. This ensures that preventive dental care like  exams and cleanings, fillings, crowns, root canals, and dentures are  not out of reach for low-income Marylanders because of cost  constraints. This benefit is critically important nationwide as  millions of Americans have joined Medicaid in the past year due to the  pandemic.   Not every State has the same benefit structure for CHIP as Maryland,  however, which means that new and existing Medicaid beneficiaries may  have limits on the types of services they can access. As we know from  the terribly tragic example of Deamonte Driver, no family or child  should ever face cost constraint decisions for basic oral health care.  This is why I have introduced the Ensuring Kids Have Access to  Medically Necessary Dental Care Act, to protect access to oral health  care for millions of CHIP and Medicaid enrollees and ensure that the  pandemic does not reverse the progress we have made in oral health.   I urge my colleagues to join the senior Senator from Mississippi (Mr.  Wicker) and me in supporting the Dental Loan Repayment Assistance Act  to help address our critical nationwide shortage of dental healthcare  providers and especially dental faculty. We cannot continue to allow  crippling graduate student debt to deprive the American people of the  teachers and mentors we need to train the next generation of oral  healthcare providers. I similarly urge my colleagues to join the senior  Senator from Michigan (Ms. Stabenow) and me in supporting the Ensuring  Kids Have Access to Medically Necessary Dental Care Act to improve  access to oral health care for low-income beneficiaries. We must learn  from the tragic example of  [[Page S894]]  Deamonte Driver, and ensure that cost constraints are not a barrier to  accessing oral health care.                                  ______                                         By Mr. THUNE (for himself and Ms. Hassan):   S. 468.
