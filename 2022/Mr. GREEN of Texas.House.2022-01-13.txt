 Madam Speaker, and still I rise. Our country has  a history of discriminating against people of color and women when it  comes to the right to vote.   But that all changed in 1965, when President Lyndon Johnson signed  the 1965 Voting Rights Act because, you see, prior to his signing that  act, in 1965, there were four Asian Members of Congress. In 2021, there  were 21 Members.   There were four Latino Members of Congress. In 2021, 54.   There were six Black Members of Congress. In 2021, 60.   And there were 18 women in Congress in 1965, and in 2021, there were  147.   We must restore the Voting Rights Act and protect democracy.
