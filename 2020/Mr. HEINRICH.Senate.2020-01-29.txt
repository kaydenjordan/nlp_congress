 Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk for  the President's counsel.   The CHIEF JUSTICE.         When did the President's counsel first learn that the       Bolton manuscript had been submitted to the White House for       review, and has the President's counsel or anyone else in the       White House attempted in any way to prohibit, block,       disapprove, or discourage John Bolton, or his publisher, from       publishing his book?    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S660, January 29, 2020, third column, the following  appears: The CHIEF JUSTICE. When did the President's Counsel first  learn that the Bolton . . .      The online Record has been corrected to read: The CHIEF JUSTICE.  When did the President's counsel first learn that the Bolton . . .    ========================= END NOTE =========================       Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and thank you,  Senator, for the question.   At some point--I don't know off the top of my head the exact date-- the manuscript had been submitted to the NSC for review. It is with  career NSC staff for review. The White House Counsel's Office was  notified that it was there. The NSC has released a statement explaining  that it has not been reviewed by anyone outside NSC staff.   In terms of the second part of the question, has there been any  attempt to prevent its publication or to block its publication, I think  that there was some misinformation put out into the public realm  earlier today, and I can read for you a relatively short letter that  was sent from NSC staff to Charles Cooper, who is the attorney for Mr.  Bolton, on January 23, which was last week.   It says:         Dear Mr. Cooper: Thank you for speaking yesterday by       telephone. As we discussed, the National Security Council . .       . Access Management directorate has been provided the       manuscript submitted by your client, former Assistant to the       President for National Security Affairs John Bolton, for       prepublication review. Based on our preliminary review, the  [[Page S661]]       manuscript appears to contain significant amounts of       classified information. It also appears that some of this       classified information is at the TOP SECRET level, which is       defined by Executive Order 13526 as information that       ``reasonably could be expected to cause exceptionally grave       harm to the national security'' of the United States if       disclosed without authorization. Under federal law and the       nondisclosure agreements your client signed as a condition       for gaining access to classified information, the manuscript       may not be published or otherwise disclosed without the       deletion of this classified information.        The manuscript remains under review in order for us to do       our best to assist your client by identifying the classified       information within the manuscript, while at the same time       ensuring that publication does not harm the national security       of the United States. We will do our best to work with you to       ensure your client's ability to tell his story in a manner       that protects U.S. national security. We will be in touch       with you shortly with additional, more detailed guidance       regarding next steps that should enable you to revise the       manuscript and move forward as expeditiously as possible.       Sincerely,    And the signature of the career official. So it is with the NSC doing  their prepublication review.   Through his lawyer, Ambassador Bolton was notified that the  manuscript he submitted contains a significant amount of classified  information, including at the top secret level, so that in its current  form it can't be published but that they will be working with him as  expeditiously as possible to provide guidance so it can be revised and  so that he can tell his story.   That is the letter from the NSC that went out. Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Iowa.
