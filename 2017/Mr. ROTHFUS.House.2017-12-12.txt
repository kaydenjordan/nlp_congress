 Mr. Speaker, not only was western Pennsylvania hit by a  flurry of snow this past weekend, but by great pride in high school  football. This past Saturday, my hometown Quaker Valley High School  football team won the State championship trophy in the Pennsylvania  Interscholastic Athletic Association Class 2A division.   With preseason rankings that would merit them as underdogs and a new  coach that stepped in just before the start of the season, the Quakers  tackled their way into history. They defeated their opponents handily  by 17 points.   Mr. Speaker, these State champions are to be commended for their grit  and perseverance. It was an excellent game to cap off an outstanding  season.   Congratulations to Coach Jerry Veshio, the entire coaching staff, and  the players who are excelling in this western Pennsylvania tradition.            Congratulating Pine-Richland High School Football Team     Mr. Speaker, on Saturday, in front of a crowd exceeding  2,000 people at snow-covered Hersheypark Stadium, western  Pennsylvania's Pine-Richland Rams charged victoriously into the history  books.   With a 41-21 victory, the Rams won the State championship in the  Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association Class 6A division.  Indeed, it was an unforgettable win that cemented their exceptional  State championship season.   Congratulations to Coach Eric Kasperowicz, the entire coaching staff,  and the players for excelling in this great western Pennsylvania  tradition.   Well done, Rams. Your dedication and hard work has made Pine-Richland  High School and all of western Pennsylvania proud.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3971, the  Community Institution Mortgage Relief Act, and I thank Representative  Tenney for her hard work on this piece of legislation.   At the Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee, we  often talk about right-sizing regulations. If we want to have a robust  financial system that balances smart regulation and consumer  protections with the need to make capital available to American  consumers, we need to consider targeted opportunities to tailor  requirements to fit the size and nature of the financial institution.  Representative Tenney's legislation does just that.   This Community Institution Mortgage Relief Act directs the CFPB to  exempt creditors with $25 billion or less in assets from certain costly  escrow and impound requirements on loans secured by a first lien on a  consumer's principal dwelling. These requirements are especially  burdensome for community financial institutions. They often force  institutions to pass increased costs on to their consumers. This can  drive business away from small banks and credit unions which are  already suffering from overregulation and other economic challenges. As  a result, in some cases, community financial institutions have exited  the mortgage business altogether. This does not help consumers, and it  further imperils our shrinking number of community banks and credit  unions.   This bill offers a targeted, reasonable fix so that these  institutions can continue to serve their customers. This is smart. It  is reasonable. It is common sense, particularly for those who  understand how overregulation from Washington, D.C., has hurt consumer  choice.   I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.
