 Mr. Speaker, the Democrats are determined to  make inflation worse by continuing their disastrous policies that  caused it in the first place. Do they not understand the concept of  pouring gas on a fire?   Beyond the reckless spending of nearly another trillion dollars on  top of the $30 trillion national debt--there is no climate crisis. It  is a hoax. This is the one crisis that even Democrats couldn't create.   They have been crying about the climate sky falling for 40 years now,  predicting the world would end in 12 years. It is a lie.   We are the cleanest large energy producer in the world, and fossil  fuels are a wonderful thing. They are essential to our economic and  national security.   Worse yet, Democrats want to spend $80 billion to hire 87,000 more  armed IRS agents to terrorize Americans with 1.2 million more audits of  hardworking taxpayers. No one in my district has ever told me that the  one thing we need is more IRS agents.   Mr. Speaker, the American people will vote against this bill on  November 8.
