 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 5, line 15, strike ``120'' and insert ``60''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman  from California (Mr. Bera) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.    Mr. Chair, the Americans with Disabilities Act is landmark  civil rights legislation. Americans with disabilities face real  challenges every day. We should strive to support them every way we  can.   When Congress passes a law, we have an obligation to make sure that  legislation is working and see if improvements can be made. Under the  ADA, business owners are responsible to make sure their business is  fully accessible to those with disabilities. However, in some cases,  business owners are unaware they are in violation of the ADA.   Most Americans can agree: rather than immediately face lawsuits for  violations, business owners should be given time to actually fix what  is wrong. This solution advances our shared goal of improved access for  all members of the community. But in listening to my constituents in  Sacramento County, many are concerned that the timeframe for fixing  these violations was too long. And I agree.   In response, my amendment would cut the time businesses have to fix  violations in half. This means, after the notification period, a  business has 60 days to fix violations, instead of 120 days in the  current bill.  [[Page H1197]]    In some cases, these barriers can and should be immediately  addressed. But in a State like California, which is prone to  earthquakes, construction permits can take time. Small businesses  should be given a reasonable amount of time to make changes and better  serve their customers.   Having heard both sides of this debate, I believe we can, and should,  find a compromise that works for both. I have seen how hard Sacramento  small businesses work and how important they are for growing our  economy and creating good-paying jobs. As a doctor, I have seen  firsthand the challenges of those with disabilities. This amendment  seeks the middle ground and is a commonsense improvement.   Americans with disabilities deserve to live full, healthy lives,  unafraid of barriers that restrict their movement.   Now, let me be clear: if a business does not make the modifications  to obstructions once notified, they should be held accountable and  there should be consequences.   When we work across the aisle, Washington can get things done for the  American people. This amendment is a commonsense fix that makes the  bill better.   Mr. Chair, I urge support of my amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe).    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe).    Mr. Chair, this amendment makes the bill better. I urge my  colleagues to support the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Bera).
