 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1695, the Register of  Copyrights Selection and Accountability Act. As lead Democratic  cosponsor of this bipartisan, bicameral legislation, I am pleased that  this bill passed out of our Judiciary Committee--thanks to Chairman  Goodlatte and many others--by a vote of 27-1.   This legislation represents sound public policy that will strengthen  the copyright system. To begin with, it has evolved directly from the  bipartisan copyright review process that Chairman Goodlatte initiated  way back in 2013. Over the course of that highly deliberative process,  the Judiciary Committee held no less than 20 hearings and heard from  over 100 witnesses on how to update the copyright laws for the 21st  century.   H.R. 1695 is the product of more than 4 years of outreach efforts  with a wide range of interested parties who very much want to see, like  all of us, a Copyright Office that is responsible to all stakeholders  in the copyright ecosystem.   This bill is also the product of bicameral collaboration with our  Senate colleagues, including the Judiciary Committee Chairman Grassley,  the Ranking Member Feinstein, and Senator Leahy. As a result of this  inclusive process, the strong bipartisan consensus emerged from the  Copyright Office that needs to be more accountable to Congress, and  that it should have greater independence.   That Office has a long and distinguished history of serving as an  adviser to Congress on copyright measures, and it is only reasonable  that Congress play a significant role in deciding who leads that  important agency.   H.R. 1695 also elevates the stature of the Register and makes the  position directly accountable to Congress, which will help ensure a  strong and vibrant copyright system that fuels our economy, creates  jobs, and promotes a diverse range of views.   Today, core copyright businesses annually contribute more than $1.2  trillion to our Nation's economy and generate foreign sales of almost  $180 billion. These businesses are also tremendous job creators,  creating more than 5 million workers.   That is why the bill is strongly supported by several unions,  including the AFL-CIO, the Screen Actors Guild, the American Federation  of Television and Radio Artists, as well as the Directors Guild of  America.   H.R. 1695 is also supported by a broad range of other stakeholders,  including: the American Intellectual Property Law Association; the  Intellectual Property Owners Association; and various coalitions of  creators, such as the Content Creators Coalition (c3), CreativeFuture,  and the Copyright Alliance.   Individual creators like Jeff Friday, the founder and CEO of Film  Life and the producer of the American Black Film Festival also are in  strong support of the bill.   Finally, H.R. 1695 will enable Congress to ensure that the Copyright  Office is led by a well-qualified individual by requiring the Register  to be confirmed by the Senate. This individual must be responsive to  the Congress and the public, as well as all the stakeholders in the  copyright community.   In fact, an amendment offered by our distinguished colleague from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), that was accepted during the Judiciary  Committee markup of the bill, will further strengthen the selection  process by establishing an even larger role for Congress in choosing  candidates for the position.   Accordingly, I urge total support for H.R. 1695, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Nadler), a senior member of the committee who has done an  amazing job.    Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Brady), ranking member of the House Administration  Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee.                                time  1415     Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from California (Mr. Cardenas).    Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson), a distinguished member of the  Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 4 minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch).    Mr. Chair, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. Judy Chu).    Mr. Chair, it is my pleasure to yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), one of the most influential  members of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Texas.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Ladies and gentlemen, in closing, I want to point out that it is  particularly appropriate that we are considering H.R. 1695 on World  Intellectual Property Day, a day dedicated to acknowledging the  critical role that intellectual property rights play in encouraging  creativity and innovation.   First established in 2001, World Intellectual Property Day encourages  engagement among governments, private industry, and the public about  the importance of intellectual property promotion and protection.   H.R. 1695 goes a long way in achieving those goals. Accordingly, I  thank my colleagues for their support, and I urge that this bill be  passed.   Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman  from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I just want everyone to know that I rise  in support of this amendment. As we discovered through the Judiciary  Committee's comprehensive copyright review process, the Copyright  Office needs significant upgrades to its technology; so the gentleman's  amendment would ensure that the Register has someone on her staff with  the knowledge and skills necessary to bring the Copyright Office  information technology system into the 21st century.   It is a useful amendment. It will help modernize the Copyright  Office, and I appreciate the gentleman from Florida for offering it. I  urge total support for the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   This amendment makes clear that nothing in the bill would impact the  Library of Congress' mandatory deposit requirement. For over 100 years,  the Library has built its world-class collection, in large part,  through the mandatory deposit requirement.   So H.R. 1695 is a very narrow bill that only changes how the Register  of Copyrights is selected. I think it is helpful, and I congratulate  the gentlewoman for this very creative amendment. I urge my colleagues  to support it.    Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Clay for his discussion  here. I think it is courageous and necessary. To begin with, the  painting's removal by the Architect of the Capitol was an infringement  on the free speech rights of the artist and on the Congressman,  yourself, Mr. Clay, from Missouri.   The First Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that:  ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech. . .  . '' And it is undisputed that the First Amendment's free speech  guarantee extends to artistic expression, including visual arts. This  is true even when such expression may be offensive to many people or to  some people.   While Members who removed the artist's painting may have acted based  on their belief that the artwork's viewpoint was offensive, that belief  cannot trump the free-speech rights of the artist and of you, yourself,  Congressman Clay. I congratulate you for putting this discussion into  the Record.   Mr. Speaker. This past January within the very confines of the  Capitol complex, we witnessed a direct assault against the First  Amendment when several Republican Members of Congress unilaterally  removed a painting by high school senior David Pulphus from the 2016.  Congressional Art Competition display in the Cannon Tunnel.   The painting, sponsored by our colleague--Representative William Lacy  Clay--had been displayed in the Cannon Tunnel along with more than 400  winners of the Art Competition for nearly 7 months without incident or  comment.   And, rather than upholding the artist's right to free expression and  Representative Clay's prerogative to sponsor student artwork from his  district, the Architect of the Capitol capitulated to political  pressure generated by the right-wing media outlets and ratified these  Members' acts of vigilante censorship by having the painting  permanently removed from the Congressional Art Competition display in  the Cannon Tunnel.   This artwork, seemingly inspired by the events in Ferguson, Missouri  in 2014 and other incidents that sparked tension between police and  minority communities, depicts a protest, with two police officers and a  young man facing each other in a standoff, all of three which have  animalistic features.   In the background, protesters look on and a young man of color  appears to be depicted in a crucifixion tableau.   Whatever message one draws from this painting, several things are  quite clear.   To begin with, the painting's removal by the Architect of the Capitol  was an infringement on the free speech rights of Mr. Pulphus and  Representative Clay.   The First Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that  ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.''   And, it is undisputed that the First Amendment's free speech  guarantee extends to artistic expression, including visual art.   This is true even when such expression may be deeply offensive to  many people.   As the Supreme Court recognized in F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation, the  ``fact that society may find speech offensive is not a sufficient  reason for suppressing it. Indeed, if it is the speaker's opinion that  gives offense, that consequence is a reason for according it  constitutional protection.''   While the Members who removed Mr. Pulphus's painting may have acted  based on their belief that the artwork's viewpoint was offensive, that  belief cannot trump the free speech rights of the artist and  Representative Clay.   Nor does it justify the Architect's removal of the painting in  response to pressure from these and other Members who found the  painting offensive.   Once the House established the Congressional Art Competition and  opened the Cannon Tunnel to display artwork sponsored by each  individual Member office, it created a limited public forum.   Having created such a forum, individual House Members and the  Architect cannot then constitutionally discriminate against expression  within that forum based on the viewpoint expressed.   Yet, that is precisely what happened here.   Unfortunately, the painting's removal was part of a broader pattern  of behavior by the Majority to undermine the fundamental right of free  expression in the House.   For instance, in January the House adopted an unconstitutional gag  rule that would allow the imposition of fines of up to $2,500 on a  Member for using an electronic device to record, post, or live-stream  activity on the House floor.   This rule was a thinly-veiled response to the protest undertaken last  year by Democratic Members on the House floor with regard to the  Majority's failure to consider comprehensive gun reform.   The rule is a direct attack against the Minority's right to political  expression and it is clearly intended to stifle the American public's  ability to access that expression.   While it is easy to think that these matters concern only one young  artist or a group of House Members, every American should be deeply  concerned about such kinds of censorship.   Tyranny starts in small ways. Censor a painting here, a poem there.  Ban photos in some instances, videos in others.   When such seemingly minor acts go unanswered, it invites more  oppressive conduct in the future.   Ensuring freedom requires vigilance and a willingness to push back  vigorously against every instance of censorship.   This is why I applaud the federal lawsuit filed by Mr. Pulphus and  Representative Clay seeking to vindicate their free speech rights  though it is shameful that they were forced to go to court at all.   And, while the trial court incorrectly concluded that the First  Amendment does not protect Mr. Pulphus and Representative Clay, I am  confident this conclusion will be overturned on appeal.   All Americans must be free to speak truth to power.   Therefore, it is imperative that we draw a line in the sand now, lest  we encourage further and even more troubling acts of censorship in the  future.
