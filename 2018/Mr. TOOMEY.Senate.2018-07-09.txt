 Mr. President, I wish to recognize the Pennsylvania  American Legion on its 100th anniversary.   The Pennsylvania American Legion was chartered in 1919 by veterans  returning from WWI with the goal of serving local communities, the  State, and the Nation. Since then, the Pennsylvania American Legion has  been a prominent advocate for the rights and entitlements of veterans.  As one of the largest departments in the national organization,  Pennsylvania has nearly 200,000 Legion members promoting the awareness  of veterans' issues throughout the Commonwealth.   Over the last 100 years, the American Legion has played a leading  role in advocating on behalf of veterans in Pennsylvania and across  America. The Legion was vital in the decision to expand the Veterans  Bureau hospitals, a forerunner to the Department of Veterans Affairs,  in 1924. During WWII, the American Legion was instrumental in crafting  the GI Bill, which provides mortgage, medical, employment, disability,  and educational assistance to returning veterans.   In recent years, the Pennsylvania American Legion has continued to  honor its commitment to veterans and the community. It has expanded the  Housing for Homeless Veterans program, which aids homeless and drug- dependent veterans across the Commonwealth. The Legion also provides  numerous academic, athletic, and scouting programs designed to mentor  youth.   The Pennsylvania American Legion is also dedicated to representing  men and women in uniform. It continues to build upon its founding  principles of a strong national defense, caring for veterans, mentoring  youth, and promoting patriotism.   Today I want to recognize the significant contributions the  Pennsylvania American Legion has made to the Commonwealth of  Pennsylvania and its continued service to the nearly 1 million veterans  across the State. I wish the members of the Pennsylvania American  Legion all the best as they celebrate a century of service and the  enduring commitment to support the veterans and servicemen and  servicewomen of Pennsylvania with dignity and honor.   Thank you.                            ____________________
