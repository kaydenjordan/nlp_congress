 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my  bill, H.R. 116, the Investing in Main Street Act of 2019.   I am so pleased that the House is considering this bill at the very  start of this new Congress because small businesses are the backbone of  our economy. They account for two out of every three new jobs and lead  the way in innovation.   The SBA's Small Business Investment Company, or SBIC, program is an  effective tool that helps small businesses get off the ground and  succeed. The program facilitates private investment into early-stage  startup small businesses across the country, and all at no Federal  cost.    Staples, Tesla, FedEx, Apple, Intel, and Costco are just a few  examples of the thousands of small businesses that have successfully  used the Small Business Investment Company program during their early  stages of growth. In fact, in 2016, the SBIC program provided $6  billion in financing to 1,200 small businesses and helped to sustain  over 120,000 jobs. It has afforded America's small businesses an  invaluable opportunity to grow their innovative ideas.   Now, many decades ago, the SBIC program was restricted from taking  more than 5 percent of capital investments from banks due to this  provision in the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. That provision  is still the law. However, since then, banking regulations established  by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency allow these same banks  to invest up to 15 percent of their capital and surplus into SBICs.   I introduced the Investing in Main Street Act with Representative  Ralph Norman of South Carolina to correct this discrepancy. This  bipartisan bill would allow banks and Federal savings associations to  invest up to 15 percent of their holdings to these funds to match  current banking regulations.   This change will strengthen and grow the SBIC program, unleashing  more capital to small businesses, and all at no cost to the taxpayer.  That means more entrepreneurs will be able to access the capital they  need to grow their businesses and hire their workers.   This legislation makes a sensible change to address the number one  need of small firms accessing capital. I, therefore, ask my fellow  Members to support this bill.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules  and pass the bill (H.R. 430) to extend the program of block grants to  States for temporary assistance for needy families and related programs  through June 30, 2019.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 430         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``TANF Extension Act of       2019''.       SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF THE TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY                     FAMILIES PROGRAM AND RELATED PROGRAMS THROUGH                     JUNE 30, 2019.         Activities authorized by part A of title IV and section       1108(b) of the Social Security Act shall continue through       June 30, 2019, in the manner authorized for fiscal year 2018,       and out of any money in the Treasury of the United States not       otherwise appropriated, there are hereby appropriated such       sums as may be necessary for such purpose.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the bill under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 430, the TANF Extension Act of  2019. This bipartisan legislation would extend the Temporary Assistance  for Needy Families program, known as TANF, and the Child Care  Entitlement to States, or CCES, through June 30, 2019.   Due to the stalemate in budget negotiations, TANF and CCES funding  lapsed at the end of 2018. Enacting this legislation will allow the  Department of Health and Human Services to send States, Tribes, and  territories TANF and CCES grants for the second quarter of the fiscal  year, which are now late, and to make on-time payments to States for  the third quarter.   States depend on Federal TANF and childcare funding to help level the  playing field for struggling parents trying to work and support their  families. These grants help pay for important programs such as  childcare, transportation, and job training. Funds are also used to  help cover basic necessities like food, housing, and diapers.   Right now, our failure to pay for what was promised is hurting State  budgets, and pretty soon it will begin to affect family budgets as  well.   CalWORKs, as my home State of California calls its TANF program,  provides help to over 50 percent of poor children in California, which  is over 1 million children, but California has a very small reserve of  unspent Federal TANF funds to cover the Federal lapse in payment.   Our reserve is about the level of Federal funding the State will use  in just over 2 weeks of operating CalWORKs.   California's counties are currently implementing the changes to  CalWORKs that we hope will make it even more effective in stabilizing  families and lifting them out of poverty. Disrupted Federal funding  would make achieving that goal much harder.   We need to do far more to help children and families, and States need  more stability and certainty to operate their programs. This is why the  first bill that was passed in this new Congress to reopen the  government included provisions to extend TANF and childcare for 2  years.   This bill would also have provided Congress with new data on  beneficiary sanctions, employment, and poverty outcomes. Unfortunately,  the Senate has refused to take up that bill, leaving our government in  a partial shutdown and causing Federal funds for TANF and CCES to  lapse, as well as payments to the States.   In the meantime, as the two Chambers continue discussions, this  legislation will allow us to quickly restore payments and ensure that  families who rely on TANF and childcare assistance are not collateral  damage in the Trump shutdown.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), an incredible advocate for  those in need.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues  to support this simple bipartisan legislation to allow us to meet our  commitments to State governments and to families in need across this  country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
