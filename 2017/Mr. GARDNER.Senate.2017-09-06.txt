 Mr. President, I rise today to speak about North Korea,  the most urgent national security challenge for the United States and  our allies in East Asia.   Secretary Mattis has said that North Korea is the most urgent and  dangerous threat to peace and security. Admiral Gortney, previously the  commander of the U.S. Northern Command, stated that the Korean  Peninsula is at its most unstable point since 1953, when the armistice  was signed. North Korea just conducted its sixth nuclear test, its most  powerful to date. An early analysis from experts says:         North Korea has comfortably demonstrated an explosive yield       in the range of at least 100 kilotons with this test.        That would be a considerable improvement from the 30       kiloton yield estimated in its fifth test and ideal for       targeting U.S. cities--a primary objective in North Korea's       pursuit of an ICBM.    Unless drastic and credible measures are taken today, we are fast  heading for a nuclear showdown that could cost millions of lives on the  Korean Peninsula.   Last year alone, North Korea conducted two nuclear tests and a  staggering 24 ballistic missile launches. This year, Pyongyang launched  21 missiles during 14 tests, including the 2 tests of intercontinental  ballistic missiles that are reportedly capable of reaching the U.S.  homeland. During 6 years of rule as the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong  Un has launched more missiles than his father and grandfather combined.  Patience is not an option with the U.S. homeland now in the nuclear  shadow of Kim Jong Un.   Our North Korea policy of decades of bipartisan failure must turn to  one of immediate bipartisan success, with pressure and global  cooperation resulting in the peaceful denuclearization of the regime.   Vice President Pence stated during his visit to South Korea in April:         Since 1992, the United States and our allies have stood       together for a denuclearized Korean Peninsula. We hope to       achieve this objective through peaceable means. But all       options are on the table.    I believe U.S. policy toward North Korea should be straightforward.  The United States will deploy every economic, diplomatic, and, if  necessary, military tool at our disposal to deter Pyongyang and to  protect our allies. But time is not on our side. The international  community needs to finally and fully join together to completely  isolate this dangerous regime.   As a first step, North Korea should immediately be kicked out of the  United Nations and many multilateral institutions from which they  derive the benefits of global recognition. Next, the United Nations  Security Council should enact a new resolution that imposes a full  economic embargo on North Korea that bans all of Pyongyang's economic  activities, including petroleum resources.   These economic tools need to be combined with robust military  deterrent, including a U.S.-led international naval blockade of North  Korea, in order to ensure a full enforcement of United Nations actions.  We must also continue frequent show-of-force exercises by the United  States and our partners in Seoul and Tokyo, enhanced missile defense  activities, and assurances of extended U.S. nuclear deterrence to our  allies. Kim Jong Un must know that any serious provocation will be met  with a full range of U.S. military capabilities.   The road to peacefully stopping Pyongyang undoubtedly lies through  Beijing. I am continuing to call on the administration to block all  entities that do business with North Korea, no matter where they are  based, from conducting any financial activities through the U.S.  financial system. China is the only country that holds the diplomatic  and economic leverage necessary to put the real squeeze on the North  Korean regime. China accounts for 90 percent of North Korea's trade and  virtually all of North Korea's exports. Despite China's rhetoric of  concern, from 2000 to 2015 trade volume between the two nations climbed  more than tenfold, rising from $488 million in 2000 to $5.4 billion in  2015--hardly the sign of cracking down on the rogue regime.   Beijing is the reason the regime acts so boldly and with relatively  few consequences. China must move beyond an articulation of concern and  lay out a transparent path of focused pressure to denuclearize North  Korea. A global power that borders this regime cannot simply throw up  its hands and absolve itself of responsibility. The administration is  right to pursue a policy of ``maximum pressure'' toward North Korea,  and we have a robust toolbox already available to ramp up the sanctions  track--a track that has hardly been utilized to its full extent.   Last Congress I led the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement  [[Page S4973]]  Act, which passed the Senate by a vote of 96 to 0. This legislation was  the first stand-alone legislation in Congress regarding North Korea to  impose mandatory sanctions on the proliferation activities, human  rights violations, and malicious cyber behavior. The following is  according to a recent analysis from the Foundation for the Defense of  Democracies:         North Korea sanctions have more than doubled since the       NKSPEA [North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act]       came into effect on February 18, 2016. Prior to that date,       North Korea ranked eighth, behind Ukraine/Russia, Iran, Iraq,       the Balkans, Syria, Sudan, and Zimbabwe.    Even with the 130-percent sanctions increase after the sanctions bill  passed last Congress, North Korea is today still only the fifth most  sanctioned country by the United States.   So while Congress has clearly moved away from the Obama  administration's inaction to at least some action, the Trump  administration has the opportunity to use these authorities to build  maximum leverage with not only Pyongyang but also with Beijing. I am  encouraged by the actions the administration took in June to finally  designate a Chinese financial institution. But this should just be the  beginning.   The administration, with Congressional support, should now make clear  to any entity doing business with North Korea that they will not be  able to do business with the United States or have access to the U.S.  financial system.   A report released in June by an independent organization known as  C4ADS identified over 5,000 Chinese companies that are doing business  with North Korea today. These Chinese companies are responsible for $7  billion in trade with North Korea. Moreover, the C4ADS report found  that only 10 of these companies--10 of these 5,000 companies-- controlled 30 percent of Chinese exports to North Korea in 2016. One of  these 10 companies controlled nearly 10 percent of total imports from  North Korea. Some of these companies were even found to have satellite  offices in the United States.   Enough is enough.   According to recent disclosures, from 2009 to 2017, North Korea used  Chinese banks to process at least $2.2 billion in transactions through  the U.S. financial system. This should stop now. The United States  should not be afraid of diplomatic confrontation with Beijing for  simply enforcing existing U.S. law. In fact, it should be more afraid  of Congress if it does not.   As for any prospect of engagement, we should continue to let Beijing  know in no uncertain terms that the United States will not negotiate  with Pyongyang at the expense of U.S. national security or that of our  allies.   Instead of working with the United States and the international  community to disarm the madman in Pyongyang, Beijing has called on the  United States and South Korea to halt our military exercises in  exchange for vague promises of North Korea suspending its missile and  nuclear activities. That was a bad deal, and the Trump administration  was right to reject it.   Moreover, before any talks in any format, the United States and our  partners must demand that Pyongyang first meet the denuclearization  commitments it had already agreed to in the past and subsequently chose  to brazenly violate.   President Trump should continue to impress with President Xi that a  denuclearized Korean Peninsula is in both nations' fundamental long- term interests. As ADM Harry Harris, commander of U.S. Pacific Command,  rightly noted recently: ``We want to bring Kim Jong Un to his senses,  not to his knees.''   To achieve this goal, Beijing must be made to choose whether it wants  to work with the United States as a responsible global leader to stop  Pyongyang or bear the consequences of keeping Kim Jong Un in power.   In July, I introduced, with a bipartisan group of cosponsors,  legislation called the North Korean Enablers Accountability Act, S.  1562. This legislation takes the first steps toward imposing an  economic embargo on North Korea, including a ban on any entity that  does business with North Korea or its enablers from using the U.S.  financial system and imposing U.S. sanctions on all those participating  in North Korean labor trafficking abuses. Our legislation specifically  singles out the 10 largest Chinese importers of North Korean goods that  we talked about earlier and sends a very clear message: You can either  do business with this outlaw regime or the world's largest economy.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation in order to finally  put real pressure--maximum pressure--on this regime and its enablers  wherever they are based.   Thank you.   I yield the floor.   The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott). Without objection, it is so  ordered.                            ____________________     Mr. President, today I wish to honor the  centennial celebration of the town of Estes Park, CO. For  [[Page S5002]]  more than a century, Estes Park has been the primary entrance point  into one of our national treasures, Rocky Mountain National Park.  Millions of tourists visit the national park each year, beginning their  journey in Estes Park.   Before the formal incorporation of the town, many Native American  tribes spent time in the region, including the Utes, Arapaho, Shoshone,  and the Comanche. Settlers began to come to the area when President  Abraham Lincoln signed the Homestead Act into law in 1862, encouraging  them to travel West and explore unchartered territory. In 1863, Joel  and Patsy Estes traveled from Kentucky, in search of fertile land to  begin their cattle ranch in Colorado, and they found it in the area  that later bore their name. By 1874, many more settlers had traveled  out West and made Estes Park their home.   The original Coloradans living in Estes Park were resourceful and  ingenious, building schools and homes from the ground up in this  rugged, mountainous terrain. The present Coloradans living in Estes  Park are also resilient--surviving floods and severe damages to the  town and surrounding area in 1982 and again in 2013. Following the  devastation of the flooding in 2013, U.S. Highway 34, one of the main  roads into Estes, was in need of extreme restoration. Through  bipartisan efforts in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the  Senate, the Colorado delegation was able to ensure this highway  received the funding it required to keep the gateway to Rocky Mountain  National Park open.   I would like to congratulate the Town of Estes Park on this exciting  milestone, and I look forward to the town's many more years of  prosperity and success.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there is a joint resolution  at the desk, and I ask for its first reading.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the joint resolution by  title for the first time.   The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:         A joint resolution (S.J.
