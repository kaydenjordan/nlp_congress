 Madam Speaker, I rise today to be a voice for the most  innocent and vulnerable among us. This Sunday many families, including  mine, will celebrate Father's Day.   My faith and my family are the most important parts of my life, and I  couldn't be more grateful for my wife, Chelsea; and our two sons, Guy  and Sam. Being the father of Guy and Sam has only intensified my belief  that we must protect the sanctity of life. Our society cannot leave our  most vulnerable unprotected.   Safeguarding the right to life has always been one of my top  priorities, and I will continue working to protect life at every stage  of development.   As a Christian and a father, I will always fight for the right to  life and for traditional family values. We must protect those who  cannot protect themselves.                            ____________________
