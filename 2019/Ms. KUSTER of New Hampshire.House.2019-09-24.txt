 Mr. Speaker, across the United States  and in my district, we are seeing more and more communities threatened  with PFAS contamination.   The proliferation of toxic PFAS chemicals throughout our environment  is a risk to human health, and as Congress continues to act on this  issue, we must listen to the families and citizens who have had to live  with this contamination.   I cannot imagine the fear of a parent who has learned that their  children's drinking water is contaminated with these harmful chemicals.   That is why earlier this year, I introduced legislation that would  prohibit companies from adjusting PFAS chemicals at the molecular level  to bypass environmental protection at the Environmental Protection  Agency.   Turning off the tap for approving new PFAS chemicals is one step that  Congress can take as we work to fully understand how expansive PFAS  contamination is to our environment and to human health.   Congress must act on this issue, which is why last month, I convened  a PFAS summit with my friend and colleague Chris Pappas to hear from  environmental advocates, impacted families, and community leaders in  New Hampshire who are on the front lines of cleaning up PFAS  contamination.                                time  1215    We also heard from experts who are working on long-term solutions to  cleaning up these ``forever chemicals,'' and I am pleased to bring some  of these ideas back to Washington as a member of the bipartisan  Congressional PFAS Task Force. This group has brought together  Democrats and Republicans from across the country to put the issue of  PFAS contamination front and center in Washington, D.C.   The PFAS Task Force has already been effective in advancing important  provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act to help clean up  contaminated sites and protect servicemembers, their families, and  first responders who have been exposed.   As House and Senate leaders begin conferencing on this bill, it is  critical that the final National Defense Authorization Act includes  PFAS provisions from the House- and Senate-passed bills. Americans have  waited long enough.   Congress has an important opportunity to pass bipartisan legislation  that will protect veterans, current servicemembers, firefighters  occupationally exposed to PFAS, and families in communities impacted by  military PFAS contamination.   This issue is critical to my district and my State, and I will  continue to work across the aisle with anyone who is willing to protect  communities and future generations from PFAS contamination.                            ____________________
