 Mr. President, it is hard to believe that it  has been 5 years since February 14, 2018--the tragic day that the world  witnessed a senseless attack and the loss of 17 innocent lives at  Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, FL.   Today, I again come before the Senate to introduce this resolution to  honor the 17 beautiful lives that were stolen from us that day. I think  of them often. I talk to their families. They were sons and daughters,  parents and partners. Some were educators, athletes, musicians; many of  them, just kids with a life full of promise ahead of them. My heart  breaks knowing they never got the chance to pursue their dreams and  that their families will forever have a piece of their heart missing.   While we can't bring back the lives lost on that tragic day 5 years  ago, I will always work to honor them and do everything in my power to  protect our students and educators and ensure they have a safe  environment to learn and succeed.   As in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of S. Res. 60, which is at the desk.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and that the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with  no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask that the previously  scheduled rollcall vote start immediately.    Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
