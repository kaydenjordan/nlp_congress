 Madam Chair, in September of 2020, as the El Dorado fire  raged through California, Big Bear hotshot firefighter Charlie Morton  said to his loved ones what he always said when there was a fire in the  area: ``I've got to go protect my mountains.''   Hotshots like Morton serve in the Vanguard. They are tasked with  making the area safe for other firefighters to operate. As one hotshot  explained: ``We do not get to turn around and walk away.''   I am hopeful that the Congress today does not turn around and walk  away. This bill is a step to deal with the extraordinary consequences  of climate change that is afflicting our country. Yes, it is the West  of our country, but it is afflicting us all, in particularly, the West.   Firefighter Morton knew his work was extremely dangerous, but he did  it anyway because he believed in the importance of protecting our  Nation's forests and the communities they sustain.   On September 17, 2020, backed into a corner by the encroaching  flames, Morton laid down his life in defense of that conviction. It was  a noble sacrifice but one that no one should have to make.   Much like Morton and his fellow hotshots, America cannot afford to  turn around and walk away from the issue of wildfires.   We must do everything we can to ensure that other brave firefighters  do not have to give the full measure of their devotion as Morton did.  That is why I am proud to serve as co-chair of the Congressional Fire  Service Caucus and to bring this Wildfire Response and Drought  Resiliency Act to the floor today.   Exacerbated, as we know, by the climate crisis, parts of the American  West are experiencing the worst drought in 1,200 years, and this is  fueling deadly and damaging wildfires affecting millions of Americans.   These disasters, Madam Chair, tear through communities and inflict  untold destruction and grief.   This issue doesn't just affect those living in the West, however. As  I have said, the effects of drought and wildfires cost our country tens  of billions of dollars each year. We all pay a price; not the price  that Morton paid, but we pay a price.   To my friends on the other side of the aisle who constantly deride  our attempts to address the climate crisis as too expensive, I would  remind them that the cost of inaction in the form of more frequent,  more severe fires, droughts, and other natural disasters is far  greater.                                time  1245    From time to time, I quote a former Governor of our State, Ted Agnew,  who, in his inaugural address in 1967, on the east front of the capitol  in Annapolis, where I was just entering as a new State senator, said:  ``The cost of failure far exceeds the price of progress.'' That is true  here.   We must not fail, and we must respond. And we must respond  effectively.  [[Page H7429]]    This legislation will help us prevent and fight future wildfires by  making investments to support our firefighting response and to protect  vulnerable communities from wildfire. This bill, for instance, would  establish a minimum basic pay of roughly $20 an hour for wildland  firefighters and ensure they have access to other benefits, such as at  least 1 week of mental health leave.   Additionally, this legislation will authorize a 10-year national  wildfire response plan, building on actions already taken by the Biden  administration, and it will expand the role of Tribes and conservation  corps programs in reducing wildfire risks.   This bill, Madam Chair, also includes $500 million in Federal funding  to programs to preserve key Colorado River reservoirs, an absolutely  critical objective for us all. Tens of millions of Americans rely on  that water.   All of these provisions will help us build on the progress we made  with the fire and drought protection measures, including the bipartisan  infrastructure law, which included close to $17 billion for wildfire  and drought prevention and response.   As an aside, Madam Chair, I am told some say this is an authorizing  bill. It is an authorizing bill. That is regular order. It will be our  responsibility to then appropriate the funds that are necessary to  carry out the objectives of this bill, and I hope we can do so in a  bipartisan way.   I thank House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raul Grijalva for  his leadership and Mr. Neguse, the ranking member, as well, for the  work that they have done. Whether they agree or not, there has been  joint work on this bill. I thank Chairs   David Scott, Frank Pallone,  Eddie Bernice Johnson, and Carolyn Maloney for their committees'  contributions.   We can take meaningful action to address these wildfires and drought  by voting ``yes'' on this bill.   Madam Chair, although Charlie Morton perished in the El Dorado fire,  his courageous efforts and those of his fellow firefighters made it  possible to extinguish, ultimately, the flames. They were able to  protect Morton's mountains, including a pristine meadow now named in  his memory.   They did their part to defend our forest and our communities. Today,  Madam Chair, we must do our part.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time.   This is, of course, an emotional debate. Some have talked about fear,  and they instill fear in the process. As Mr. Nadler has pointed out, no  weapons are taken away.   A number of Members on the other side of the aisle have gotten up and  said this is an unconstitutional bill. Yet, from 1994 to 2004, that  bill was tested in the courts. None of those courts found that  unconstitutional.   In the Heller case, which has been quoted over and over again, a very  simple statement was made by that superliberal Antonin Scalia. He said,  ``Like most rights, the right secured by the Second Amendment is not  unlimited.''   From Blackstone through the 19th century cases, commentators and  courts routinely explained that the right was not a right to keep and  carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever for whatever  purposes.   One indication of that, of course, is that we have a ban on machine  guns in America. Now, one could answer, ``Well, they are not in common  use.'' That is correct, because they are banned.   Mr. Speaker, 67 percent of Americans support an assault weapon ban.  Fifty-three percent, over half, strongly support, and another 14  percent somewhat support, for a total of 67 percent. That is in a poll  by Morning Consult on May 25, 2022.   There was another poll by Pew in September 2021 that said that 63  percent of Americans support it.   In both polls, over 60 percent of Americans, over two-thirds of  Americans, think this action makes sense.   I am sure the Founders, as they were discussing the Second Amendment,  debated whether we ought to have mass rapid-fire weapons covered by the  Second Amendment.   They had no idea. Such weapons certainly didn't exist, and they acted  within the framework of the times in which they lived.   Mr. Speaker, Congress must take action today to protect all Americans  from dangerous and deadly assault weapons. If we do so, we will still  be the country that has the most weapons per capita in the world, more  weapons than people, which you would seem to think, therefore, we ought  to be the least dangerous nation if the premise that the more people  who are armed, the less crime we will have. That seems a little  counterintuitive to me.   The weapons that we are talking about are able to kill large numbers  rapidly, used to kill 6 adults and 20 children at Sandy Hook, used to  kill 61 people in Las Vegas, used to kill 19 students and 2 teachers in  Uvalde, Texas, just a few weeks ago. From Aurora to Orlando, San  Bernardino, Buffalo, El Paso, and Highland Park, they have been  mentioned today, and we ought to mention them on a regular basis to  remind us.   We have watched assault weapons inflict mass destruction in our  communities time and time again. Not only do these weapons claim the  lives of innocent civilians, but they frequently kill members of law  enforcement who have worked to keep their communities safe.   That is why law enforcement largely, not all of them, support this  bill because they see that as one of the greatest dangers to their  lives.   Indeed, one study by the Violence Policy Center found that nearly a  quarter of all the police officers killed in the line of duty between  2016 and 2017 were killed by the same firearms that would be outlawed  under this ban.   Of those police officers killed by assault weapons, almost a quarter  of them were wearing body armor that was nevertheless penetrated by a  bullet. These types of attacks and police killings are not inevitable.   We know there is a better way. We know that because these attacks  became far less common when an overwhelmingly bipartisan coalition-- this was not some Democratic bill. It was a bipartisan bill. I will  speak more to that in just a second.   They came together in 1994 to pass a ban, including 46 House  Republicans. That measure had support from law enforcement and from  both Democratic and Republican Presidents, including Ronald Reagan.   After Republicans were in control of Congress, they allowed that ban  to expire in 2004. Mass shootings tripled.   Today, I am pleased to bring Mr. Cicilline's bill to the floor to  reinstate--reinstate--a bill that has been taken to court already. This  legislation would prohibit the possession, manufacture, sale, and  transfer of semiautomatic assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.  It does not take any of those away from any citizen.   To be clear, we are not undermining the Second Amendment. I am for a  person having the right to have a weapon not only to hunt but in his  home, in his business, to protect himself and his family, and, where  authorized, to carry upon his person--where authorized.    This bill will not lead to confiscation of firearms, notwithstanding  the fear that has been expressed, of weapons that were legally  purchased before its enactment. However, it will set safety  requirements.   Doesn't that make sense? We have safety requirements for our cars.  Doesn't it make sense to have safety requirements for weapons that can  kill?   Additionally, this legislation will provide funding for buyback  programs for those who would prefer to be responsible neighbors and  community members and relinquish their assault weapons voluntarily.   But, of course, our NRA friends have this slippery slope concept that  anything we do, even banning cop killer bullets, goes too far because  of the next step and the next step and the next step.   These commonsense reforms will save the lives of law enforcement  officers and innocent Americans across the country. The Speaker said  that we are going to bring additional community safety legislation to  the floor to support our police because as much as the Republicans  would like to say we Democrats are for defunding the police, it is  absolutely incorrect and false, and they know it.  [[Page H7524]]    Why do they know it? Because we bring appropriation bills to this  floor which fund the police, not only at the national level but at the  State and local level as well, which gives lie to that assertion.   Are there some people who used that comment? Look in the mirror,  folks. There are some people on your side of the aisle who say absurd  things.   There are many people on both sides of the aisle who say, ``Let's  support and protect police.'' This is a way to do it. Today, we have an  opportunity to put votes behind our words and show who is ready to do  exactly that.   Now, I hope my Republican friends and Democratic friends and my  fellow Americans will listen to the quote that I am about to give from  a President that used to be revered on the Republican side of the aisle  but is now not looked at as such a reverential figure.   Ronald Reagan said this: ``Listen to the American public and to the  law enforcement community and support a ban on the further manufacture  of these weapons.''   A moment of silence is not enough. I should have counted how many  moments of silence we have had on this floor this year and lamented the  loss of children and the elderly and everybody in between because of a  weapon that is designed to kill a lot of people quickly.   No more moments of silence. Let's act. Vote ``yes.'' Pass this bill.
