 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  sesquicentennial celebration of the city of Ennis, Texas, founded on  June 8, 1872.   When the railroad was expanded from Houston to St. Louis in 1872,  many of the workers found solace and community in what we know today as  Ennis.   The railroad workers were drawn to the area's bluebonnets and cotton  fields. The appreciation for the natural beauty that surrounds this  Texas town still runs deep in the community.   Through the years, Ennis has grown as an agricultural and industrial  community, attracting residents and visitors, which has earned it the  title of the ``Official Bluebonnet City'' of our State.   Ennis is known for more than just its bluebonnets. It is also the  hosting city of the National Polka Festival. The National Polka  Festival began in 1967 and attracts as many as 50,000 people to the  town.   Ennis is also home to the Texas Motorplex, where national records  have been set and speed milestones have been broken. My family and I  have been able to witness some truly remarkable races there.   It is places like these that make Texas proud. The events and venues  of Ennis, Texas proudly promote Texas values by providing a family  atmosphere and cultivating community outreach.   Strolling along the historic district of Ennis, one can experience  plentiful restaurants and shopping options. When entering any store,  you are kindly greeted. Families and neighbors welcome each other with  open arms. The hospitality of Ennis is seen through these interactions,  and it becomes evident why the citizens of Ennis take so much pride in  their town.   Ennis has encompassed many of our Texan values, including community  and family, and has shown Texas pride for the past 150 years. I am  proud and honored to represent the people of Ennis in the Sixth  Congressional District of Texas. I look forward to what the next 150  years brings to the great city of Ennis.                            ____________________
