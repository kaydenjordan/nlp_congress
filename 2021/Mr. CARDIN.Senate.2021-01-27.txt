 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, today the world comes together to  remember the horrors of the Holocaust. We honor the 6 million Jews and  5 million others--Roma, Afro-Germans, gay men and women, people with  disabilities and more--whom the Nazis brutally murdered. And we stand  in awe and celebration of those brave souls who managed to survive.    It is difficult to comprehend the terror that took place in Europe  between 1939 and 1945, but we carry on an obligation to those who  perished and those who survived to prevent further genocide and mass  atrocities. It is critical that we understand what happened to them so  we can prevent it from ever happening again.   One of the most important things to understand about the Holocaust is  that while a limited group of particularly evil monsters orchestrated  it, they could not have succeeded without the active or tacit support  of millions of average people. Men and women agreed to turn over their  neighbors, patrol the ghettos, drive the cattle cars, guard the death  camps, and line people up to shoot them down. Men and women decided to  avert their gaze and do nothing to stop the atrocities.   I don't believe that all those people were born villains. I think  they were taught by their communities to adopt a level of anti-Semitism  and prejudice that likely would have been recognizable to many of us  today and that the Nazi propaganda masters exploited those feelings.  That terrifies me because it means that the Holocaust was not an  anomaly. It means that under the right conditions, a similar atrocity  could happen again.   The hatred that gave rise to the Holocaust is still very much alive.  The Anti-Defamation League's 2014 Global Index of Anti-Semitism found  that more than 1 billion people--nearly one in eight--around the world  harbor anti-Semitic attitudes. Over 30 percent of those surveyed said  that it was ``probably true'' that Jews had too much control over  financial markets, that Jews think they are better than other people,  that Jews are disloyal to their country, and that people hate Jews  because of the way that Jews behave. Such sentiments often translate  into violence, leading 40 percent of European Jews to report in 2018  that they lived in daily fear of being physically attacked.   Sadly, these trends bear out closer to home too. Jews make up fewer  than 3 percent of the American population, but the majority of reported  religion-based hate crimes targeted Jewish people or institutions. In  2019, the ADL reported that anti-Semitism in America had hit a four- decade high. According to the 2020 survey by the American Jewish  Committee, more than one-third of American Jews say they have been  verbally or physically assaulted during the past 5 years simply because  they are Jewish.   I believe that the world looks to the United States for moral  leadership. When we allow anti-Semitism or racism or other kinds of  intolerance to flourish here, other countries take that as a license to  do the same. Moreover, we need to recognize the nexus between and  networking among those who traffic in hate and conspiracies in the  United States and other like-minded individuals and groups around the  globe. Combating the most dangerous forms of this bigotry will require  understanding the ways in which such groups are reinforcing and  learning from each other.   Unfortunately, the last 4 years--beginning with White nationalists  chanting ``Jews will not replace us'' in Charlottesville and ending  with an insurrectionist wearing a ``Camp Auschwitz'' sweatshirt while  storming the Capitol--are a dark stain on this country's record. By  allowing such vicious hatred to take root and to grow, we fail  ourselves, and we fail the rest of the world.   Now we have the opportunity to redeem ourselves--to become leaders  once more in the fight to eliminate anti-Semitism and all forms of  hatred around the globe. It will not be easy, but it is something we  have to do, and it starts with education.   In the ADL's 2014 global survey, 35 percent of the respondents had  never heard of the Holocaust, and 28 percent of those who did know of  it believed that the number of Jews who died in the Holocaust had been  greatly exaggerated. Meanwhile, the AJC's 2020 Survey of the General  Public found that nearly one-quarter of Americans know nothing or not  much about the Holocaust, and nearly one-half are not even sure what  the term ``anti-Semitism'' means.   How can we hope to learn as a society from the horrors of the  Holocaust if so many people do not know or do not believe that it  happened? How can we root out anti-Semitism if almost half of us don't  understand what it is?   We must educate the next generation on the horrors of the Holocaust  and the dangers of intolerance. I am proud to have led efforts to  provide the full funding of a bill, which our Presiding Officer was  very much involved with, the Never Again Education Act, and I thank our  Presiding Officer for her leadership on this issue. That bill expanded  the reach of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum's world-renowned  education program. This will allow educators across the country from K- 12 through college to access age-appropriate curriculum on the  Holocaust. It will also bolster the Holocaust Memorial Museum's  continued collection and use of survivor testimony so that tomorrow's  leaders will see and hear for themselves why we must never again allow  hatred to thrive.   At the same time, we must fight against Holocaust denial in any form  in any part of the world. As the Organization for Security and Co- operation in Europe's Parliamentary Assembly's Special Representative  on Anti-Semitism, Racism and Intolerance, I am committed to countering  attempts to erase or revise the events of the Holocaust, such as  Poland's efforts to punish those who speak the truth about the 3  million Jews killed there. I am deeply disturbed, for instance, by the  news of a slander lawsuit against two Polish scholars for their  writings on Jews forced into hiding during the Nazi occupation. I am  also appalled that Hungary's Viktor Orban has erected a monument that  tries to whitewash Hungary's wartime role in the murder  [[Page S166]]  of more than a half-million Hungarian Jews. On a day we remember the  liberation of Auschwitz, I remember, too, that one out of every three  Jews who died there were Hungarian.   The Holocaust happened, and it can happen again. It can. We made a  promise to our grandparents and to our grandchildren that it would  never happen again. I believe that we are all each responsible for  keeping that promise. So let us heed the lessons of the past in order  to build a more peaceful, just, and compassionate future for all.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
