 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of  H.R. 2722, the SAFE Act.   Among the many disturbing revelations in the Mueller report, we  learned that Russian intelligence officers successfully infiltrated the  computer network in my home State at the Illinois  [[Page H5217]]  State Board of Elections. They accessed the personal information of  millions of voters and stole thousands of voter records before being  detected.   As far as we know, this breach has not affected the results of any  subsequent elections, but it desperately underscores the need for much  greater election security moving forward.   Now, officials in my home State and others around the country have  worked tirelessly to secure these vulnerabilities over the past 3  years, but without the help of the Federal Government, they can only do  so much. It is past time that we step up and give States the resources  they need to ensure our elections and our voters are safe in the  upcoming election.   Our democratic system depends on the consent of the governed. That is  far too fragile to take lightly. And our constituents' trust and the  independence of our democracy depend on it.   Madam Speaker, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote for  the SAFE Act on the floor today.                                time  0945
