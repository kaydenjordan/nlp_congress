 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the en bloc  amendment.   The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the wealth and economic  inequalities faced by many individuals, families, and small business  owners in our Nation's LMI and communities of color.   As chair of the House Small Business Committee, I fought to ensure  our Nation's women-, LGBTQ-, and minority-owned small businesses had  access to Federal recovery programs and mainstream sources of credit to  the same degree as White-owned firms or those with preestablished  relationships with the big banks. Unfortunately, structural barriers  and historical inequities in our society continue to cause women and  small business owners of color to face ongoing challenges when applying  for affordable and timely credit.   This bill will help break down these structural barriers, root out  discrimination where it exists, and promote entrepreneurship and other  wealth-building opportunities for women, LGBTQ individuals, and people  of color. By addressing these disparities, we can create a more  resilient economy and one that works for everyone.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill.
