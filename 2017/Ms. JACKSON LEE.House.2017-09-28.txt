 Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman  from Illinois for yielding and the gentlewoman from South Dakota for  managing this bill.   The crux of this bill, however, is, again, to support and fund the  multitrillion-dollar tax cuts that have just been introduced, that will  give millions, if not billions, if not trillions, to the richest of  Americans, and that is a very sad commentary.   I oppose the Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons Act because it is not  that. It will terminate essential benefits for poor people, deprive  poor people of due process, and increase mass incarceration.   If the Rules Committee had simply taken my amendment, it would have  remedied these criminal justice defects, which struck the arrest  warrant language because it recklessly targets vulnerable people. This  bill deprives citizens of due process, particularly where many poor  individuals are completely unaware of a pending warrant.   Let me be very clear. What you have is a situation where you may have  a mentally ill individual in a nursing home who now has a warrant that  they are not aware of. You will then cut off their benefits.   What does that do to those families.   Prohibiting SSI payments to individuals with an outstanding warrant  or parole or probation violation without due process is simply  inhumane. This bill would terminate those benefits from very low-income  seniors and people with disabilities. They may not even know that they  have these warrants.   Now, I am a strong supporter of the Maternal, Infant, and Early  Childhood Home Visiting program, and I tell you that the Democrats on  the Ways and Means Committee had an amendment to pay for a 5-year  reauthorization of that program, doubling the funding, by closing a tax  loophole. They were not allowed to even vote on that amendment.   What does that say? This is a conspiracy.   There are 110 organizations that are against this, including the  Alliance for Retired Americans, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational  Fund, Hand in Hand: The Domestic Employers Network, and the Coalition  on Human Needs.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a document with the names of all  of these organizations.                                                     June 26, 2017.        Dear Members of Congress: On behalf of the 119 undersigned       organizations, we urge you to oppose efforts to cut       Supplemental Security Income (SSI) to offset the costs of the       Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program       (MIECHV program).        H.R. 2824 would reauthorize the MIECHV program, which funds       voluntary, evidence-based home visiting programs for at-risk       pregnant women and parents with young children up to       kindergarten entry. The current MIECHV program has       demonstrated beneficial outcomes associated with improved       maternal and child health, including increased access to       screening and early intervention for childhood disabilities.        Unfortunately, H.R. 2824 proposes to pay to extend this       valuable maternal and child home visiting program by cutting       off SSI entirely for certain adolescents and adults with       disabilities, as well as seniors.        H.R. 2824 would revive an old, failed policy that had       catastrophic effects for many people with disabilities and       seniors, employing procedures that did not withstand judicial       scrutiny. The Social Security Act currently prohibits SSI       payments to individuals fleeing from law enforcement to avoid       prosecution or imprisonment. The existing system is already       working to ensure that those who shouldn't be paid SSI       benefits don't receive them.        The proposed cut, Section 201 of H.R. 2824, would bar       payment of SSI benefits to people with an outstanding arrest       warrant for an alleged felony or for an alleged violation of       probation or parole. Most of the warrants in question are       decades old and involve minor infractions, including warrants       routinely issued when a person was unable to pay a fine or       court fee, or a probation supervision fee.        Based on prior experience with SSA's failed former policy,       the people who would be affected are those whose cases are       inactive and whom law enforcement is not pursuing. Many       people are not even aware that a warrant was issued for them,       as warrants are often not served on the individual. A very       high percentage of people who would lose benefits have mental       illness or intellectual disability. Many are unaware of the       violation, may not have understood the terms of parole or       probation, or may have other misunderstandings about their       case.        Warrant databases are notoriously inaccurate. Fourteen       percent of the arrest warrants processed by the federal       Warrant Information Network in 2004 were later dismissed by       the court or returned unexecuted. The state of Alabama, even       with an audit mechanism in place, reported a 13% error rate       in its arrest warrant databases. Due to these kinds of       inaccuracies, some people will have their SSI benefits cut       off as a result of mistaken identity, or paperwork errors,       which can take months or even years to resolve.        When this failed policy was previously implemented by SSA,       many of those who had their benefits cut off had no arrest       warrant outstanding against them. For example, Rosa Martinez,       the lead plaintiff in Martinez v. Astrue was, in 2008, a 52-      year old woman who received notice from SSA that she was       losing her disability benefits because of a 1980 arrest       warrant for a drug offense in Miami, Florida. Ms. Martinez       had never been to Miami, never been arrested, never used       illegal drugs, and is eight inches shorter than the person       described in the warrant. Despite an obvious case of mistaken       identity, Ms. Martinez was left without her sole source of       income. It was only after filing a lawsuit in federal court       that Ms. Martinez was able to have her benefits restored.        Resolving outstanding warrants can be very difficult and       costly. People often must go before a judge in the issuing       jurisdiction, and typically need counsel to assist them in       navigating the process. Often, people have moved in the       intervening years and live far away from the issuing       jurisdiction. The proposed offset would cut off all SSI       income. Losing this income will cause many people to become       homeless and unable to meet their basic needs, much less       resolve a warrant, a case of mistaken identity, or an error       in the warrant database. Completely cutting off SSI benefits       will leave people with little recourse to resolve an       outstanding warrant, representing a step backward in       bipartisan efforts towards criminal justice reform.        By relying on databases of outstanding arrest warrants,       this proposal seeks to punish people by presuming their       guilt, undermining the presumption of innocence that is the       bedrock of our criminal justice system. The existence of an       arrest warrant does not establish that any criminal conduct       has occurred. Many arrests do not result in criminal charges,       or the charges are eventually dismissed. Even if an       individual is charged and subsequently prosecuted, he or she       is presumed innocent until proven guilty.        The proposed offset also will have a disproportionate       impact on people of color. People who are on probation are       particularly susceptible to having an outstanding arrest       warrant. Parolees and probationers are disproportionately       people of color--in 2015, 13% of adults on probation were       Hispanic, and 30% of adults on probation were African       American.        Finally, the proposed offset could harm some of the very       same children who we seek to help through home visiting. In       any given month, approximately 2.7 million children are       estimated to live with a family member who is a senior or       adult with a disability who receives SSI. These children's       families are overwhelmingly the same types of families served       by the MIECHV program: over 3 in 5 families with a SSI       recipient age 18 or older have a total family income below       150% of the federal poverty level, and SSI makes up on       average about 40 percent of these families' income. Cutting       off SSI income would put families at risk of being unable to       keep a roof over their heads, put food on the table, and meet       other basic needs--including children's and mothers' health       needs.        H.R. 2824 would also harm Social Security beneficiaries--      since over half of SSI recipients who are elderly, and almost       one-third of SSI recipients with disabilities, are Social       Security beneficiaries.        In closing, we reiterate that although the MIECHV program       has demonstrated beneficial outcomes, and reauthorization       must be a priority, it should not come at the expense of cuts       to SSI, which would harm seniors, adolescents and adults with       disabilities, and their families, and should not be raided as       a pay-for for an unrelated program. We urge the U.S. Congress       to reject any proposals to offset the costs of reauthorizing       the MIECHV program by cutting SSI benefits.

In addition, let me share with you the reality of  this: Rosa Martinez. Yes, the Social Security Administration was doing  this before, but they had to stop it.   We are now reigniting it because Rosa Martinez filed a suit in 2008.  She was a 52-year-old disabled woman from Redwood, California, who  received a notice from SSA last December that she was losing her only  source of income, her disability benefits, because of a 1980 arrest  warrant for a drug offense in Miami, Florida.   Ms. Martinez has never been to Miami, has never been arrested, and  has never used illegal drugs. In addition, she is 8 inches shorter than  the Rosa Martinez identified in the warrant.   Do you want this random, reckless cutting off of SSI benefits because  of misidentification? Identity theft is rampant. So this bill is  failed, it is a failure, and it has a number of Achilles' heels that  will not work.   The bill will also increase mass incarceration. We should allow law  enforcement to do their job. I don't mind giving them the tools that  they need, but I refuse to allow individuals to suffer because of this  very abusive bill.   I kneeled on this floor because of injustice. This is a bill that is  full of injustices.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2792.   I oppose this bill for the following reasons:   SSI is a needs-based program for people with limited income and  resources.   It will terminate essential benefits of poor people.   It will deprive poor people of due process.   It will increase mass incarceration.   My amendment would have remedied these criminal justice defects in  H.R. 2792, which struck the arrest warrant language because (1) it  recklessly targets vulnerable and innocent individuals; (2) this bill  deprives citizens of due process, particularly where many poor  individuals are completely unaware of any pending warrant, and (3)  there have been cases in which warrants were either decades old or, in  many instances, it was a matter of a mistaken identity.   The bill amends the Social Security Act (SSA) to make certain  revisions that limit payment of benefits to fugitive felons under  titles II, VIII, and XVI of the (SSA), by prohibiting Supplemental  Security Income (SSI) payments to individuals with an outstanding  felony warrant or parole or probation violation.   ``Almost none of the individuals who would be affected by this  provision are actual fugitives from justice and most of the warrants in  question are many years old and involve minor infractions,'' the  Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities said in a letter to Senators  who tried to implement this policy.   This bill is merely a continuation of President Trump's $1.7 trillion  budget cuts of programs designed to help the millions of poor and low- income families that need these programs for survival.   Plainly stated, this bill will terminate SSI benefits of very low- income seniors and people with disabilities, because SSI is granted  based on financial need.   In creating this bill, the sponsors essentially agree that it is best  to incarcerate economically vulnerable people in order to fund the  Maternal Infant Early Childhood Home Visiting program (MIECHV).   As the Center for Law and Social Policy, a nonprofit group focused on  low-income Americans, previously reported of the Trump's budget scheme,  this bill would likewise, create an overall assault on a wide range of  ordinary Americans for the purpose of providing tax cuts to the  wealthiest.   My Democratic colleagues on Ways and Means offered amendments to  fully pay for a 5-year reauthorization of the MIECHV program and  doubling the funding by closing a tax loophole called the ``stretch  IRA''. Republicans however, would not let my colleagues vote on those  amendments.   My amendment and those of my colleagues would have made this bad bill  a lot more palatable.   Instead, the Republicans have chosen, once again, to lock people up,  and do so in a manner that deprives poor people of their sole source of  income, while purporting to safeguard against fugitive felons that are  recipients of these SSI benefits.   This bill is unnecessary because under current law, SSI and Social  Security payments are already prohibited to people fleeing prosecution  or confinement.   Most alarming, this bill will terminate these benefits without any  judicial determination of guilt, and thus, usurping recipients' rights  to due process.   The presumption of ``innocent until proven guilty'' is the  constitutional principle at the bedrock of our criminal justice system.  This principle guarantees that the government cannot deprive citizens  of their rights without due process of the law.   The bill maintains that payments could be immediately restored once  the individual resolves any outstanding issues, a potentially lengthy  and time-consuming process.   Ask the thousands of individuals swept under this broad policy if  that is true. SSA already tried to implement this very ill-advised  policy and it resulted in thousands of court challenges in 2009 forcing  the agency to repay billions of dollars it had withheld from people  deemed fugitives.   For example, Miami resident Joseph Sutrynowics' Social Security  Disability Insurance benefits were halted in 2008 because of a bad  check he'd written to cover groceries in Texas more than a decade  earlier.   Under this policy, SSA agreed to repay $700 million in benefits that  were withheld from 80,000 people whose benefits have been suspended or  denied since January 1, 2007 in the Martinez v. Astrue case. SSA could  also, reportedly, repay close to $1 billion in benefits to 140,000  individuals in the Clark v. Astrue case.   We have already tried this before and failed miserably. Let us not  waste tax payers' money in litigation, while causing poor folks to go  [[Page H7602]]  hungry. As the old adage says: ``don't continue to do the same thing  and expect a different result, that's insanity''.   Past experiences proved that this policy was detrimental then, and it  is so now. It will further exacerbate the epic tragedy of mass  incarceration, and the attendant costs incurred by taxpayers,  particularly in the well-documented higher cost of incarcerating the  elderly and those in poor health.   Even conservative coalitions like Freedom Works, American  Conservative Union Foundation, Generation Opportunity, and Taxpayers  Protection Alliance agreed that mass incarceration is extremely costly  to taxpayers.   In addition to tax dollars in litigation fees, incarceration cost  taxpayers $407.58 per person per day and $148,767 per person per year.   Criminalizing poor individuals, depriving them of their social  security income benefits, and increasing the incarceration rate in this  fashion will NOT solve the fugitive problem this bill purports it will  do.   In fact, this bill will expand existing problems of mass  incarceration by increasing the likelihood for recidivism. Statistics  show that incarceration does not serve as deterrence, nor does it keep  our communities safe.   For the reasons stated above, I oppose this bill.
