 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a great citizen of  Arkansas and one of the pillars of Scouting in our State, John Carman.   John is retiring after 21 years of service as the Scout executive of  Quapaw Area Council. He is the longest serving Scout executive in the  history of the council.   During his tenure, John played an instrumental role in more than  doubling the council's territory, currently encompassing over half the  geography and half the population of the State of Arkansas.   Also, under John's leadership, the Quapaw Area Council, for the first  time ever, was recognized as a Gold Level Council by the Boy Scouts of  America's Journey to Excellence program, the highest award a council  can earn.   After a 35-year career as a professional Scouter, John and Mary plan  to move to Louisville, Kentucky, and spend more time with their  beautiful family.   My congratulations to John on an incredible career and best wishes  for his future endeavors.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Louisiana for the  opportunity to speak tonight in the House Chamber on what the benefits  of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act has had across our country and,  particularly, in the Second Congressional District of Arkansas.   Like for most Americans, Arkansans are actively benefiting from the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, signed by President Trump at the end of last  year, through lower withholding rates--all Americans should check your  check and look at the difference in withholding this year versus last  year--a streamlined tax filing process, a doubled child tax credit, a  doubled standard deduction, Mr. Speaker, that now says 9 out of 10  Arkansans living in the Second District can file a simple tax reform  and not have to go through the paperwork of itemizing, and flexibility  in tax advantaged savings for their kid's education has expanded to K  through elementary and high school. This helps our families, Mr.  Speaker.    I hear numerous examples from Arkansans and business people across  the district of how they are seeing that benefit manifested besides the  changes in their paycheck.   My friend, Mr. Crawford, referenced Entergy Arkansas. All C corps  that are utilities in this country are required to share the benefits  of our tax cut directly with the households in their electricity bills  and their gas bills. Those rates are falling directly proportionate  with the reduction in tax cut rates to the point that Arkansans will  save about $20 a month on a typical electrical bill.   I had a woman write me just a few months ago, right after the law  passed, saying that she checked her check in February on withholding,  and she found that the change in withholding now paid for the health  insurance premium that she is covering for her daughter. These are not  crumbs, as alleged by certain leaders in Washington. These are dollars  our families get to spend in a way that benefits them.   A local banker in my district announced $500 bonuses for each of  their 800 employees, Mr. Speaker. That is  [[Page H4766]]  real money, in addition to the tax savings. That executive at the bank  said:         The tax reform has created the opportunity for us to reward       our employees who are working hard each day to both serve our       customers and enrich relationships in our communities.    Those are not crumbs, Mr. Speaker.   And to make a statement like calling you keeping more of your money  crumbs, that just shows you how out of touch some political leaders are  up here in the beltway.   Real families in Arkansas and across our country want to have more  income for our families. Our businesses want more money to invest  because if we invest money, we grow our companies faster. We add  employees, and we boost the GDP. We are part of that American Dream  that we are witnessing with the lowest unemployment rates in decades,  the highest optimism in decades.   Arkansans and Americans should know that House Republicans are  working hard on policies to complement the tax reform package to help  them keep more of what they earn.   I commend my colleagues for the work that we have done to bring  American families and businesses tax relief. For years to come, there  will be benefits from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. It was a long wait for  30 years to get this change, but it is reminiscent, back in 1963, of  President John Kennedy when he argued for tax cuts, stating the goal is  to achieve the most prosperous, expanding economy. Exactly right,  President Kennedy. House Republicans share that vision, and we have set  a foundation for communities across the country to reap the benefits of  their hard work and their contributions to our Nation.   These reforms are not only good for our families, they are necessary  for faster economic growth.
