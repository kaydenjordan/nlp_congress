 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule. I certainly thank the  gentleman from Washington, my friend, for his kindness. I think he is  one of the best Members we have, but I am going to have to disagree  with Mr. Newhouse today.   When Speaker Ryan assumed the gavel, he told the American people that  he wanted to have ``a process that is more open, more inclusive, more  deliberative, more participatory.''   When the majority took control of both the Congress and the White  House, they again promised to abide by standard congressional  procedure.   But we are here, 3 months from the end of the fiscal year. The  majority hasn't passed a budget resolution, and legislation moves at a  glacial pace. The majority working to rush through a massive minibus  before any individual appropriations bills have been considered on the  floor is also a mistake.   This may sound pedantic, but we do have rules.   Every one of us wants to improve our security, but this bill, I am  afraid, is a little more than smoke and mirrors. The increase in  defense spending under this bill will never see the light of day.   That is because we operate under the Budget Control Act, and that  mandates that any breach of the defense cap, which this bill does, will  trigger an across-the-board sequestration cut of all defense accounts,  making what we do here a useless exercise, I am afraid.   The majority has also inserted an amendment to provide $1.6 billion  President Trump requested to begin construction of the wall on the  U.S.-Mexico border.   This is surely just the beginning of making taxpayers pay for the  entire wall, which experts have estimated could cost as much as $21  billion, with nary a peso from Mexico. If we are investing $1.6 billion  now, I see no reason why they do not plan to go on to reach the $21  billion expenditure.   Let me put that in some perspective: $21 billion could be used to  double the Federal investments in public schools. Think of that. Just  the money to build that wall, it could provide 6 million people with  healthcare under Medicaid, it could buy school lunches for tens of  millions of low-income children. But these investments are not a  priority for this majority.   President Trump's own budget director famously said that it isn't  worth feeding hungry children if the nutrition does not improve their  school performance, and that Meals on Wheels ``sounds great,'' but  doesn't work.   I never thought I would hear either of those things come from the  mouth of a Federal official. The idea that we should not feed hungry  children unless their school work improves, frankly, I am baffled by  that, let me say it that way.   The opposition to the wall is bipartisan. Republican Representative  Hurd from Texas, a former CIA officer, sits on the Homeland Security  Committee and represents the largest border district in the State of  Texas. He testified before the Rules Committee late Monday night  against it, saying, ``having a one-size-fits-all solution to border  security makes no sense.'' Yet this amendment was included without  debating the merits on the floor and without giving Members an up-or- down vote.   Let me explain that a little bit. This amendment is in the bill, but  there will be no vote on it. It has been what we call self-executed to  keep people from being recorded in any way, whether they are for or  against the wall.   The last statistic that I saw from the American public is that 68  percent of them oppose it. They will never know whether their  Representatives did or not. It is a sort of a bait-and-switch idea.   Mr. Speaker, immigration has enriched our country beyond measure. It  is what has allowed our country to shape the world, rather than to fear  it. A wall will lock the United States away from the rest of the world.   The President's new communications director, Anthony Scaramucci,  wrote online: ``Walls don't work. Never have. Never will.''   We don't know whether he is going to change his mind about that or  not, but that is what he said.   One of our famous Republican Presidents that everybody knew and  loved, Ronald Reagan, 30 years ago last month stood in West Berlin and  demanded that another wall be torn down.   I said in the Rules Committee yesterday and I will say it again here  this afternoon: if the President and the majority build this wall, it,  too, will be torn down, not by someone crossing the border or by an  outside force. It will crumble because the public understands in a way  that this President and majority do not, that our Nation does not  barricade itself away from the rest of the world.   We will not build walls to keep us in. What kind of superpower would  we be if we built a wall around the outside of our Nation and crumbled  from the inside because the money we put on the wall kept us from  updating our infrastructure, which is in such terrible shape, and a  shredded social safety net?    None of us want to find that out, but the majority is putting us on  such a path.   Just yesterday, President Trump announced a ban on transgender  servicemembers serving in the military. It appears today that he made  that announcement all on his own and that neither the Joint Chiefs of  Staff or the Pentagon had any idea that he was going to do that.   The announcement came 69 years to the day that President Truman  desegregated our military. Think about that for a minute. Sixty-nine  years ago, on the very day that President Trump said transgender people  couldn't serve, was the day President Truman integrated the military  services.   This is an insult to the approximately 15,000 transgender soldiers  who sacrifice for our country every day. Transgender servicemembers are  being attacked from both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.   Just days ago, Republicans joined Democrats to defeat an amendment  that would bar transgender servicemembers from receiving the necessary  healthcare that they deserve. I will note that these same treatments  would have been available to other servicemembers under this amendment.  Apparently to the majority, it is not about the treatment, but the  person who receives it.   The amendment is especially cruel when you consider that a Pentagon  report has found that gender transition-related treatment costs between  $2.4 and $8.4 million a year. That is the cost of just four of the  President's trips to Mar-a-Lago. Think about that: several millions  dollars to go to Mar-a-Lago would have paid for operations for  transgender persons.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from USA Today that  details this fact.                      [From USA Today, July 26, 2017]      OnPolitics Today: Trump's Mar-a-Lago Trips Cost More Than Trans                           Soldiers' Health Care                              (By Josh Hafner)         President Trump tweeted this morning that the U.S. military       wouldn't allow transgender troops ``in any capacity,'' an       apparent rejection of the military's roughly 6,000 trans       troops and the Obama-era policy that embraced them.        The U.S. ``cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical       costs and disruption that transgender in the military would       entail,'' Trump said.        Except trans troops don't really cost that much, as many       soon pointed out.        A report for the Pentagon last year found that transition-      related care would cost between about $2.4 and $8.4 million       per year--less than 0.14% of the military's medical budget.  [[Page H6483]]         That's roughly the cost of four of Trump's trips to Mar-A-      Lago, GQ noted, even using a conservative estimate of $2       million per trip. And it's way less than the $84 million       spent on Viagra and similar meds by the Department of Defense       in 2014, as others also said.        It was, as Sen. John McCain noted, ``yet another example of       why major policy announcements should not be made via       Twitter.''     I believe all of our soldiers deserve our thanks and  support. They are Americans. They don't need to be attacked based on  who they are.   Lastly, Mr. Speaker, it is also outrageous--and I saved this for the  end--that the majority stripped from the bill Congresswoman Barbara  Lee's bipartisan amendment to repeal the 2001 Authorization for Use of  Military Force.   Until this AUMF, which, as I said, came into law in 2001, is  rescinded and replaced, the President of the United States can usurp  our power and effectively declare war without Congress' concurrence. In  fact, that has already happened.   Matters of war are the most serious issues that Congress considers.  We should not--and we don't want to--shirk those responsibilities. We  want to fulfill our constitutional duties.   Yet Speaker Ryan removed it from the bill without any debate or  single vote because he was afraid of it. He replaced it with weaker  language requiring a 30-day study. After those 30 days, we are not  assured of anything at all, just a study.   That is not the type of open and transparent process that the Speaker  promised. More than just bad process, it silences the debate we need to  have. All Americans, especially our men and women in uniform, deserve  better from us, as they volunteered to save us with their very lives.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Gallego).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Price), the distinguished ranking member of the  Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban  Development.    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Barragan).    Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I  will offer an amendment to the rule to allow the House to consider  Representative Lee's AUMF amendment--authority to use military force.  This will provide all Members the chance for an up-or-down vote, which  we have, thus far, been denied.   Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the  amendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately  prior to the vote on the previous question.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee) to discuss our proposal.    I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, if we hadn't had this last election and the campaign  that went with it, we wouldn't be talking about any wall. One of the  candidates threw out that he would like to have a wall and was sure--he  gave us the absurd notion that somehow Mexico would pay for it.   Not many of us believed that, but I will tell you, now that we have  put in this $1.6 billion for this wall, I will bet you that we are  going to finish it, and we don't know how much it costs--somewhere  between $20 billion and $40 billion for a wall.   Now, if I have heard correctly what my colleagues have said over  there, the walls are working already, the ones they have got. There are  walls there. I  [[Page H6489]]  heard San Diego had three. So the idea, I guess, if one works, we will  build us another one. Oh, my goodness.   This funding bill that we are talking about spending on a wall is  needed to repair roads and bridges and bring down the cost of  education, but the majority refuses to have debate on the AUMF,  something that is critically important, life and death to many people  who live in this country who are presently in the armed services. This  amendment should have been included here.   And I appreciate what my colleague, Mr. Sanford, said. He is  absolutely right. But if we were to get a new AUMF, it would put  Congress back into its duty to declare war. That is something that the  Constitution gave us that we no longer have.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
