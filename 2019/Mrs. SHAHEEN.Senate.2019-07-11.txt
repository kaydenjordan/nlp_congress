 Madam President, on Tuesday, the Fifth Circuit Court of  Appeals heard oral arguments in the Texas v. United States case to  overturn the Affordable Care Act. Unfortunately, although the  Affordable Care Act is currently the law of the land, the Department of  Justice--our Nation's highest law enforcement authority--was not there  to defend the law of the land, the Affordable Care Act. The DOJ was not  there because it had been instructed by this President and this  administration to join the effort to overturn the Affordable Care Act.   Sadly, the stakes of the Texas v. United States litigation are  profound. This year in New Hampshire alone, approximately 90,000  Granite Staters obtained health insurance coverage through the  Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion or through the ACA's health  insurance marketplaces. Across the country, more than 17 million  Medicaid expansion enrollees and 11 million people in the marketplaces'  health plans depend on the Affordable Care Act for their coverage. Yet  the Department of Justice refuses to defend them. It refuses to defend  the law of the land in court.   In this case, if the courts side with the Trump administration and  the Republican attorneys general, millions of these people will return  to the days when they were one cancer diagnosis, one medical  complication, or one car accident away from medical bankruptcy.   The Affordable Care Act's coverage expansion is also our most  powerful tool in combating the opioid epidemic. This is critically  important in New Hampshire as we have the third highest overdose death  rate from opioids of any State in the country. In New Hampshire, more  than 11,000 people receive substance use disorder treatment thanks to  the Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion, and many more Granite  Staters are able to get substance use disorder treatment thanks to  coverage obtained through the ACA's health insurance marketplaces.   Just think. Without the expansion of Medicaid, which is a bipartisan  effort in New Hampshire, and without the ACA's health insurance  marketplaces, we would have thousands of people affected by substance  use disorders who would not be able to get treatment. There is no plan  B if the Affordable Care Act is overturned.   In 2017, a mother named Nansie, from Concord, wrote to my office. I  will not use her last name.   I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Nansie's 2017  letter.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         Dear Senator Shaheen: Thank you for giving me the       opportunity to share my story about ACA. It saved my son's       life.        Benjamin went to Keene State College with the same hopes       and dreams many have when building their American dream.       While there he tried heroin. Addiction overcame him but did       not stop him from graduating. After graduation he suffered a       long road of near death existence. After a couple of episodes       where he had to be revived (fentanyl) he chose recovery. It       was due to Obamacare that we were able to get him insured so       that he could get the proper help he needed and a suboxone       program that assisted him with staying ``clean''. In April it       will be a year for Ben in his recovery. Without Obamacare       this would not have been possible. In early 2016 we had very       long waiting lists for rehab and then the ones with the means       to pay were the first accepted.        I can't find the words to define my gratitude to President       Obama. I believe my son would not be alive today if it were       not for this plan that provided the means he needed to get       the help he needed at the time he needed it. Ben still has a       long road ahead of him but I will see to it that he never       walks it alone.        It is one of my greatest wishes that one day I could shake       President Obama's hand and thank him for providing the tools       that saved my son's life.            Sincerely,                                           Nansie J. Garnham Feeny.     Madam President, in Nansie's letter, she writes:         The ACA saved my son's life. It was due to ObamaCare that       we were able to get him insured so that he could get the       proper help he needed and get into a Suboxone program that       assisted him. Now, if the courts side with the Trump       administration, this critical source for treatment and       recovery could be ripped away.    We don't have enough time for me to go through the whole list of all  of the benefits under the Affordable Care Act that will be lost if the  ACA gets overturned. One of the benefits, though, that would be thrown  out yet is critically important to the people of New Hampshire and  across this country is that of the consumer protections against  skyrocketing prescription drug costs. They will be gone.   A couple of weeks ago, I was at a hearing in the Committee on Aging,  and we had someone from the FDA who was testifying. She talked about  the fact that the major driver in prescription drug costs under  Medicare and Medicaid was the cost of biologic drugs and that what was  bringing down that cost was the pathway for biosimilars to create  alternatives of those biologic drugs for those people. What she failed  to point out was that this provision  [[Page S4790]]  was in the Affordable Care Act and that if the Affordable Care Act gets  struck down, this provision will get struck down. Those increased costs  that we have been seeing of those biologic drugs are going to continue  going up.   What is probably even more important for most people in New Hampshire  is that the Affordable Care Act includes a very important program that  has closed the Medicare Part D coverage gap--what is called the  doughnut hole--for prescription drug coverage. This program has saved  New Hampshire's seniors an average of $1,100 a year in Medicare  prescription drug costs. These savings help to ensure that Granite  Staters who have fixed incomes can pay their utility bills or put food  on the table.   The court's decision could wipe out these critical Medicare savings  for seniors, just as it could wipe out coverage for preexisting  conditions, coverage to keep young people on their parents' insurance  up until they are the age of 26, and coverage for essential health  benefits, which means that mental health care and coverage for  substance use disorder treatment are required by insurance companies to  be covered.   So given what is at stake, at this point I want to offer a unanimous  consent request that the Senate proceed to the consideration of S. Res.  134, which is a resolution I introduced to express a sense of the  Senate that the Department of Justice should reverse its position in  the Texas v. United States case and defend the Affordable Care Act.                    Unanimous Consent Request--S. Res. 134    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that as in legislative  session, the Judiciary Committee be discharged from further  consideration of S. Res. 134 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration; further, that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble  be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table with no intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, I knew my colleague from Wyoming was  going to object. I am disappointed in his objection, and I know he is a  doctor. I believe he cares about his former patients. I believe he  cares about providing healthcare to his constituents, as I believe all  of my colleagues care about that.   That is why I am so puzzled by why there has been a 9-year effort to  try and undermine the Affordable Care Act and the healthcare that it  provides to people in this country.   As I said earlier, there is no followup plan that will provide  coverage for people with preexisting conditions if the Affordable Care  Act is overturned. There is no followup plan that will provide coverage  for people with substance abuse disorders, for mental health coverage.  That is all going to go out the window.   By failing to send a clear message to the Justice Department that  they should defend the Affordable Care Act, we are putting access to  care at risk for millions of Americans across this country.   What we should be doing--and we should have done it as soon as the  effort to overturn the Affordable Care Act was defeated in 2017--is  working together to put in place changes that make the Affordable Care  Act work better. We should be looking for ways to provide coverage to  people that is affordable, that provides quality healthcare, that is  accessible to every American. Instead of that, we have no plan B. There  is no bill that would provide coverage if this administration is  successful in overturning the Affordable Care Act.   I am very disappointed, though not surprised, by the reaction from my  colleague from Wyoming.   I yield the floor.
