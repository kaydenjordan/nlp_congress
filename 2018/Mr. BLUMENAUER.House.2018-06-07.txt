 Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman's courtesy  and her focusing on this.   I agree wholeheartedly; we don't need to go down this path again. The  Republican Congress in 2005 looked at a similar proposal and eliminated  it from a spending bill.   The notion that we have low-yield weapons that are going to enable us  to advance forward from the submarine launch is troubling. This  actually will make the submarine exposed for being able to know where  it is and attack it.   And the ``low-yield'' terminology is a little disquieting. Think of  the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima. These are amazingly destructive.  Being able to have gradations of response and buy into that notion I  think is deeply troubling and is, in fact, destabilizing.   The $1.6 trillion episode that we are embarked upon in terms of  modernization and enhancement could be well spent in other ways,  especially not in this direction.
