 Madam Speaker, I rise today to raise alarm on the tax- and-spending spree Democrats are trying to rush through Congress.   The bill is over 1,500 pages and has not even received a score from  the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. They want to vote on this  bill without knowing how much it will cost taxpayers. What kind of  policies are House Democrats trying to hide from the American people?   Union handouts, billions of dollars to grant amnesty to illegal  immigrants, and over $400 billion in small business tax hikes; these  are just a few of the bad policies tucked away in this bill. This is  not what the American people want.   House Democrats should read their own bill and explain to the  American people exactly how they are spending their tax dollars.                            ____________________
