 Mr. President, for decades, both parties have shared a  desire to invest in our Nation's infrastructure. It is one of the few  issues here in Washington where our two parties can consistently work  together, and it has been years since Congress passed a significant  stand-alone investment. We are hoping to change that this year.   Nearly a month ago--a month ago--a bipartisan group of Senators came  together, along with the White House, and agreed on a framework for a  bipartisan infrastructure bill. So last night I moved to set up a  process for the Senate to consider that bipartisan framework.   On Wednesday, the Senate will take the first procedural vote on a  shell bill, merely a vehicle to get the whole process started. It is  not a final deadline for legislative text. It is not a cynical ploy. It  is not a fish-or-cut-bait moment. It is not an attempt to jam anyone.  It is only a signal that the Senate is ready to get the process  started, something the Senate has routinely done on other bipartisan  bills this year.   All a ``yes'' vote on the motion to proceed means is simply that the  Senate is ready to begin debating a bipartisan infrastructure bill--no  more, no less. We have waited a month. It is time to move forward.   My colleagues have heard me speak for months about making progress on  two different tracks of infrastructure. After the group of Senators  reached a deal with the White House, I endorsed it and I announced I  wanted to put their agreement on the floor of the Senate in July. This  week's vote is an honest attempt to get something done, to get the ball  rolling on the Senate floor.   That is why I am giving the maximum amount of flexibility to our  Senate colleagues who are negotiating this bill. If the bipartisan  group can finalize the text of their agreement by Thursday, I will  offer it as the pending substitute amendment. If, for whatever reason,  the bipartisan group isn't ready with their final text by Thursday, I  will offer an amendment consisting only of the bipartisan  infrastructure bills that have already gone through our Senate  committees and are actually the core of the bipartisan infrastructure  framework. They are the water bill, the highway bill, the rail and  safety bill, and the energy bill.   All of them are bipartisan, all of them have gone through committee,  and all of them received overwhelming Republican votes. Why wouldn't  our Republican colleagues want to move to proceed to debate that bill,  at the very minimum, even if we don't have agreement on the broader  bipartisan bill?   Just to go over the record, the Environment and Public Works  Committee reported the water bill, passed by voice vote, unanimous, in  committee and then 89 to 2 on the Senate floor. The Environment and  Public Works Committee reported the highway bill, passed by 20 to 0.  The Commerce Committee reported the rail and safety bill, passed by 25  to 3. And the Energy and Natural Resources Committee report of the  energy bill passed 13 to 7.   So once again, to repeat, this week's vote is an honest attempt to  get something done, to get the ball rolling on  [[Page S4954]]  the Senate floor, after a month, after the agreement was reached by the  bipartisan group and the White House. That is why I am giving the  maximum amount of flexibility to our Senate colleagues who are  negotiating the bill. If the bipartisan group can finalize their  agreement by Thursday, I will offer it as the pending substitute  amendment, as I mentioned before. I just wanted to repeat that so  people hear it loud and clear.   The bills I mentioned are the lowest common denominator and the most  agreeable starting point, a package of bipartisan bills that nearly all  the Senators have already supported this year, a package of bills that  the bipartisan group is using as the basis of their framework. And once  it is on the floor, we can then debate, amend, and work from there. It  is not the final word.   There will be no doubt many Senators would want to offer additional  items from the bipartisan framework or other issues: from transit to  broadband, to resiliency, and more. And, of course, if the bipartisan  group finalizes their product over the weekend, Senators can offer it  as an amendment at that point, and I will make sure that that amendment  is in order.   Let me repeat. Even if the text of the bipartisan framework isn't  ready by Thursday and we agree to make the package of bipartisan bills  that I mentioned the starting point, Senators can still work on the  bipartisan framework and offer it as an amendment later on.   The bottom line is very simple. If Senators agree to start debate,  there will be many, many opportunities for the bipartisan group to make  their agreement the base of the bill. But if Republican Senators refuse  to start debate, they would be denying the Senate an opportunity to  consider the bipartisan amendment.   And this is not a new process. We have used it regularly here in the  Senate, on the anti-Asian hate crimes bill, the U.S. Innovation and  Competition Act. On both of those, the Senate agreed to start debate,  just to proceed on a base bill, a shell bill. It took several weeks of  amendments before everyone was ready to move forward, eventually and  successfully. Both measures passed with significant bipartisan support.   If we did it there--on the anti-Asian hate bill, on the U.S.  Innovation and Competition Act--we can do it here. There is no reason  we can't do it here with infrastructure.   Look, Senators of good will on both sides want to finish the  bipartisan infrastructure bill before the August recess. That is  certainly my goal. But in order to finish the bill, we first need to  agree to start. Let me repeat that. But in order to finish the bill, we  first need to agree to start. That is the first step.   Let's all agree to start. That is what this week's vote is about, and  I hope my Republican colleagues will join us in beginning debate.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, right now, there is a  fire burning in Oregon the size of New York City. A heat wave recently  rolled through the Pacific Northwest that melted power lines and  cracked roadways in two. Hurricanes and flooding in the East have  battered one community after the other. Earlier this year, a snowstorm  engulfed the typically scorching State of Texas and claimed the lives  of hundreds--hundreds--of people. And, of course, we saw what happened  in Europe with the flooding.   These extreme, once-in-a-century weather events are now commonplace.  The dangers of climate change are here, and they are real. Fighting  climate change will take not only new technologies and new ways of  thinking but something more basic: It will take people--people, lots of  people--working together to fight climate change from the ground up.   This morning, I joined with my Democratic colleagues from the House  and Senate to push a bold, new approach to fighting climate change that  will help create thousands of good-paying jobs in the process: the  Civilian Climate Corps, CCC.   The idea at the core of the Civilian Climate Corps harkens back to  the New Deal, when hundreds of thousands of Americans were put to work  on conservation and infrastructure projects across the country. During  the Great Depression, President Roosevelt needed ways to put Americans  to work and to do it fast, and he found a way to do it while having  those workers do something enormously productive for their country:  building public works and dams and bridges and airfields and flood and  forest-fire prevention.   The Civilian Conservation Corps, as it was called at the time, was a  brilliant idea--a success--that should be harnessed once again, this  time to fight climate change.   The bottom line: We need a CCC for the 21st century. We can put  Americans to work on climate and resiliency projects. We can put  Americans to work on clean energy initiatives across the country. We  can put Americans to work helping poorer and more disconnected  communities handle the challenge of climate change. And we can create  hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs, particularly focusing on the  poorer communities, the communities of color that have been left out in  the past.   The Civilian Climate Corps can be one of the largest employment  projects and one of the largest environmental projects at the same  time. I believe the Senate should work to make this a reality this  year. I believe the CCC, the Civilian Climate Corps, should be one of  the pillars of the American Jobs and Family Plan. As majority leader, I  will ensure that CCC will be included in the upcoming budget  reconciliation package in as big and bold a way as possible.                            ____________________     Mr. President, finally, later, the Senate will pass a  long-overdue fix to the Crime Victims Fund to help Americans stitch  back their lives after falling victim to violent crime.   As hard as it is to suffer the trauma of a violent crime, survivors  almost always face enormous financial hardship in the immediate  aftermath. Just think about healthcare or mental health services for  victims of human trafficking or sexual assault, emergency housing for  victims of serious domestic abuse, legal fees for those who try to  pursue justice for the crime committed against them. Those services can  cost tens of thousands of dollars. So for nearly 35 years, the Justice  Department has operated a Crime Victims Fund that uses money from  Federal convictions and fines to help survivors of violent crime. It is  a simple idea. It has helped thousands and thousands of Americans  during the most challenging moments of their lives.   But today, this popular and effective program is in danger of going  into the red. Compared to 5 years ago, the Crime Victims Fund could  fall to less than one-twentieth--one-twentieth--of its former size by  the end of the next fiscal year. Well, the Senate is not going to  abandon Americans who survived violent crimes. Today, the Senate will  pass legislation to replenish the Crime Victims Fund and set it on a  path toward long-term stability. The Crime Victims Fund has been a  beacon of hope and healing for countless survivors over the decades.  With today's vote, survivors of violent crime can rest assured that it  will continue to be that beacon of hope and healing for decades more to  come.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand there is a bill at the desk  that is due for a second reading.    Mr. President, in order to place the bill on the  calendar under the provisions of rule XIV, I would object to further  proceedings.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
