 Last week marked 34 years since the Tiananmen Square  massacre. Up to 10,000 people were killed by their own government. They  were run over by tanks and shot in the streets--all for demanding  freedom.   The grotesque actions of the Chinese military have been remembered  throughout history. Today, China continues to target, abuse, detain,  and remove opposition.   It is important for the United States to make a statement condemning  the evil regime, the CCP. That is why I am introducing legislation that  would rename the road outside the Chinese Embassy to the Tiananmen  Square memorial boulevard.   America needs to take a strong stand against the human rights  violations of the Chinese Communist Party.   Let us not forget the Americans who have died because of the CCP  virus, the Americans and children who have died because of fentanyl  flooding our streets because of the CCP, the incursion of the balloon  in our airspace, and the recent advances toward a naval destroyer and  our military.    Mr. Speaker, it is time we stand and say no to the CCP.                            ____________________
