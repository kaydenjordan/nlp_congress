 Mr. Speaker, St. Louis and I rise today because the  violence of white supremacy has once again threatened institutions of  Black education across our country, our historically Black colleges and  universities.   Nearly 30 bomb threats have been levied against HBCUs in recent  months. My own alma mater, Harris-Stowe State University in St. Louis,  was subjected to this dangerous violence on the first day of Black  History Month. As one of only two HBCUs in Missouri, Harris-Stowe  should be a safe haven for Black students to learn, to grow, to fully  realize their humanity. As proud Harris-Stowe Hornets, we know the  antidote to white supremacy's violence and intimidation is Black  education and our liberation.   I thank my HBCU sister in service, Congresswoman Adams, for  championing this legislation and bringing the issue of white  supremacist violence against HBCUs for consideration in the U.S. House  of Representatives. I am proud to support this resolution and to join  my colleagues in condemning the bomb threats against HBCUs.
