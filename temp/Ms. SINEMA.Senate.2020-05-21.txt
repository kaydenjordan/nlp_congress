 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the esteemed  career and public service of Mr. Peter M. Hayes, who is retiring as  associate general manager and chief public affairs executive of the  Salt River Project, or SRP.   The Salt River Project is the Nation's third largest public power  utility. It manages an extensive system of dams, reservoirs, wells,  canals, and irrigation laterals, providing water and electricity to  more than 2 million people in metropolitan Phoenix. As associate  general manager and chief public affairs executive, Mr. Hayes has not  only been integral in providing utilities to Arizonans' homes; he has  also supported many issues that have advanced Arizona's economy,  including the expansion of public education, the development of  transportation systems, and the construction of infrastructure  necessary to support Arizona's sports and tourism industries.   Mr. Hayes has also served as chairman of the board of the Sandra Day  O'Connor Institute, the chairman of the Greater Phoenix Chamber of  Commerce, a board member of the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, a trustee  of the Arizona Science Center, a member of the Dean's Advisory Board of  the Arizona State University Barrett Honors College, and a member of  the Arizona Commission on the Arts. He served as an aide to the former  Minority Leader and Arizona Congressman John J. Rhodes, as Deputy  Director of Congressional Liaison for two Secretaries of the Interior,  and as chief of staff to former Arizona Governor Fife Symington. In  both the public and private sectors, Mr. Hayes has been a leader in  public policy. He has wielded his expertise and vision to manage a wide  array of energy and water issues to benefit the State of Arizona.   I thank Mr. Hayes for his years of dedicated work and public service  on behalf of Arizona.                            ____________________
