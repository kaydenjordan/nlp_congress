 Madam Speaker, the conversation we are having here today  does not need to be as divisive and destructive to hardworking  Minnesotans as my Democrat colleagues from Minnesota are pushing.   Today, I stand with the Representative of northern Minnesota, Pete  Stauber, who is advocating for those Minnesotans who will be directly  impacted by this shortsighted effort. We both firmly believe that  American mining is the safest and environmentally responsible way to  help America.   We have been told, time and time again, not this mine, not this  location. Unfortunately, the reality is, our Democrat colleagues want  to ban all mining. They want to eliminate good-paying jobs in  construction--labor--and allow countries like China and Russia to  utilize child labor and environmentally disastrous practices to mine  for the minerals our everyday items need, like cellphones and cars.   This bill doesn't simply attack the future of mining. It impacts  existing mines in operation today. This bill will decimate those jobs.   I urge all of our colleagues to vote against this rule and the bill  in order to preserve mining in our great State. It will also help  secure America's mineral independence and give miners the opportunity  to do what they do best, mine responsibly in our country for the  benefit of all Americans.
