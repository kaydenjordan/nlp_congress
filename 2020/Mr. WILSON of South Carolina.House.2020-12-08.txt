 Mr. Speaker, this Saturday, America  recognizes 150 years since Joseph Rainey, the first African American to  serve in the U.S. House of Representatives, took office.   I am grateful for South Carolinian Joseph Rainey, a Republican, a  champion of civil rights, for breaking  [[Page H6919]]  ground for so many African Americans who followed in his footsteps.   Last week, it was announced there will be a House exhibition  entitled, ``Joseph Rainey: 150 Years.'' The exhibition shares Rainey's  impact from the 1870s through the 1970s. The power and importance of  voting rights are at the heart of the exhibition, which tells this  tumultuous history through objects, images, documents, and words of  African-American Members of Congress who have lived and legislated  through it.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.   Congratulations to President Donald Trump for leading South Carolina  Republicans to the most success in 140 years since Congressman Rainey  began the Republican Party.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Chairman  Adam Smith and Ranking Member Mac Thornberry for their dedicated work  on developing this bipartisan bill appropriately named in honor of  Chairman Mac Thornberry, an American patriot.   As a member of the conference committee, I appreciated the  opportunity to work on another historically important NDAA. Enactment  of this bill will be the 60th consecutive fiscal year that the NDAA has  passed, exhibiting the true bipartisan nature of the process.   I am thankful for the provision of a 3 percent military pay increase,  which represents the first time in a decade the troops have  consecutively received a salary boost of at least 3 percent.   The most recent report contains the Guardian and Reserve Hazard Duty  Pay Equity Act, a bipartisan bill introduced with Representative   Andy  Kim. I was grateful to lead a letter with Representative Kim urging its  inclusion.   I am also especially grateful that my bill, the Body Armor for  Females Modernization Act, was included to ensure that female  servicemembers have the right equipment from day one.   This legislation contains the Small Manufacturer Cybersecurity  Enhancement Act, a bill I introduced with Representative   Jimmy  Panetta, which will allow the Department to partner with manufacturing  extension partnership centers to provide assistance to small  manufacturers.   There is full funding for the Advanced Manufacturing Collaborative at  USC Aiken and PILT and pit production at the Savannah River site.   It also incorporates a bipartisan bill I introduced with  Representative Ed Perlmutter to ensure continued funding for the Office  of the Ombudsman in the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Program.   I appreciate the success of staff member Drew Kennedy and military  fellow Major Jeremy Tillman.   I support this conference report, remembering 9/11 and the murderous  attacks, by defeating the terrorists overseas.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to vote in favor.
