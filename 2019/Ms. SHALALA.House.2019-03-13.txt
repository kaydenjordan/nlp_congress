 Madam Speaker, today, I would like to speak about my  dear friend, Congresswoman Louise Slaughter.   Louise was larger than life, a force of nature, and a trailblazer for  women. She was an embodiment of her district's long history in the  women's rights movement, going back to Susan B. Anthony and Frederick  Douglass.   She would have been so proud to see the record number of women  elected to Congress this year. She would have been an extraordinary  mentor. She was the best retail politician I have ever known.   I have never served in this body with Louise, but, as a Cabinet  member, I knew her well and joined her in her district eight times and  had numerous phone calls over the years.  [[Page H2703]]    She held degrees in microbiology and public health. Her knowledge of  health policy and her political smarts helped her shepherd critical  legislation. Thanks to Louise, we have the Affordable Care Act, the  Violence Against Women Act, and the Genetic Information  Nondiscrimination Act, just to name a few.   She was the first chairwoman of the Rules Committee. I am proud to  now serve on this committee. It is Louise's spirit that keeps all of us  going through long Rules Committee meetings. We should all aspire to be  the person she was, to tirelessly serve our constituents, the  Constitution, and this country.                            ____________________
