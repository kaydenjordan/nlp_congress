 Mr. President, when it comes to what is happening in  Washington, DC, it is often the legislation Congress is considering  that gets the lion's share of attention, but just as significant are  the regulations being put out by the executive branch. Regulations may  not seem as significant as legislation, but they can have just as far- reaching an effect as any law and can radically shift Federal policy.   A look at the Presidential administration's regulations can tell you  a lot about that administration's approach to government. Over the past  2-plus years, the Biden administration has built a record of regulation  that reflects its big-government, big-spending priorities.   Take the President's student loan giveaway, which, if the  ``forgiveness'' portion is not overturned by the Supreme Court, is set  to cost taxpayers nearly $1 trillion over the next decade, or take his  overreaching waters of the United States rule, which, if enforced,  would give the Federal Government sweeping jurisdiction over most water  features on private property, including things like irrigation ditches,  ephemeral streams, and even prairie potholes.   The ability to create regulations gives a Presidential administration  a lot of power--and the ability to do a lot of damage. Checks do exist  on the regulatory power, however, and one check is provided by the  Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to pass resolutions of  disapproval that repeal the regulations in question. The President  still has to sign the resolution for it to go into effect or else two- thirds majorities in both Houses of Congress have to override his veto.  But the tool can be used to check excessive use of regulatory power.   Senate Republicans have been making regular use of the Congressional  Review Act this Congress to attempt to address some egregious Biden  administration regulations. We have passed nine now resolutions of  disapproval of Biden administration actions so far this year, every  single one of which has been bipartisan, which goes to show just how  extreme the actions in question are.   I mentioned Senator Capito's resolution to overturn the  administration's waters of the United States rule. It is an Obama-era  relic resurrected by the Biden Environmental Protection Agency. As I  mentioned, if enforced, this rule would give the Federal Government  jurisdiction over a vast number of water features on private property,  including things like irrigation ditches and even prairie potholes-- something we are very familiar with in my region of the country.   Farmers, ranchers, and other private landowners could see parts of  their land rendered useless for months while the Federal Government  determines what restrictions to impose. Landowners could also be faced  with huge compliance costs, and the value of their land could plummet.   Now, I say ``if enforced.'' While nine Democrats in the House and  five in the Senate joined Republicans to pass a resolution disapproving  the President's WOTUS rule, the President vetoed the resolution. But,  in a victory for landowners, the Supreme Court recently ruled to  clarify and limit the Federal Government's reach under the Clean Water  Act, which effectively overturns the President's WOTUS rule.   I also mentioned the President's student loan giveaway. The  forgiveness part of the President's student loan giveaway would cost  taxpayers somewhere in the neighborhood of half a trillion dollars over  the next decade. The President's legal authority to unilaterally  forgive student debt is extremely dubious, not to mention how unfair it  is to ask the many Americans who worked hard to pay off their loans or  who never pursued college in the first place to take on the burden of  student debt for individuals who took out loans for college or graduate  school and agreed to pay them back.   With Senator Cassidy's leadership in the Senate, Republicans in the  House and Senate, joined by a handful of Democrats, passed a resolution  disapproving of the administration's student loan forgiveness  overreach, but the President vetoed it. However, the President's  forgiveness plan could still be overruled by the Supreme Court, which  is set to release his decision on two student loan forgiveness cases as  soon as this week.   Another terrible Biden administration regulation that Republicans,  through Senator Braun's efforts, have attempted to check is the  President's rule that allows pension plan fiduciaries--those are the  individuals who manage Americans' retirement accounts--to consider so- called environmental, social, and governance factors and not just the  rate of return when investing their customers' money.   In other words, the individuals who manage $11.7 trillion of  Americans' retirement are no longer required to make investment  decisions based solely on maximizing return. It might come as a  surprise to many of the people out there who have funds invested.  Instead, they will now be allowed to opt for a less valuable investment  if they prefer its environmental profile.  [[Page S2082]]    House and Senate Republicans passed a resolution disapproving of this  rule, but unfortunately, again, the President vetoed it, meaning that  for now retirees may have to accept that environmental goals-- environmental goals--can come ahead of giving them a secure retirement.   But it was important to bring attention to this regulation--one of a  number of radical environmental regulations from the Biden  administration.   Senate Republicans have also passed resolutions from Senators Mullin  and Marshall addressing Biden administration overuse of the Endangered  Species Act; a resolution from Senator Lummis addressing the  administration's expansive new definition of ``critical habitat,''  which could have major negative consequences for landowners and  businesses; a resolution from Senator Fischer disapproving of an EPA  rule on truck emissions that could drive some smaller trucking  companies out of business entirely--and more. We have more resolutions  of disapproval in the pipeline.   While, unfortunately, President Biden has predictably vetoed attempts  to check his administration's aggressive use of Federal power, we have  had some successes.   When Senator Capito announced her intention to challenge a Federal  Highway Administration memo discouraging States from pursuing highway  expansion projects and prioritizing funding for projects that reduce  emissions, the Federal Highway Administration withdrew the memo and  issued a revised version without the problematic language, which was a  win for infrastructure investments in rural areas.   As I mentioned, while the President vetoed the resolution  disapproving of his overreaching waters of the United States water  rule, the Supreme Court's recent decision effectively overturning this  regulation is a win for farmers, for ranchers, and for other  landowners--and, honestly, for common sense.   While it wasn't a Biden administration regulation, Senator Hagerty  led a successful charge in the Senate to overturn Washington, DC's  crime bill that would have weakened penalties for a number of crimes.   Congress, of course, has the legal authority to block DC ordinances  thanks to Federal legislation rooted in the Constitution which gives  Congress legislative jurisdiction over the seat of the U.S.  Government--namely, Washington, DC.   Republicans' effort to overturn DC's dangerous new crime bill  ultimately persuaded the President to change his mind and sign the  resolution of disapproval.   As we move forward, Republicans will continue to use the  Congressional Review Act to push back against overreaching regulations  from the Biden administration. We may not always be successful, but at  the very least, we can highlight the true cost of the Biden  administration's regulations and the burdens they place on our economy  and on hard-working Americans.
