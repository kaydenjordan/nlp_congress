 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight  Eric's Law, a piece of legislation I introduced with my Pennsylvanian  colleague, Congressman Matt Cartwright.   Eric's Law is named for Eric Williams, a Federal correctional officer  who was brutally murdered by an inmate at U.S. Penitentiary Canaan in  Wayne County, Pennsylvania. His murderer's crime largely went  unpunished, even though 11 out of 12 jurors voted for the death penalty  because he was already serving a life sentence.   Current law requires a unanimous decision by the jury to impose the  death penalty.   Our legislation permits prosecutors to impanel a second jury for  sentencing if the first jury in a Federal death penalty case fails to  reach a unanimous decision on a sentence. This allows for a final,  definitive decision in death penalty cases that our victims and  families deserve.   I thank Eric's father, Don, as well as the Council of Prison Locals  for their support and endorsement of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, we must do everything in our power to prevent this kind  of tragedy from reoccurring. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.                            ____________________
