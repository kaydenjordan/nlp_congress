 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Linnie ``Papa'' Darden, who is being honored at the Legends, Leaders,  and Life Well Lived Award luncheon on May 9.   Well deserving of this honor, he should be an inspiration to us all  about how to constantly strive to make the world a better place to  live. Mr. Darden has dedicated much of his life to young people,  teaching deaf children in Ethiopia and counseling teenagers on life  skills and drug education here in the United States.   At the young age of 80, he earned a Ph.D. in religious counseling  with a thesis on at-risk youth.   Along with serving youth at home and abroad, he served in our  Nation's Armed Forces.   I couldn't be prouder to have him in the First Congressional District  of Georgia. I thank Mr. Darden for his service, both in the military  and in our communities. He continues to truly exemplify a life well  lived.                           honoring richard eckburg     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Richard ``Dick'' Eckburg, who is being honored at the Legends, Leaders,  and Life Well Lived Award luncheon on May 9.   Well deserving of this honor, he should be an inspiration to us all  about how to constantly strive to make the world a better place to  live.   A Korean war veteran, Dick worked at UPS for 32 years, eventually  becoming the vice president of public affairs. Since then, he has  dedicated countless time and resources to numerous charitable  organizations around the Savannah area, including the Telfair Museum,  the Lucas Theatre, the Bethesda Academy, and many more.   Dick's work with each of these organizations, along with that of his  wonderful wife, Judy, has changed the face of Savannah and improved the  lives of many in our community.   I couldn't be prouder to have him in the First Congressional District  of Georgia. I thank Dick for his service in the military and especially  for his service to our community. He continues to truly exemplify a  life well lived.                           honoring dr. les wilkes     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Les  Wilkes, who is being honored at the Legends, Leaders, and Life Well  Lived Award luncheon on May 9.   Well deserving of this honor, he should be an inspiration to us all  about how to constantly strive to make the world a better place to  live.   Dr. Wilkes practiced orthopedic surgery in Savannah for over 40  years. Before that, he served in the United States Navy as an  orthopedic surgeon.   After his retirement, he partnered with Hospice Savannah to provide  photographs for the clients. He continues his work with our veterans by  serving in Honor Flights, escorting veterans to Washington, D.C.   Dr. Wilkes is also the unofficial photographer for Wesley United  Methodist Church in downtown Savannah where he and his wife, Ge-Juan,  and their son, Lee, and his family have worshipped for many years.   I couldn't be prouder to have him in the First Congressional District  of Georgia. I thank Dr. Wilkes for his service, both in the military  and in our communities. He continues to truly exemplify a life well  lived.                recognizing savannah college of art and design     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Savannah College of Art and Design on its 40th anniversary.    In 1978, an elementary school teacher, Ms. Paula Wallace, wanted to  start a college in her hometown dedicated to the arts. Beginning with  71 students, SCAD now has over 55,000.   The school has four campuses, in Savannah, Atlanta, Hong Kong, and  Lacoste, France. It has countless alumni who have gone on to successful  careers in photography, abstract art, film, interior design, and so  much more.   In addition to providing college students with an exceptional art- centered education, they have given back to our community 10 times  over, hosting art festivals, public concerts, and fashion shows.   Locations important to our city's history and culture have been  restored by its students: the Flannery O'Connor Childhood Home, the  Victory Drive corridor, and the Massie Heritage Center.   I thank everyone at SCAD--the faculty, administrators, and students  alike--for their contributions to our area. As a native Savannahian, I  have always said that SCAD was the catalyst for the renovation of  downtown Savannah.   I thank Paula Wallace for bringing SCAD to Savannah and leading its  success over the last four decades, and I congratulate it on its 40th  anniversary.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize the  partnership between the city of Savannah and the 165th Airlift Wing,  symbolized by one of their aircrafts recently being named the ``Spirit  of Savannah.''   Commemorating the C-130 airplane with its new name on Tuesday, April  9, the ceremony was a special occasion. It is now the only aircraft at  the 165th that bears a unique designation and seal. I can't thank the  members of the 165th Airlift Wing enough for their service.   They have flown to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to assist  with hurricane recovery efforts. Just a few weeks later, they flew to  Iraq and Syria to support missions against ISIS.   The work they do, based out of the First Congressional District of  Georgia, helps keep our Nation and the entire world safe.  [[Page H3464]]                                ____________________
