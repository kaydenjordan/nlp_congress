 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow.    Madam Speaker, I am proud to introduce, today, H.R.  643, a bipartisan bill to stop all U.S. arms sales and military aid to  Saudi Arabia.   Madam Speaker, it has been over 100 days since the Government of  Saudi Arabia brutally murdered journalist and U.S. resident Jamal  Khoshoggi at the Saudi consulate in Turkey.   The Senate unanimously condemned the Saudi Government for this  heinous crime, but the House has yet to do so. It is past time that the  House clearly and unambiguously declares that there is a price to pay  for such barbarity. Let it begin by ending all U.S. arms sales and  military aid to the Saudi Government.   I urge all my colleagues to join me and cosponsor H.R. 643.
