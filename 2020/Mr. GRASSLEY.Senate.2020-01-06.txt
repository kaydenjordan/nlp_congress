 Mr. President, I ask permission to address the Senate  for 1 minute.    Mr. President, I want to wish all Iowans and maybe, in  turn, all Americans a happy New Year. As 2020 begins, I am focused on  passing the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. I am leading a  meeting of the Finance Committee tomorrow to report out the bill, so  the Senate floor vote is imminent.   I am continuing to work, in a bipartisan way, to lower the cost of  prescription drugs with the Grassley-Wyden Prescription Drug Pricing  Reduction Act.   In the coming weeks, I will begin my 40th annual 99-county tour of my  State to continue to hear what is on the minds of Iowans so that I can  better serve them in the U.S. Senate.   I look forward to remaining in touch with Iowans as the new decade  begins.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
