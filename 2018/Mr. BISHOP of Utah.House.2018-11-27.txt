 Mr. Speaker, Major Brent Russell Taylor is one of  six brothers to each wear the uniform of the United States Army.   While training Afghan security forces in support of Operation  Freedom's Sentinel, Major Taylor was killed by an apparent insider  attack on November 3 in Kabul province while in the final months of his  deployment. He is survived by his wife, Jennie, and seven children:  Megan, Lincoln, Alex, Jacob, Ellie, Jonathan, and Caroline. In Utah, we  mourn with the family of Major Taylor and grieve his loss and honor his  sacrifice.   As Major Taylor and his brothers passed through Basic Combat  Training, they learned the seven Army values in great detail. Those  values are loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity,  and personal courage, and Major Brent Taylor lived these values.   First, loyalty: Major Taylor swore to bear true faith and allegiance  to the Constitution of the United States and support and defend our  Nation's guiding documents against all enemies. He demonstrated his  loyalty to this oath time and time again.   Duty: Major Taylor earned a Bronze Star for his outstanding  dedication to duty during combat operations in Iraq. The Army says  doing your duty means more than carrying out your assigned tasks. Major  Taylor's military service record shows he employed this guidance to the  fullest.   So, too, does his life outside the military, because Major Taylor was  not only Major Taylor, he was also Mayor Taylor. His community and  neighbors so entrusted him to lead and provide that they elected him  the mayor of North Ogden City in Utah.   In that role, he did much more than carry out his assigned tasks. He  worked to beautify and improve the city and to create a community that  was welcoming to newcomers; and in the predawn morning of his last  Christmas on Earth, Mayor Taylor ventured out into the cold to oversee  the snowplows and salt trucks as they cleared the roads and made his  city safe.   Respect: Major Taylor not only enjoyed the respect of his family,  community, and fellow servicemembers, but his praises came from across  the globe. In a letter from Afghanistan to Mrs. Taylor following her  husband's death, an Afghan aviator said: ``Your husband taught me to .  . . treat my children as treasured gifts, to be a better father, to be  a better husband, and to be a better man.''    A man does not receive that level of praise without first showing his  own grand measure of respect.   Selfless service: As a high school senior in Chandler, Arizona, Brent  delivered the honor speech at graduation, and his instruction to the  audience was: ``Go out. Be happy. Find peace and make a positive  difference in the world.''   Major Taylor left his family and American soil on four deployments to  serve and ``make a positive difference in the world.'' In that same  honor speech, he gave the order to ``stick with it to the end.'' He,  himself, did just that.   Honor: Major Taylor honored his faith, his family, his community, and  his country throughout his short life. Brent's social media postings  are replete with photos of his children and family. They show images of  love and service and patriotism, qualities of a man, a husband, and a  father who honors his family and country.   In his last Facebook post, Brent implored that we all remember: ``We  have far more as Americans that unites us than divides us.'' And he  ended the post with the words, ``God Bless America.''   Integrity: The Army says that integrity is a quality you develop by  adhering to moral principles, and the more choices you make based on  integrity, the more this highly prized value will affect your  relationships with family and friends.   The days since the sad passing of Major Taylor have been filled with  an outpouring of love and grief expressed by those who knew Brent. His  integrity left an impression, and his integrity affected his  relationships.   Finally, personal courage: In September of 2007, Major Taylor was  commanding a convoy in Iraq when he was hit by an insurgent IED. His  vehicle was struck by shrapnel, asphalt, and concrete debris. For the  wounds received in action, Major Taylor was awarded the Purple Heart,  and he would go on to deploy twice more.   Brent Taylor stood as an example of personal courage. He lived the  Army Values.   In April of this year, the Department of Veterans Affairs opened a  facility in North Ogden City. It is a place where veterans and their  families can go to receive counseling and support. It is a place  located in the heart of Brent Taylor's hometown.   As a small gesture to his service and his sacrifice, I have  introduced a bill to name that VA facility the ``Major Brent Taylor Vet  Center Outstation.''   The naming of a building will never repay the debt our Nation owes  Major Taylor or his family, but it can stand as a humble reminder of  the citizen soldier who lost his life in the service of others.
