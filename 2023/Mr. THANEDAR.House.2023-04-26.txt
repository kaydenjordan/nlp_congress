 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to request support for naming  a Federal building after the late Congressman John Conyers, Jr.   Mr. Conyers was a civil rights legend, the dean of the House of  Representatives and, above all else, a faithful and devoted public  servant for the city of Detroit.   In this House, Mr. Conyers had many firsts. He was one of the first  members of the Congressional Black Caucus. He was the first African  American to serve on the Judiciary Committee and to become its  chairman. He was the first to introduce the bill making Martin Luther  King Jr. Day a Federal holiday.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask for your support in naming a Federal  building after this Detroit icon.  [[Page H2041]]                                ____________________
