 Mr. President. Maintaining a talented workforce is  essential to cultivating a strong economy and positioning our Nation  for success in today's increasingly competitive global marketplace.  Opportunities for education, professional development, and the  acquisition of skills immediately translatable in the workplace will  help to ensure that our students and workers are equipped with the  skills required to succeed in the 21st century. Career and technical  education (CTE) programs play a vital role in increasing student  engagement, continuing our nation's economic competitiveness, and  building the skills of our country's workforce.   In recent years, there has been a resurgence of student interest in  career and technical education, but shortages in high-quality CTE  teachers have made it difficult for school districts to meet this  demand. While the Higher Education and Opportunity Act of 2008 provides  grants for teacher residency partnership programs to colleges and  universities who work with high-needs school districts to train  prospective teachers, no CTE-focused partnerships exist.   That is why I am introducing with my colleagues, Senator Baldwin,  Senator Portman and Senator Capito the Creating Quality Technical  Educators Act, which would amend the Higher Education and Opportunity  Act to create a CTE teacher-training grant partnership to equip  aspiring CTE teachers with real-world experience and credible skills to  apply in the classroom. This legislation would foster teacher training  partnerships between high-needs secondary schools and post-secondary  institutions to create a one-year residency initiative for teachers and  includes teacher mentorship for a minimum of two years. This period of  hands-on training and mentorship will only increase the ability of CTE  teachers to benefit their students through classroom instruction and  serve as a career model.   In addition to establishing CTE specific teacher-training grant  partnerships, this bill takes a proactive approach to recruiting and  training more high-quality CTE teachers. CTE teacher residencies would  target teacher candidates from a variety of backgrounds including  recent college graduates, veterans, mid-career professionals, and  currently licensed teachers with a need for technical skills training  who seek to transition into CTE fields.   As co-chair of the Senate CTE Caucus, I am proud to introduce this  commonsense, bipartisan legislation to recruit and train talented  teachers to meet the rising need for CTE. The Creating Quality  Technical Educators Act is an important step towards ensuring access to  high-quality CTE instruction, preparing teachers for success, and  maintaining the skill set of our Nation's workforce.                                  ______                                         By Mr. CORNYN (for himself and Mr. Cruz):   S. 2734. A bill to designate the Federal building and United States  courthouse located at 1300 Victoria Street in Laredo, Texas, as the  ``George P. Kazen Federal Building and United States Courthouse''; to  the Committee on Environment and Public Works.    Mr. President.
