 Mr. Speaker, I rise in celebration of Asian American,  Native  [[Page H2468]]  Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.   As a ``fourth generation,'' ``yonsei,'' Okinawan American, I believe  this month is not only a chance to recognize our communities and their  contributions, but it is also deeply personal to me as I think about  the future we want to build for the next generation for our  ``children,'' ``keiki.''   AANHPIs are the fastest-growing population in the United States. We  are a diverse diaspora. We are in every State across the country.   While we have made great progress, we have also seen an unprecedented  rise in xenophobia, discrimination, and violence nationwide, but we  will not let these forces of hate hold us down.   The stories of AANHPI people in our country are of grit,  perseverance, and courage. They are stories that continue today through  the tireless advocacy of those fighting to defend our civil rights and  our democracy and through hardworking men and women keeping the  American Dream alive.   I invite my colleagues to join me in celebrating Asian American,  Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.                            ____________________
