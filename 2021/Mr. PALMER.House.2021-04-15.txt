 Madam Speaker, with the stroke of his pen, President  Biden canceled more than the Keystone XL pipeline. He canceled the jobs  of over 1,000 men and women.   Each one of these jobs is a real person with real hopes for  themselves and their families who are now out of work because they did  not have a Biden administration ``approved job.'' The workforce that  works on our energy sector is as diverse as our nation.   Madam Speaker, 24 percent of pipeline construction workers are women,  and another 24 percent are minorities. The Biden administration is  telling these pipeline workers their careers are over and to find a  green job that they are not trained to do and that does not pay as  much. They are telling single moms and single dads that they have to  give up the jobs that supported their families.   Joe Biden should not destroy the jobs that support the workers and  families who have provided the fuel for the American economy and that  has lowered energy costs for American families.   Madam Speaker, this is an economic injustice that should not be  tolerated. These workers and their families deserve better.                            ____________________
