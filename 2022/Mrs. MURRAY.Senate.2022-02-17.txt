 Mr. President, I rise to speak against the Lee  amendment, which we will be voting on in just a minute.   We are working to rebuild our economy, and we are working to end a  pandemic that has killed over 900,000 people. So why are a few Senate  Republicans, once again, risking a government shutdown and creating  problems rather than trying to work with us on the ones that our  country already faces?   This is not the first time I have had to point out to a handful of  Senate Republicans that shutting down the government in the middle of a  pandemic is a bad idea. It should be obvious, but here I am, once  again, because my colleagues are here, once again, pretending that the  biggest threat to our Nation is not the virus but, instead, vaccines  and tests and masks, which have helped to actually save lives. This  makes about as much sense as blaming the rescue crew for a shipwreck  and threatening to sink the lifeboat unless they don't stop helping.   We all want this pandemic to end; we want our schools to stay open  safely; and we want people to be able to go to work safely and go about  their lives like before.   We are making real progress toward the goal of putting this pandemic  behind us. One way to continue this progress is to do what the vast  majority of Senators--Democrat and Republican--are prepared to do: vote  to keep the government open so we can work together on funding the  Nation's priorities through regular order.   I urge all of my colleagues to vote against this completely  unnecessary amendment, against a government shutdown, and for common  sense.   I yield the floor.    I yield back our time.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator yields back time.                          Vote on Amendment No. 4930    The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on adoption of the  amendment by the Senator from Indiana (Mr. Braun).    I ask for the yeas and nays.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?   There appears to be a sufficient second.   The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk called the roll.    Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to  the life and work of Karen Ferguson, the founder and president of the  Pension Rights Center. Karen passed away in December. Today would have  been her 81st birthday, and today also marks the 46th anniversary of  Karen founding the Pension Rights Center.   Under Karen's steadfast leadership, the Pension Rights Center has  been at the forefront of ensuring retirement security for all, from  retirees in struggling multiemployer pension plans to women obtaining  spousal shares of retirement plans to countless individuals seeking  assistance through one of the center's pension counseling projects. The  Pension Rights Center was Karen's gift to all of us.   Karen will be remembered for her fierce determination and tireless  advocacy on behalf of workers, women, and retirees. She also possessed  an unparalleled depth of knowledge on retirement law, a subject many  find intimidating. The world has lost a pension superhero. I salute  Karen for her decades of service. She will be greatly missed.                            ____________________
