 Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and  I thank her for her leadership on this important issue.   Mr. Chairman, for the first time in many years, this budget uses  reconciliation for the purpose it was intended: to bring mandatory  spending under control.   The appropriations that dominate so much of the debate comprise less  than one-third of our total spending, and that is called discretionary  spending. The budget sets a level; the appropriations process spends to  that level. That is everything from general government to defense.   We have actually been able to bring that under control, but the other  two-thirds of spending is called mandatory spending. It is beyond the  annual control of Congress. It continues automatically until and unless  the statutes that call for it are actually changed.   It is the mandatory spending that is eating our country alive.  Mandatory spending is supposed to be controlled by reconciliation.  Instructions are sent to the various authorizing committees to make  whatever changes are necessary in current law to stay within our means.  But this powerful fiscal tool has been ignored or squandered in past  budgets, and this neglect is undermining the solvency of our country.   For the first time in many years, the House budget finally restrains  mandatory spending by instructing our committees to find at least $200  billion in savings over the next decade. That means this budget will  get us back to balance within the decade, and this is why it is so  important.   If the Democrats had their way and we maintain our current path, the  Congressional Budget Office warns that in just 4 years, in 2022, our  deficits will surpass $1 trillion a year. That is where economists warn  we run the risk of damage or even loss of our access to credit, a  sovereign debt crisis.   If you want to know what that looks like, Venezuela is going through  it right now, and within our own territory, the Commonwealth of Puerto  Rico--pension systems implode, basic services falter, the economy  collapses.   Two years after that, in 2024, 6 years from now, the CBO warns that  the annual interest cost on our debt will reach $654 billion. That is  more than we currently spend on defense.   I would remind my friends on the left that you cannot provide for the  common defense or promote the general welfare if you can't pay for it,  and the ability of our country to do so is being undermined by our  spending trajectory.   At the same time, we charge the highest corporate tax rate in the  industrialized world, sending trillions of dollars of capital and  hundreds of thousands of jobs to other countries. In the last 8 years,  we have averaged only half of our postwar economic growth.   I remind my friends that corporations do not pay corporate taxes.  Corporate taxes can only be paid in one of three ways: by consumers  through higher prices, by employees through lower wages, by investors  through lower earning. Cutting corporate taxes means lower prices for  consumers, higher wages for employees, and higher earnings for  investors.   Tax relief is absolutely vital to reviving the economy, but  experience does warn us that revenue growth only partially offsets  revenue lost to tax reductions. Indeed, when we are told that the  choice is between taxes and debt, those are two sides of the same coin.   Taxes and debt are the only two possible ways to pay for spending.  Once we have spent a dollar, we have already decided to tax it. We  either tax it now, or we borrow it now and tax it later. Either way, it  is entirely driven by spending. By restraining spending, this budget  makes possible the tax relief that our economy desperately needs to  grow.   Frankly, we could do much more if we summon the political will, and I  will be presenting such a budget tomorrow on behalf of the Republican  Study Committee.   But this budget moves us a long way in the right direction. It sets  in motion the policies that Presidents from Calvin Coolidge to John F.  Kennedy to Ronald Reagan have all used to revive and expand our  economy. It brings us closer to that day when families will awaken to a  new and prosperous morning for America.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Mr. Chairman, even though I disagree heartily with the budgets  advanced by  [[Page H7822]]  the Progressive Caucus, they do us an invaluable service in the budget  debate by bringing into sharp relief the two very different visions of  governance advanced by the two parties.   The Progressive budget is a sincere and bold document. Unfortunately,  it is also wrong. It would hike taxes by $10.1 trillion over the next  10 years relative to the Republican budget.   Now, think of every trillion dollars that we throw around here as  $8,000 from an average family, because that is what it comes to. So  $10.1 trillion in new taxes ultimately translates as $81,000 from an  average family over the next decade taken either as direct taxes or as  tax-driven price increases or as lower wages or as lower earnings as  businesses pass on their burdens to consumers or employers or  investors. Remember, investors are largely your 401(k) or your pension  plan.   It also runs up $2.6 trillion more in debt than the Republican budget  over the next 10 years. That means another $21,000 of debt added to  that family's obligations that they will have to pay as future taxes  just as surely as if it appeared on their credit card statement this  month. And they have got to pay that back before they pay back their  credit card statement. The IRS can get very insistent that they do.   And don't believe for a moment that only the rich will pay these  taxes. It turns out that the so-called rich people aren't rich and they  aren't even people. Many are struggling small businesses filing under  subchapter S, small businesses that create two-thirds of the jobs in  our economy.   We are told: ``Don't worry. We are using that money to create wealth  and jobs.'' Well, the problem is government does not create jobs  because it cannot create wealth. Government cannot inject a dollar into  the economy until it has first taken that dollar out of the same  economy.   As Bastiat warned, we see the job that government creates when it  puts the dollar back in the economy. What we don't see as clearly is  the job that is lost when government first takes that dollar out of the  economy. We see those lost jobs as stagnating wages and workers giving  up and leaving the job market, or as it is also known, the Obama  economy.   Here is what government can do and what the Progressive and  Democratic budgets propose. It can transfer jobs from the private  sector to the public sector by taxing one and expanding the other. It  can transfer jobs from one sector of the private market to another by  taxing one and subsidizing the other. That is precisely the difference  between Apple Computer and Solyndra. It is the difference between FedEx  and the post office. It is the difference between the Reagan recovery  and the Obama recovery.   Reagan, like Coolidge and Kennedy before him, reduced the tax and  regulatory burdens on the economy and produced one of the longest  economic expansions in our country's history. It truly felt like  morning again in America. That is the Republican approach, and it  works.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, my friend reminds me of a story when  Ronald Reagan was pushing his tax reductions a generation ago that  produced the biggest expansion in our Nation's history. He was  approached one day by a working class fellow on a stop that the  President was making, and the man looks at him and says: Mr. President,  the Democrats say that you Republicans want to cut taxes on the rich.  Is that right?   Reagan says: Well, that is what they say.   And the man says: Well, you go ahead and do that, Mr. President,  because a poor person never gave me a job.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Woodall).                                time  1815     Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Alabama (Mr. Palmer), a former director of the State Policy  Network.    Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Alabama.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman  from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Chair, I am prepared to close when the gentleman  from Arizona is finished, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, have my friends on the left learned absolutely nothing  over these past 8 years? If massive government spending, higher and  higher  [[Page H7826]]  taxes, and deeper and deeper debt produced economic growth, the Obama  years should have been the golden age of our economy. Instead, we  suffered prolonged stagnation. We averaged 1.5 percent annual growth,  only half the average economic growth that our Nation has enjoyed in  the postwar era. The Progressive and Democratic budgets promise more of  the same.   We choose a different path, the Reagan path that produced an average  of 3.5 percent growth year after year, higher wages, better jobs. Not  just a Republican policy, John F. Kennedy did the same thing. He  reminded us that a rising tide lifts all boats. These are the policies  that create prosperity.   The government cannot create jobs because it cannot create wealth,  but what it can do is create the conditions where jobs multiply and  prosper or where they stagnate and disappear. That it can do very well.  We have very consistent experience with the policies that create these  conditions.   If you increase the burdens on the economy as the Democrats again  propose, the economy contracts. If you lighten the burdens on the  economy, it grows and prospers. No nation has ever taxed and spent its  way to prosperity, but many nations have taxed and spent their way to  economic ruin and bankruptcy.   We know what works and we know what doesn't work because we have  tried both paths many times before. The House Budget Committee's budget  follows principles that have, time and again, consistently and rapidly  produced economic expansion and prosperity.   The House Democrats' budget and the Progressive budget before us now  double down on policies that have impoverished and bankrupted nations  wherever they have been employed down through history.   That is the choice before us today. Let us choose wisely. Our future  depends on it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
