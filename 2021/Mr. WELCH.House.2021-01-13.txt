 Mr. Speaker, our government is founded on the principle of  all power flows from the people.   Donald Trump challenged this principle in two ways: Deceit and  violence. The deceit is repeated in baseless assertions of an electoral  fraud. The violence, the attack on the United States Capitol on January  6, the mob was assembled by Donald Trump, incited by Donald Trump, and  in service of Donald Trump's effort to overturn, through violence, what  he lost at the voting booth.   The violent mob reached the Capitol; killed and injured Capitol  Police; destroyed property; threatened the Vice President, Members of  Congress, and staff, all to obstruct the peaceful transfer of power.   If we want unity, we must have accountability. So the question before  this Congress: Will Congress condone through acquiescence or condemn  through impeachment Donald Trump's violent acts to overturn the  election?   Congress must impeach.
