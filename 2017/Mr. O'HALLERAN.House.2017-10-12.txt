 Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I am opposed in its current form.    Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill,  which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted,  the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.   Mr. Speaker, increasing accountability and transparency across our  government is a shared principle we can all agree on among this body.  Whether at the VA or other Federal agencies, the American people  deserve to know that Federal officials from the top down are being held  to the standards we expect of them.   We owe it to our veterans, to our seniors, and to the hardworking  American taxpayers to ensure that their tax dollars are utilized  appropriately and efficiently, as intended. Waste, fraud, and abuse,  have no place at our agencies, and those who help uncover it deserve  our admiration and our protection.   I am proud that we are coming together to increase protections for  whistleblowers of Federal agencies, a long overdue effort. But, Mr.  Speaker, in light of recent reports and events that have revealed a  disturbing pattern of improper use of tax dollars on air travel by  senior Federal officials, I believe we must go further.   The reports of Cabinet officials abusing the rules for air travel  that applied to them are not isolated. Not one, not two, not three, but  at least four Cabinet officials are facing scrutiny for irregular and  irresponsible use of agency resources for official and nonofficial air  travel. In light of Secretary Price's recent resignation, it is clear  that Congress must conduct greater oversight.                                time  1345    That is why I am offering this final amendment on the underlying  bill.  [[Page H8004]]    My amendment simply extends whistleblower protections that are  created under the bill to Federal employees who disclose information  about travel, including improper use of aircraft.   Not only would this make clear to agencies that any violation of  laws, rules, or regulations concerning travel or government aircraft is  unacceptable, it will also ensure those who come forward to expose any  wrongdoing will have appropriate protection from retaliation.   Regardless of party, those who serve the American public must be held  to the highest ethical standards. Our ability to hold government  officials accountable to taxpayers is a hallmark of our democracy, and  we must work to uphold that principle. The resources invested to  agencies to fulfill their missions of serving Americans should not be  abused or frivolously flaunted for personal gain or convenience.   This is not about Republicans or Democrats. We must come together to  stand up for accountability and transparency. The moment we begin  treating disregard for the rules by our elected and appointed officials  as partisan politics, we risk ceding the very values that make our  democracy great and unique in the world.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting my  commonsense amendment on behalf of American taxpayers, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
