 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of Chairwoman  Waters' resolution disapproving of President Trump's efforts to gut the  Community Reinvestment Act, and I salute her for her leadership to  support the financially underserved communities across our Nation.   The administration's immoral rule change would roll back critical  financial protections at a time when millions of Americans are facing  down dire COVID-19 crises.   Fair credit for all has always been an elusive goal for our Nation.  Predatory lending is a plague in countless American communities, many  of which are comprised of minorities or low-income residents.   The Community Reinvestment Act says your money belongs to you, not to  any loan shark, predatory lender, fast buck artist, or financial  institution sucking the wealth out of your neighborhood.   We must not only strengthen the CRA, but also increase the reach of  credit unions and build out postal banking platforms to extend critical  financial lifelines and fair credit to those who need it most.   Mr. Speaker, I urge swift passage of this critical legislation, and I  urge my colleagues to support it.                            ____________________
