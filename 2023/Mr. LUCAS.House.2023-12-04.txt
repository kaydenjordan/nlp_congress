Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on H.R. 1734, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1734, the TRANQ Research Act  sponsored by the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins).   This is an important bill that will help us combat the dangers of  novel synthetic opioids. Unfortunately, there is no area of our country  that hasn't been touched by the deadly fentanyl epidemic. Now these  drugs are being mixed with animal tranquilizers to create deadly new  combinations.   Drugs like tranq are presenting new challenges to law enforcement,  healthcare professionals, and first responders. H.R. 1734 authorizes  critical research and development to help us better understand, detect,  and handle these drugs. With that knowledge, we can help to slow their  spread and reduce lives lost to these deadly drugs.   This bill takes advantage of the tremendous expertise of the National  Institute of Standards and Technology, which is already doing cutting- edge work on detecting and analyzing fentanyl. With the passage of the  TRANQ Research Act, NIST will be able to apply their expertise to these  dangerous new variants.   This bill authorizes NIST's work to quickly identify illicit drugs,  analyze them, and establish best practices for first responders to  handle these dangerous substances. By doing that, it provides critical  protections for the police officers and EMTs that encounter these  drugs, helping them to stay safe and protected as they do their work.  It will also give us the knowledge we need to stop the spread of tranq  and other novel synthetic opioids.   This bill has already passed the House with a unanimous bipartisan  vote of 425-0. I would like to see that same level of backing today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Collins) to speak on his bill.    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I note that when this bill is signed by the President,  it will be the first bill introduced by a freshman in the 118th  Congress to become law. I congratulate the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Collins) for this achievement. I think it is a reflection of just how  important this topic is, and I am so glad our colleagues have all  recognized the growing dangers of novel synthetic opioids and have  given this bill such strong support.   Again, I thank Representative Collins and my colleagues for  everything they have done to help support this. I urge all of my  colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 1713) to provide for Department of Energy and Department of  Agriculture joint research and development activities, and for other  purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 2980, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2980, the DOE and NSF  Interagency Research Act. This bill supports the longstanding  partnership between the Department of Energy and the National Science  Foundation, allowing them to work on cutting-edge and research  technology challenges.   DOE is our Nation's largest supporter of basic research in the  physical sciences, while NSF is the backbone of the collaborative  research environment between government and academia.   Together, they can tackle some of the Nation's toughest challenges in  physics, quantum information sciences, artificial intelligence, and  material science.   The bill enhances both DOE and NSF's capacities and leverages each  other's investments in research and development, maximizing the impact  of our taxpayer dollars.   There has never been a more important time for this kind of  breakthrough research. The Chinese Communist Party has made no secret  of their goal to surpass us as the world leader in science and  technology.   They are attempting to outspend us, out-educate us, and outpace us in  everything from quantum computing to advanced manufacturing.   They know that the Nation that leads the way in technological  development sets the rules of the road and determines how that  technology will be used.   We simply cannot afford to live in a world where China is  technologically ahead of us. It is bad for our economy and dangerous  for our national security.   We must ensure our investments in research and development go as far  as possible. This bill helps us to do that.   By authorizing the collaboration between DOE and NSF, we are  maximizing our return on investments and ensuring we can stay on the  cutting edge of technological development.   I thank my colleagues, Representatives Stevens and Baird, for  introducing this important legislation and shepherding it through the  Science Committee where it passed unanimously.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I am  prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, once again, I rise in support of H.R. 2980,  the DOE and NSF Interagency Research Act.   This will accelerate U.S. competitiveness in emerging technology  areas and key economic sectors while enabling taxpayer dollars to be  used more efficiently, allowing more to be done with less.   I appreciate all the work done by my colleagues, Representatives  Stevens and Baird, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill  (H.R. 2988) to provide for Department of Energy and National  Aeronautics and Space Administration research and development  coordination, and for other purposes, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 2988, the bill now under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2988, the DOE and NASA  Interagency Research Coordination Act.   The Department of Energy and NASA have a long history of  collaboration, which has enhanced our understanding of our universe and  our ability to explore beyond our planet.   The Voyager spacecraft, which were launched more than 40 years ago  and are now flying in interstellar space, continue to operate under  DOE's propulsion systems.   The work DOE and NASA are doing on nuclear energy is critical to our  ability to establish a long-term human presence on the Moon. That same  technology can be used here on Earth, too, helping to improve this  clean and reliable energy source.   The DOE-NASA partnership will also help us advance our high- performance computing systems, which help keep us at the forefront of  research and development. This partnership will also help us with  satellite development, space situational awareness, and even planetary  defense from near-Earth objects.   In short, it allows two of our premier scientific agencies to better  work by collaborating on some of our most challenging scientific  issues.   I thank my colleague, Representative Williams, for introducing this  legislation and Representative Sorensen for cosponsoring it.   This bipartisan bill earned unanimous support in the Science  Committee, and I urge my colleagues to give it the same support on the  floor today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Williams) to speak on his bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield  myself the balance of my time.   H.R. 2988, the DOE and NASA Interagency Research Coordination Act, is  smart legislation that will help us stay competitive in the race to  return humans to the Moon and send them to Mars.   Without key collaborations like this, we would be unable to make  critical strides in our energy production and propulsion technologies.  I thank Representatives Williams and Sorensen for their leadership in  moving this bill forward.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
