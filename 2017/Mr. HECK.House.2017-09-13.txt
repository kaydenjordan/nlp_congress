 Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.  [[Page H7357]]    The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 348, line 18, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $3,800,000)''.        Page 447, line 13, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(increased by $3,800,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Washington (Mr. Heck) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a bipartisan amendment  in support of the Small Business Administration's ScaleUp program. Like  many of you, one of my favorite things to do when I am back home is to  visit local businesses, businesses like Beech Tree Woodworks in  Olympia, which just invested in some amazing new cutting-edge  machinery; or Zoe Juice Bar in Olympia, which opened with just four  employees not that long ago, and they now have more than a dozen, and  they are still growing.   These businesses have all expanded with the help of SBA's ScaleUp  program. ScaleUp is a program that gives small businesses the tools  they need to become not so small anymore. It works within existing  community networks to provide the education and technical assistance  and access to capital that small businesses need to grow.   I include in the Record an article from my hometown newspaper which  discusses the positive impact ScaleUp has had on our community.     Why Is Trump's Pro-Business Administration Hurting Businesses in                              Thurston County?                              (By Rolf Boone)         President Donald Trump once declared that he would be the       ``greatest jobs president that God ever created.''        After a recent decision to cut a business owner training       program in Thurston County--and 14 other locations around the       country--some might question Trump's claim.        ``The program was under review by the Trump Administration       and the decision was made to let the program expire in its       entirety at the end of September,'' said Melanie Norton, a       spokeswoman for the Northwest region of the U.S. Small       Business Administration.        Locally, the program was known as ScaleUp Thurston, a       multi-week course that helped businesses beyond the start-up       stage grow.        The two-year-old program was based in Lacey at the Center       for Business & Innovation, a partnership of the Thurston       Economic Development Council, its business resource center       and South Puget Sound Community College. Celia Nightingale is       the director of the center.        ScaleUp received about $200,000 a year from the SBA, she       said.        The decision to discontinue the program clearly was not       data driven because it produced results, with businesses       increasing their revenue and adding employees, Nightingale       said.        ``I find it hard to believe,'' said Kevin Leneker about the       decision. Leneker is chief executive of Olympia-based Single       Handed Consulting, a vocational rehabilitation business that       helps injured workers return to work. After participating in       ScaleUp in 2016, his revenue grew 57 percent and he increased       his staff to 25 from 10.        The course taught him to step back and think bigger picture       about the future of his business.        ``Work on your business, not just in it,'' he said.        Jason Phillips, owner of Zoe Juice Bar in Olympia, also       took part in ScaleUp.        Phillips said the course allowed him to fine-tune his       business systems and procedures. It also introduced him to       other business owners and the importance of networking. His       juice bar opened in December 2013, followed by a production       space for cold-pressed juice in Tumwater. His business opened       with four employees. He now has 12-14, he said.        ``It's really disappointing,'' he said. ``It was a great       resource for small businesses, and small business represents       jobs and families''        ``You feel like you had a friend in your corner,'' he added       about ScaleUp.        ScaleUp may have been viewed as a duplication of services       already offered by the SBA's Small Business Development       Center, Nightingale said.        Leneker praised the services of the Small Business       Development Center, but he thinks there was little overlap.        ``Not even close,'' he said.        Nightingale said the current ScaleUp program will run       through Sept. 29. After that, the plan is to seek grants and       corporate sponsorships to keep it going, she said.        Perhaps the city of Lacey will step up with some funding.        Lacey City Council recently learned about ScaleUp's end       after Councilwoman Rachel Young, a small business owner who       serves on the Thurston EDC board, reported the news to a       stunned council on July 13. That led business owner and Mayor       Andy Ryder to wonder aloud about possibly funding the       program.        It wouldn't be the first time the city has stepped up when       the federal government would not. The city led the creation       and funding of the Veterans Services Center Hub.     SBA currently plans to phase out this program at the end of  this fiscal year--in other words, in 17 more days. After hearing from  so many people whom it has benefited, I felt compelled to offer this  amendment which will provide the funding to continue ScaleUp for  another year.   ScaleUp communities can be found at every corner of America: in  Texas, Pennsylvania, Florida, Maine, Virginia, Ohio, Illinois,  Arkansas, Tennessee, and Arizona. I thank my friend from Arizona, Ms.  McSally, for working with me on this bipartisan effort.   Mr. Chairman, we are in a tough budget environment. I get that. But  that makes it all the more important that we focus on programs that  have been proven to be a good investment, programs like ScaleUp.   Mr. Chair, I urge the adoption of this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, the fact of the matter is that our  constituents were only informed 5 short weeks ago that ScaleUp was  ending in 2 months. This amendment is the only recourse available given  that very short timeframe, and because evidence-based measures of  ScaleUp performance are all very positive, none of us had any reason to  believe that the program would not continue, and the announcement came  as a complete surprise to all of us.   The fact of the matter is, I don't agree with the decision of the  Small Business Administration, and it is our job as a function of our  oversight and check and balance responsibility to pursue our  disagreement, as it were, because their decision flies in the face of  the evidence.   I would argue that the appropriation process exists so that Congress  can exercise this independent oversight of the spending priorities of  the executive branch and assert itself in exactly this sort of a  circumstance.   Mr. Chair, I would dearly love to work with the chair of the Small  Business Committee on legislation to specifically authorize the ScaleUp  program, but that is a longer term issue. This program will end at the  end of this month if we don't act now, taking away a very valuable  program that is working--evidence, metrics, measurable. It is getting  the job done.   Why wouldn't we pass this amendment, it is fully offset, there is no  increased spending here, and have the existing program continue while  we work on a more permanent solution.  [[Page H7358]]    Mr. Chair, with all due respect, I would urge my colleagues to  support this amendment in the name of helping small businesses grow.  Two out of every three jobs created in America are created by small  businesses. This program, ScaleUp, has been proven to work. There is  not one shred of evidence that has been offered here today to suggest  it isn't doing the job for which it was intended to do.   Please, support this amendment, support small businesses, support  your check and balance responsibility, support the creation of jobs.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
