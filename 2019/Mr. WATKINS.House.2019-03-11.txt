 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Duty, honor, country. The United States possesses the greatest  military in the history of mankind, and it isn't even close. How is  that possible since, through the ages, warfare changes, our enemies  change, the geography changes, the ideology that we are up against  changes.   I would contest that the reason we consistently win our Nation's wars  is because our greatest attribute never does change. Those are the  values that we hold dear. It is the leadership principles that every  graduate of the United States Military Academy learns.   How on Earth could that be encapsulated? The best I could hope for is  to call on General MacArthur, who in 1962, to the United States Corps  of Cadets, said: ``Duty, honor, country: Those three hallowed words  reverently dictate what you ought to be, what you can be, what you will  be. They are your rallying point to build courage when courage seems to  fail, to regain faith when there seems to be little cause for faith, to  create hope when hope becomes forlorn.''   The United States Military Academy has a sacred place in my heart, to  the class of 1999, with duty in mind. I want to thank God for West  Point. I want to thank The Long Gray Line. And God bless you USMA, my  rockbound highland home.
