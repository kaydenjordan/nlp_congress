 Madam Speaker, today is World AIDS Day, and lest we  forget, it is not over yet.   In 2021, 1.5 million persons became infected with AIDS and 600,000  died; a pandemic or an epidemic. As we fought and scurried to save  lives against COVID-19, let us not forget.   I rise to thank all the AIDS advocacy groups and my particular  center, the Thomas Street Clinic, which will hold a World AIDS Day  ceremony today, one that I never miss except when in Washington.   I remember the days of standing at the bedsides of those who were  dying alone. We must continue to research, we must continue to  acknowledge, and we must continue to eliminate the stigma, for all of  those infected and affected AIDS must have human dignity.   I am reminded of my early engagement standing with the late Senator  Orrin Hatch and, of course, the late Senator Ted Kennedy when they  announced the Ryan White CARE Treatment Act, and what an amazing  impact.   We have lost many souls. Many families have suffered, but as  Americans, let us continue to fight against the scourge of AIDS and to  embrace those who are fighting and living with AIDS.    World AIDS Day. We should never forget. It is not over yet.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1499, I  call up the bill (H.R. 3372) to authorize implementation grants to  community-based nonprofits to operate one-stop reentry centers, and ask  for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 3372.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 3372, the One Stop Shop Community Reentry Program  Act of 2021, is truly a public safety-minded bill that would create a  grant program within the Department of Justice to support community  reentry intake and coordination centers.   The centralized centers opened pursuant to this bill would offer  those leaving incarceration the resources necessary to successfully  rejoin and reintegrate into our communities through DOJ and community- funded reentry programs.   Now, let me be very clear: I am delighted that there are the kind of  sensitive community efforts across America, spotty in different States  and different cities, who believe in reentry. That is why we believe  this legislation is so important, because it federalizes and increases  the opportunity for all Americans facing the daunting responsibilities  of what reentry is to have a lifeline.   There exists a great need for these programs envisioned in this  legislation as more than 600,000 people return to their communities  each year after serving time in State and Federal prisons, as do nearly  9 million people from county jails, while more than 2.5 million people  complete parole and probation.   We can't deny these people an opportunity to be again contributing  citizens in a positive way.   Individuals with criminal convictions face daunting challenges upon  release. The overwhelming majority of those released from custody  receive minimum preparation during their incarceration and inadequate  assistance to get back on their feet after they are released.   Their convictions may limit employment prospects, educational and  training opportunities, public housing assistance, and access to social  services. They should not, but they do.   Even a minor criminal conviction can erect substantial barriers and  trigger far-reaching collateral consequences, maybe even access to  college education.   Due in part to the difficulty of overcoming these barriers, five out  of six people who have spent time in a State prison will be arrested  for a new crime within 9 years of their release.   We cannot waste human resources or talent in this way. That is why  policies designed to improve reentry outcomes have broad bipartisan  support, as demonstrated by the passage of our First Step Act and the  Sentencing Reduction Act, which incentivizes education and recidivism  reduction programs for people in Federal prisons.   While the First Step Act and Second Chance Act, first introduced by  my good friend,   Danny Davis, and other initiatives have been  successful at the Federal level, the majority of returning citizens are  exiting State and local facilities, and there is no overall and  comprehensive effort to address the challenges of reentry.   An example of the type of community reentry center supported by this  legislation is in Tulsa, Oklahoma,  [[Page H8682]]  where community organizations offer a comprehensive model of reentry  services. The services offered through the Tulsa Reentry One-Stop have  significantly reduced recidivism and increased employment. In 2015, 77  percent of the individuals who successfully completed their  reintegration program remained employed after exiting the program.  There is the proof.   H.R. 3372 would establish a grant program to support reentry centers  like Tulsa and ensure support is more available for all individuals  across the Nation from the moment they are released. Support would  include assistance with transportation, housing, skills training, and  even advanced education.   One-stop reentry centers would also assist reentering individuals in  obtaining identification and applying for eligible public benefits.  Those who have formal reentry plans would be able to find case  management assistance and court-directed wraparound support at the  reentry centers.   This, again, would be a lifeline for a new direction, not for the  individual only, but for their family, their neighbors, their  neighborhood, and where they live.   In addition to the one-stop reentry centers, this bill would  authorize a second mechanism to assist individuals reentering  communities that do not have large enough populations of reentering  individuals to maintain a standalone reentry center. In these  communities, H.R. 3372 would provide grants to operate free reentry  hotlines that operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to assist those  recently released from incarceration with reentry services near their  homes.   Madam Speaker, the Judiciary Committee has a responsibility not to  look only at urban crises, urban crime, and urban solutions. We must  look at the hamlets, villages, suburbia, and elsewhere. Rural  communities need our assistance.   We specifically thought it was important to have this hotline to be  able to assist them. This element of the bill is particularly important  in our smaller communities.   Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle might argue that  the funding authorized in the bill is too high, but we know that the  high rates of recidivism equal this amount of money, leaving  individuals coming out of incarceration as having nowhere to go.                                time  1245    Their actions can become more costly to Americans than our investment  in changing their lives.   This bill would address a pressing nationwide need, providing  individuals with the tools and support they need to successfully  reenter society, ultimately making our community safer.   Now, I have had the privilege of serving alongside of Representative  Karen Bass for a number of years. I take this moment to publicly, on  behalf of her colleagues, congratulate her for her next step in life:  Becoming the first woman to ever become mayor of the great city of LA.   I can say that because there is another great city, Houston.   But I give her my congratulations and I know her colleagues would do  so, as well.   Representative Bass worked with leadership on this issue, as well as  joining with bipartisan cosponsors. We know it has widespread support  and, therefore, we are looking forward to introducing this important  legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, my dear friend, Ranking Member  Jordan, speaks to a particular point that I just have to respond.   I am so glad he cited positive examples of what a reentry program can  do, but he is giving evidence, comfort, and advocacy for this  legislation. Because isolated programs will not help Americans. We now  give a broad-based opportunity for cities, hamlets, villages, and  counties across America--rural and urban, North, South, East and West-- to look at their landscape of those reentering and accessing this one- stop program.   We have already said 600,000 are released, and we have already said  that these persons want to rehabilitate themselves. Why would anybody  oppose this legislation? And it is bipartisan. Let me remind my friends  that these are individuals who have served their time.   Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island  (Mr. Cicilline), a distinguished member of the committee and the  subcommittee chair.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume. There lies the key element to my friends who are ignoring the  fact that this one-stop legislation has bipartisan support. It means  that someone who was in opposition to my party, my caucus, supports  this. The work that Ms. Bass did with all of us was a bipartisan  effort. And the reason is because this is an investment.   And my friends keep talking about grants. And so it is the grant that  continues to be the line of argument and the--how should I say it--the  bee sting. And they are wrong because grants have oversight. Grants  require these organizations to apply and present the best practices,  the best evidence. And so I am very glad that it is a grant. But it  also gives those with broad needs across the land the fair opportunity  to apply for a grant to be able to have these kinds of programs.   The one-stop model that this legislation promotes would aim to  provide complete reentry services to address the critical elements of  the reentry process that promote long-term reentry success, which as I  said, is housing, employment, education, and healthcare.   The bill will ensure that returning citizens can effectively access  the services funded through the many bills that we have tried to work  on.   Now let me just be very clear. One of my good friends called off a  list of offenders that really triggers fear, apprehension, and  distaste. Well, those are the very individuals that we would hope that  through treatment, medical care and otherwise, and getting them into a  proper program, that they can be contributing, that their families do  not have to be fearfully looking over their shoulder as to what have  they done next. We have to try. And these programs will hire those who  have a difficult time finding employment. But you can be assured that  working with the program they will be screened prior to their  employment; their employment will reduce their likelihood to  recidivate.   Mr. Speaker, I think it is extremely important that we take the tough  questions and give good answers. Tough questions about: What do you do  with those who are trying to reenter? What you do is you have a good  program that is tough and that it works.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, just in a moment let me indicate that  you can always find just a sliver on which to oppose.   I hold in my hand a whole list of Republicans that believe the bill  works and should work. So that, we should take off the table.  Republicans and Democrats support this legislation.   And then I can assure you that people answering the phone will not be  randomly answering the phone. They will be under a supervised program,  as this program relates. We would hope and expect that they would be  the kind that can listen and take the intake of those who are desperate  and trying to find a way not to go back to crime.   Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time  to close.   Mr. Speaker, I always like a words game with my good friend from  Ohio, so let me clarify.   An isolated program means that a program in Tulsa and a program in  Pennsylvania do not help someone in Idaho. And so what this one-stop  program does is it gives the good works of the people of Pennsylvania  and Tulsa, it gives Americans the opportunities in cities, hamlets,  urban centers, and rural hamlets the opportunity to have the same exact  program and to invest in the 600,000, those who are coming out of  incarceration, give them the same opportunity for ensuring that they  will have that access to this program   That is what our intent was on the Judiciary Committee, and that is  what the intent was on the many individuals, if you will, who were  trying to craft something that will work for all of America.   Now, let me share with you, Mr. Speaker, an article titled: ``To keep  people from returning to jail, Mesa County follows other communities'  reentry roadmap.'' Many people transitioning from jail or prison  struggle to reenter society. So here is Mesa County's new program with  housing, jobs, transportation, and mental health services.   What we simply want to do is to get this program out.   I will just share you with the story of Richard Gallegos who was  locked up in the Mesa County jail for the first time at age 18. He  spent the next 8 years in and out of jail--typically drug- and alcohol- related misdemeanors that sometimes led to more serious incidents,  including nonviolent domestic disputes and resisting arrest. He said  that at 27 he was sentenced to prison for a drug and firearms  violation.   Altogether, Gallegos, was born and raised in Grand Junction and now  45 years old, has spent 5 years in State prison, and 3 years in county  jail, and for the past 4 years he has been on probation. He now works  at a job where he is learning masonry, a switch from the oil and gas  industry work he did previously.   ``I am staying honest, humble,'' he said. ``I try not to walk with  too much shame. The best thing in my favor is I have been forgiven by  those I have wronged. They understand my drug addiction.''   These are individuals whom we don't want to throw by the wayside. We  want to make sure they get into this program.   Mr. Speaker, I include this article in the Record.                   [From the Colorado Sun, Nov. 8, 2022]     To Keep People From Returning to Jail, Mesa County Follows Other                        Communities' Reentry Roadmap                            (By Sharon Sullivan)         Richard Gallegos was locked up in the Mesa County Jail for       the first time at age 18. He spent the next eight years in       and out of jail--typically drug and alcohol-fueled       misdemeanors that sometimes led to more serious incidents,       including (nonviolent) domestic disputes and resisting       arrest, he said. At 27, he was sentenced to prison for a drug       and firearms violation.        Altogether, Gallegos, born and raised in Grand Junction and       now 45 years old, has spent five years in state prison and       three years in county jail. For the past four years, he has       been on probation. He now works at a job where he's learning       masonry, a switch from the oil and gas industry work he did       previously.        ``I'm staying honest, humble,'' he said. ``I try not to       walk with too much shame. The best thing in my favor is I       have been forgiven by those I've wronged. They understand       drug addiction.''        Gallegos shares an apartment with an adult daughter, but       many formerly incarcerated friends are not so lucky, he said.        ``People are coming out of jail with no resources,''       Gallegos said. ``You better hope you have a support system.       Resources are slim to none coming out of county jail.        ``You're on your own, facing what put you in there in the       first place. People's first thought is often, `I want to do       what's right--but where do I go?' ''        Mesa County officials have long recognized that many people       transitioning from jail or prison struggle with substance       abuse, mental illness or both--compounding the multiple other       challenges they face when reentering society, and often       lacking much-needed resources like Gallegos did.        The Mesa County Sheriff's Office compared names of frequent       users of the jail with frequent visitors to emergency rooms       at Grand Junction's two acute care hospitals, Community       Hospital and St. Mary's Medical Center. (To protect patient       privacy, the two hospitals did not disclose names, but       confirmed that many people appeared on both lists.) They       identified 60-90 frequent users of both the jail and       emergency rooms. Most of these frequent users face challenges       related to mental health diagnoses or substance abuse, said       Mesa County Commissioner Janet Rowland, who has led an effort       to address the issue.        In September, Mesa County launched a new multiagency       collaboration (county officials refer to it as MAC), aimed at       helping people successfully transition from incarceration.       The collaboration connects people to agencies that can assist       with employment, housing, transportation and other basic       needs, as well as access to mental health services or       rehabilitation programs to combat drug or alcohol addictions.                              Reentering society         In April 2021, 50 percent of people held in the Mesa County       Jail were on mental health medications, Mesa County Sheriff       Todd Rowell said. Mental health and/or substance abuse issues       are a significant factor in recidivism rates at the jail,       said Rowell. While people can receive treatment for these       conditions while incarcerated, they often lack continuity of       care once they leave jail and, thus, can be prone to       reoffending, he said.        In 2020, when overall arrests were down due to the COVID-19       pandemic, one man was arrested 19 times, Rowell noted. A       dozen other people were arrested four to eight times each.        ``I was frustrated. I felt people had almost zero chance to       succeed after jail,'' Rowell said. ``Life is hard anyways,       particularly after spending three months in jail. Finding       work is almost impossible. It's a benefit to any county to       understand those challenges to change the recidivism.''        Mesa County did not have a transition coordinator at its       jail until it hired Julie Mamo in 2019. She visited jails in       Boulder and Douglas counties to learn about their reentry       programs while creating Mesa County's program. The new       multiagency collaboration builds on the program Mamo founded.        Thus far, Mesa County has enlisted three agencies to       provide services to help people with reentry: Amos       Counseling, a Grand Junction-based counseling service;       Foundations 4 Life, an organization that provides substance       use disorder and mental health services to people involved in       the justice system; and the Freedom Institute, a nonprofit       that offers WAGEES (Work and Gain Education and Employment       Skills), a community reentry program within the Colorado       Department of Corrections.        The Freedom Institute has already been providing WAGEES       services for prison parolees in Grand Junction. Its new       county contract now allows the Freedom Institute to offer       those same services to the jail population.        Lisa Mills, Mesa County's behavioral health strategies       manager, decides which agency can best meet the specific       needs of a person leaving jail. Case managers are given no       more than 10 clients--the goal is to meet with people daily       if necessary--to ensure they are adhering to prescription       medications, able to access food assistance, acquire bus       passes, find employment and housing. Upon release, people are       met at the jail by an agency staff member for rides to where       they are staying or wherever else they need to go. The       agencies work closely with the jail's two transition       coordinators.        The county secured a $400,000 grant from the Colorado       Department of Human Services' Office of Behavioral Health to       fund the program. St. Mary's Medical Center and the Mesa       County Sheriff's Office each pitched in another $300,000 for       a total of $1 million.        ``It's a long overdue program,'' said Lieutenant Henry       Stoffel of the Mesa County Sheriff's Office. ``A lot of       people leave our facility and don't have basic human needs,       and so they often reoffend. We want to get them out of that       cycle.''                    Returning to prison for minor offenses         It's taken 45-year-old Gary Swenson 20 years to get out of       that cycle. His involvement with the justice system began at       age 12 when he was sentenced to a Colorado juvenile detention       center for a burglary he committed with a relative and two       friends. By age 18 he was addicted to methamphetamine. He has       spent half his life in and out of state prison.        Swenson said he found it challenging to meet his parole       obligations without a reliable source of transportation.       Public transit didn't exist in the Grand Valley when he       needed it, and he wasn't allowed to drive until he had       fulfilled parole obligations. Employers were annoyed that he       asked to leave work a couple times each week to attend       mandatory substance abuse classes. He also had to take time       off to submit weekly urine samples for drug screenings--which       he was required to pay for himself, along with the classes.        ``Your employer has to be real understanding, which they're       usually not,'' Swenson said.  [[Page H8685]]         He said most of his time behind bars was for parole       violations, including once for receiving a speeding ticket,       or on other occasions for missing those classes--all       violations for which he'd be sent right back to prison.        ``It was always a prison sentence,'' as opposed to       probation or a halfway house, Swenson said.        ProPublica (a national nonprofit media outlet that receives       funding from The Colorado Trust) recently reported on how       easy it is to be sent back to prison for minor offenses. The       number of people in Colorado who return to prison within       three years is 50 percent, one of the worst recidivism rates       in the nation, according to a 2018 Virginia Department of       Corrections report cited by ProPublica.        Douglas County's reentry program includes a jail       medication-assisted treatment program that helps people with       opioid use disorder. The county had a 42 percent recidivism       rate in 2021, which is lower than the statewide average, said       Nicole Beckett, the jail-based behavioral health services       administrator in Douglas County. Its reentry program includes       working with probation officers, pretrial officers, public       defenders and community behavioral health professionals.        ``It's definitely our goal to disrupt the cycle of       incarceration,'' Beckett said. ``People with substance use       disorders face risk of relapse, making them a challenging       population to help.''        Boulder County's reentry program added a housing       coordinator, Kim Smith, in 2019 to focus specifically on       helping people find housing in the city's extremely tight       market. People on probation are prohibited from leaving       Boulder County to seek more affordable housing elsewhere.       With such a competitive housing market, landlords can easily       choose not to rent to people with criminal records, said       Smith. The reentry program has seen an 80 percent success       rate of people avoiding recidivism.        Mesa County officials say reentry programs are rare in       rural areas due to a lack of resources. County Sheriffs of       Colorado, a nonprofit that provides programs and support to       sheriffs statewide, does not track the number of counties       offering transition programs.        While Mesa County Jail offers some programs in-house, it       needs more space, and continuity of care has been an issue       once people leave jail, Stoffel said. He would like the       jail's transition program to double or triple in size, and       said he expects reentry programs to increase across Colorado.        ``They're in treatment for 45 days; recovery is for life,''       Mamo said.                             Readjusting to life         In July, Mamo launched a program similar to one she       witnessed in Douglas County that helps people acquire       identification cards. A Department of Motor Vehicles mobile       unit comes to the jail twice a month to issue IDs.        ``Most people need two forms of ID,'' said Lory Villumsen,       a second transition coordinator hired in June. ``We process       the application to help with getting them their Social       Security card.'' The transition team is additionally working       on finding birth certificates for people.        Mamo has created partnerships with transitional sober       living spaces, reunited people with family members who reside       outside the community, and enrolled people in treatment       programs--sometimes out of town. The challenges of reentry       are similar, whether transitioning from jail or prison,       except lengthier prison sentences often means a person has       become more ``institutionalized,'' making it more difficult       to adjust to life on the outside, Mamo said.        People who are incarcerated are told when to eat, when to       sleep, what to wear and what to do; ``when people leave jail,       we need to empower them to make all these decisions,''       Stoffel noted.        Freedom Institute executive director Micah Espinoza hopes       that working with people leaving county jail will keep them       out of prison.        ``Once you're convicted of a felony, and have fulfilled       your sentence, you still pay for that the rest of your       life,'' Espinoza said. As part of the multiagency       collaboration, ``we're targeting people going in and out of       jail for typically petty offenses. Why are they committing       these crimes? It's usually poverty, homelessness, substance       abuse, mental health.''        Swenson said he's learned from his mistakes; he's been out       of prison for almost two years and is on unsupervised       probation for the first time. He works as a peer specialist       for the Circle Program, a residential treatment program in       Grand Junction for men age 18 and older with concurrent       substance abuse and mental health disorders.        ``There are people in this program I've been in prison       with, gotten high with,'' Swenson said. ``They see 'if Gary       can do it,' they can. It's me not forgetting where I came       from.        ``Instead of locking people up for possession, give us an       opportunity first to work with them,'' he continued. ``A lot       of guys don't want to be high, live on the streets, be       homeless--it's just all they know. Being part of this program       is a chance to see an opportunity.''     My concluding remarks include programs in Boulder  County that can be done.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, once you are convicted of a felony and have  fulfilled your sentence, you will still pay for the rest of your life.  We need to find a way where these individuals can contribute and not be  those who enter out and then go in. It is important to learn from their  mistakes, but we have got to help them.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support the underlying  legislation. Again, I thank those who cosponsored it and the main  cosponsor, Congresswoman Karen Bass.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3372, the ``One Stop Shop Community Reentry Program  Act of 2021,'' is a public-safety minded bill that would create a grant  program within the Department of Justice to support community reentry  intake and coordination centers.   The centralized centers opened pursuant to this bill would offer  those leaving incarceration the resources necessary to successfully  rejoin and reintegrate into our communities through DOJ and community- funded reentry programs.   There exists a great need for the programs envisioned in this  legislation, as more than 600,000 people return to their communities  each year after serving time in state and federal prisons, as do nearly  nine million people from county jails, while more than 2.5 million  people complete parole or probation each year.   Individuals with criminal convictions face daunting challenges upon  release. The overwhelming majority of those released from custody  receive minimal preparation during their incarceration and inadequate  assistance to get back on their feet after they are released, while  their convictions may limit employment prospects, educational and  training opportunities, public housing assistance, and access to social  services.   Even a minor criminal conviction can erect substantial barriers and  trigger far-reaching collateral consequences. Due in part to the  difficulty of overcoming these barriers, five out of six people who  have spent time in a state prison will be arrested for a new crime  within nine years of their release.   That is why policies designed to improve reentry outcomes have broad  bipartisan support, as demonstrated by passage of the First Step Act,  which incentivizes education and recidivism-reduction programs for  people in federal prisons.   While the First Step Act, Second Chance Act, and other initiatives  have been successful at the federal level, the majority of returning  citizens are exiting state and local facilities, and there is an  overall need for a more comprehensive approach to address the  challenges of reentry.   An example of the type of community reentry center supported by this  legislation is in Tulsa, Oklahoma where community organizations offer a  comprehensive model of reentry services. The services offered through  the Tulsa Reentry One-Stop have significantly reduced recidivism and  increased employment. In 2015, 77% of the individuals who successfully  completed their reintegration program remained employed after exiting  the program.   H.R. 3372 would establish a grant program to support community  reentry centers like the Tulsa Reentry One-Stop and ensure support is  made available for all individuals the moment they are released.  Support would include assistance with transportation, housing, and  skills training.   One Stop reentry centers would also assist reentering individuals in  obtaining identification and applying for eligible public benefits. And  those who have formal reentry plans would be able to find case  management assistance and court directed, wrap-around support at the  reentry centers.   In addition to the One Stop reentry centers, this bill would  authorize a second mechanism to assist individuals reentering  communities that do not have large enough populations of reentering  individuals to maintain a standalone reentry center.   In these communities, H.R. 3372 would provide grants to operate free,  reentry hotlines that operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, to assist  those recently released from incarceration with reentry services near  their homes. This element of the bill is particularly important for  rural and smaller communities.   Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle might argue that  the funding authorized in this bill is too high. But we know that the  high rates of recidivism of individuals leaving incarceration are far  more costly to American communities.   This bill would address a pressing nationwide need, providing  individuals with the tools and support they need to successfully  reenter society, ultimately, making our communities safer.   I thank our colleague, Representative Karen Bass, for her leadership  on this issue, as well as her bipartisan cosponsors, for introducing  this important legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.   Recognizing the high rates of recidivism in our communities and the  lack of access to reentry resources, H.R. 3372 would establish a  [[Page H8686]]  new grant program within DOJ to support One Stop Community Reentry  Centers.   When individuals lack access to reentry services such as housing, job  training, and mental health resources, they are more like to be  rearrested and reincarcerated. This bill would improve public safety by  reducing recidivism.   I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, let me rise in great enthusiasm for an  important amendment that calls for an evaluation and a determination as  to whether or not this is impacting positively those who are in the  program.   I have already read stories about Robert and a number of others; if  this program spreads across America to urban hamlets, villages,  counties, and rural communities, then we need to know how effective it  is.   I am almost positive it will be very effective as a worthwhile  investment for the 600,000 people who are released, but this amendment  will ensure that we have the right kind of amendment for best practices  and best evidence.    Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6878, the  Pregnant Women in Custody Act, because women's lives matter, pregnant  women's lives matter, their babies' lives matter, as do the lives of  incarcerated women and their babies.   I have worked on this issue for a very long time and am delighted to  be able to support this legislation introduced by my friend and  colleague, Congresswoman Bass.   This works to ensure that we recognize the increasing population of  women incarcerated. Unfortunately, women are the fastest-growing  segment of the incarcerated population in the United States.  Conversations about criminal justice reform often overlook their unique  experiences and the needs of women and girls within the criminal  justice system.   For instance, Mr. Speaker, the United States has the second highest  rate of women incarcerated in the world, with 64 women per 100,000 in  custody and nearly 60,000 pregnant women admitted into American jails  and prisons every year. That is a lot.   Some States have yet to prohibit the shackling of women when they are  giving birth. We have to do something.   This bipartisan legislation would establish Federal policies to  prohibit the use of restrictive housing on incarcerated pregnant women  and develop a national standard of care to add to the pregnancy-related  needs of incarcerated women, including access to prenatal and post- delivery care and support.   My legislation, the SIMARRA Act, also complements this by creating a  pilot program in the Federal system for mothers to stay with their  infants for a period of time. This humane response and the humane  response of this bill are what we need to do.   Oftentimes, pregnant women lack access to appropriate nutrition while  incarcerated, and the use of restrictive housing can have detrimental  effects on a woman's health, as well as the health of her baby. While  women of color are disproportionately impacted by incarceration, they  also face higher risks of both miscarriage and maternal mortality.   This bill would make certain that incarcerated pregnant women receive  vital prenatal healthcare and postpartum support and ensures the Bureau  of Prisons and the Marshals Service protect the health and safety of  incarcerated women through their pregnancy, when they deliver their  child, and as they receive postpartum care. They should not be  shackled, and they should not be intimidated or frightened.   The one thing I want to say, Mr. Speaker, even though many of us have  different views--and I am an avid supporter of the right to choose-- this is not an abortion bill. This is a healthcare bill.   We also know that the prisons make their determinations on how they  help women in their contraceptives. H.R. 6878 would allow BOP to  collect data on healthcare needs of pregnant women so that we may have  a better understanding.    Let me clearly say that separating a newborn from its mother gives it  less chance for both survival and success in life.   We know in Harris County, Texas, there are approximately 1,000 women  incarcerated in the Harris County Jail. This bill would require a GAO  study, setting national standards, and endeavor to do a landscape to  understand reproductive freedom in this country.    Mr. Speaker, that is why I was glad to see my bill,  the Stop Infant Mortality And Recidivism Reduction Act of 2021, or the  SIMARRA Act, included in the Violence Against Women Act, which passed  earlier this year. That bill established a pilot program to allow women  incarcerated in Federal prisons and their babies to reside with each  other while the mother is incarcerated for a period of time.   Mr. Speaker, let us continue to be innovators in the treatment of  those who are incarcerated, and let us make sure that we give every  newborn a healthy life. I ask my colleagues to support the underlying  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6878, the ``Pregnant Women in  Custody Act,'' because women's lives matter, pregnant women's lives  matter, their babies' lives matter--as do the lives of incarcerated  women and their babies.   Although women are the fastest growing segment of the incarcerated  population in the United States, conversations about criminal justice  reform often overlook the unique experiences and needs of women and  girls within the criminal justice system.   The United States has the second highest rate of women incarcerated  in the world, with 64 women per 100,000 in custody, and nearly 60,000  pregnant women admitted into American jails and prisons every year,  while some states have yet to prohibit the shackling of women when they  are giving birth.   This bipartisan legislation would establish federal policies to  prohibit the use of restrictive housing on incarcerated pregnant women  and develop a national standard of care to address the pregnancy- related needs of incarcerated women, including access to prenatal and  post-delivery care and support.   Oftentimes pregnant women lack access to appropriate nutrition while  incarcerated and the use of restrictive housing can have detrimental  effects on a woman's health as well as the health of her baby. And  while women of color are disproportionately impacted by incarceration,  they also face higher risks of both miscarriage and maternal mortality.   This bill would make certain that incarcerated pregnant women receive  vital prenatal healthcare and post-partum support and ensure the Bureau  of Prisons and the Marshal's service protect the health and safety of  incarcerated women throughout their pregnancy, when they deliver their  child, and as they recover post-partum.   H.R. 6878 would also require BOP to collect data on the healthcare  needs of pregnant  [[Page H8691]]  women, so that we may better understand the challenges incarcerated  women face and determine how to address the needs of this vulnerable  population.   In Harris County, Texas, on average, there are approximately 1,000  women incarcerated in the county jail and on average 25 to 30 of them  are pregnant. The jail offers specific programs for mothers to reduce  recidivism and help them support their families upon release.   This bill would require GAO to study state and local corrections  facilities to understand the services and protections provided for  pregnant women, like the program offered in Harris County.   Setting national standards for the treatment of incarcerated pregnant  women in federal custody would set an example for state and local  facilities to follow and the data collected by BOP would farther inform  Congress of the additional health and safety needs of this vulnerable  population.   As we endeavor to navigate a new landscape for reproductive freedom  across the country, we must recognize that incarcerated women will  continue to face challenges in carrying healthy pregnancies to term.   That is why I was glad to see my bill, the ``Stop Infant Mortality  and Recidivism Reduction Act of 2021'' (or the ``SIMARRA Act''),  included in the Violence Against Women Act which passed earlier this  year. That bill established a pilot program to allow women incarcerated  in Federal prisons and their babies born during their incarceration to  reside together with while the mother is incarcerated.   Let us continue to be innovators in the treatment of those who are  incarcerated. And let us make sure women receive proper health care and  humane treatment whether they are incarcerated or not--because all  women deserve proper health care and to be treated with dignity--no  matter their circumstance.   I thank Representative Karen Bass for her steadfast commitment to  addressing this important issue. I urge my colleagues to join me in  support of this long overdue legislation.   I include in the Record a Prison Policy Initiative document titled:  ``Unsupportive environments and limited policies: Pregnancy,  postpartum, and birth during incarceration.''               [From Prison Policy Initiative, Aug. 19, 2021]  Unsupportive Environments and Limited Policies: Pregnancy, Postpartum,                       and Birth During Incarceration                               (By Leah Wang)         Making up for a serious gap in government data collection       and understanding, researchers are discovering what pregnant       incarcerated women should expect when they're expecting (or       when they give birth while in custody). Findings indicate       that jails, prisons, and youth facilities have yet to       adequately recognize pregnancy and postpartum needs either in       policy or in practice.        Recently published findings from the groundbreaking       Pregnancy in Prison Statistics (PIPS) Project and other       datasets shed light on a common but rarely discussed       experience: being pregnant, postpartum or giving birth while       incarcerated. Spearheaded by Dr. Carolyn Sufrin of the Johns       Hopkins University School of Medicine and School of Public       Health, this series of studies is our best look yet at       pregnancy prevalence and outcomes in U.S. jails, prisons, and       youth facilities.        In total, 22 state prison systems, all federal prisons, 6       jails, and 3 youth confinement systems participated in the       PIPS Project, a systematic study of pregnancy and its       outcomes among incarcerated women. Historically, the       government has not collected data about carceral pregnancy on       a regular basis, meaning no national effort has been made to       understand maternity care for thousands of incarcerated       pregnant women. The project's sample represents 57 percent of       all women in prison, 5 percent of all women in jail and about       3 percent of young women in youth facilities.        Our takeaway: Carceral pregnancy, whether in jail, prison,       or youth confinement, is characterized by a lack of       supportive policies and practices. Some of the major findings       to come out of these publications are:        There are an estimated 58,000 admissions of pregnant women       into jails and prisons every year, and thousands give birth       or have other outcomes while still incarcerated. Pregnancy       rates among confined youth were similar to those among       adults.        In some state prison systems, miscarriage, premature birth,       and cesarean section rates were higher than national rates       among the general population.        Only one-third of prisons and jails had any written policy       about breastfeeding or lactation, and even where policies       supporting lactation did exist, relatively few women were       actually breastfeeding or pumping.        There are an estimated 8,000 admissions of pregnant women       with opioid use disorder (OUD) into prisons and jails each       year, but long-term treatment using medication is the       exception, not the rule.        A related (non-PIPS Project) study finds paternal       incarceration is also linked to adverse birth outcomes like       low birth weight, which are widely known to impact long-term       health.        The researchers' findings add complexity to a growing body       of literature and consensus linking incarceration to negative       health impacts. And although PIPS Project data can't be       broken down by race, ethnicity, or gender identity, measuring       the scale and outcomes of pregnancies in prison and jail is a       major public health research accomplishment. The fact that       academic researchers had to conduct this research to fill the       data gap--and the shortage of appropriate policies they       found--makes it clear that many correctional agencies have       yet to even acknowledge the needs of pregnant incarcerated       women.   every year, thousands of incarcerated expecting mothers and babies face              adverse outcomes from exposure to incarceration         Over the 12 months of the Pregnancy in Prison Statistics       (PIPS) study period, there were nearly 1,400 admissions of       pregnant women to participating state and federal prisons       with over 800 pregnancies ending in custody (births,       miscarriages, and others), and over 1,600 admissions of       pregnant women to jails with 224 pregnancies ending in       custody. Unsurprisingly, given the short length of most jail       stays, more pregnant women are admitted to jails each year,       but more births take place in prisons, where the average stay       is longer. Based on their data, the authors estimate that,       nationally, 4 percent of women entering prison (in line with       Bureau of Justice Statistics 2016 estimates) and 3 percent of       women admitted to jail (lower than BJS' most recent 2002       estimates) are pregnant.        Pregnancy outcomes in prisons and jails in some places were       worse than national trends across the general population.       When pregnancy did end in custody, in some states like       Arizona, Kansas and Minnesota, rates of miscarriage ranged       from 19 to 22 percent, exceeding estimates of the national       rate. In Ohio and Massachusetts, premature births exceeded       the general population rate of about 10 percent. Among live       births, which were 92 percent of birth outcomes in custody,       one-third (32 percent) of these were caesarean section       births, in line with the national average rate. In some       states, the C-section rate was much higher, suggesting that       C-sections may be taking place when not medically necessary,       risking short- and long-term health problems in babies.     pregnancy among confined youth is not uncommon, and better testing                   might reveal it's even more widespread         Upon hearing about the Pregnancy in Prison Statistics       (PIPS) Project, three juvenile justice systems (one state-      level, and one county-level system) volunteered to complete a       survey about pregnant adolescents in the custody of 17 of       their ``juvenile residential placement'' facilities,       providing a window into this population for the first time.       One takeaway from the survey's findings was that adolescent       pregnancies--both in confinement, and upon release--may risk       poorer outcomes because of a lack of continuity of medical       care between confinement facilities and the community. Even       though all three state systems provided basic prenatal care,       with the typical length of stay for young women lasting a few       months or less, justice-involved youth would benefit       enormously from consistency in medical care throughout       pregnancy.        The survey also showed that the rate of pregnancy among       confined youth (3.3 percent) was similar to that of the adult       incarcerated population (3.5 percent). However, the youth       facilities reported less routine pregnancy testing,       bolstering a 2004 study revealing that only 15-17 percent of       1,255 juvenile facilities nationwide tested youth for       pregnancy at admission (with about two-thirds of facilities       providing tests only if requested). Therefore, it's possible       the youth carceral pregnancy rate is a very conservative       estimate, and that thousands of pregnant youth are going       without prenatal care when their health needs are likely       complicated.        Eight pregnancies ended among youth confined in the       surveyed facilities during the 12-month study period,       including four miscarriages, three induced abortions, and one       live full-term birth. It would be misleading to view these       outcomes as representative of all pregnant confined youth,       but the authors advise youth confinement facilities to be       prepared for high rates of miscarriage and other adverse       birth outcomes, seeing as justice-involved pregnant youth are       going through highly stressful life experiences.        Services and policies regarding prenatal and postpartum       care were variable: All three juvenile systems allowed       abortion, and some covered the cost; all three systems also       allowed lactation through either breastfeeding or pumping.       Still, the small sample size (which represented just 2.8       percent of all confined female youth) and the potential       influence of self-selecting facilities make it difficult to       draw conclusions about the experience of pregnant youth in       confinement.      breastfeeding and lactation are not guaranteed to new mothers and           babies, ignoring the enormous benefits of breast milk         When the cohort of 22 prison systems and 6 jail systems       described their lactation-related policies to the       researchers, they painted a discouraging picture of how       correctional facilities largely don't support breastfeeding,       a practice chosen by some mothers for its unique benefits.        To begin, only one-third of prisons and jails had any       written policy on lactation, leaving many incarcerated women       to the whims of facility staff who may not be  [[Page H8692]]       trained in this area or understand its importance. Even where       women were formally allowed to lactate, milk was sometimes       discarded at the study sites due to mother-infant separation,       providing only a benefit to the mother of maintaining milk       supply.        Because it is a matter of health equity to provide the       opportunity to lactate and breastfeed (among other parental       choices), researchers extend the ``further research is       needed'' statement in order to understand the probable racial       disparities within carceral pregnancy: ``. . . research in       collaboration with current and formerly incarcerated women,       specifically Black, Indigenous, and women of color, is needed       to fully understand breadth of experiences and perspectives       related to breastfeeding and lactation while in custody.''     opioid use disorder among incarcerated women is treated under some         circumstances, but leaves mothers without help postpartum         In addition to known medical needs during pregnancy, some       women enter incarceration with other health problems.       Researchers accessed six months of activity and policy       related to opioid use disorder (OUD) treatment of pregnant       women in the Pregnancy in Prison Statistics (PIPS) study       sites and found that 26 percent of those entering prison and       14 percent entering jail had OUD. The gold standard of care       for these women would be medication for opioid use disorder       (MOUD), which is linked to better pregnancy outcomes and       increased engagement with addiction treatment and other       medical care.        Twenty-two of 28 sites did offer this avenue for treatment       of pregnant women in some way, but the narrow window in which       they could be treated for OUD leaves much room for       improvement. In most facilities offering MOUD, it would not       be initiated in the facility; they would only continue       someone on MOUD if they were already on it. This unfairly       excludes women who were unable to begin treatment before       admission; for example, if someone was in jail before being       transferred to prison, their access would then depend on the       jail's policy. Postpartum, most facilities providing MOUD       would discontinue treatment, showing a clear disregard for       the mother's well-being after birth.        Still, one-third of surveyed sites managed OUD among       pregnant women through detoxification, some with and some       without medication to manage symptoms. Detox, or ``medically       supervised withdrawal,'' can be a painful process and has a       high rate of failure for pregnant women, increasing the risk       of future overdose.        These exclusionary policies and practices are troubling       given the fact that opioid overdose is a major cause of death       for pregnant and postpartum women in the United States, and       remains a huge concern for formerly incarcerated people. In       Rhode Island, where MOUD has been implemented comprehensively       in their unified prison-jail system, there has been a huge       reduction in post-release overdose deaths; replicating their       initiative would have a great impact on carceral pregnancy       and postpartum outcomes.     the incarceration of fathers is also linked to worse birth outcomes         As if it's not bad enough that incarceration prevents       expecting mothers from receiving care and providing care to       their babies, another recent study finds that incarcerating       fathers during pregnancy or at the time of birth is also       harmful to babies' health.        In another recent study--unrelated to the Pregnancy in       Prison Statistics (PIPS) project--Youngmin Yi and fellow       researchers matched hundreds of thousands of birth records to       jail records in New York City between 2010 and 2016,       observing trends in birth weight, preterm (premature) birth,       admission to the NICU (neonatal intensive care unit), and       more. Paternal incarceration was associated with nearly all       adverse outcomes, even after other characteristics of mother       and father were accounted for statistically. ``Exposed'' to       their fathers' incarceration--even for as little as one day--      babies were born with these vulnerabilities, such as low       birth weight, known to have an impact later in life.   incarcerated pregnant people and their babies deserve better care that                           is codified in policy         The findings by Sufrin, Asiodu, Kim and fellow researchers       offer a desperately-needed look into pregnancy during       incarceration. And the findings by Yi et al. contribute to an       even more holistic picture of what it means to be a growing       family entangled in the criminal legal system. Families       experiencing pregnancy are impacted by incarceration whether       the mother or the father is incarcerated, and whether or not       the baby is born during the mother's incarceration.        Both adolescents and adults in confinement should be       afforded comprehensive prenatal care, including education,       lactation support, and opioid use disorder treatment that       continues beyond the end of pregnancy. And babies born right       after or during their parents' incarceration, who risk health       issues like lower life expectancy and social and emotional       challenges, deserve the chance to begin life with one or both       parents as much as possible. These efforts and programs       should be clearly written into agency policy so that facility       staff can be trained and expected to provide care.        One way that prisons and jails can begin to assess and       improve their care for pregnant women is by reviewing the       American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' recently       updated comprehensive set of guidelines for carceral       reproductive health care. Facilities should also consider       subscribing to the National Commission on Correctional Health       Care's standards for health services, which have clear ways       of addressing many of the above topics. Prisons and jails       should make their policies publicly available, and create       ways to keep healthy mothers and their babies together.                         note about the language used         Throughout these publications, the terms ``pregnant women''       and ``mother'' described those people who were pregnant in       custody during the study period. While we've deferred to the       terminology used by the authors, we acknowledge that       pregnancy can overlap with multiple gender identities, and       our conclusions and recommendations apply to all pregnant       people.
