 Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget  scorekeeping report for February 2019. The report compares current-law  levels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate agreed to  in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, BBA18. This information is  necessary for the Senate Budget Committee to determine whether  budgetary points of order lie against pending legislation. The  Republican staff of the Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget  Office, CBO, prepared this report pursuant to section 308(b) of the  Congressional Budget Act, CBA.   This is my second scorekeeping report this year. My last filing can  be found in the Congressional Record for January 10, 2019. The  information included in this report is current through February 25,  2019.   Since my last filing, two bills with significant budgetary effects  cleared Congress, the Medicaid Extenders Act of 2019, P.L. 116-3, and  the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019, P.L. 116-6.   Budget Committee Republican staff prepared Tables 1-3.   Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee  exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays  under the most recently adopted budget resolution and the fiscal year  2019 enforceable levels filing. This information is used for enforcing  committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the CBA. Over the  current 10-year enforceable window, authorizing committees have  increased outlays by a combined $3.4 billion. For this reporting  period, as in my last report, 8 of the 16 authorizing committees are  not in compliance with their allocations. Two of these committees,  Finance and Judiciary, further exacerbated their violations during this  work period with the passage of Medicaid Extenders and the authorizing  division, Division H, of the final 2019 appropriations bill,  respectively. For the Finance Committee, P.L. 116-3 was estimated to  increase budget authority over each enforceable period for its  allocation, with the largest violation, $120 million, occurring in  2019. For the Judiciary Committee, Division H of P.L. 116-6, which  included various immigration extenders, was estimated to increase  budget authority and outlays by $30 million over the next 10 years.   Table 2 provides the amount by which the Senate Committee on  Appropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This  information is used to determine points of order related to the  spending caps found in sections 312 and 314 of the CBA. Appropriations  for fiscal year 2019, displayed in this table, show that the  Appropriations Committee is compliant with spending limits for fiscal  year 2019. Those limits for regular discretionary spending are $647  billion for accounts in the defense category and $597 billion for  accounts in the nondefense category of spending.   The fiscal year 2018 budget resolution contained points of order  limiting the use of changes in mandatory programs in appropriations  bills, CHIMPs. Table 3, which tracks the CHIMP limit of $15 billion for  fiscal year 2019, shows the Appropriations Committee has enacted $15  billion worth of full-year CHIMPs for fiscal year 2019. The fiscal year  2019 CHIMPs were contained in the Labor, Health and Human Services,  Education and Related Agencies division of P.L. 115-245 and the  Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies division of P.L. 116- 6. This information is used for determining the point of order under  section 4102, overall limit, of H. Con. Res. 71, 115th Congress.   In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican  staff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget  totals approved by Congress.   For fiscal year 2019, CBO estimates that current-law levels are $2.8  billion above and $3.3 billion below enforceable levels for budget  authority and outlays, respectively. Revenues are $426 million below  the level assumed in the budget resolution. Further, Social Security  revenues are at the levels assumed for fiscal year 2019, while Social  Security outlays are $4 million above assumed levels for the budget  year.   CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate  pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. The PAYGO scorecard shows deficit increases  in fiscal year 2019 of $1,930 million--$427 million revenue loss,  $1,503 million outlay increase--over the fiscal year 2018-2023 period  of $3,337 million--$894 million revenue loss, $2,443 million outlay  increase--and over the fiscal year 2018-2028 period of $425 million-- $634 million revenue loss, $209 million outlay decrease. During this  work period, one bill, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019,  included a statutory exemption for the budgetary effects of its  Division H from the Senate's PAYGO scorecard. The Senate's PAYGO rule  is enforced by section 4106 of H. Con. Res. 71, 115th Congress.   This submission also includes a table tracking the Senate's budget  enforcement activity on the floor since the enforcement filing on May  7, 2018. Since my last report, no new budgetary points of order were  raised.   All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   TABLE 1.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--ENACTED DIRECT SPENDING ABOVE                    (+) OR BELOW (-) BUDGET RESOLUTIONS                         [In millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                         2019-     2019-                                               2019      2023      2028 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry     Budget Authority......................     2,414     4,249     3,123     Outlays...............................     1,406     1,820        70 Armed Services     Budget Authority......................         0         0         0     Outlays...............................         0         0         0 Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs     Budget Authority......................        21       285       382     Outlays...............................        20       285       382 Commerce, Science, and Transportation     Budget Authority......................        41        77        91     Outlays...............................        11        74        90 Energy and Natural Resources     Budget Authority......................         0         0       -14     Outlays...............................         0         0       -14 Environment and Public Works     Budget Authority......................         2         4      -333     Outlays...............................         2         4      -333 Finance     Budget Authority......................       326     1,058      -917     Outlays...............................       127     1,051      -919 Foreign Relations     Budget Authority......................         0        -5       -20     Outlays...............................         0        -5       -20 Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs     Budget Authority......................         0         2         4     Outlays...............................        43        48        49 Judiciary     Budget Authority......................        13       209       497     Outlays...............................        13       205       492 Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions     Budget Authority......................         0       -36       -84     Outlays...............................         0       -36       -84 Rules and Administration     Budget Authority......................         0         0         0     Outlays...............................         0         0         0 Intelligence     Budget Authority......................         0         0         0     Outlays...............................         0         0         0 Veterans' Affairs     Budget Authority......................         4         3      -729     Outlays...............................     4,402     4,400     3,668 Indian Affairs     Budget Authority......................         0         0         0     Outlays...............................         0         0         0 Small Business     Budget Authority......................         0         0         0     Outlays...............................         0         0         0                                            -----------------------------     Total         Budget Authority..................     2,821     5,846     2,000         Outlays...........................     6,024     7,846     3,381 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   TABLE 2.--SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE--ENACTED REGULAR DISCRETIONARY                            APPROPRIATIONS \1\                [Budget authority, in millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                       2019                                        ---------------------------------                                           Security \2\   Nonsecurity \2\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Statutory Discretionary Limits........          647,000          597,000             Amount Provided by Senate Appropriations Subcommittee   Agriculture, Rural Development, and                   0           23,042  Related Agencies.....................

Hon. Mike Enzi,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of       Congressional action on the fiscal year 2019 budget and is       current through February 25, 2019. This report is submitted       under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the       Congressional Budget Act, as amended.        The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues       are consistent with the allocations, aggregates, and other       budgetary levels printed in the Congressional Record on May       7, 2018, pursuant to section 30103 of the Bipartisan Budget       Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-123).        Since our last letter dated January 10, 2019, the Congress       has cleared and the President has signed the following       legislation that has significant effects on budget authority,       outlays, and revenues in fiscal year 2019:         Medicaid Extenders Act of 2019 (Public Law 116-3);       and         Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2019 (Public Law       116-6).            Sincerely,                                                        Keith Hall,                                                          Director.        Enclosure.

Sections 1001-1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255) require that certain funding provided for   2017 through 2026 to the Department of Health and Human Services--in particular the Food and Drug   Administration and the National Institutes of Health--be excluded from estimates for the purposes of the   Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (Deficit Control Act) or the Congressional Budget   and Impoundment Control Act of 1974 (Congressional Budget Act). Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do   not include $771 million in budget authority, and $767 million in estimated outlays. b. For purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as   approved by the Senate, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a   result, current level does not include those items. c. Pursuant to section 232(b) of H.C. Res. 290 (106th Congress), the Concurrent Budget Resolution for Fiscal   Year 2001, the budgetary effects related to the Federal Reserve's surplus funds are excluded. As a result, the   amounts shown do not include estimated increases in revenues of $655 million in fiscal year 2019, $570 million   over the 2019-2023 period, and $454 million over the 2019-2028 period. d. Division I of P.L. 115-254 provided $1.68 billion in supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2019, and   designated those amounts as being for emergency requirements pursuant to section 251 of the Deficit Control   Act. In general, the budgetary effects of authorizing legislation are recorded as direct spending or revenue.   However, consistent with the language in Division I, and at the direction of the Senate Committee on the   Budget, those budgetary effects are classified as discretionary spending. e. The Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L. 116-5), as amended, extended several immigration programs   through February 15, 2019, that would otherwise have expired at the end of fiscal year 2018. The estimated   budgetary effects of those previously enacted extensions are charged to the Committee on Appropriations, and   are included in the budgetary effects of P.L. 116-6 shown in the ``Appropriation Legislation'' portion of this   report. In addition, division H of P.L. 116-6 further extended those same programs through the end of fiscal   year 2019. Consistent with the language in title III of division H of P.L. 116-6, and at the direction of the   Senate Committee on the Budget, the budgetary effects of extending those immigration programs for the   remainder of the fiscal year are charged to the relevant authorizing committees, and are shown in the   ``Authorizing Legislation'' portion of this report. f. Section 30103 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 required--in the absence of a concurrent resolution on the   budget for fiscal year 2019--that the Chair of the Senate Committee on the Budget publish the aggregate   spending and revenue levels for fiscal year 2019; those aggregate levels were first published in the   Congressional Record on May 7, 2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also allows the Chair of the Senate   Committee on the Budget to revise the budgetary aggregates:                                                                         Budget                                                                   Authority         Outlays          Revenues ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Original Aggregates Printed on May 7, 2018:..................        3,547,094        3,508,052        2,590,496 Revisions:     Pursuant to sections 311 and 314(a) of the Congressional               921                0                0      Budget Act of 1974......................................
