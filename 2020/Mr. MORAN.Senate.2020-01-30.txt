 Mr. Chief Justice, I have a message to be sent to the  desk, a question. It is on my behalf and on behalf of Senator Rubio,  Senator Crapo, and Senator Risch.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senators Moran, Crapo, Rubio, and Risch for the  counsel for the President reads as follows:         Impeachment and removal are dramatic and consequential       responses to Presidential conduct, especially in an election       year with a highly divided citizenry. Yet checks and balances       is an important constitutional principle. Does the Congress       have other means--such as appropriations, confirmations, and       oversight hearings--less damaging to our nation?    Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you for the  question. And yes, Congress has a lot of incremental steps, a lot of  means short of impeachment to address friction or conflicts with the  executive branch. That was the point that I was making a moment ago  with respect to what the Department of Justice has said in litigation  today where the absolute immunity for senior advisers--actually, I  think it was a different issue in that case. I beg your pardon.   But anyway, there is a dispute in that case about information  requests, and the point the DOJ was making there is the Constitution  requires incremental steps where there is friction between the  branches.   As I mentioned the other day, friction between the branches--between  Congress and the executive--on information requests in particular is  part of the constitutional design. It has been with us since the first  administration. George Washington denied requests from Congress for  information about the negotiation of the Jay Treaty. So from the very  beginning, there has been this friction leading to jockeying for  position and accommodations and confrontation and leading to ways of  working things out when Congress demands information from the executive  and the executive asserts to protect the institutional authorities of  the executive branch, the sphere where the executive can be able to  keep information confidential.   But the first step in response to that should be the accommodations  process. And the courts have described that as constitutionally  mandated, something that actually furthers the constitutional scheme,  to have the branches negotiate and try to come to an arrangement that  addresses the legitimate needs of both branches of the government.   Part of that accommodations process is--or as it gets--as the  confrontation continues can involve Congress exercising the levers of  authority that it has under article I to try to put pressure on the  executive. So, for example, appropriations, not funding the policy  priorities of a particular administration or cutting funding on some  policy priorities; or legislation, not passing legislation that the  President favors or passing other legislation that the President  doesn't favor. Or the Senate has the power not to approve nominees. As  I am sure many of you well know, holding up nominees in committee can  be effective in some points, putting pressure on an administration to  get particular policies picked loose, things accomplished in a  particular department or agency.   All of these elements of the interplay of the branches of  government--that is part of the constitutional design. But impeachment  is the very last resort for the very most serious conflict where there  is no other way to resolve it.   So there are all of these multiple intermediate steps, and they all  should be used. They all should be exercised in an incremental fashion.  That is exactly what didn't happen in this case. There was no attempt  at the accommodations. There was no attempt even to respond to the  legal issues, the legal defects that counsel for the President and the  departments and agencies pointed out in each of the subpoenas that were  issued by the House committees.   And even the issue of agency counsel--there was no attempt to try to  negotiate on that. And that is really something that, in the past--even  last April, with the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform  with Chairman Cummings, there was a dispute about that. We wouldn't  allow a witness to go without agency counsel, and then we had a meeting  with Chairman Cummings, and it got worked out. And it was turned into a  transcribed interview, I think, and the--but agency counsel was  permitted to be there. But the committee got the interview. They got to  talk to the person. They got the information they wanted. But the  executive branch got to have agency counsel there to protect executive  branch interests. That is the way it is supposed to work, but there was  no attempt at anything like that from the House in this case.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The Senator from Massachusetts.
