 MALONEY of New York. Madam Speaker, I rise today in  support of this amendment, which contains my bill to crack down on  terrorism financing and the illicit use of anonymous shell companies,  called the Corporate Transparency Act.   This is one of the most pressing national security problems we face  in our country because anonymous shell companies are the vehicles of  choice for money launderers, criminals, and terrorists. Unfortunately,  the United States is the world's capital of anonymous shell companies.   Madam Speaker, my bill would correct this by requiring companies to  disclose their true beneficial owners to the Financial Crimes  Enforcement Network, or FinCEN. This information would only be  available to law enforcement and financial institutions so they can  comply with know-your-customer rules that were strengthened after 9/11.    Madam Speaker, I have been working on this bill for over 10 years,  and it would plug a huge hole in our national security defense. It  would also be the single most important anticorruption reform in  decades.   Madam Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Waters for her steadfast support,  as well as Congressman Cleaver and my Republican partners, Congressmen  King and Blaine Luetkemeyer.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
