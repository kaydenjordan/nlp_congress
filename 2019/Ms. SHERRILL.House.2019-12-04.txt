 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the taxpayers of  New Jersey. There are 12 days left in the legislative calendar, and I  urge the House to close 2019 by lifting the cap on the State and local  tax deduction cap, or SALT.   I will be here on the floor every day this holiday season  highlighting the impact of SALT on my constituents and on Americans  across the country for the 12 days of SALT.   And on this first day of SALT my constituents have said to me that  SALT is the number one concern they have. I meet teachers,  firefighters, homeowners, and small business owners who owed thousands  more on their taxes this year as a result of the $10,000 deduction cap.   Capping SALT deductions is an attack on New Jersey residents,  businesses, homeowners, and unfairly imposes a marriage penalty on  couples filing jointly. It is an attack on States that invest in their  communities--investments in roads, libraries, schools, first  responders, and teachers.   So I urge my colleagues to pass SALT legislation immediately and to  stop double taxing hardworking Americans.                            ____________________
