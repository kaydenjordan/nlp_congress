 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on an issue  critical to this Chamber setting an example for the rest of the  country.   Yesterday, the CDC issued guidance that fully vaccinated individuals  can resume indoor activities without wearing a mask or physically  distancing.   I am pleased to see the Centers for Disease Control following the  science and recommending that fully vaccinated individuals can go  without masks indoors.   As Members of Congress, we should not only encourage constituents to  get vaccinated, we should be showing them what a return to normal looks  like and follow the science.   According to the Speaker, roughly 75 percent of our Members have  received COVID-19 vaccinations, and, therefore, should have the choice  to go without masks. Americans are looking for hope, and we are not  showing it. Just as I implored on April 22, I am, again, calling on the  Speaker and Attending Physician to lift the rules and fines that  require fully vaccinated Members of Congress to wear masks in the House  Chamber.   Even The New York Times today said that the Centers for Disease  Control is  [[Page H2321]]  finally catching up to the science and so should the House. We must be  the leaders we were elected to be, follow the science, and have the  choice to go without a mask.   I am going to be that leader, and I choose no mask.                            ____________________
