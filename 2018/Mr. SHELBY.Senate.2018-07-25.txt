 Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to oppose the  Paul amendment.   While we all understand the desire to cut spending, the allocations  in this package before us are based on caps that were set in a  bipartisan budget agreement signed into law earlier this year. I think  we cannot go back on our word and our agreement and expect bipartisan  support.   We are working longer in the Appropriations Committee. I think we are  doing well at this point. We have a long way to go, but if we start  loading it up, the process will fall apart.   I urge you to vote no on the Paul amendment.
