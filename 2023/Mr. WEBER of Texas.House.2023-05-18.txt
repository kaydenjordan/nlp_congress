 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas  for his service to the people of Arkansas and the people up here in  this very humble institution.   Mr. Speaker, today marks the 5-year anniversary of the shooting in  Santa Fe High School where 10 innocent lives were lost at the hands of  evil. We will never forget that. We will never forget that tragic day  that has forever changed Santa Fe, Texas.   My heart and my prayers still go out to the family and friends of  those we lost, and I remain immensely grateful to the law enforcement  officers who responded to that scene at their own peril.   Mr. Speaker, it is often a good guy with a gun that stops the bad guy  with a gun. In Santa Fe, Texas, it was a brave law enforcement officer.  Let me tell you that disarming legal gun owners will never, ever make  us safer. There are, however, Mr. Speaker, steps that we can take to  secure our schools without infringing on our citizens' Second Amendment  rights.   There is no reason why our schools should be soft targets. We clearly  have the resources and the means to protect the most precious amongst  us, and that is going to be our children and their teachers.   Mr. Speaker, we should do everything we can to help school districts.  We can hire armed professional police officers to help protect our  schools, the kids, protect their teachers, and the staff.   Following the shooting in Santa Fe, I participated in roundtable  meetings to discuss that very thing; namely, enhanced security for our  schools. I heard about the need to emphasize safety in school  architecture and design. We heard about ways to encourage gun owners to  responsibly lock away their weapons, and the ways school marshal  programs can ensure that armed and trained personnel are present on  those campuses.   In response, I introduced a school safety package, Mr. Speaker. The  first bill in that package is the Protect Our Children's Schools Act,  which would allow the Secretary of Education to use unspent COVID-19  funds designated for schools and localities to reprogram those funds to  make our schools safer against those kinds of attacks. This money would  be used to strengthen and enhance security systems already in place at  those schools.   The second bill, Mr. Speaker, the Protect Against School Shootings,  or the PASS Act, would allow qualified law enforcement officers,  retired law enforcement officers, and those permitted by State law to  carry a firearm in an otherwise gun-free school zone.   Then there is the School Resource Officer Compensation Act, which  would incentivize school districts to hire retired law enforcement  officers to serve as school resource officers, or SROs, by exempting  the respective school districts from the additional expense of having  to pay matching Social Security contributions to anyone desiring to  serve in this critical safety role.   Mr. Speaker, it is a win-win-win. Schools get armed and trained by  professionals. The schools can hire those professionals at a reduced  rate and enjoy the additional savings. The law enforcement officer  professionals can continue to serve their communities by protecting  those very kids in their communities without financial penalty.   The last bill in the package is the Securing Our Schools Act, which  would enhance school security, including doubling school resource  officers, hiring more school-based mental health counselors, and  expanding the nonprofit security grant program.   Mr. Speaker, I think we all agree that we need to secure our schools  to ensure another senseless crime doesn't happen in our communities.   Today, I pray for Santa Fe High School and the families who lost  their loved ones. May 18, 2018, will forever be ingrained in me and  etched on my heart.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
