 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   I rise in opposition to this latest attempt by the Democrats to  increase their power at the expense of longstanding American traditions  and the Constitution.   Sadly, this is not at all surprising. Democrats have made it clear  that American institutions don't stand in their way of advancing their  political agenda at all costs. They want to pack the Supreme Court,  eliminate election integrity, defund our police, keep our borders open,  and prohibit debate in this very House. And D.C. statehood is just the  next step.   This legislation is an unconstitutional power grab designed to give  Democrats more votes to pass their radical socialist agenda.   As the majority leader just said, this is about two Senators. It is  not about principle.   The District of Columbia has served as the Federal district for over  200 years. The Framers understood the importance of Federal and State  governments having separate authority and recognized that States would  be ill-suited to house a Federal Government. And this was long before  the Democrats started making everything about race.   Now, Democrats want to disregard the Founders' vision, again, in  order to grab two more votes in the Senate. Political advantage is no  justification for policy that disregards precedent and the  Constitution. Therefore, I oppose this bill.
