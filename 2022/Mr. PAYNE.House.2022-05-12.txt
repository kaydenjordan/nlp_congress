 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 903, the  Transportation Security Administration Workforce Act of 2022.   This bill would provide the TSA workforce with opportunities to  increase pay, engage in collective bargaining, and appeal disciplinary  actions. It gives TSA workers the same workplace rights and protections  as other Federal workers.   Currently, the TSA workforce suffers from low employee morale and  high turnover. This bill would allow the TSA to better recruit and  retain high-skilled workers.   Most importantly for me, it gives a COVID-19 hazard bonus pay to  employees who had substantial contact with the public during the  initial pandemic, and it gives them resources to keep them safe on the  job.   This bill requires coordination between the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention with other leading medical agencies to provide  TSA proper guidance on how best to protect its workforce. I have been a  strong supporter of more protections and benefits for our critical TSA  workforce.   The chairman made it clear early on in my arrival here in Congress  that this issue needed to be addressed. So, I introduced a bill, the  Hazardous Duty Pay for Frontline Federal Workers Act, to give this  hazard bonus to TSA workers during the pandemic.   In addition, I helped pass the Rights for Transportation Security  Officers Act to provide TSA workers full collective bargaining and  whistleblower protection.   I cosponsored the Rights of the TSA Workforce Act to provide them the  same protections as other Federal workers. I also supported President  Biden's efforts to increase pay for TSA employees and hire more  officers at airports.    TSA workers are critical to the safety of American passengers, our  transportation network, and our Nation. We need to make sure they get  the same rights and protections they deserve to keep us safe and  continue to keep our Nation safe for the traveling public.   Mr. Speaker, I don't understand why this one group of Federal workers  has been pointed out not to deserve the same rights every other Federal  worker has in their position. It makes no sense.   For whatever reason that it was not initially there, it is time for  them to be brought into the system that the rest of our workforce is  protected by.   I would like to respond to my colleague's argument that TSA should  not move to title 5 because the system is somehow antiquated or  imperfect. I understand that the prior administration stood up the  blue-ribbon panel that recommended against moving the TSA workforce to  title 5, arguing that it would deny the Administrator the flexibility  to make TSA's personnel system better. Is it worth noting that the  blue-ribbon panel did not include a single labor representative or  expert with a labor background? This omission is very telling.   The truth of the matter is, title 5 offers structured rules for pay,  raises, bonuses, collective bargaining rights, disciplinary actions,  and grievances that TSA currently lacks in the system. Why? Why should  they be omitted?   Title 5 is time-tested and has been developed and tweaked carefully  over the decades. While not a perfect system, title 5 is significantly  better than TSA's current system in which TSA makes up its own rules as  it goes along.   TSA has had more than 20 years to develop a system that delivers  better benefits, protections, and compensation than title 5, and it  couldn't do it. How much longer should they wait?   Notably, even the TSA Blue Ribbon Panel recognized that TSA has only  used its statutory authorities to benefit management and not the  frontline workers.   That said, I am pleased to hear interest from my colleagues in  improving title 5. I would be happy to work with them in a bipartisan  way to address the issues for workers across the Federal Government.   In the meantime, we should put TSA under the time-tested system that  has worked so well for most Federal workers.                                time  1245     Madam Speaker, I rise today to address a serious problem  on the U.S. Supreme Court. Justice Clarence Thomas refuses to recuse  himself from cases where he has a clear conflict of interest.   Thomas' wife, Ginni Thomas, is a conservative, rightwing, zealot  activist, and she is reported to have worked to stop the legitimate  election of President Joe Biden. Now, Justice Thomas will rule on cases  that protect our elections and strengthen our democracy, the same  democracy that his wife wants to overthrow.   Unfortunately, the Constitution was not written for such conflicts of  interest. It was written by men who never imagined the Justices would  put personal interests over the interests of our Nation.   So, I ask Justice Thomas to make the patriotic decision to recuse  himself from cases involving the January 6 criminal insurrection, the  2020 election, and topics that conflict with his wife's far-right  personal work. Every day he refuses lowers the credibility of the Court  for more and more Americans.                            ____________________
