 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to praise a school in my  district that is going the extra mile to ensure that our heroes are  given the resources and opportunities they deserve.   On April 22, Paul Smith's College in my district will hold the grand  opening of their Veterans Resource Center--a project made possible  through grants from the Holder Family Foundation and the Fred L.  Emerson Foundation. This center will provide vets on campus with an  important recreational resource and place to study, as well as house  the Paul Smith's College Veteran's Club. Paul Smith's has a proud  tradition of service with our Armed Forces dating back to when the  campus was first built during World War II and was used as a U.S. Army  Signal Corps training center.   Since then, the school has upheld their commitment to our  servicemembers, working with several organizations to ease the  transition from service to academia for our veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to speak on the House floor today to  recognize the special work being done for our heroes by Paul Smith's  College.                            ____________________
