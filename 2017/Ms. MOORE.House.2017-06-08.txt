 Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the ``Wrong'' CHOICE Act. This  is a bad bill, and I suspect that Republicans are pushing it through  with only one hearing because they want to push it past the beleaguered  public who lost trillions of dollars of wealth and home value during  the last recession.   Republicans' rubric about freedom and community banks is not fooling  anyone. This legislation unleashes every bloodthirsty and greedy Wall  Street superpredator back into the American people to feast on our  misery like they did pre-Dodd-Frank. In contrast, you will actually  hear the GOP blame predatory borrowers and say that they caused the  crisis--like blaming hungry children for famines.   If this bill passes with the mere 10 percent capital requirements,  the financial system will become brittle, prone to systemic crisis and  taxpayer bailouts--a system that is less fair and rife with fraud.   Didn't we learn our lesson in 2008? 2008 taught us that we cannot  have sustainable economic growth absent good regulation.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to reject this bad bill.
