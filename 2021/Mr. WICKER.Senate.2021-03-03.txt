 Madam President, today I wish to recognize Mr.  Christopher Pickens, a Knauss Sea Grant fellow on the U.S. Senate  Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.   Mr. Pickens has had a significant impact during his time as a fellow.  His expertise on fisheries management and ocean sciences has  meaningfully contributed to the committee's efforts. He has worked on  several pieces of legislation that have passed the Senate or have  become law, such as the FLOODS Act and the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps Amendments Act.  His contributions will help improve ocean and flood monitoring to keep  Americans safe, promote deep sea ocean exploration, and inform the  stewardship of our Nation's marine resources.   I would like to extend my sincere thanks and appreciation to Mr.  Pickens for all of the fine work he has done and wish him luck in the  years to come.                            ____________________
