 Madam Speaker, March is also Kidney Cancer  Awareness Month, so I rise in support of all Americans suffering from  kidney disease and to highlight the importance of regular cancer  screenings and learning about their risks.   According to the CDC, about 37 million adults are estimated to have  kidney disease. Unfortunately, kidney disease is among the 10 most  common cancers in both men and women, and 1 out of 3 Americans are at a  heightened risk for kidney disease.   I also take this opportunity to honor and remember one of our former  colleagues and friends, Representative Jim Hagedorn of Minnesota, who  tragically lost his life last year due to kidney cancer.   Coincidentally, just recently, I found a letter he sent me just  before he passed. As Jim used to say, ``Please visit your doctor  regularly and get those annual cancer screenings. Early detection could  save your life.''                            ____________________
