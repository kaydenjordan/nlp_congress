 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Madam Speaker, as we are hearing from many of my colleagues tonight,  there is no shortage of policy failures to reflect on as we approach  President Biden's 1-year anniversary. But the one that is still beyond  belief and a complete disaster is the cancellation of the Keystone  pipeline project.   On day one, just hours after being sworn into office, the President  halted construction of the pipeline, bringing down thousands of good  jobs, many of them in my home State of Wisconsin and many of them in my  district. This decision undermined our country's energy independence  and destroyed a safe and efficient route to transport oil.   Oh, and now Russia is flush with cash as they market their oil around  the entire globe. That is right. Killing the Keystone project didn't  just stop the transportation of oil; it completely  [[Page H211]]  reconfigured the way that this works globally.   Listen, while President Biden continues to ignore the negative  implications of his agenda, my Republican colleagues and I have been on  the forefront proposing solutions--in this case, the Keystone XL  Pipeline Construction and Jobs Preservation Act.   Madam Speaker, after seeing the disaster that President Biden left in  his wake after only 1 year, I can only fear what will come in the next  3 years.
