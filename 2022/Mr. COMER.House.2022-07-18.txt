 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to discuss yet another  disastrous  [[Page H6704]]  economic record for the Biden administration: Inflation has hit 9.1  percent. Grocery costs are up. Gas prices are up. Nearly every  essential item for living is up.   The Biden administration's failed economic policies and congressional  Democrats' unchecked spending has put our economy on the verge of  recession.   In Kentucky, citizens are paying twice as much at the gas pump as  they did last year. In fact, Kentuckians have seen a 50 percent  increase in gas pries since last year and a diesel increase of 84  percent, which is detrimental to the farming industry.   Farmers are at their breaking point. The USDA recently reported that  farm expenses are expected to rise by over $20 billion next year alone.   I am hearing from constituents in Kentucky's First District who are  deeply concerned and rightfully so. Farmers are saying it is costing  thousands of dollars more per day to keep their farm equipment  operational due to the skyrocketing price of diesel. This is  unsustainable.   On top of inflation, it is clear that President Biden has made  diminishing American energy production a top priority.   Madam Speaker, Americans are in trouble. No matter how hard Democrats  try, Congress cannot spend their way out of this problem.                            ____________________
