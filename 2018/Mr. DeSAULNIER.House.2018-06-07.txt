 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the life and  service of Raphael Allen. I join his family and friends to celebrate  his life and his service to the Richmond, California, community.   Raphael Allen was born and raised in the Bay Area, where he attended  Stanford University. He went on to serve as an editor for Duke  University Press and covered a variety of topics relating to the World  War II Home Front National Historical Park and Rosie the Riveter Park  in Richmond, California.   In 2007, he began volunteering with the National Park Service at  Rosie the Riveter, editing exhibits, conducting research, and  developing interactive youth programs. He was also a ranger at the Port  Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial, where he assisted with  outreach programs at local schools and gave tours of the site,  including for myself and our staff.  [[Page H4861]]    Later in his career, Raphael was hired permanently at Rosie the  Riveter as a park guide, where he was instrumental in opening the new  visitor center. He also supported the development of exhibit content  and Rosie the Riveter informational films. He went on to develop a wide  variety of programs, which he often presented in the visitor center,  highlighting many untold average American stories that existed about  the park and the service.   Raphael will be remembered for his service and the mark he left on  our community and our country for ensuring its history was passed on to  others. He will be sincerely missed.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment seeks a modest amount of  dedicated funding for the repair and maintenance of existing equipment  in the migrating fish screen program.   Fish screens are an important part of the water supply infrastructure  of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta that help to protect fish in the  delta ecosystem. These fish screens work to prevent fish from being  drawn into various locations in the Bay-Delta Watershed where our water  supply takes in water. Fish screens in the delta are particularly  important for protecting multiple species listed or threatened as  endangered under the Endangered Species Act, including salmon,  steelhead, and delta smelt.   Fish screen components operate under water and are constantly exposed  to stress and damage that wears them down and makes them less  effective. Without proper upkeep, debris, sediment, and changes in  temperature can create gaps or holes in the screening material and  damage cleaning mechanisms.   While I appreciate that in its report the Appropriations Committee  has recognized the need for continued support of the fish screen  program overall, it is important that we include money specifically for  the maintenance and repair of existing equipment. My commonsense  amendment helps us to do that, I urge my colleagues to support it.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman's comments,  and I yield back the balance of my time.
