 Mr. Speaker, I rise to strongly oppose this  misnamed Republican bill, which purports to protect families and small  businesses, but instead, continues the unrelenting effort to starve the  IRS.   The only Americans that this legislation protects are tax cheats.   What is up with this conversation about how many agents are going to  be added?   The IRS has fewer agents today than it had in 1953, and our economy  is seven times larger, and our population has more than doubled since  then.   The characterization of the IRS as a militant government agency  deployed to harass unwitting small businesses and Americans is a  flagrant lie.    Our voluntary tax system depends on our taxpayers trusting that it  works fairly. We need to ensure that the IRS can examine complex tax  avoidance strategies of well-heeled individuals and businesses, period.   To do that, we need to help the agency modernize and transition away  from decades-old technology, and we must support the agency's capacity  to effectively administer a range of crucial tax benefits.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
