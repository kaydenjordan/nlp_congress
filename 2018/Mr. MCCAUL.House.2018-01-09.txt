Hon. Michael McCaul,      Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has       prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 1486, the       Securing American Non-Profit Organizations Against Terrorism       Act of 2017.        If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be       pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Robert       Reese.            Sincerely,                                                        Keith Hall.        Enclosure.                                   ____   H.R. 1486--Securing American Non-Profit Organizations Against Terrorism                                Act of 2017       As ordered reported by the House Committee on Homeland           Security on December 13, 2017                                   SUMMARY         H.R. 1486 would authorize the appropriation of $50 million       annually for fiscal years 2018 through 2022 for the Federal       Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide grants to       certain nonprofit organizations to enhance security measures       aimed at guarding against terrorist attacks.        Assuming appropriation of the authorized amounts, CBO       estimates implementing H.R. 1486 would cost $112 million over       the 2018-2022 period. Enacting the bill would not affect       direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go       procedures do not apply.        CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 1486 would not increase       net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four       consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2028.        H.R. 1486 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector       mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act       (UMRA).                   ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT         The estimated budgetary effect of H.R. 1486 is shown in the       following table. The costs of this legislation fall within       budget function 450 (community and regional development).  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--                                                     ------------------------------------------------------------                                                        2018      2019      2020      2021      2022    2018-2022 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                  INCREASES IN SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION   Authorization Level................................        50        50        50        50        50        250 Estimated Outlays..................................         4        11        21        33        43        112 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                             BASIS OF ESTIMATE         CBO assumes the bill will be enacted near the beginning of       calendar year 2018 and that the authorized amounts will be       appropriated each year. H.R. 1486 would authorize the       appropriation of $50 million in each of fiscal years 2018       through 2022 for FEMA to provide grants to nonprofit       organizations for improvements to physical security and       cybersecurity. (In 2017, FEMA allocated $25 million for such       grants.) Based on historical spending patterns for such       grants, CBO estimates implementing the bill would cost $112       million over the five year period and $138 million after       2022.                         PAY-AS-YOU-GO CONSIDERATIONS         None.              INCREASE IN LONG-TERM DIRECT SPENDING AND DEFICITS         CBO estimates that enacting H.R. 1486 would not increase       net direct spending or on-budget deficits in any of the four       consecutive 10-year periods beginning in 2028.                                   MANDATES         H.R. 1486 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector       mandates as defined in UMRA.                             ESTIMATE PREPARED BY         Federal Costs: Robert Reese; Mandates: Andrew Laughlin.                             estimate approved by         H. Samuel Papenfuss, Deputy Assistant Director for Budget       Analysis.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 1486, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
