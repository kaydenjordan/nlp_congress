 Mr. Speaker, I am from New York, and I rise in support  of the Raise the Wage Act of 2019 for workers in my district and  workers everywhere, particularly rural America.   The Raise the Wage Act is a long overdue minimum wage increase that  will lift wages for millions of Americans and boost the small business  economy.   Today, under the current minimum wage of just $7.25 per hour,  American workers and their families are living on the margins. They  spend nights at the dinner table having to decide whether to pay for  their child's school trip or groceries for the week.   If we are to build a better economy for all Americans, we must ensure  that our workers can make a good living and have a good life.   Poll after poll shows that small business owners support raising the  minimum wage. This is because doing so has been proven to help small  firms better retain employees who, in turn, are more productive and  higher performing.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a sign-on statement from  Business for a Fair Minimum Wage.       Business for a Fair Minimum Wage Federal $15 Sign On Statement         As business owners and executives, we support gradually       raising the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2024. It's good       for business, good for customers and good for our economy.        Workers are also customers. Today's $7.25 minimum wage--      just $15,080 a year for full-time workers--doesn't even cover       the basics. Raising the minimum wage puts money in the       pockets of people who most need to spend it, increasing sales       at businesses and boosting the economy.        Raising the minimum wage makes good business sense. Low pay       typically means high turnover. Raising the minimum wage pays       off in lower employee turnover, reduced hiring and training       costs, lower error rates, increased productivity and better       customer service. Employees often make the difference between       repeat customers or lost customers.        Raising the minimum wage is smart policy. It will reduce       the strain on the safety net caused by wages that people       can't live on. It will help level the playing field for       businesses and strengthen the consumer spending businesses       depend on to thrive.

Mr. Speaker, take it from the words of Rebecca  Hamilton, CEO of Badger Balm, a small cosmetic company in New  Hampshire. She said: ``Paying a living wage is a core part of our  culture and has helped us hire and retain excellent staff even in a  time when other businesses have struggled.''   We have heard businesses that started out small, such as the popular  restaurant &pizza, that attribute their fast-growing success to their  practice of paying fair wages while maintaining competitive prices.   Small companies make up 99 percent of U.S. employers, and nearly 70  percent of our economic activity comes from consumer spending.    Mr. Speaker, by raising the minimum wage, we can help  put money back into consumers' pockets, injecting new life into our  Main Street and our economy.   I ask everyone to support this important bill.
