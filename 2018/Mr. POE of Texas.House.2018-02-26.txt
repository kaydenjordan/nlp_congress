 Mr. Speaker, in the early days of 1984, Congress  came up with a unique idea: with Congress' support, President Ronald  Reagan signed into law the Victims of Crime Act, otherwise known as  VOCA.   This law established the Crime Victims Fund, with the sole purpose of  supporting crime victims throughout the United States. But instead of  using taxpayer money for the fund, Congress came up with a novel idea:  Why not force the criminals, the traffickers, the abusers, the scourges  on society, to pay for the restitution to their victims? They inflicted  pain and suffering on innocent people, so they should be the ones,  literally, to pay for their crimes.   Because of the new law, convicted felons in Federal court who are  assessed fines and fees pay into the Crime Victims Fund. The money in  the fund is used for a wide range of victims' services:   It pays for domestic violence shelters where spouses can recover from  their abusers;   It funds rape crisis coalition centers;   It funds children's assessment centers like the one in my hometown of  Houston;   It sends money to victim advocates throughout the United States who  go to court with victims of crime;   It gives victims restitution and pays for critical medical and mental  health programs.   It is a really good idea, Mr. Speaker.   Over the years, because our Federal judges have continued to fine and  assess greater and greater penalties to the criminals, the VOCA fund  currently holds--get this, Mr. Speaker--$12 billion. And let me make it  clear: This is not taxpayer money; it is money that criminals have paid  into the system. Criminals are paying the rent on the courthouse,  paying for the system that they have created.   So what is the problem? Here is the problem, Mr. Speaker: The fund,  every year, is robbed by the bureaucrats to offset other Federal  projects that are  [[Page H1230]]  completely unrelated to crime victims. For example, about $800,000 is  spent out of the fund, which has $12 billion in money, and over the  years, it continues to have more and more money because less of it is  being spent. In my opinion, these bureaucrats are literally stealing  money from the Victims Fund and throwing it into the abyss of the  Federal Treasury. That money does not belong to the Federal Government;  it belongs to crime victims.   Victims do not have, Mr. Speaker, high-dollar lobbyists up here in  Washington, D.C., advocating on their behalf. They expect us, Members  of Congress, to be their lobbyists, to be their voice. As a former  prosecutor and a former judge in Texas, I take that duty very  seriously.   It is the first responsibility of government to actually protect the  people. We must stop the robber bureaucrats from stealing money out of  the Crime Victims Fund and make sure that victims have access to the  resources they need to become survivors.   To achieve this goal, my friend, Representative  Jim Costa from  California, my cochair in the Victims' Rights Caucus, and I have  introduced the Crime Victims Fund Preservation Act. The bill is very  simple. It creates a lockbox to make sure that the money in the fund  cannot be used for anything other than victims' programs under the  Victims of Crime Act.   The Crime Victims Fund becomes an especially attractive target for  offsets at this time when our government faces any sort of a deficit.  That is why Congress must safeguard the fund to make sure the money is  protected.   The bill uses the money paid by criminals to help rescue and restore  victims and ensure that it is safe from the sticky, pilfering hands of  bureaucrats--and does so forever. So let the victims of crime keep the  money and not send it to other programs in the Federal departments  throughout the Nation.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, New York City lights, modeling, and  starring in music videos sounds like a script from a movie. So when two  young girls met a man they knew as ``Drey'' on Instagram, they thought  they had their ticket to the spotlight. Little did they know they were  about to be victims of human sex trafficking.   The 15- and 17-year-old girls headed to the airport, ready to check  into their American Airlines flight. Denice Miracle, however, was  working the American Airlines ticket counter when the girls approached.  She noticed that the teenagers looked nervous. They had too many bags,  no adult was with them, and they had one-way, first-class tickets.   Denise's training kicked in, recognizing the red flags of human  trafficking. She immediately alerted law enforcement, and they came to  the rescue. Thankfully, this story ends with both girls returning home  safely. They were not trafficked into the scourge of human slavery, in  large part, because of Denice, who saw something and said something.   We thank people like Denise Miracle for their work, for their  personal involvement in rescuing these two girls from evil.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
