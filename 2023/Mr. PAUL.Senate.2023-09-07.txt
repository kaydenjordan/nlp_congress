 Mr. President, the Flat Earth Society is champing at the  bit to bring back masks even though the Cochrane analysis has looked at  78 randomized controlled studies and shown that masks didn't stop  transmission, didn't stop hospitalization, and didn't lessen deaths. In  other words, the masks on a population level had no influence over the  spread of COVID. Again, the Flat Earth Society cannot listen and absorb  these facts. They want the masks to come back.   In addition, the Flat Earth Society also wants to mandate three COVID  vaccines for kids despite no evidence that COVID vaccines reduce  transmission, hospitalization, or death for adolescents. Yet, to this  very day, Senate pages are required to get three vaccines in order to  participate in the program.    I rise today out of a desire to protect the health of the young men  and women who serve as Senate pages. I think we can all agree that the  Senate wouldn't function very well without the pages.   The very first page was a 9-year-old boy named Grafton Hanson. He was  appointed by   Daniel Webster back in 1829. In those days, the pages  had to refill the inkwells and clean out the spittoons. Things have  changed a little bit around here since then. The work isn't quite as  messy anymore, but it is still a high-pressure job for a high school  student.   From day one, our country's response to the pandemic made the  comfortable more comfortable while the working class had to keep on  working. And now, in the Halls of Congress, a privileged class can  choose whether to get vaccinated while an underclass must abide by  COVID dictates. Think about it. The antiquarians of the Senate are not  required to be vaccinated, but the young, healthy people--at zero risk  for death from COVID--are being forced to be vaccinated three times.   To become a Senate page, you must get a COVID-19 booster shot, but  study after study demonstrates that for young and healthy people, the  risks posed by the vaccine are greater than the risk from COVID. Let me  be clear about that. This is for young, healthy adolescents; the facts  are different.   If you are elderly or infirm or have other risk factors, the risks of  the disease outweigh the risks of the vaccine, but for young, healthy  people, none of them will die from COVID. Almost all of them have  either had a vaccine or had the disease or both, but we are mandating  that they have three vaccines.   Study after study shows that it makes no sense to mandate COVID  vaccinations for teenagers who are healthy and that such a mandate  actually may be dangerous to adolescents. A study published last year  in the Journal of the American Medical Association Cardiology examined  23 million people ages 12 and up across Denmark, Finland, Norway, and  Sweden. It found that after two doses of mRNA vaccine, ``the risk of  myocarditis was higher within 28 days of vaccination.'' So they had a  risk of developing a heart inflammation within 28 days of the  vaccination compared with the group who was unvaccinated and that the  risk increased with each successive dose.   So there is a risk, particularly for the ages between 16 and 24, of  an inflammation of the heart, and it increases with each successive  dose. So if you are going to mandate three vaccines on a group of kids  who have zero risk of dying and the vaccine doesn't prevent  transmission, protects no one, all you are doing is adding a risk to  their health. And for goodness' sake, in a free country, couldn't we  let them make their own medical decisions?   This is exactly why European countries, including Germany, France,  Finland, Sweden, Denmark, and Norway, restrict the use of mRNA vaccines  for COVID. There are rules for young people. Yet the policy for the  Senate pages blindly commands three vaccines for young, healthy people.   A study published in December in the Journal of Medical Ethics found  that per million third doses, booster doses, of COVID vaccine, up to  147 cases of myocarditis may be caused in males ages 18 to 29; up to 80  percent of those diagnosed with vaccine-induced myocarditis or  pericarditis continue to struggle with cardiac inflammation more than 3  months after receiving a second dose.   Yet, remember, this is a group of people who have zero deaths--zero  deaths. There are no deaths of young, healthy people from COVID, and we  are mandating that they take three vaccines. We are supposed to be the  leaders in this country. What science are we looking at? What science  are we obeying? We are reacting in an emotional way. We are promoting  hysteria and leading with the wrong example.   Recently, Dr. Vinay Prasad and Dr. Benjamin Knudsen published a  review in the European Journal of Clinical Investigation that examined  29 studies across three continents. Six of the 29 studies showed that  after two doses of mRNA vaccine, more than 1 in 10,000 males between  the ages of 12 and 24 would experience myocarditis.   Think about it. To be a page up here, you send a perfectly healthy  young man or woman up here, and then you give them the risk of a  serious heart inflammation over a disease that is evolving every 3 or 4  months--such that the vaccine is good for about 3 or 4 months, until it  is no longer good--for a disease that was never deadly for children.   Initially, the argument was: Oh, we have to stop the children from  transmitting it to the old people. It doesn't  [[Page S4249]]  work that way. The only thing even the proponents of the vaccine argue  is that the individual vaccinated may have a reduction of  hospitalization and death, but those statistics only hold for at-risk  populations: the elderly, the immunocompromised, the ill. For young,  healthy people, there is no health advantage to being vaccinated, and  there is actually a health disadvantage the more vaccines you give  them.   It is actually medical malpractice to continue to mandate three  vaccines, whether it is in the Senate or in a university, and  unfortunately, the example that is being set here in the Senate is  being followed in other universities around the country of mandating  three vaccines.   A study published recently in the Annals of Internal Medicine found  that regardless of sex, among those ages 5 to 39, myocarditis or  pericarditis occurred in 1 in every 50,000 after a first booster. With  statistics like that, why would we think it is a good idea to insist on  boosters for our young, healthy pages who are in their early teenage  years?   We are taking the rights of the individual, their parents, and their  physicians to make a decision based on their risk factors and their  individual parameters, and we are making a blanket rule that says they  need to get vaccinated. Yet study after study is showing that the risks  of the vaccine exceed the risks of the disease for this particular age  group. It is the height of malpractice to subject young people to the  greater risk of vaccination simply to satisfy mandates designed to  protect bureaucrats from accountability.   Now, I am told that the Democrats will object to this today. The  Democrats will stand up and say they know better than your parents. The  Democrats will stand up and say they know better than these kids'  doctors and that, by golly, if you want to be on the Senate floor, you  have to have three vaccines.   Well, guess what. I have got zero. I am standing right here. I have  got zero vaccines. I had COVID in the first month of the disease. And,  actually, I would have gotten vaccinated, but I got the disease early  on, and then all the evidence pointed toward immunity being gained from  having the disease. So I didn't bother getting the vaccine. Members of  my family got the vaccine. We recommended that my elderly in-laws get  the vaccine. But the thing is, we made that choice.   And so here I sit without a vaccine, and I won't wear a mask because  they don't work either. Yet then we are telling them. In a month, are  we going to be putting them back in masks? The Democrats want everybody  in masks. They want the hysteria to return. Why? Because they don't  think any of us are smart enough to make our own decisions. They want  to make the decision for us. The common man be damned. The working  class be damned. Americans be damned. The Democrats are going to tell  you to wear a mask, and the Democrats are going to tell you how many  vaccines to get.   Well, the vaccine goes out of style. The virus evolves away from the  vaccine within a couple of months. How many mandates are there going to  be? Why not six mandates? Why not 12? Why not mandate the newest  booster that may be more effective than the last booster? Which one are  we mandating? They just have to get three vaccines. But it goes against  the science.   Let's say you even grant the Democrats that there might be some  science on the other side of it. Good. Let the individual make the  decision. Whatever happened to the idea of individual choice? Whatever  happened to the idea of choice with regard to your body and your  medical decisions? The hypocrisy is astounding.   Recently, Drs. Vinay Prasad, Tracy Beth Hoeg, and Ram Duriseti shed  light on some of the science surrounding this, on some of the efforts  to manufacture studies that artificially bolster the case for mandates.  In a letter published this July in the New England Journal of Medicine,  Dr. Prasad and his team question an Israeli study that the FDA and our  government--Democrats--are trying to use to justify forcing people to  take boosters.   This study, they said, shows a 90-percent reduction in death if you  take the COVID booster vaccine. And they kind of scratched their heads,  and they said: Well, almost nobody is dying anymore because the virus  has become less dangerous as it has evolved. More people have immunity,  either natural or vaccine immunity. To have a 90-percent reduction in a  death rate that is already very tiny just seems a little bit  unbelievable.   So they looked at the data from the study, and what they found was  that, actually, there was a 90-percent reduction in the booster  category for all diseases: cancer, a variety of--diabetic, heart  attacks, you name it; people died 90 percent less of the time if you  were boosted. It is like: Wow. A booster cures heart disease; it cures  diabetes; it cures cancer. No. It turned out the study was flawed and  that the group that had been boosted died 90 percent less of the time  just because you have got to select it out for a group that was very  healthy versus a group that was less healthy.   The study was flawed, and it took scientists with the courage to  stand up to the New England Journal and say: Look at the data.   The original authors of the data finally released and said: Whoops.  We made a big mistake here. Our study doesn't really prove what we said  it proved.   When the FDA approved boosters for kids, did they show that it  reduced transmission? No. When they approved vaccines for adolescents,  did they show that it reduced hospitalization? No. Did they show that  it reduced deaths? No, because no kids are dying from COVID. You can't  be less than zero deaths.   How did they approve the vaccine at all for adolescents? How did they  approve the booster? They said: If we give them a booster, they make  antibodies.   I confronted Anthony Fauci on this, and I said: Well, I can give you  a hundred vaccines. Every individual I give it to will make antibodies.  That doesn't prove you need it. You need to prove that it does  something.   If you give them three vaccines, will they transmit the disease less?  No evidence of it. Will they be hospitalized less? No evidence of it.  Will they die less often? No evidence. There is no evidence other than  the laboratory tests saying they make antibodies but no evidence that  they need to make more antibodies.   But one thing we know: If you are a young person who has had COVID  recently--even the CDC admits this: If you have had COVID within 3  months and you take a vaccine, you have a profound risk of getting an  overly exuberant immune response and having the myocarditis because you  have had the vaccine in the middle of an immune response that you are  making against the disease.   Yet do you recall anyone at one of these pharmacies that are all  handing out the vaccine and pushing it--have you had any example of  them saying: Well, have you had COVID recently? Maybe you should wait 3  months. No. Nobody is paying any attention to natural immunity. Nobody  is paying any attention to the natural course of the disease. And  nobody is really paying any attention to the danger the vaccine  presents to young people.   This is not a benign situation. This is a situation where the  Democrats are in favor of mandating a vaccine that puts their health at  risk. We are telling kids all across America: You cannot come up here  unless you get what the Democrats tell you is the best thing for your  health. And even though there are some scientists who say that it may  actually imperil your health, you don't get a choice; and you can't be  part of the nationwide Senate program, you can't be part of this elite  group, unless you submit, unless you bend the knee to the Democrats,  unless you say: My body belongs to the Democratic Party; my body will  be injected with whatever the Democrats tell me I need to do because I  don't have control over my medical decisions; the Democratic Party  does.   This is obscene, and the Democratic majority should be embarrassed  that they are here today telling us that American parents and American  families are not smart enough to make their own decisions.   In the letter, Dr. Prasad and his colleagues wrote that the  ``[u]nderlying health plays a substantial role in COVID-19-related  mortality'' and ``[i]nclusion of mortality not related to COVID-19 in  all observational . . .  [[Page S4250]]  studies would provide important context.''   So, in other words, it looks like the studies that may have shown any  indication that boosters might help were incorrectly performed, but the  vast majority of the studies have shown no effect on transmission,  hospitalization, or death. They do not exist.   I would love for the Democrats, when they stand up and talk about  forcing kids to do this, if they would present the studies for us that  show why or show that the booster vaccine actually aids in reduction of  transmission, hospitalization, or death of adolescents.   Even from within the government, though, some have resisted the ever- expanding booster mandates. In 2021, the Director and Deputy Director  of the FDA's Office of Vaccine Research and Review--not someone who is  opposed to vaccines, someone who has been involved with the development  and promotion of vaccinations his entire career--resigned, two of these  guys resigned, citing White House pressure to approve third doses for  all adults, writing damning op-eds critical of the FDA's subsequent  decision to do so.   One of these op-eds ran in the Washington Post and was coauthored by  Dr. Paul Offit--once again, not an opponent of vaccines, not an  opponent of the COVID vaccine, a professor of pediatrics and director  of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,  a longtime advocate of vaccines who has been involved in the mainstream  pro-vaccine community--objected.   As a member of the FDA's Vaccine Advisory Committee, Dr. Offit did  not support widespread boosting. He and two former FDA officials wrote  that ``healthy young person[s] with two mRNA vaccine doses is extremely  unlikely to be hospitalized with COVID, so the case for risking any  side effects--such as myocarditis--diminishes substantially.'' Dr.  Offit even advised his own son not to get a booster because he was  already well protected against severe disease.   So here we have advocates of the vaccine, mainstream scientists who  work in the vaccine community, who have been promoting vaccines for the  health of the community. These are not people opposed to vaccines,  saying they would not give a booster to their child; they would not  give a third COVID vaccine because the risks of the vaccine outweigh  the risks of the disease.   This really encapsulates the debate here. Your healthcare is about  you. You are not a statistic. The Democrats somehow feel you are a cog  in their wheel, and you are just supposed to do what everybody does and  do as they say. But really, your healthcare decisions are based on your  risks of getting COVID, your risk of dying, being hospitalized, or  transmitting it. It is about you. That is why you make the decision.  Instead, they want a blanket mandate. And by doing it to the pages here  and forcing them to submit to this, what they are doing is setting a  terrible example for the country.   One editorial put it this way last year:         If being ``boosted'' becomes a prerequisite for       participation in normal life, the vaccine's diminishing       efficacy means the booster campaign will never end.    What does that mean? The virus is evolving. It is like the flu. It is  changing every 3 or 4 months. The vaccine becomes outdated within 3 or  4 months. So if you are at risk, by all means, keep getting the updated  vaccine. We are not even mandating the updated vaccine; we are  mandating a booster and often a booster that is a year or two old and  has no effect at all on the vaccine, even for people who are  susceptible to this. But we need to let the individual kids and their  parents make this decision.   Dr. Marty Makary is a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine.  He wrote in the Wall Street Journal that ``[t]he U.S. government is  pushing COVID-19 vaccine boosters for 16- and 17-year-olds without  supporting clinical data. A large Israeli population study, published  in the New England Journal of Medicine . . . found that the risk of  COVID death in people under 30 with two vaccine shots was zero.''   So there is no science behind this. A large study of the entire  country of Israel, which keeps great records on this, found that kids  that had been vaccinated twice had zero deaths. Germany showed the same  thing--not just a few, not a small number, zero deaths among kids aged  5 to 17.   There is no scientific rationale for mandating three COVID vaccines  for healthy kids. Even the World Health Organization's chief scientist,  Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, said last year that ``there's no evidence right  now'' that suggests healthy children and adolescents need booster  shots. Even the WHO--one of the most pro-vaccine mandate groups you can  find in the world--has said they don't recommend booster shots.   Dr. Martin Kulldorff of Harvard Medical School says that mandating  people who have already had COVID still get vaccinated ``makes zero  sense''--zero sense--``from a scientific point of view, and it makes  zero sense from a public health point of view.''   A study in the Lancet supported this view, stating that ``[c]urrent  evidence does not . . . appear to show a need for boosting in the  general population, in which efficacy against severe disease remains  high.''   What does that mean? Why do they have efficacy? Why can they fight  it? Because they are young and healthy, and the disease seems to have a  predilection for the elderly. They are young and healthy, but they have  already had COVID. They have immunity. And many of them have all been  vaccinated. But we aren't demanding even just basic vaccination; we are  demanding three vaccines. And what we know is that with each individual  vaccine, the risk for heart inflammation goes up. It is less if they  have one. It is less if they have two. It is even more, though, if you  get to a third.   When we consider the rules for the pages, we ought to ask: Will these  policies be expected to continue indefinitely? COVID is with us  forever. COVID is now the new flu. Fortunately, it has become less  deadly over time. It was quite deadly in 2020, and each successive  evolution of the virus has made it less deadly. The death rate is  dramatically reduced.   Even at its peak, the death rate was about .3 percent, about three  times greater than the seasonal flu. It still meant a million Americans  died either from COVID or with COVID, but it is now lessened in  severity. Are they going to continue to tell us how to make our  healthcare decisions forever? Are Democrats so insistent that they know  better than everyone else that we will be beholden to bending the knee  and asking their permission to live? Are we going to ask permission  whether or not--they will come to us and say: To participate in life,  you have to be vaccinated three times. There is no science to back this  up.    When it comes to vaccines, although they can benefit the vaccinated  person if that person is in a risk category, in Denmark, vaccines were  not shown to have any impact on household viral transmission or  secondary attack rate.   Even the proponents of the mandates will admit, if forced to admit,  the vaccines don't stop transmission. The only thing they can hang  their hat on is there is reduced hospitalization, but that only exists  if you are in a category of increased risk.   Over a certain age, over a certain weight, have some diseases,  immunocompromised, there is some evidence of reduced hospitalization if  you have immunity. But actually, it is less so with each subsequent one  and really hasn't fully accounted for the natural immunity that people  get from having the disease, which still needs to be studied.   Multiple scientific studies have shown, though, that there is a  heightened risk of myocarditis--heart inflation--for children and  teenagers after taking mRNA COVID vaccine. That is why multiple  countries began restricting it for certain age groups. Germany, France,  Denmark, Finland, and Sweden all restricted Moderna's vaccine for young  people. Norway, South America, and the UK all chose to recommend only  one dose of Pfizer due to the risk of cardiovascular side effects for  boostering kids.   But what we are going to find out today is the Democratic Party  doesn't care about the science, doesn't care about choice with regard  to your medical decisions, can't even allow a debate whether you get  one, two, or three vaccines, but it is going to insist that, to be part  of the U.S. Capitol, the U.S. Senate Page Program, you must bend the  knee to the Democratic Party and  [[Page S4251]]  do what they say about your vaccines or you can't be a participant.   Why is the U.S. Senate choosing to ignore risks other countries  acknowledge when mandating these vaccines for young people who are in  peak physical condition?   Public health measures should be backed up with proof that the  benefits outweigh the burdens. There is no evidence of that when it  comes to vaccination and booster mandates, especially for teenagers,  who as a group are less vulnerable to this virus than any Senator.   That is why I ask unanimous consent that the Senate pass my  resolution to end all COVID-related mandates for pages who serve in  this Chamber.   Mr. President, as in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate proceed to S. Res. 332, which is at the desk; further,  that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the  motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon table.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S4251, September 7, 2023, in the left column, the  following appears: I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed  to S. Res. 322      The online Record has been corrected to read: I ask unanimous  consent that the Senate proceed to S. Res. 332    ========================= END NOTE =========================       Mr. President, the argument has been made that we should  leave these decisions up to a doctor. Well, the thing is that in  America we don't appoint like a doctor as dictator. We don't appoint  one doctor. You get a choice. You get to choose your doctor. If you  don't like your doctor's advice, you think your doctor's advice is  invalid, such as it is in this case, you go to another doctor.   In a free country, the decisions are made by individuals, and each  individual will assess their risk.   Now, the argument has been made that there is overwhelming evidence  on the record. That is just, frankly, untrue. There is no evidence--and  I don't say that lightly--zero--there are zero studies in any of the  scientific literature that show that a booster for adolescents reduces  transmission, hospitalization, or death--zero.   They only approved the booster to allow you to make the choice of  using it by saying that you make antibodies. Making antibodies proves  that vaccines work, which no one disputes. Vaccines work to induce the  production of antibodies. But the question is, If you have already had  COVID, do you need three vaccines if you are a 15-year-old kid? The  answer in all the literature is, you don't need that vaccine.   What we found today--he says: Oh, this isn't partisan. Certainly, it  is partisan. Do you see any Republicans over here objecting? The  Republicans unanimously support getting rid of this mandate. The  Democrats are objecting because the Democrats don't think that  [[Page S4252]]  individual Americans are smart enough to make their own decisions. The  Democrats don't think that these kids and their parents and their  doctors can make their decision. They don't believe in choice when it  comes to medical decision making. They believe that they know better.   But in this case, it isn't just a matter of taking something that is  ineffective; it is mandating a vaccine that threatens the health and  well-being of these kids--not just a vaccine, mandating three vaccines  with no mention of even whether the kids have already had COVID, which  is essentially another inoculation.   So this is a disappointing day, but this is consistent with what we  have seen time and again, whether it is having a nationwide emergency  mandating that you wear masks in school, masks on planes, vaccines  here, vaccines there. This is a desire by the majority party to control  your life, to control your medical decision making because they know  better.   They want to beg off and say this is about the science. I recited 15  different studies for them. They didn't recite one study because no  study exists saying that three vaccines for kids reduces  hospitalization, transmission, or death. There is no science. Large,  nationwide studies of this problem have gotten a dozen countries to say  we shouldn't be giving three vaccines to kids. Half of Europe won't  allow you to do it. They won't allow the mandates.   The argument is made, oh, well, we have to do what everybody is doing  in schools. Even the colleges--90 percent of the colleges aren't  requiring this. This was a bad mandate from the beginning. Most of the  colleges have woken up and understand now, one, that this is America  and you ought to be able to make your own medical decisions, but, two,  that the science points towards booster vaccine mandates actually being  a threat to the health and well-being of adolescents.   I am very disappointed, but I think this illustrates where we are in  America, where one party thinks they are smarter than every American,  smarter than every individual, and they will make your medical  decisions for you.   I rest my case.
