 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to honor the legacy of the  late  [[Page H207]]  Congresswoman Barbara Rose-Collins, Michigan's first African-American  Congresswoman. She was a trailblazer who inspired many women to seek  public office.   Congresswoman Rose-Collins got her start in public service as a  member of the Detroit public school board. She served as a Michigan  State legislator and a Detroit City Council member before being elected  to the United States Congress in 1990.   During her tenure in the U.S. Congress, Congresswoman Rose-Collins  advocated for food and agriculture policies to assist communities with  food insecurity.   She was a fierce defender of human rights in Detroit, across the  country, and abroad. She dedicated her career to making our community  stronger and our country better.   Please join me in recognition of Congresswoman Barbara Rose-Collins'  many years of dedicated public service as we honor her memory.                            ____________________
