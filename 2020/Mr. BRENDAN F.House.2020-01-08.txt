 BOYLE of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission  to address the House for 1 minute.)    BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, recently, I went  on a tour of a public elementary school in my district, a school I  attended.   As I describe what I saw, I want everyone in this body to imagine  having to send your child to a school with these conditions: mold- covered ceilings, exposed wires and pipes, and lead paint chipping down  the walls.   These issues are felt across my city of Philadelphia. Three schools  in my district have had to close this school year because of asbestos.   Schools should foster an environment that stimulates intellectual  curiosity. Instead, our students and teachers are surrounded by health  hazards. That is why I urge this House, later this year, when we  consider a comprehensive infrastructure package, to ensure that we  include rehabbing and rebuilding America's schools.   We cannot leave our Nation's kids and educators behind.                            ____________________
