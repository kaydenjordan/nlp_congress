 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for  yielding.   The Bible, wow, what a book. You know, Billy Graham said in the 1950s  in one of his early books called ``Peace with God,'' he said:         There is one thing that has never changed since day one of       creation. The truth has always been the truth, and it always       will be. There is only one place to go to find that truth,       and that is in God's Holy Word, the Bible.    You know, I think our Founders understood that nearly 2,000 years  before Billy Graham ever spoke those words on the floor of the  Constitutional Convention. Benjamin Franklin, in a moment of  frustration because they were at an impasse trying to write the  Constitution of the United States, brought focus to what was happening  on the Convention floor. He was recognized by the President of the  Convention, George Washington, and he stood up and said these words:         I have lived long, sir, and the longer I live and the more       I see, the more convincing proof I see of this truth that God       deals in the affairs of men. And if a sparrow can't fall from       the sky without His notice, how do we think it probable that       an empire can rise without His aid?    Other Founders understood where the truth was to be found. John Adams  went on to say:         The Constitution of the United States is a document       designed to govern a moral and religious people, and it is       wholly inadequate for any other.    I believe that is because our Founders understood that to be a self- governing people, we had to be grounded in our faith. We had to be  self-responsible people and that there were no more self-responsible  people on the planet than those who lived by the truth contained in the  Scriptures.   My prayer for our country and for each of us today is that we would  live by the prayer that Paul prayed to the church in Ephesus:         That God would send His Holy Spirit to give us His wisdom       and His revelation that we might know Him better because it       is only knowing God better that we can understand the truths       that lie in that precious book, the Bible.
