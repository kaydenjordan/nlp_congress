 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in  morning business for up to 5 minutes.    Madam President, I rise to speak about yesterday's  horrific tragedy in Texas, and I won't be long; I know we have votes  coming up.   But I wanted to start by expressing, I think, both the grief and the  outrage that we see all across the country that,  [[Page S2680]]  yet again--and not just another tragedy. In this case, the death of the  19 children and 2 adults, at least that is the latest reporting, but  also indicating that the deaths took place because an armed gunman came  into a school with body armor protecting him from the response from any  law enforcement.   So we have another example, in barely less than a week, where a  gunman goes into a setting in a grocery store in Buffalo, NY, and now  into a school where second graders, third graders, and fourth graders  are killed because he has a high-powered weapon, and he is fully  protected from any law enforcement or any other response. And we are  supposed to just get used to this, I guess. That seems to be the  response here in Washington.   Now, this isn't a problem of Congress, more broadly, or the executive  branch of our government. This is a problem--the failure to address  this problem, even to pass something as simple as background check  legislation--this is a problem in the Senate of one side. You have got  50 U.S. Senators who are Republicans who have refused now for years to  pass anything remotely resembling commonsense gun measures.   I would support a whole series of bills that we could talk about. We  don't have time today. But at least the U.S. Senate should be able to  pass a background check bill supported by 90 percent of the American  people.   And you have to ask, why is that? And it is not simply that you have  so many Republicans who are beholden to the gun lobby. That is obvious.  That is right in front of us.   The other problem is--and I think it is related to the question of  the power of the gun lobby in one party--you have got a whole party  that seems to want to surrender to this problem, to throw up their  hands and say: ``There is nothing the most powerful Nation in the world  can do, nothing at all the most powerful nation in the world can do to  stop the killing, over and over again, of Americans,'' and especially  in the context of the horror--the unspeakable horror--yesterday of  second, third, and fourth graders being gunned down in a manner that is  so horrific that some of them can't be identified because of the power  of the weapon and the number of bullets that can be discharged in a  matter of seconds. So even if law enforcement gets there and isn't  confronting body armor, no law enforcement is fast enough to get to a  scene in seconds to prevent a horrific mass shooting.   So we are supposed to accept the fact, as Americans--I guess this is  what the Republican position is--that we should surrender to this  problem. The most powerful Nation in the world can't stop second,  third, and fourth graders from being murdered in schools. The most  powerful country in the world, I guess, can't prevent the shooting we  saw in Buffalo. And you can go down the list of other tragedies.   This is a uniquely American problem. No other country that is  similarly situated--has an economy like ours as a country even close to  what we have--no other country has this problem and has any kind of  change or reform or action being blocked by one side. And I know there  is work that has to be done at the State legislative level and all  that.   But right here, we could vote this week on a background check bill,  and it would be supported overwhelmingly.   But think about this, and I will end with this. Think about if we had  the same attitude about 9/11. What if someone said right after 9/11:  ``You know what, there is really nothing we can do as Americans to stop  a foreign terrorist from taking an airplane into a building or crashing  an airplane into the Pentagon or the plane that went down in  Pennsylvania. There is nothing we can do about that so we just have to  get used to that reality of terrorists doing that to our country''? No  one would say that--then or now. We created an entire new Agency, the  Department of Homeland Security. And guess what, a lot of those reforms  that we made to protect Americans against terrorism worked. Just like  no one said years ago, when we had these viruses and the potential of  pandemics, that we shouldn't do anything about it even though we have  the knowledge and the skill to create a vaccine.   We invested. We did what Americans do--confronted a big problem and  did something about it.   What if during World War II, what if everyone stood up and said:  ``You know, the Axis nations are pretty powerful. Those nations are  pretty powerful. They have the most well-funded, sophisticated armies  in the world, and there is nothing we can do in 1941 to take on the  Axis powers''? We didn't say that.   It is un-American to surrender--to surrender to a problem. Now you  have an entire political party in this Chamber that has not just  surrendered to the lobby--that is objectionable and insulting enough-- but they surrendered to the problem; that there is nothing we can do  about it. That, I would submit, is un-American. And it is about time  that the Republicans in the Senate begin to be part of the solution to  do something that Americans do all the time--confronting evil, like we  did after 9/11; confronting terrorism or disease or whatever it is; and  in this case to confront gun violence and do something about it, not  sit around and pretend that there is nothing we can do. That is un- American.   We don't surrender. We are Americans. We take on tough problems like  our entire history has shown. But we haven't taken on this problem.   What we should be saying to these families, in addition to offering  our sympathy, is: Your government has failed you. Your government at  the Federal level and your government at the State level, it has failed  you. And in this case and in this Chamber it has failed because one  side will not even entertain the idea of passing any gun measures. They  have surrendered.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
