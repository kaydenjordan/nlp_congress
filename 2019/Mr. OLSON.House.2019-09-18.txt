 Madam Speaker, I rise to honor an extraordinary leader on  her retirement, Carol Smolenski.   She has been involved in ECPAT for 20 years as the executive  director, a renowned organization with a single mission: end child  exploitation and trafficking.   Two decades ago, Carol noticed that America did not have an ECPAT- like organization like some other nations had, and so she took charge.  ECPAT-USA was born.   Carol's mission has been pure and simple: raise awareness of modern- day slavery in America and end human trafficking in our world.   As Carol moves on, I would like to let her hear some Texas wisdom.  Carol may not be in a class by herself, but whatever class she is in,  it don't take long to call the roll. I thank Carol. She has saved  lives.                            ____________________
