 Mr. Speaker, for those with silk stockings, it is a very  Merry Christmas indeed. The billionaires get stuffed, but we get coal.  It is like a White Elephant gift exchange. The billionaires grab the  good gifts, and the leftovers go to working families, though they get  the bill for everything.   How many millions of dollars the Trump family will personally stuff  in their pockets cannot be precisely determined, only because of  continuing Republican collusion to cover up Trump's personal tax  returns.   Excluding the public, refusing to even permit Democrats to offer an  amendment, Republicans dumped this proposal out this weekend and now  demand an immediate vote. The dangers lurking in this bill for economic  opportunity, for tax fairness, are very real, but they are overshadowed  by the dangers to our democracy from these Trump tactics to impose his  rule on America.   Republicans decided the only way to pass their program was to hide  it. Let's reject it today.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, the world's biggest corporate tax dodgers  get the most out of this bill: a 40 percent reduction in the corporate  tax rate and the right to bring back those profits they have hidden in  Caribbean hideaways for pennies on the dollar.   Another loophole will encourage jobs in America to be exported  abroad, a long commute to work if the job is in Europe or in Asia.   Of course, they have camouflaged this corporate tax giveaway with  some changes for individuals.   Who gets those?   Well, it is a Who's Who of not you: the Trump family, real estate  moguls, and their millionaire buddies.   Disguised as a middle-class tax relief, this wretched bill targets  the middle class with a dime of every dollar that is in the bill. What  most Americans will really get is more debt and the coming cuts that  these Republicans will insist on making to Medicare, Medicaid, and  educational opportunity.   Tax fraud is criminal, but passing this fraudulent tax bill  apparently is not.    Mr. Speaker, between tweets, Trump apparently had time  to take those calls from his rich friends that kept asking for more.  Not even this lapdog Republican Congress initially did enough to  satisfy the Trump family and their billionaire buddies.   Instead of adjusting the differences between the House and the  Senate, Republican conferees, last week, secretly concocted even more  benefits for them. Those real estate moguls, like Trump, who had  already been granted preferential tax treatment, can now take advantage  of an entirely new loophole that was not in either of the previous  bills.   Just in case their endless loopholes left some donor behind, the  Republicans have provided a new, across-the-board tax cut for  billionaires. It is working families who will pay to put the platinum  tinsel on this Christmas tree for the elite.   This is not tax reform. It is a reward for the privileged. It is a  Christmas where working people get to keep the gift wrapping, but the  wealthy and corporate tax dodgers get the gift.
