 Madam Speaker, I rise to speak in support  of my bill, the Women Veterans TRUST Act, a bill that aims to address  the need for women-specific programs that treat veterans with drug and  alcohol dependency.   The over 2 million women veterans who live in the United States face  unique challenges that far too often are not appropriately addressed.  Women veterans have higher rates of post-traumatic stress that can lead  to substance abuse. Tragically, women veterans with substance-use  disorders often have higher rates of suicide than their nonveteran  peers.   To address this crisis, women-specific programs make all the  difference. As chair of the Women's Veterans Task Force, I have heard  how critical these treatment programs are to saving lives.   Madam Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to cosponsor this  important bill to ensure our Nation's women veterans have the resources  and programs they need to thrive.                            ____________________
