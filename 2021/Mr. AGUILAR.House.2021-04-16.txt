 Madam Speaker, earlier this week, we marked the 100th  day of the 117th Congress, and I rise today to reflect on some of the  progress we have made in the House.   In our first 100 days, we passed the Equality Act to ensure full  equality under the law for our LGBT community.   We removed the ratification deadline from the ERA to extend that same  equality to all American women.   We passed the Dream and Promise Act, giving young immigrants who call  this country home a chance to build their lives here.   We passed the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to reform our  broken system of policing.   We took meaningful, lifesaving action to prevent gun violence and  stop further tragedies.   The recent tragedies our country has endured have further highlighted  the need for the Senate to take action quickly on these bills.   We passed the American Rescue Plan, the most important and ambitious  investment in the American people into nearly a century. This bold  legislation gives us a roadmap to help us build back better and to  emerge from this pandemic stronger than ever. It has helped 50 percent  of Americans receive a lifesaving vaccine and put money in the pockets  of people.   I am so proud of all we have achieved, and I know our work is just  getting started.                            ____________________
