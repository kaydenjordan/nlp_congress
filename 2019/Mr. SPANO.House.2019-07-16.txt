 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the 50th anniversary of  the Apollo 11 Moon landing.   Fifty years ago, Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins  launched from Florida's coast at Kennedy Space Center with the goal of  being the first to step foot on the Moon.   On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong accomplished what was only a short  time prior believed to be impossible. He became the first man to set  foot on the Moon, uttering the famous words, ``That's one small step  for man, one giant leap for mankind.''   Those words ring through history, but it is important that we also  recognize the hundreds of scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and  support staff who worked tirelessly to ensure mission success but do  not receive the public recognition that they deserve for their  contributions.   One example of this is Susan Finley. She began her career as a  computer programmer at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory and wrote  software for the Deep Space Network. That software made it possible to  hear the transmissions from the Moon that showed the world what was  possible when the United States committed to achieving the impossible.   I am also incredibly proud that 50 years after this accomplishment,  Florida remains at the forefront of space exploration. Today, the new  crew capsules designed to launch American astronauts into space are  being built, and I hope that by the end of this year, in which we are  celebrating the first Moon landing, we will again see American  astronauts climb into American-built capsules and launch into space  from Florida's shores.   We have relied on Russian spacecraft for too long, and this will  inspire a new generation of American children to develop a passion for  exploration and to pursue science, technology, engineering, and  mathematics education, just as the Apollo program did 50 years ago when  Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin became the first to set foot on the  Moon.   President George Bush said: ``Mankind is drawn to the heavens for the  same reason we were once drawn into unknown lands and across the open  sea. We choose to explore space because doing so improves our lives and  lifts our national spirit. So let us continue the journey.''              Congratulating Michaela McLean, Miss Florida 2019     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Michaela McLean  on her crowning achievement of being named Miss Florida 2019.   Michaela, a graduate of East Ridge High School in Clermont, Florida,  and  [[Page H5832]]  daughter of two citrus growers, is no stranger to pageants, as she had  also previously been named Miss Florida Citrus.   To win this latest competition, she was able to showcase her skills  as a collegiate dance major, a talent she uses to express her dreams  and her struggles.   She has plans now to use her other college major of public relations  to help promote Florida's economic and cultural strengths.   Michaela will promote her social impact initiative called Brave &  Beautiful, which encourages women to develop healthy habits while  living purpose-driven lives. Brave & Beautiful has already launched  conferences in multiple schools in central Florida and has made an  impact internationally in Kenya, Guatemala, and the Dominican Republic.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to hear how Michaela is using her many gifts  to help transform lives, and I applaud her efforts. She is a wonderful  role model for our young women.                            ____________________
