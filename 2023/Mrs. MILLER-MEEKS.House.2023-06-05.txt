 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  extraordinary life of former Bettendorf Mayor Ann Hutchinson, who  passed away at age 74 this past week. She dedicated her life to the  Bettendorf community, serving as mayor for 16 years, until 2003.   When Mayor Hutchinson took office, Bettendorf was struggling to  survive financially. She got the city back on sound economic footing  and accomplished a wide range of projects, including revitalizing  downtown Bettendorf, building the Learning Campus with a library and  the Family Museum, and started plans for the new I-74 bridge, which  just opened last year.   After her time as mayor, Ann served the region in multiple leadership  roles with the Eastern Iowa Small Business Development Center, the Girl  Scouts of Eastern Iowa and Western Illinois, and served as the  president of the Iowa League of Cities.   Mayor Hutchinson played a major part in making the Quad Cities what  they are today, and she will be greatly missed. My thoughts and prayers  are with her family at this time.   I would also like to wish my brother, Richard, a very happy birthday.  Happy birthday, Richard.                            ____________________
