 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise today to encourage my colleagues to  support my amendment, which would direct the newly titled United States  Export Finance Agency to include in its outreach plan an emphasis on  small businesses in sectors impacted by retaliatory tariffs.   For nearly a century, the Export-Import Bank has been a powerful  force for creating the good-paying jobs of the future by ensuring that  small businesses can compete on a fair and global playing field.   Mr. Chair, today we recognize our phenomenal chair of the Financial  Services Committee for her leadership and stewardship in seeing us to  this point.   It has been through consistency, it has been through commitment to  our small businesses that we arrive at this place where today we will  be voting this bill into law, for we must compete in foreign markets,  we must not cede any ground to China, and we certainly must prevent any  uncertainty making its way into our marketplace here in America.   So that is why today is particularly significant if we reflect on the  past when it was called into question if this Export-Import Bank would  be reauthorized. Today we are renaming it and reclaiming our ground.   Just this year, the Export-Import Bank has financed approximately $9  million of exports from companies in my district in southeastern  Michigan, helping small and mid-size businesses reach global markets  that they would not otherwise be able to access, selling best-in-class  products from a best-in-class workforce in southeastern Michigan to the  markets who desire it.   This bipartisan initiative is critical for advancing America's  economic preeminence in the world and lifting up communities in a place  where I call home.   Many of us have heard from businesses in our districts about the  negative impact of tariffs on their bottom lines and on their export  activities. In no short order have I heard that being repeated in  southeastern Michigan, in the hub of American manufacturing,  particularly for automotive.   Taxpayers in Michigan alone have paid $1.6 billion so far in  additional tariffs that were placed on imported products between May  2018 and August 2019.   Our Michigan businesses, including manufacturers and farmers, have  faced $589 million in new retaliatory tariffs as a direct result of the  trade actions taken by the current administration.   This isn't winning.   It is no coincidence that exports from my State as a result are  projected to drop 7 percent this year alone.                                time  1015    Now, more than ever, we must be paying attention to the needs of our  small and midsized businesses, which are bearing the brunt of a self- inflicted and go-it-alone trade war. Our friendly reminder is that  small businesses are the lifeblood of our U.S. economy, making up over  99 percent of all firms in this country.   As the Export-Import Bank continues to help businesses access new  markets--small businesses that have been harmed by retaliatory  tariffs--they must be a part of this central mission.   The reauthorization that we are passing here today has the support of  a wide range of stakeholders--quite remarkable--from the U.S. Chamber  of Commerce to the National Association of Manufacturers to the AFL- CIO.   Our workforce will benefit from this action. Our economy will benefit  from this legislation.   I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in  ensuring our small businesses reeling from the tariffs know that they  are supported by the great resources of the U.S. Export Finance Agency.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I think ringing throughout this amendment  is the importance of our manufacturing economy. That is also what we  are standing up here today to deliver for manufacturers, small  businesses, and our labor force here in Michigan.   Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California  (Ms. Waters), the chairwoman of the Financial Services Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
