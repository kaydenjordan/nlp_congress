 Madam Speaker, as my colleagues have said, the  evidence of the President's abuse of power and obstruction of Congress  is uncontested. But let's outline a few key events involving the nearly  $400 million in military aid that was held up by President Trump and  for President Trump despite congressional mandate.    The summer of 2019 was a summer of shame at the White House.   On July 3, the White House first blocked security assistance money  for Ukraine with no explanation.   On July 10, Gordon Sondland states, during a White House meeting with  Ukrainian officials, that they will get a White House meeting only  after announcing an investigation into President Trump's political  rival.   On July 18, a White House staffer announces the freeze on Ukrainian  aid, per direct Presidential order.   And just one day after Robert Mueller's testimony before Congress,  President Trump makes a now infamous phone call with Zelensky asking  him to investigate the Bidens.   Then, things start to fall apart.   The White House learns that a whistleblower has reported President  Trump's phone call with President Zelensky in a complaint.  [[Page H12168]]    On September 9, Congress starts to investigate the President's  actions, and then the jig is up.   On September 11, the aid is suddenly released without explanation-- over 2 months later.   When you read the call transcript and follow the timeline I have laid  out, guilty is guilty. Nothing changed during that time regarding the  President's supposed concerns over corruption.   So let's be clear. The military aid was released because the  President got caught.   But getting caught doesn't get you off the hook.   And I ask my colleagues: Is attempted murder a crime? Is attempted  robbery a crime? Is attempted extortion and bribery by a President a  crime? Yes, it is.   The only question now is whether we will find the moral courage to  stand up for our country and impeach the President of the United  States.
