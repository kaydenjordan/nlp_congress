 Madam Speaker, I rise today to mark the 50th anniversary  of the Pell Grant Program.   Programs like Pell help break down longstanding, often systemic  barriers to education so that everyone has the chance to reach their  full potential.   In my district, over 65,000 students are receiving over $165 million  to pursue their higher education goals at our local colleges. The Pell  grant is further leveraged by the University of New Hampshire Granite  Guarantee program, which allows students who are Pell-eligible to  attend UNH, Keene State, or Plymouth State tuition-free by leveraging  Pell, Federal aid, and institutional support to ensure access to high- quality public education in New Hampshire.   Putting higher education within reach for more people has been a  strong priority of mine since taking office, and we have worked to  increase funding for Pell grants and provide the kind of resources that  our students deserve.   The education these students receive will help them fulfill their  dreams and develop their greatest abilities. I look forward to Congress  continuing to support access to college through the Pell grant for  another 50 years.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Cicilline for  organizing this Special Order hour.   I rise to mark Pride Month. Pride is an important opportunity for all  of us, regardless of our orientation, to come together and celebrate  our Nation's diversity and to keep striving to perfect this Union, to  make sure that there is truly freedom and equality for all.   As a gay person growing up in New Hampshire, it wasn't always easy  for me to see a path forward and to know that there would be a place  for me in my community. But I am really fortunate that my family and my  community welcomed me for who I am. I couldn't be more proud today to  be able to serve them in Congress and to continue this fight for  equality.   All people deserve to live their lives as their true selves, without  fear of harassment, discrimination, violence, or imprisonment. But we  know many LGBTQ+ Americans don't have the same legal protections that  are guaranteed to others. No one should be a second-class citizen in  this country, and they shouldn't be a second-class citizen anywhere in  the world just for being LGBTQ+. Unfortunately, we know that far too  many people face violence and persecution just for being who they are.   In Afghanistan today, LGBTQ+ people have been harassed, attacked, and  sexually assaulted due to their sexual orientation and gender identity.   I called for the State Department to allow LGBTQ+ Afghans to access  the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program to  [[Page H5814]]  help them ensure that they could find safety because of Taliban rule,  which we know now threatens LGBTQ+ individuals with the prospect of a  violent death.   Russia, which has banned same-sex marriage, recently shutdown the  country's main LGBTQ+ organization, and there are reports that Russia  plans to target the LGBTQ+ community in Ukraine during its invasion.   As we speak, we know Brittney Griner, who is an openly gay WNBA  player, remains wrongfully detained by Russian authorities.   It should concern us all that an American has been wrongfully  detained abroad in any circumstance, but that is made even more  troubling by the fact that Russia's laws don't accommodate and protect  the community. We have seen a recent uptick in vigilante violence  against LGBTQ+ individuals in that country.   In our own country, we still haven't yet banned the use of the so- called ``gay panic'' or ``trans panic'' defenses in Federal court that  can be used to actually blame victims of violence for the violence that  is committed against them. I have introduced legislation in Congress to  ban these so-called defenses, and it is time to get it done. They  legitimize homophobia and transphobia that leads to violence against  LGBTQ+ people, and we must end their use.   We see too much homophobia and transphobia that has no place in  America today. Last year, in my home State of New Hampshire, a man was  punched in the face in downtown Manchester just for holding hands with  his boyfriend walking downtown. His assailant later told investigators  that he didn't approve of homosexuality. This happened in my community  in 2021.   Just last year, we saw transphobic attacks in the neighboring town of  Derry that caused a community event to have to be moved to a different  venue for safety reasons.   This is just not the New Hampshire way, it is not the American way,  and it shows that we have work to do at all levels to combat this.   I hope that people out there who fear for their safety know that  there are LGBTQ+ individuals who are fighting for them in the U.S.  House of Representatives and lots of policymakers who are allies  working to ensure that you can live your lives free of harassment,  discrimination, and violence.   We have got to pass the Equality Act to ensure that all Americans can  live free from discrimination and to send the unequivocal message that  every LGBTQ+ American and their families matter. Doing so will give  full legal protection to all Americans, regardless of who they are or  whom they love.   This legislation is crucial, and it is especially crucial as we see  what the Supreme Court is poised to do, on the verge of overturning  landmark precedent, and rolling back the fundamental right to privacy  in this country.   I know these challenges can seem daunting. We do feel that there is  an uneven march toward progress, where sometimes we take a couple steps  forward and then we see a step backward.   I remember my first speech on the floor of the New Hampshire House of  Representatives in my early twenties. We were fighting against a bill  that would have prevented New Hampshire from recognizing same-sex  marriages performed in Massachusetts. We were fighting against that  legislation. We lost the fight. We came up short.   But in just a matter of a few years, we saw civil unions and then  same-sex marriage approved legislatively, signed by our Governor into  law in New Hampshire, because those elected officials were reflecting  the will of the people and recognizing that the country is changing and  moving forward and that our laws need to catch up.   So Pride Month is a time to rededicate ourselves to a fight that we  still need to win. We move forward by promoting equality because it is  important to lift each other up. It is important to ensure that  everyone can live openly as their true self.   To everyone out there, no matter your sexual orientation, your gender  identity, your profession, or where you call home, you should be proud  of who you are. This is how we are going to continue to change this  country for the better and move forward and ensure that everyone is  included.
