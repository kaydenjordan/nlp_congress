 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida.   In 2016, Olyn Itriago escaped the evil Maduro tyranny in Venezuela.  She received death threats, including a failed attempt on her life. Her  brother, however, was captured and tortured by the Venezuelan National  Guard. The crime? Supporting the opposition party.   Olyn is now one of my constituents in Orlando, with her daughters and  her husband. She is active with our local groups, advocating for  freedom in Venezuela. She holds on to hope of returning home one day  soon.   Another one of my newest constituents, Selene Vargas, was diagnosed  with cancer in 2017. Due to the shortages of medicine, food, and lack  of functioning quality hospitals in Venezuela, all caused by Nicolas  Maduro's destruction of the economy, she moved to Orlando to continue  her cancer treatment. Selene hopes to beat cancer, return to Venezuela,  and see her family again.   Like Olyn and Selene, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans in the  United States fear for their lives. They ask for our compassion until  the horror ends. Our bipartisan Venezuela TPS Act would protect all  eligible Venezuelan nationals from deportation. It allows them to  contribute to our American economy, all while they continue to work to  fix Venezuela.   The world is now witness to the ruthless oppression, starvation, and  human rights abuses of Maduro's rule. The administration has been a  loud voice condemning Maduro.   Vice President Mike Pence said, during a visit to Florida recently,  that the White House is discussing TPS. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo  also mentioned TPS protections could be decided ``in the near future.''   Today, the House has a chance to fulfill those promises. Senators  Marco Rubio and Bob Menendez are leading this bipartisan effort in the  Senate as well.   Granting Venezuelans TPS is one of the most bipartisan immigration  acts each of us as a Member of Congress can take right now. I plead  with Members on both sides of the aisle to take this opportunity to  come together to do the right thing.   It is our moral responsibility to support these brave Venezuelans and  their families who are already citizens here in the United States. This  is the next step to helping the people and to restoring freedom and the  rule of law in Venezuela.   Madam Speaker, I urge all my colleagues in the House to vote for the  bill.   ``For a free Venezuela,'' ``Por una Venezuela libre.''    Madam Speaker, tonight, I would like to honor Gary John  Aleknavich and congratulate him on his upcoming retirement.   Gary John Aleknavich is a U.S. Navy veteran, labor leader,  maintenance foreman, journeyman mechanic, and certified welder by  trade. He has received a certificate of achievement for completing  courses at the Florida International University Center for Labor  Research and Studies.   After serving in the U.S. Navy from 1976 to 1979, Gary was hired by  Florida Power and Light, and then went on to become an apprenticeship  mechanic at the Florida Port Everglades Power Plant. In 1984, he became  a journeyman mechanic at the St. Lucie Nuclear Power Plant, and later  became a mechanical certified welder and a nuclear maintenance foreman.   He has held various positions within his local union of the  International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, including treasurer,  executive board member, job steward, System Council U-4 delegate, and  national convention committee delegate, and served as the Florida  Electrical Worker Association's vice president and executive board  member.   Gary has been a member of IBEW since 1980 and even started the  process to establish and train IBEW officers and members in the IBEW  Code of Excellence training program. He soon became System Council U-4,  assistant business manager of IBEW System Council U-4, and was later  elected to serve as business manager in 2005, where he ran unopposed  for four additional 3-year terms and will retire next month.   There is no question that Gary John Aleknavich has been a leader in  his community and a public servant, and one of labor's strongest  members.   Madam Speaker, for that, we thank him.                            ____________________
