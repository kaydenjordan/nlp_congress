 Mr. Chairman, I thank both Chairman Calvert and Chairman  Frelinghuysen for their work on this legislation. I greatly appreciate  the committee's efforts to fund the National Endowment for the Arts and  the National Endowment for the Humanities.   I stress the importance of Federal investments in the arts and  humanities. The numbers speak for themselves. The NEA and the NEH each  consist of only .003 percent of a nearly $4 trillion Federal budget,  yet for every dollar the United States spends on Federal arts  initiatives, nine nonFederal dollars are leveraged, generating roughly  $600 million in matching support.   Federal arts and humanities funding is a catalyst for the economic  development and job creation that we all need, having a powerful  multiplier effect not only in New Jersey, the State I represent, but  throughout the entire Nation.   The arts and humanities also engage nearly every community. In April,  I visited the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, New Jersey, in the  district I serve, to see its ``Theater for Everyone'' project in  action, an autism-friendly program supported by the NEA. It provides a  creative outlet for children with developmental disabilities and for  their families. Seeing these performances reinforced the importance of  our continued investments in the NEA and in the NEH.   Mr. Chair, I also thank both Chairman Calvert and Chairman  Frelinghuysen for including funding for the Delaware River Basin  Restoration project authorized just last year to coordinate private  investments, regional partnerships, and local knowledge, and develop  strategies to protect and restore the watershed's ecological and  recreational assets and historical significance.                                time  1830    Throughout the four States that are involved--New Jersey, New York,  Pennsylvania, and Delaware--the Delaware River Basin supplies 15  million people with clean water and supports approximately $25 billion  in economic activity each year. It is imperative that we preserve these  resources for future generations, and I look forward to working with  the committee on this initiative.   Let me repeat my deep thanks to Chairman Calvert and to Chairman  Frelinghuysen.
