 Mr. President, I have been advised that inclusion of this  amendment in the budget resolution would be corrosive to the privileged  status of the resolution.   Since this amendment contains material inappropriate for inclusion in  a budget resolution, its adoption could jeopardize the privilege of  this resolution, which would completely halt our efforts to provide  urgent, critical pandemic relief.   Additionally, this amendment is not germane to the budget resolution,  as required by law. Accordingly, I raise a point of order that the  pending amendment violates section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974.    Mr. President, I have been advised that inclusion of this  amendment in the budget resolution would be corrosive to the privileged  status of the resolution. Since this amendment contains material  inappropriate for inclusion in a budget resolution, its adoption could  jeopardize the privilege of this resolution, which would completely  halt, again, efforts to provide this essential, critical pandemic  relief.   Additionally, this amendment is not germane to the budget resolution  as required by law. Accordingly, I raise a point of order that the  pending amendment violates section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional  Budget Act of 1974.    Mr. President, this amendment would cut $20 billion from  Finance to fund homeland security matters--probably a fence. I strongly  oppose it. This amendment would cut funds for unemployment insurance,  payments for families, for things like a border wall that have taken  our immigration policy backward, not forward.   Colleagues, I would urge a ``no'' vote.    Mr. President, this now will put the Senate on record as  to what the Senate thinks about the 2017 Trump tax law--the $2 trillion  bill that overwhelmingly benefited corporations and the wealthy. It  opened new special interest loopholes, and it increased incentives to  ship American jobs overseas.   The Senate needs to fix our broken Tax Code, starting with the  proposition that everybody, including those at the top, pay their fair  share. Locking in the Trump tax handouts to those at the top would take  America in the wrong direction. This is not the vehicle to debate these  tax changes. I strongly urge a ``no'' vote.                           Vote on Amendment No. 55     Mr. President and colleagues, I strongly urge opposition  to this amendment. It simply makes no sense to take any tool--any  tool--off the table in the existential fight against climate change.   Obstructing the fight against climate change costs money due to  cleanups from bigger storms, fires, and floods, and it costs America  jobs.   Move over, this is a budget focused on COVID recovery. This is a  separate issue, colleagues, and it deserves its own debate. I would  urge a ``no'' vote.    Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. This  is an amendment, once again, that tries to stack the deck in terms of  healthcare choices, and, in this case, the proponents want to make  health savings accounts the driving force of the American healthcare  system. I think that is a mistake.   I urge a ``no'' vote.                          Vote on Amendment No. 253
