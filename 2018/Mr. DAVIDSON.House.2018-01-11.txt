 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Amash amendment  and in strong opposition to the underlying bill.   As a former Army ranger, I know the importance of section 702 in  defeating the enemies of our country. The foreign enemies of our  country are not subject to the protections of our Constitution;  American citizens, however, are.   The supporters of the underlying bill would have you believe that the  only way to secure America is by ignoring the Fourth Amendment, and I  strongly disagree. It is the data of American citizens that is at  subject here. The Fourth Amendment does not change when communications  shift from the Postal Service, also in the hands of the government, to  a database. It should be protected by the Fourth Amendment.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge support of the Amash amendment.
