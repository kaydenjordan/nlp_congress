 Madam Speaker, I rise to introduce the bipartisan  Restoring Communities Left Behind Act.   This legislation establishes a $5 billion neighborhood infrastructure  stimulus program at the Department of Housing and Urban Development to  help communities face down the dire COVID-19 economic crisis.   I am grateful for the cooperation and leadership of Michigan  Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib for leading this bill with me, and also for  Chairwoman Maxine Waters for encouraging our efforts.   In addition to COVID-19, Americans in rural and urban areas are still  suffering from the effects of the 2008 Great Recession, decades of job  washout, and redlining. Wall Street's malfeasance resulted in African  Americans alone losing nearly half of their accumulated wealth since  the founding of the Republic.   Nothing is more important for wealth creation than owning a home.  This bill will provide a lifeline for families to restore financial  security through homeownership.   The bill is a critical job-creation program. By investing in  neighborhood infrastructure, we are investing in skills training and  creating good paying jobs.   Congress must act now to provide stimulus for neighborhoods to  recover so they emerge more resilient. I look forward to working to  include this bill in a larger COVID relief and recovery package. I urge  my colleagues to support this important housing recovery legislation.                            ____________________
