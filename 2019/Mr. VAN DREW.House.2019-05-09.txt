 Madam Speaker, I am grateful for the opportunity to  speak to the Members of the House.   As a dentist, I have a firsthand understanding of the American  healthcare system and the need to make it both accessible and  affordable.   I have seen the high costs of healthcare and how they can be  devastating to those who suffer a health emergency.   Additionally, those with preexisting conditions should not feel under  the constant threat of losing or not being able to obtain coverage.   We must protect our families and our small businesses, including  those with preexisting conditions, and work to  [[Page H3552]]  lower the high cost of healthcare and prescription drugs. Individuals  and families lose their homes and their vehicles--literally, their  entire way of life--due to the high cost of healthcare and prescription  drugs.   This week, we voted to lower prescription prices and to protect those  with preexisting conditions. We must continue to work together right  here in the House in a bipartisan way to do what is right and to make  healthcare more accessible for all of the American people.                            ____________________
