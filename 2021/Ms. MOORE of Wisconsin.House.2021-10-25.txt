 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman and the  ranking member. I am so delighted to have been appointed to the Select  Committee.   The Speaker, of course, said that we should make proposals that make  our economy grow for everyone, empowering American economic growth  while ensuring that no one is left behind in the 21st century economy.  [[Page H5867]]    It is no secret that our country is marred by unequal access to good  paying jobs, healthcare, housing, high quality education, childcare,  and many other things. I can't dwell on all those things in this short  period of time. These disparities impact the ability of many  communities to escape poverty, and especially people of color.   I do want to dwell on a couple of things, proposals that I think are  extremely important to close the economic gap, the wealth gap, and the  housing gap.   First of all, I think that all of our workers deserve paid family  leave, a universal comprehensive paid family and medical leave program.  Only about a third of Americans in the highest quintile in the country  receive any kind of paid family leave, while 92 percent of workers in  the lower quintile have no paid family leave.   I think that we should enhance the child tax credit and the earned  income tax credits. These are things that, while there is a very high  cost of poverty, there is a big, huge outcome and harvest from  investing in our children. People around the globe have noted that it  really creates better workers, better educational outcomes, and better  healthcare outcomes.    We also need to address the uncompensated care that so many family  caregivers, especially women, are providing, about a half-trillion  dollars a year in uncompensated care, and we need to address that. So I  think if we boost the CTC, the earned income tax credit, provide paid  family leave, we will begin to see the beginnings around the edges of  reducing some of the disparities.
