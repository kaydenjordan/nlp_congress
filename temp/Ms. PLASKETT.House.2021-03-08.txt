 Mr. Speaker, the COVID pandemic and economic crisis are  destroying the lives and livelihoods of tens of millions of Americans  across the country. And our most vulnerable communities are bearing the  brunt.   Thankfully, help is on the way. The American Rescue Plan will save  lives and livelihoods by putting vaccines in arms, putting children  safely back in school, putting money in people's pockets, and finally  putting people back in jobs.   I am proud to note the inclusion of provisions in this bill for the  Virgin Islands and other territories that we all in this House have  been fighting for. This plan creates equality in the child tax credit,  the earned income tax credit, including an advancement of the child tax  credit in 2021.   The child tax credit provision in the bill will be transformational  in the lives of hundreds and millions of children, lifting them out of  poverty. This is generational change. This will reduce poverty and  improve the economic standing of Americans throughout our country. We  are grateful for this bill.                            ____________________
