 Mr. Chairman, there is a lot wrong with this  bill, but as ranking member of the Committee on Education and the  Workforce, I am particularly concerned about its impact on students.   SNAP eligibility is tied to eligibility for other vital Federal  programs, so the proposed cuts in SNAP eligibility will also cut access  to free school meals for 265,000 children.                                time  1730    Research has consistently shown that students struggling with hunger  have  [[Page H4052]]  lower grades, are less able to focus, and more likely to miss school.  This bill would undermine the ability of hundreds of thousands of  students to reach their full potential by cutting SNAP benefits for the  family and reducing school benefits for children.   In the wake of a $1.5 trillion tax cut for corporations in the top 1  percent, it is a shameful statement of priorities when you try to pay  for these tax cuts by reducing food assistance programs for low-income  students.   I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''
