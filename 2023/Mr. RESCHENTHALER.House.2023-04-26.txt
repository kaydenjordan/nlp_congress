 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from Missouri  for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to engage the gentlewoman from Virginia  (Mrs. Kiggans), who is my fellow Navy veteran, for the purpose of a  colloquy.    I yield to the gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her  remarks and for working with us on this bill. I would like the  gentlewoman to know that I support repealing these tax credits, but I  understand the gentlewoman's concerns on some individual provisions in  this bill.    Of course, we will continue to work with the  gentlewoman from Virginia just like we will with all Members on making  sure we are paying our Nation's debts and lifting our debt ceiling, but  doing it in a responsible, reasonable, and sensible manner, and  bringing Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden to the negotiation table.
