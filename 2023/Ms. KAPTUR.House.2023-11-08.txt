 Mr. Speaker, more than 1 month after the October 7 terror  attack on Israel by Hamas, the number of people killed during this  horrible conflagration tragically exceeds well over 11,000 lives:   Over 1,400 Israeli civilians, including women and children; over  10,000 Palestinian civilians, nearly half women and children, with at  least 20 U.S. citizens still being held by Hamas among 240 hostages.   The latest war follows wars between Israel and Hamas in 2008, 2008- 09, 2014, and all these ended in cease-fires with no resolution.   The question is what will be the plan for stabilizing this chronic  standoff.   How will Gaza be governed going forward?   The diplomatic path forward being forged by several Arab nations,  Fatah, some European states, the Arab League, and the United Nations is  constructive. Let us promote it and elevate it.   Earlier this week, President Biden spoke with Prime Minister  Netanyahu. Both acknowledged the value of a multi-day pause in fighting  to secure  [[Page H5649]]  the release of hostages and ensure that humanitarian relief can reach  those in need. Let us echo the call for such a pause and let the  violence and retribution once and for all end through diplomatic  initiatives.                            ____________________
