 Mr. Speaker, there is no substitute for conducting the  business of the American people in person.   On Monday, 80 members of the majority voted ``present'' by proxy.  This is one of the most asinine things that has become commonplace  under one-party rule by the majority.   Have House Democrats become so averse to work that they now believe  voting from their couches is a viable option?   Mr. Speaker, it is time to end proxy voting once and for all. It is  one of the many blemishes that have been put on this great body under  one-party rule.   If the current majority won't end proxy voting, Republicans will  snuff it out entirely when we take back the House. It is past time to  get back to work.                            ____________________
