 Mr. Speaker, since the House of Representatives moved  into this very Chamber in 1857, the people's Representatives have  debated the great issues of the day. The Speaker's rostrum behind me  was redesigned after World War II and words were added to the bottom  level that speak to noble aspirations of our Nation: union, justice,  tolerance, liberty, and peace.   These words are not the fundamental principles upon which our Nation  was founded, but are, I suggest, the fruits of those principles.  Consequently, if our founding principles are eroded, these fruits will  be eroded as well.   Over recent decades, our Nation has endured a great and ongoing  debate that, at its heart, goes to the continuing relevance of our  Nation's founding principles. And what are those principles? They are  in our Declaration of Independence.  [[Page H9752]]    ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created  equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable  rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of  happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted  among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the  governed.''   ``The consent of the governed.'' These five words recognize that our  Nation's sovereignty is in her people--not the government, not the  legislative branch, not the judicial branch, not the executive branch  or the Federal bureaucracy, but in the people.   Sovereignty in the people was, indeed, revolutionary in 1776, and it  is at the heart of the notion of self-government. This sovereignty in  the people, however, is not absolute. It is restrained by a higher law  that acknowledges that certain of our rights come from our Creator and  are inalienable, among them, the right to life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness.   These rights do not come from or depend on government, or what a  majority of people electing the government decide. They require,  however, that the government protect them. Sovereignty is further  restrained by the higher law that we are created equal.   Our laws should not favor one person over another. All are to be  equal before the law, and there must be a fair playing field where all  are given the opportunity to develop their God-given gifts and talents.   These concepts, Mr. Speaker, are not just founding principles. These  are truths, self-evident truths. There are many today who challenge the  notion of truth and claim everything is relative. But the Founders  recognized the self-evident truths of the Declaration in establishing  this country.   Our Founders built on these principles when they adopted our  Constitution and Bill of Rights which limited the power of the Federal  Government. The Founders understood that the bigger government became,  the more it would infringe on the principles in our Declaration.   It was appealing to our founding principles that our Nation was able  to correct the defect in our Constitution that denied equal rights and  liberty to those held in slavery.   But some current political views reject the framework of sovereignty  in the people, and that such sovereignty is limited by God-given rights  and freedoms. Some decry our Constitution's structure as being a  charter of negative liberties.   For example, Barack Obama, prior to becoming President said that our  Constitution, `` . . . says what the States can't do to you. Says what  the Federal Government can't do to you, but doesn't say what the  Federal Government or State government must do on your behalf.''   If you don't like what the Constitution says, there is a process to  amend it. And those who would advocate for the government to do things,  should go through the process of proposing amendments.   Those who are Progressives believe that they can better order a  society than can a free people relying on their God-given rights to  life and liberty. But this is inconsistent with the notion of self- government.   Progressives believe in the power of government. The power of  government should be used to protect rights, not infringe or abridge  them. What Progressives miss is how the power of government can destroy  communities and lives and infringe upon God-given freedoms, which we  have seen in recent decades.   It is the power of the government acting through the Supreme Court  that denied the very first right recognized in our Declaration, the  right to life, for an entire class of human beings.   To be clear, insisting on universality of the God-given right to life  is not an establishment of religion. It is simply an affirmation of a  self-evident truth described in our Declaration of Independence.    It is the power of government that put through great society programs  that undermine the family and dramatically increased societal  challenges as a result.   It is the power of government that targeted the American energy  industry, threatening hundreds of jobs in my district.   It is the power of government that took away healthcare plans that  people liked, and the power of government that went after the Little  Sisters of the Poor.   Rather than looking to the power of government, perhaps we should  look to the power of the people. Rightly understood, government should  not be looked at as a vehicle for wielding power, but for serving and  protecting the rights in our Declaration and Constitution. It is never  out of season to rediscover those principles.   This is what Abraham Lincoln called upon us to do at another divided  time in our Nation. In an 1858 speech in Lewistown, Illinois, Lincoln  said,  `` . . . if you have been taught doctrines conflicting with the great  landmarks of the Declaration of Independence; if you have listened to  suggestions which would take away from its grandeur, and mutilate the  fair symmetry of its proportions; if you have been inclined to believe  that all men are not created equal in those inalienable rights  enumerated by our chart of liberty, let me entreat you to come back . .  . come back to the truths that are in the Declaration of  Independence.''   If we want union, let us unite around the principles of the  Declaration. If we want justice, let us work for equality for all while  protecting the right to life of every human being, no matter their age  or state of dependency.   If we want tolerance, let us appreciate that while we, indeed, have  differences, we should not demonize those with whom we disagree.   If the Little Sisters of the Poor, or a small business, or a private  citizen for that matter, hold sincerely held beliefs that people  throughout history would recognize as being grounded in the exercise of  conscience and faith, we should be tolerant of such exercise.   If we want liberty, let us ensure that our Constitution remains a  check on the power of the State that would infringe on the fundamental  rights and freedoms our Founders sought to protect.   And if we want peace, let us embrace what our Founders embraced. And  like the Founders, let us firmly rely on the protection of divine  providence as we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes,  and our sacred honor.   And when we reaffirm our foundational principles, let us hope that  instead of division, we would see the new birth of freedom that Lincoln  envisioned.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my deepest gratitude to the people of  Pennsylvania's 12th Congressional District, encompassing Beaver County  and parts of Allegheny, Lawrence, Westmoreland, Cambria and Somerset  Counties. I appreciate that they elected me to represent them in this  House for the past 6 years.   It has been an incredible honor to pursue the objectives they sent me  here to do: to get the economy growing at a healthier pace with more  jobs and higher wages; to stop government overreach that was taking  away the right of people to choose their own healthcare plan and  causing their health insurance costs to skyrocket; to stand in  solidarity with our veterans; and defend the foundational principles on  which this country was founded, including the first right and the first  freedom mentioned in our founding documents, the God-given right to  life and the free exercise of religion.   Mr. Speaker, I could not have done my work without the support of  several constituents, in particular: my wife, Elsie; and my kids, Mimi,  Gerard, Edmund, Maggie, Helen, and Alice.                                time  1115    Their patience and endurance with my absences are what many families  of those in public life go through, and I cannot thank them enough.   May God grant that our country reaffirm the truths embedded within  our Declaration of Independence. May He grant that such reaffirmation  does lead to that new birth of freedom that President Lincoln spoke of.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
