 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Arkansas. I  appreciate the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 803.   In my Northern California district, we are devastated year after year  after year, as we are all over the West by wildfire and unmanaged  forests. Adding 1.5 million more acres of untouchable lands because of  wilderness designation does not help. It will merely make the problem  worse.   What is the purpose of a new wilderness designation? What does it  achieve?   It isn't needed to prevent a new highway or a new mine, oil and gas  operations, or a new dam. Those are already difficult things to get  permitted, taking years and years.   So why do we have to have this designation? We are already so far  behind on forest management that I don't know when we will ever get out  of it, because every year--every year--we have devastating fires  affecting our public lands, the access to those lands, the private  lands that are near them, and the towns of the people that live nearby  them as well.   The economy has already been devastated in those areas because of  regulatory ideas that come out of Washington, D.C., and California to  stop the type of work that needs to be done for those logging  communities.   Mr. Speaker, this is wrongheaded legislation and is unnecessary.
