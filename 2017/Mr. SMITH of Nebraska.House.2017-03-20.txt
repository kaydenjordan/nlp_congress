 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of  National Agriculture Week and the farmers and ranchers who have made  Nebraska's Third District the top producing agriculture district in the  country.   One in four Nebraska jobs is tied to agriculture. The hard work and  innovative practices of our producers have made our State a leader in  feeding the world.   For too long the heavy hand of the Federal Government has threatened  agriculture's future. Thankfully, we have seen important victories  under the Trump administration, including the beginning of the end for  the EPA's dangerous waters of the U.S. rule, or WOTUS.   Nebraska's farmers and ranchers are committed stewards of our natural  resources and take many steps to keep our water resources clean.  President Trump ordered a reset on WOTUS, agreeing farmers and ranchers  deserve better than to have Washington bureaucrats controlling the  water puddles and irrigation ditches on their land.   As founder and co-chairman of the Modern Agriculture Caucus, I will  continue to promote policies designed to get the government out of the  way and  [[Page H2190]]  open more markets around the world for Nebraska producers.                            ____________________
