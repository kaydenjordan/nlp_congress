 Mr. Speaker, my apologies for not being able to be present  for today's recorded votes. My flight from ALB to DCA was cancelled due  to a winter storm, and I could make no other flight that would have  gotten me to Washington in time. Had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea on rollcall No. 86, and ``yea'' on rollcall No. 87.                            ____________________
