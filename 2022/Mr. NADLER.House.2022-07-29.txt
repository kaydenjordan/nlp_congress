 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 1302, I call up  the bill (H.R. 1808) to regulate assault weapons, to ensure that the  right to keep and bear arms is not unlimited, and for other purposes,  and ask for its immediate consideration in the House.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  insert extraneous material on H.R. 1808.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, today, we take another step to advance historic gun  violence prevention legislation. H.R. 1808, the Assault Weapons Ban Act  of 2022, restores and updates the prior assault weapons ban that kept  weapons of war out of our communities for a decade before Republicans  opposed its renewal.   As we have learned all too well in recent years, assault weapons,  especially when combined with high-capacity magazines, are the weapon  of choice for mass shootings. These military-style weapons are designed  to kill the most people in the shortest amount of time. Quite simply,  there is no place for them in our streets.   In 1994, we banned these killing machines, and countless lives were  saved. But that ban was allowed to lapse 10 years later. Since then, we  have seen the predictable results: Mass shootings have increased  exponentially in our public spaces. Schools, movie theaters,  supermarkets, houses of worship, parades, you name it, have all become  vulnerable to attack.   Uvalde, Parkland, Tree of Life Synagogue. How many more mass  shootings must we endure? When will we learn?   Well, I hope we are starting to learn today. I hope we are starting  to learn today indeed.   The Assault Weapons Ban Act would prohibit the sale, manufacture,  transfer, or possession of semiautomatic assault weapons and large- capacity ammunition feeding devices. At the same time, it grandfathers  existing semiautomatic assault weapons and contains numerous  protections for law enforcement and responsible gun owners, including  hunters, gun collectors, farmers, sports shooters, and those who use  firearms for self-defense.   It is important to consider today's debate in the context of our  other efforts to address the violence plaguing our communities.   Time and again, Democrats have advanced responsible gun safety  legislation, only to face Republican opposition.   We have advanced legislation to conduct background checks for all gun  sales, to close the Charleston loophole, to close the boyfriend  loophole, and to keep guns away from those who are a danger to  themselves or others.   We advanced my bill, the Protecting our Kids Act, and we sent the  President the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which was signed into  law and will save lives. These proposals were opposed by all but a few  of our Republican colleagues.   Today, they have another chance to take the action needed to make our  communities safer. Will they stand with us? Will they show that they  have learned? Or will they stand with an industry that right now is  promoting a weapon to civilians that is powerful enough to shoot  through bulletproof vests?   Will our Republican colleagues choose to defend the weapons of choice  for mass murderers and those who seek to target law enforcement? Or  will they choose to defend Americans who simply want to go to school,  to go shopping, to march in a parade, or to go to a movie theater  without the fear of having a target on their back? It is an easy choice  for me.   I thank Congressman Cicilline for his leadership on this important  legislation, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting it,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), the sponsor of this bill and a member of  the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lofgren), a distinguished member of the Committee on  the Judiciary.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the Committee on  the Judiciary.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Garcia), a member of the Committee on the  Judiciary.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Neguse), a member of the Committee on the  Judiciary.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Pennsylvania (Ms. Dean), a member of the Committee on the Judiciary.    Fact: Contrary to Mr. Roy, this bill takes away nobody's  weapons because existing weapons are grandfathered in if he would only  read the bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Escobar), who is a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, contrary to Mr. Roy, I include in the Record  a report from Third Way titled ``The Red State Murder Problem''.                       [From Third Way, Mar.15, 2022]                        The Red State Murder Problem                     (By Kylie Murdock and Jim Kessler)         Every news outlet from FOX to CNN to The New York Times to       local newspapers has a story with attention-grabbing       headlines like ``US cities hit all-time murder records.'' Fox       News and Republicans have jumped on this and framed it as a       ``Democrat'' problem. They blame it on Democrat's ``soft-on-      crime'' approach and have even referred to a New York       District Attorney's approach as ``hug-a-thug.'' Many news       stories outside of Fox have also purported that police reform       is responsible for this rise in murder and have pointed to       cities like New York and Los Angeles.        There is a measure of truth to these stories. The US saw an       alarming 30% increase in murder in 2020. While 2021 data is       not yet complete, murder was on the rise again this past       year. Some ``blue'' cities, like Chicago, Baltimore, and       Philadelphia, have seen real and persistent increases in       homicides. These cities--along with others like Los Angeles,       New York, and Minneapolis--are also in places with wall-to-      wall media coverage and national media interest.        But there is a large piece of the homicide story that is       missing and calls into question the veracity of the right-      wing obsession over homicides in Democratic cities: murder       rates are far higher in Trump-voting red states than Biden-      voting blue states. And sometimes, murder rates are highest       in cities with Republican mayors.        For example, Jacksonville, a city with a Republican mayor,       had 128 more murders in 2020 than San Francisco, a city with       a Democrat mayor, despite their comparable populations. In       fact, the homicide rate in Speaker Nancy Pelosi's San       Francisco was half that of House Republican Leader Kevin       McCarthy's Bakersfield, a city with a Republican mayor that       overwhelmingly voted for Trump. Yet there is barely a       whisper, let alone an outcry, over the stunning levels of       murders in these and other places.        We collected 2019 and 2020 murder data from all 50 states.       (Comprehensive 2021 data is not yet available.) We pulled the       data from yearly crime reports released by state governments,       specifically the Departments of Justice and Safety. For       states that didn't issue state crime reports, we pulled data       from reputable local news sources. To allow for comparison,       we calculated the state's per capita murder rate, the number       of murders per 100,000 residents, and categorized states by       their presidential vote in the 2020 election, resulting in an       even 25-25 split.        We found that murder rates are, on average, 40% higher in       the 25 states Donald Trump won in the last presidential       election compared to those that voted for Joe Biden. In       addition, murder rates in many of these red states dwarf       those in blue states like New York, California, and       Massachusetts. And finally, many of the states with the worst       murder rates--like Mississippi, Kentucky, Alabama, South       Carolina, and Arkansas--are ones that few would describe as       urban. Only 2 of America's top 100 cities in population are       located in these high murder rate states. And not a single       one of the top 10 murder states registers in the top 15 for       population density.        Whether one does or does not blame Republican leaders for       high murder rates, it seems that Republican officeholders do       a better job of blaming Democrats for lethal crime than       actually reducing lethal crime.        If you're tuned in to the media, you'd think murder is       rocketing skyward in New York, California, Illinois. But       those states don't even crack the top ten.        In fact, the top per capita murder rate states in 2020 were       mostly those far from massive urban centers and Democratic       mayors and governors. Eight of the top ten worst murder rate       states voted for Trump in 2020. None of those eight has       supported a Democrat for president since 1996.        The chart below shows the top 10 murder rate states in       2020. Mississippi had the highest homicide rate at 20.50       murders per 100,000 residents, followed by Louisiana at       15.79, Kentucky at 14.32, Alabama at 14.2, and Missouri at       14. The national average was 6.5 per 100,000 residents, but       the top five states had rates more than twice that high.        These red states are not generating ``murder is out of       control'' national headlines. They seem to generate no       headlines at all. The rest of the top ten were filled out by       South Carolina, New Mexico, Georgia, Arkansas, and       Tennessee--all states rarely talked about in breathless media       reports about rampant crime in Democratic strongholds.       Notably, New Mexico and Georgia were the only Biden-voting       states in the top ten, and they ranked seventh and eighth,       respectively.        Five of the largest Biden-voting states by population, and       those often in the news when it comes to crime, had much       lower murder rates. New York at 4.11 per 100,000 residents,       California at 5.59, and New Jersey at 3.70 were each well       below the national average. Pennsylvania (7.22) and Illinois       (9.20) were higher than the national average. But       Mississippi's murder rate was nearly 400% higher than New       York's, more than 250% higher than California's, and about       120% higher than Illinois's. In fact, the five states with       the highest murder rates, all Trump-voting states, had rates       at least 240% higher than New York's murder rate and at least       150% higher than California's, the homes to some of the       largest cities featured prominently in the ``crime is out of       control'' narrative.        Beyond the top 10, we looked at the 2020 murder rates in       the 25 states that voted for Donald Trump and compared it       with the murder rates in the 25 states that voted for Joe       Biden. The 8.20 murders per 100,000 residents rate in Trump       states was 40% higher than the 5.78 murders per 100,000       residents in Biden states. These Biden-voting states include       the ``crime-is-out-of-control'' cities of Los Angeles, New       York City, Chicago, Detroit, Philadelphia, Portland,       Baltimore, and Minneapolis, among other large cities.        Among the 50 states, murder rates were often well above the       national average in many Republican-controlled states and       cities. Jacksonville with 176 homicides and a murder rate       (19.776) more than three times that of New York City (5.94)       has a Republican mayor. Tulsa (19.64) and Oklahoma City       (11.16) have Republican mayors in a Republican state and have       murder rates that dwarf that of Los Angeles (6.74).       Lexington's Republican mayor saw record homicides in 2020 and       2021, with a murder rate (10.61) nearly twice that of New       York City. Bakersfield (11.91) and Fresno (14.09) each have       Republican mayors and murder rates far higher than either San       Francisco or Los Angeles.        Of course, some cities controlled by Democrats have       alarming murder rates, like Chicago (28.49) and Houston       (17.32). But we hear about these and other Democrat-run       cities all the time. We aren't getting the whole picture.        In 2020, murder rates increased nearly everywhere. But they       increased more in Trump-voting states than Biden-voting       states, albeit slightly. The average increase in murder rate       across all Trump-voting states was 32.2% compared to 30.8% in       Biden-voting states.        Three out of the five states with the highest murder rates       in 2020--Mississippi, Missouri, and Alabama--didn't have       reliable 2019 data available, so they weren't included in       this analysis.        Three of the five states with the largest increase in       murder rate were Trump-voting Wyoming at 91.7%, South Dakota       at 69%, and Nebraska at 59.1%. These states are decidedly       rural and do not conform to the chaos-in-the-city meme that       has overtaken the crime debate. Biden-voting Wisconsin came       in at the number three spot at 63.2% and Minnesota came in       fifth at 58.1%. Out of the top ten states, six were Trump-      voting states--with the additional three being Kentucky, West       Virginia, and Kansas. The remaining states in the top ten       were Delaware and Washington. Only one of the top ten states       in murder rate increases, Delaware, was among the top twenty       in population density.        Again, California, New York, and Illinois aren't in the top       ten. California's murder rate increase was 31.1%, or about       the national average. Both New York (45.8%) and Illinois       (38.2%) were above the national average.        The current narrative around crime and murder is convenient       and wrong. Whether you're watching CNN or Fox News, or       getting news online or from a traditional newspaper, you       would think that the increase in murder is a phenomenon found       mostly in liberal cities. Many have tried attributing this       increase to Democratic policies, specifically police reform.       Republican lawmakers and ad makers have contributed to this       narrative through clever messaging and strategies.        But the data clearly paint a different story. The increase       in murders is not a liberal cities problem but a national       problem. Murder rates are actually higher in Republican,       Trump-voting states that haven't even flirted with ideas like       defund the police. Eight of the ten most lawless, high-murder       states are not only Trump-voting states, but GOP bastions for       the last quarter of a century. A more accurate conclusion       from the data is that Republicans do a far better job blaming       others for high murder rates than actually reducing high       murder rates.        We sought 2019 and 2020 murder data from all 50 states. Our       primary source was the annual crime reports released by state       governments, more specifically from their Departments of       Justice or Public Safety. We chose state data because we       found it's more comprehensive than FBI data which is often       compiled later. For example, ``the FBI estimated crime       statistics for Mississippi are based on data received from       113 of 251 law enforcement agencies in the state that year.''       37 states had crime reports for the years 2019 and 2020:       Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut,       Delaware, Florida, Iowa, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky,       Massachusetts, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, North       Carolina, North Dakota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey,       Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South       Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia,       Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. For the remaining states       we pulled data from published public sources: Alabama--US       News, Georgia--US News, Hawaii--The Center Square, Indiana--      Hartford City News  [[Page H7519]]       Times, Louisiana--US News, Maryland--Ocean City Today,       Mississippi--US News, Missouri--US News, New Mexico--US News,       Ohio--Axios, Oregon--KOIN, Vermont--WCAX, West Virginia--The       Center Square. In seven states, the public sources only       provided murder per capita rates, so using the rates and       census population data, we estimated the number of murders in       that state. Data and sources are attached above.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Schneider).    Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter of  endorsement of the assault weapons ban from the Major Cities Chiefs  Association, a professional organization of law enforcement executives  representing the largest cities in the United States.                                Major Cities Chiefs Association,                                                      July 20, 2022.      Hon. Jerrold Nadler,      Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Jim Jordan,      Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Nadler and Ranking Member Jordan: I write on       behalf of the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA), a       professional organization of law enforcement executives       representing the largest cities in the United States and       Canada. Thank you for including H.R. 1808, the Assault       Weapons Ban of 2022, in today's markup. The MCCA was proud to       endorse this legislation when it was introduced earlier this       Congress.        The MCCA has long advocated for sensible firearms and gun       safety policies. In 2018, the Association adopted a Firearms       Violence Policy that consists of several common-sense       reforms, including banning assault weapons and high-capacity       magazines. Many law enforcement officials have closely       studied assault weapons and firearms with high-capacity       magazines and determined they have no reasonable sporting or       hunting purpose.        Assault weapons and high-capacity magazines also represent       a significant threat to law enforcement officers responding       to violent crimes. For example, the suspect who murdered NYPD       Officers Jason Rivera and Wilbert Mora in January 2022 used a       firearm with a high-capacity magazine that allowed his gun to       hold 40 additional rounds. Earlier this month, Detroit PD       Officer Loren Michael Courts was killed by a suspect with an       AK-47-style pistol that would have been banned under H.R.       1808.        The MCCA encourages all Members of the Committee to support       the Assault Weapons Ban of 2022 and report it favorably       during today's markup.            Sincerely,                                                  Jeri Williams,                                   Chief, Phoenix Police Department,                        President, Major Cities Chiefs Association.     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a report from the  Violence Policy Center entitled, ``Target: Law Enforcement, Assault  Weapons in the News.''                                Section One    Introduction: Background on Assault Weapons and Federal Attempts at                              Their Regulation         Assault weapons. Semiautomatic assault weapons are civilian       versions of automatic military assault rifles like the AK-47       and the M-16. The civilian guns look the same as their       military brethren because they are identical functionally,       except for one feature: military assault rifles are machine       guns. A machine gun fires continuously as long as its trigger       is held back--until it runs out of ammunition. Civilian       assault rifles, in contrast, are semi-automatic weapons. The       trigger of a semiautomatic weapon must be pulled back       separately for each round fired. Because federal law has       banned the sale of new machine guns to civilians since 1986       and heavily regulates sales to civilians of older model       machine guns, there is virtually no civilian market for       military assault weapons. Nonetheless, civilian semiautomatic       assault weapons have proven every bit as deadly as their       military counterparts.        Regulation of assault weapons. The regulation of       semiautomatic assault weapons has been a contentious subject       for more than two decades.        In the 1980s foreign manufacturers (principally China)       began dumping semiautomatic versions of the Soviet-designed       AK-47 military assault rifle--a ubiquitous staple of the       world-wide small arms trade--onto the U.S. civilian firearms       market. Colt Industries, a domestic manufacturer, was also       marketing the AR-15, a semiautomatic version of its M-16       machine gun, the standard U.S. military infantry rifle. The       gun industry introduced these semiautomatic versions of       military assault weapons in order to create and exploit new       civilian markets. More particularly, the industry found in       assault weapons a product to compensate for a slump in       handgun sales. Importers and manufacturers rushed copycats       and new models to market. By the end of the decade, a roster       of semiautomatic assault weapons had become household words,       boosted into daily language as much by their glamorization in       entertainment media as by their deadly toll on America's       streets. These guns included, among others, assault pistols       like the MAC-10, MAC-11, and TEC-9, the Ruger Mini-14 rifle,       and several versions of the Israeli Military Industries UZI.        No comprehensive statistics were available about the misuse       of the hundreds of thousands of assault weapons pouring onto       the Nation's streets. But by 1988 police departments and       other law enforcement agencies were often on the receiving       end of assault weapons firepower. Many of them demanded that       the federal government take action to stringently control or       ban semiautomatic assault weapons. In February 1988, for       example, Prince George's County (Maryland) Police Chief       Michael J. Flaherty stated, ``The real issue is the safety of       our officers.'' Holding up a TEC-9 assault pistol, he added,       ``It's not used for hunting, and it's not used for sporting       events. In my opinion, they should not be sold in the United       States.''        In 1989 the federal government took a modest regulatory       step. At the urging of William J. Bennett, the director of       the Office of National Drug Control Policy under President       George H. W. Bush, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and       Firearms (ATF) barred the import of a handful of specific       models, including AK-type and UZI assault rifles. The move       was based on a federal statute that effectively limits the       import of firearms to those that are ``generally recognized       as particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting       purposes.'' This ``sporting purposes'' test does not apply to       domestically manufactured firearms, however. Law enforcement       officials quickly complained that the putative ban did not       reach many of the most dangerous weapons they faced,       including semiautomatic assault pistols made in the United       States (e.g., the MAC-10, MAC-11, and TEC-9, among others).       Although the Bush Administration claimed to have been       conducting a wide review with the goal of further regulation,       strong opposition by the National Rifle Association (NRA) and       the firearms industry squelched any further regulatory moves       by the Administration. Within a year, Bennett announced       himself opposed to any further regulation, declaring his       opposition at a February 1990 Senate hearing, stating, ``I       don't know a damn thing about guns!''        In 1994, President William J. Clinton signed the 1994       federal assault weapons ``ban.'' The law defined assault       weapons in two different ways--by a list of specific firearm       types, and by a generic description. Thus, the law       specifically named 19 types of guns (e.g., ``Norinco,       Mitchell and Poly Technologies Avtomat Kalashnikovs'') as       assault weapons covered by the putative ``ban.'' It also       generally defined as assault weapons semiautomatic firearms       that could accept a detachable magazine and had any two of a       list of specified design characteristics (e.g., bayonet       mount, folding stock). The 1994 law was deeply flawed. At the       outset it exempted millions of semiautomatic assault weapons       by ``grandfathering'' all such firearms legally owned as of       the date of enactment. For these guns, it was as if the law       had never been passed. They continued to be bought and sold,       many at gun shows where no questions are asked of prospective       buyers in nominally ``private'' sales. Moreover, some of the       design characteristics by which new production or imports       were to be defined as banned assault weapons were simply a       laundry list of superficial cosmetic features that had       nothing to do with the weapons' most deadly functional       features. The gun industry quickly and easily evaded the 1994       law by making slight, cosmetic changes to the supposedly       banned firearms. Gun manufacturers and importers soon openly       boasted of the ease with which they could circumvent the ban.       By the time the 1994 law expired (sunset) in 2004, there were       actually many more types and models of assault weapons       legally on the civilian market than before the law was       passed.        In April 1998 the Clinton Administration attempted to       staunch the flow of cosmetically redesigned foreign assault       weapons by strictly interpreting the ``sporting purposes''       test for imports. The action--taken independent of the 1994       law and intended to close the cosmetic redesign loophole for       imports--was reported to have blocked 58 types of assault       weapons, including in one swoop importation permits pending       at the time for as many as 1.6 million guns. Since this       administrative determination and action has never been       rescinded, it should have survived the expiration of the       broader 1994 assault weapons ban. However, there is       substantial evidence--including extensive gun industry       advertising--which compels the conclusion that the George W.       Bush Administration either ignored or effectively gutted       through administrative artifice the 1998 Clinton import       controls. This evidence includes the following facts.        There are numerous companies that appear to be importing       AK-47 and other assault weapons of the type clearly       prohibited by the import ban. The Russian American Armory       Company offers the Saiga rifle, an AK-47 variant that was one       of the guns specifically excluded from import under the 1998       Clinton rule. The Fabrique Nationale Herstal PS90 assault       rifle, a favorite of Mexican drug cartels, is manufactured in       Belgium and imported by the company's U.S. subsidiary, FN  [[Page H7521]]       USA, according to the company's catalogs and promotional       materials.        There seems to have been a substantial increase in the past       few years of assault weapons made primarily from imported       parts that skirt the import ban by incorporating a small,       minimum number of US-made parts into imported assault weapons       (27 C.F.R. Sec. 478.39 prohibits the assembly of a       semiautomatic rifle or any shotgun using more than 10       enumerated parts that are imported if the assembled firearm       is prohibited from importation under 18 USC 925(d)(3)).        ATF has further weakened the prohibition on imported       assault weapons by placing certain extremely problematic       assault rifles on the ``curios or relics'' list. Inclusion on       the ``curios or relics'' list makes a shotgun or rifle       automatically eligible for importation (18 USC       Sec. 925(e)(1)). The most problematic of these are certain       SKS assault rifles manufactured in Yugoslavia and Albania.       The SKS type assault rifle is the ``rifle most commonly       encountered by law enforcement'' according to ATF and is       frequently used to kill police officers. The Clinton       Administration specifically banned SKSs from China and Russia       from import through trade agreements because they are so       frequently involved in crime.        There are examples of firearms being imported that seem to       clearly fall outside of the ``sporting purposes'' test       articulated in 925(d)(3). For example, J&G Sales advertises       ``Romanian AK Pistol[s]'' along with Romanian and Hungarian       AK-47 assault rifles.        For all practical purposes, it thus appears that the       federal government has abandoned all attempts to regulate       commerce in assault weapons into and within the United       States. As a result, an unknown but certainly substantial       number of foreign assault weapons poured into the United       States during the Bush Administration and continue to under       the Obama Administration. This is in addition to the enormous       number of firearms exempted from, or manufactured in easy       evasion of, the 1994 law. The only meaningful attempts at       regulating this flood of killing machines exist at the state       level. One outstanding example is California's assault       weapons ban, which has been hammered into an effective ban       after the now-predictable gun industry attempts to evade the       intent of the original law. Even California's law, however,       is undermined by the lack of a strong and effective federal       ban, allowing for out-of-state assault weapons to be       illegally trafficked into the state.        The current study. This study is a snapshot of the effect       of America's laissez-faire policy toward assault weapons.       Based on reports of assault weapons in the news over a two-      year span, it makes clear that assault weapons are frequently       used in crime and confiscated from criminals. Moreover, it       demonstrates that the number of incidents in which law       enforcement officers are reported to have been confronted       with assault weapons rose dramatically in the two-year period       monitored.                                Section Two                         Sources for This Analysis         The dearth of data. Firearms enjoy the dubious distinction       of being the only consumer product not subject to federal       public health and safety regulation. Moreover, there is no       national database tracking deaths and injuries from specific       types and models of firearms. And only the most rudimentary,       summary information is collected at any level about criminal       use of firearms. As a result, public policy analysts,       legislators, and public health and safety administrators must       make do with crude data and anecdotal analysis. This is       neither an accident nor a product of inattention. It is the       deliberate result of a coldly calculated long-term policy of       strangling information about guns and their public health       effects designed by the National Rifle Association and its       major client, the gun industry, and implemented by an all-      too-pliant Congress. The firearms industry and gun lobby know       that if as much data were available to the public about death       and injury resulting from firearms as is available about, for       example tires, toys, or Tacoma pick-up trucks, the gun lobby       would lose the public debate.        The Tiahrt Amendment. A blatant and crucial example of this       iron curtain surrounding information about the carnage and       criminality caused by firearms is a federal spending       prohibition known as the ``Tiahrt Amendment.''        For the past six fiscal years (2004 through 2010),       legislation making appropriations for ATF has contained       language severely restricting release of information about       guns traced to crime scenes contained in the agency's       Firearms Tracing System database. This restriction has become       known as the ``Tiahrt Amendment,'' after its principal       sponsor, Representative Todd Tiahrt of Kansas.        For many years, crime gun tracing data was publicly       available under the provisions of the Freedom of Information       Act (FOIA). It was an imperfect but extraordinarily useful       surrogate for a badly needed, but nonexistent, national       firearms and public health database and tracking system.       Crime gun tracing data was routinely used by city officials       and law enforcement agencies to determine the sources of       illegally trafficked firearms and to identify corrupt gun       dealers and the types of guns most often traced to crime. The       ``Tiahrt Amendment'' cut off even this basic data. It       prohibits ATF from releasing any data contained in the       database, except in a limited fashion to individual law       enforcement agencies. There is also a prohibition on use of       the data in civil litigation.        Proponents of the ``Tiahrt'' restrictions claim that the       release of tracing data could interfere with ongoing law       enforcement investigations. However, prior to implementation       of the ``Tiahrt Amendment'' exemptions to the FOIA enabled       ATF to withhold any information that could interfere with law       enforcement investigations. The FOIA explicitly protects from       disclosure any information that would interfere with       enforcement or reveal confidential information. Moreover, ATF       compilations of tracing data (e.g., top 10 crime guns) bore       no conceivable relation to the compromise of any       investigation. The ``Tiahrt Amendment'' simply represents an       unwarranted and cynical restriction on public access to       information, enacted in the interest of protecting the gun       industry and acquiesced to by a Congress frightened by the       NRA.        The ``Tiahrt Amendment'' also serves to hide the source of       assault weapons used in crime--including those detailed in       this study. For example, it is impossible to document the       sources of the assault weapons used in California, where the       sale of such weapons is banned, although experience suggests       that these weapons are illegally trafficked from states with       lax gun laws such as Nevada and Arizona.        Surrogate data sources. In the absence of a responsible       national firearms information policy, researchers, public       policy analysts, and policymakers have sought out information       in various interstices of public life, such as public polling       and media reports. While none claim that these surrogate       sources of data are comprehensive or ``scientific,'' they       represent the best information available in the stark aridity       of data about guns and their effect on public health and       safety in the United States.        The current report. This report was developed in response       to a number of stories in the news media, as well as Violence       Policy Center staff conversations with law enforcement       personnel, from which it appeared that: (1) assault weapons       continue to be the source of many deaths and injuries       throughout the United States; and, (2) law enforcement       agencies have become concerned enough about the frequency of       their encounters with assault weapons that many are issuing       assault rifles to their patrol units as a way of ``evening       up'' the firepower. In short, as has so often been seen in       the past three decades, the gun industry first increased the       level of firepower available to criminals by marketing       enhanced lethality, and then persuaded the law enforcement       community that it needed to ``arm up'' in order to keep pace       with the criminals.        The information described in the following pages is based       on a compilation derived from multiple searches using a       variety of terms (``assault weapons'' and ``assault rifles,''       for example) of reports published in U.S. news media and       included in the commercial database Nexis between March 1,       2005 and February 28, 2007. Stories that recounted firearm-      related events outside of those date ranges were discarded.       For example, if a story within the date range reported an       appellate decision or trial of a shooting that occurred prior       to the date range, that story was eliminated.        No claim is made that the information compiled here is       exhaustive, much less complete. It is a fair conclusion from       common experience and examination of police records that many       more crimes of violence occur than are reported in the news       media on any given day. Recognizing this, the numbers cited       in this study most likely represent the floor, not the       ceiling, of assault weapon incidents, and are best suited to       determining overall trends, not whole numbers or rankings.       Inspection of the stories themselves indicates that in the       vast preponderance of cases they are based on law enforcement       reports. Accordingly, the use of terms such as assault weapon       or assault rifle in these cases is usually derived from       police descriptions.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from New York (Mr. Higgins).   MR. HIGGINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, no technology advances more  quickly in our society than the technology of killing. Every day,  weapons of mass destruction are being made and manipulated to kill more  people more quickly.   In Buffalo, New York, May 14, one shooter, a racist shooter, went  into a supermarket on Jefferson Avenue and shot 13 people, killing 10  of them. The shooting started and was completed in 2 minutes and 3  seconds; one shooter.   I often heard it said that the best way to stop a bad guy with a gun  is a good guy with a gun. There was a good guy with a gun in the store  that day that was working security; a retired 30-year-veteran of the  Buffalo Police Department. But he was helpless because he was outgunned  by the bad guy with the gun who had an assault rifle.   I thank Mr. Cicilline for his leadership on this issue, for his  thoughtful approach to this, and I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Chu).  [[Page H7522]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Green).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Nevada (Ms. Titus).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the Chairman of the  Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished majority leader of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The previous speaker on the Republican side said that citizens must  be able to meet the government with equal arms. The United States  Government has hydrogen bombs. Does he think that every citizen ought  to have a hydrogen bomb?   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from  Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin).                                time  1715     Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished  gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), a member of the Judiciary  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on each side?    Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to  close.   Mr. Speaker, it is no surprise that assault weapons are the weapon of  choice for mass shooters and those who target law enforcement. They are  designed for ruthless efficiency, killing the most people in the  shortest amount of time.   The gentleman from Ohio is right, I did say in the committee, ``Spare  us the BS.'' I meant the Republican BS about the Constitution, about  the Second Amendment.   The Second Amendment is designed not to allow people to fight the  government.   Do they want to take up arms against American troops? Is that what  they say?   That is what they say. You saw what that did with the insurrection we  had recently, and that was a mild case.   No, the Second Amendment is designed to allow for a well-regulated  militia, which is to say in our day the National Guard.   The assault weapons ban would take the weapons of war off our streets  and save countless lives, and that is why it is supported by all  associations of police, the American Federation of Teachers, the  American College of Physicians, the American Public Health Association,  the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, the National Organization  of Black Law Enforcement Executives, the Major Cities Chiefs  Association. They know what they are doing.   The assault weapons ban would take these weapons of war off our  streets. It would prevent more of the Uvaldes, more of the Parklands,  more of the Tree of Life synagogues.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this important  legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.
