 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution, and I  appreciate the opportunity to work on it with my good friend and co- chair of the HBCU Caucus, Alma Adams. Alma and I have worked tirelessly  over the past year and a half on issues of importance to our HBCUs. We  were elected together in 2014 and have both been actively engaged in  helping lead on HBCU issues before this Congress over the past four  terms.   All four of Arkansas' HBCUs have received bomb threats, Mr. Speaker.  University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff, our land grant university, was  the first to receive a bomb threat. Later, Philander Smith, Arkansas  Baptist College, and Shorter College all received bomb threats, all in  my hometown of Little Rock.   These bomb threats began on January 4, and we are seeing continued  bomb threats even as of last week. According to the FBI, at least 28  historically Black colleges and universities have received such a  threat, and they have received threats multiple times.   Imagine being a student and learning your school has had a bomb  threat. Imagine being a parent and learning that your child's school  has had a bomb threat. It would be terrifying. As a student, a campus  community member, or a parent, this cannot stand.    These bomb threats are meant to invoke fear in our HBCU communities.  This violence is unacceptable, and it cannot become the norm for our  historically Black colleges and universities. I am deeply disturbed and  saddened that we even have to be on the floor today to carry on this  conversation.   We are condemning these threats by this resolution. I expect an  overwhelming bipartisan support. I urge it. I thank Alma, again, for  her leadership on it. I thank Mr. Scott and Mrs. Miller-Meeks.
