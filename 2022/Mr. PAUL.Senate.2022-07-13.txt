 Madam President, I rise today to honor the career of  Mike Burress for his dedicated service to better the Commonwealth of  Kentucky. In his over 37 years with the Lincoln Trail Area Development  District administering and writing grants, Mike has worked tirelessly  to better our cities and communities.   Mike started his career as a community development adviser, providing  direct support and coordination to the regional planning and  development process. A few short years later, Mike was promoted to  associate director for community and economic development, where he was  responsible for the day-to-day supervision and coordination of the  community development department.   In the summer of 1998, Mike was promoted to the district's deputy  director, primarily overseeing community and economic development  throughout the eight-county region. In 2018, the Lincoln Trail Area  Development District board of directors selected Mike to become the  district's fifth executive director.   In the last 4 years, his leadership and advocacy as executive  director have benefited area development districts throughout the  State. Mike's ongoing work with local, State, and Federal delegations  as well as nongovernmental organizations highlights the essential work  the area development districts do in assisting their constituents.   Mike and his wife Judy are Hardin County natives with three children  and two grandchildren. I am proud to salute and thank Mike for a  remarkable career of dedication to his community.                            ____________________
