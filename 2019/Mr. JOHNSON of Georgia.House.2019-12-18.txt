 Mr. Speaker, I was not among those who  supported impeachment before Ukraine, but I have called for impeachment  today because our President is, as we speak, abusing his power and  placing himself above the law.   President Trump's attempt to sabotage the 2020 election is a clear  and present danger on our democracy.   We the people know this, and more Americans support impeachment today  than at any time since Richard Nixon's final weeks in office. We know  that it is wrong to enlist the help of foreigners in interfering in our  elections. We know it is wrong to cheat, and we know what is at stake.  It is not just that our elections were attacked; our elections are  under attack right now.   The very day the Judiciary Committee voted out Articles of  Impeachment, President Trump welcomed Rudy Giuliani back to the White  House.   President Trump is still at it. He is doubling down. He doesn't think  he can win an election fair and square, so he is trying to cheat. To  ignore these crimes is not just giving the President a pass; it is  giving him a green light. Those who vote against impeachment are not  just endorsing President Trump's past actions but his future ones as  well.   If you think I exaggerate in warning that our elections can be  undermined, I would urge my colleagues to come down to Georgia and find  a Black man or woman of a certain age. They will tell you that the  danger is real. And they will tell you of brave Americans--patriots-- willing to risk far more than a political career who marched,  struggled, and sometimes died so that we could have fair and free  elections. We are not asked to possess even a fraction of their  courage. We are simply called upon today to do what is right. I am  proud to vote ``yes'' on impeachment.
