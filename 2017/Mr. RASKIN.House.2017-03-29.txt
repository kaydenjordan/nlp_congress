 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  [[Page H2551]]  have five legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous materials on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, with my colleague Pramila Jayapal, from  the State of Washington, on behalf of the Progressive Caucus, we are  taking this Special Order hour to focus on the question of the Russian  connection.   This is a matter of utmost seriousness and urgency to the American  people because it goes to the question of our national security and the  political sovereignty of the American people to engage in democracy on  our own without foreign interference, subversion, and sabotage.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine  Waters), the distinguished Congresswoman.    Madam Speaker, I want to thank Ms. Waters for her zealous  work on behalf of her constituents and all Americans.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler),  our distinguished colleague, who is a leading member of the House  Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Washington  State (Ms. Jayapal), who is the co-convener of the Progressive Caucus  Special Order along with me.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Jayapal for her  fantastic leadership for the people of Washington in the city of  Washington and her zealous advocacy for all of the American people.   Mr. Speaker, let me try to recap some of the themes that we have  brought up this evening and talk about what is really at stake here.  But I want to start with some good news, because there was really some  great news out of Russia on Sunday, where more than 75,000 people  across the country braved the tyranny and despotism of their government  to go out into the streets to express their commitment to democracy,  human rights, and against corruption.   They were focused very specifically on some of the oligarchs who  surround Vladimir Putin. One of them, Prime Minister Medvedev, it has  just been learned, has amassed more than $1 billion, as a public  servant, in mansions, in vineyards in Italy, in fancy cars, in  jewelry--$1 billion. And the people of Russia are up in arms about the  corruption, the kleptocracy, the stealing from the Russian people,  which is increasingly impoverished by the imperial designs and the  corrupt practices of Putin and his team.   So tens of thousands of people went into the streets to protest.  These are brave people, because you are talking about an authoritarian  government there, a dictator, a despot, someone who orders out for the  assassination of his political enemies. Many of them were arrested.  Hundreds of them were arrested in Moscow, and some of them are still in  jail right now.   Mr. Speaker, we should be on the side of the protesters in Russia.  That is who we are as America. We are a nation conceived in  revolutionary insurgency against corruption, against monarchy, against  dictators and autocrats and theocrats and kleptocrats who steal from  the people. That is who we are.   We should be meeting with them. We should be meeting with the human  rights activists. We should be meeting with the anticorruption marchers  who are putting themselves on the front lines of history. We should be  meeting with the dissenters and the critics of Vladimir Putin and the  oligarchs and big business kleptocrats who surround him. But, instead,  our government has aligned with Putin himself, with the insiders in  Russia. That is totally antithetical to the design of America, when you  think about it.    Mr. Speaker, we have the great good fortune to go to work every day  surrounded by portraits of people who built this country, like George  Washington, who is right over there. We have got portraits of Thomas  Jefferson. We have got portraits of Frederick Douglass. We have got  portraits of Abraham Lincoln, who actually served in this body and,  when he was here, spent a lot of his time railing about a war that was  concocted with lies by President James Polk, the Mexican War.   But Lincoln knew how delicate and precious and precarious an  enterprise democracy is. In the Gettysburg Address, he posed the  question of how long government of the people, by the people, and for  the people can last. Will it perish from the Earth? And he put the  question to the people because, he said, it is up to us.   Democracy is a rarity in human history. Democracy is not the norm.  That is why America is a miraculous experiment on Earth. If you don't  do anything, you are going to end up with dictators and despots and  kleptocrats who steal from their own people, like Vladimir Putin.   But America started a different way. The first three words of our  Constitution are ``We, the people.'' We, the people; we flipped the  whole design. Before that, the whole theory was that the king had the  power, and the king got power directly from God; and everybody was a  subject of the king, and everybody served the king.   Our Founders had the vision, in that outburst of enlightenment and  enthusiasm, to say, no, we are going to try something different:   We are going to start a government based on we, the people, and we  are going to separate church and state; and we are not going to dictate  to people their religious worship, and we are not  [[Page H2555]]  going to dictate to people their political beliefs. There is going to  be freedom of thought and freedom of speech.   We don't trust the collapse of all powers into one, which Madison  said was the very definition of tyranny. We are going to separate  powers. The legislature, Congress, will come first, Article I. It will  represent the people. But then we are going to have someone else  execute the laws of the people, faithfully execute the laws of the  people. That will be the President. And when there are disputes, they  will be adjudicated in a third branch of government, by the Supreme  Court, to figure it out.   But we are going to separate the powers, because when one guy has got  all the power, it endangers the freedoms and the liberties of everybody  else. We even said, even though our President is limited by the  separation of powers, we are going to make sure that the President and  also the Members of Congress will have an undivided, zealous loyalty  only to the American people.   Article I, section 9 says we cannot accept presents, emoluments,  which are any kind of payments, offices, or titles from foreign  princes, foreign kings, or foreign states, period. We can't accept them  without the approval of Congress. It doesn't go.   There were all kinds of powers that were sending spies and saboteurs  to Washington, when the country first began, to try to pay off elected  officials, but our Founders had the vision to say: No, we are not going  to accept that. We are not going to allow payments and bribes and fancy  presents being given to our elected officials.   So one government, separated powers, based on public integrity,  honesty, and devotion to the people. That is the model here.   Now, we should be on the side of democratic movements all over the  Earth, like the people who assembled in Moscow on Sunday, who assembled  in Siberia on Sunday. There were marchers even there. It was like our  Women's March. It took place all over the country. Those are our  people. We should be on the side of the people who are trying to  overthrow the despotism in Russia.   But look what is happening. Tyranny and authoritarianism are on the  march all over the world. Russia is the headquarters of it, but you can  find it everywhere you look:   Philippines, a madman dictator who thinks he has the power to send  his agents out to go and shoot people on the street because they look  like they are a drug dealer and brags about it, Duterte;   Hungary, another favorite of Vladimir Putin, Mr. Orban, who is  cracking down on press freedom, on human rights in his country;   Iran, authoritarian, theocratic state; people being thrown in jail  for blasphemy, for heresy, for apostasy, for religious offenses;   Saudi Arabia, fomenting racist, anti-Semitic propaganda and sending  it out, oppressing people based on religion, not even allowing women to  drive in their society.   Everywhere you turn, tyranny, despotism on the march.   And Mr. Putin has a plan. How do we know it? Do we know it from the  Democratic Caucus or the Republican Conference? No. We know it from our  intelligence agencies, from the FBI, the CIA, the National Security  Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency.   Seventeen of America's intelligence agencies came back with a report,  and they said Vladimir Putin has a plan to continue to destabilize and  undermine liberal democracy all over the world.   Brexit was part of it. The intervention in our election was part of  it. They are going after France, where they want the rightwing, ultra  nationalist, anti-immigrant campaign of Marine Le Pen to triumph in  France. They are trying to do it in Germany, which is now the strongest  outpost of liberal democracy left on Earth, as of yet, uncontaminated  by the penetration of Russian intelligence and Putin's agents.   But what did they do to us? What is this all about?   Well, we had an election in 2016. The sovereign people of America had  an election. Now, unfortunately, we are still using the electoral  college, which is antiquated and obsolescent. There is a movement to  change it afoot to the national popular vote. But be that as it may,  that is our system. We haven't reformed it yet. It is our system. It is  our elections here in America. But the electoral college makes it more  vulnerable because you just have to intervene in a handful of States in  order to sway the vote.    What did Putin do? Again, we know this. I am not making this up. We  know this from our intelligence agencies. If you don't believe me, you  go to your computer and you just look up the intelligence agency report  on Russian interference and espionage and sabotage in our 2016  election.   And what did they do?   They spied on different Democratic institutions, like the Democratic  National Committee, and they spied on particular people.   They engaged in not just cyber espionage, but cyber sabotage.   They orchestrated a series of leaks which dominated election coverage  in the United States for several weeks.   They orchestrated a campaign of fake news and propaganda in order to  undermine Hillary Clinton, who was reviled--and is reviled,  presumably--by Vladimir Putin because she challenged him, and she  challenged the human rights situation in Russia and the involvement of  Russia with various dictators in other parts of the world. So they  interfered in our election.   When I first got to Congress, that was still being disputed. When we  tried to talk about this, it was being said, well, there is no evidence  that Russia did this. Well, guess what? The evidence is replete. It is  decisive. It is determinative.                                time  1800    Now we are not hearing from our friends on the other side: Well,  Russia didn't do this.   Now they are saying something different: Well, Russia may have done  that. It may have been this massive, orchestrated campaign to undermine  and subvert our elections, but there is no proof that that was actual  collusion by the Trump campaign.   About that, I want to say two things. Number one, it shouldn't make  any difference. Let's say nobody in the Trump campaign knew anybody in  Russia and never heard of Vladimir Putin. It would make no difference  because we should still view this as a radical threat to the political  sovereignty of the American people.   But the second answer is even more important. As all of my colleagues  were pointing out before, every day we get more evidence not just of  contacts and connections, but actual collaboration and cooperation  between people in the Trump campaign, the Trump family, and the Trump  universe with Vladimir Putin and his closest agents and assets  throughout Russia and around the world.   Let's just recap a few of those: former national security adviser  Michael Flynn was forced to resign, or I guess he was fired by  President Trump after he failed to disclose the scope of his contacts  with Russians, including Ambassador Kislyak. He was paid more than  $33,000 in 2015 by Russian-funded propaganda media, and the full extent  of his relationship to the Russians is still being investigated.   Attorney General Jeff Sessions was forced to recuse himself from this  whole matter because he met several times with Ambassador Kislyak, who  has been described as Russia's top spy in America during the 2016  election. Then--I will speak charitably here--he misled his own  colleagues in the Senate about it at his Senate confirmation hearing  raising the issue and then denying that he had had any contact with the  Russians at all.   Senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner met with the Russian  Ambassador at Trump Tower a few months ago in December of 2016. We have  got former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page, who has  admitted that he met with the Russian Ambassador and other Russians in  Cleveland at the Republican National Convention and met with managers  from Rosneft, the Russian-owned oil company. He himself owns shares of  a Russian energy company called Gazprom.   Roger Stone, Trump's longtime buddy and political adviser, was  working with WikiLeaks, which published documents during the election  based on information divulged because of Russian interference and  espionage that  [[Page H2556]]  tilted the scales again in favor of Trump in the campaign, and he  hosted a series on the Russian propaganda network.   Paul Manafort, Trump's campaign manager for 6 months, was an adviser  to Ukrainian oligarchs who got sweetheart business deals from Putin's  associates. He was also a business partner of Russian oligarchs close  to Putin. He resigned in August of last year after reports surfaced  that suggested that he had received $12.7 million from Ukraine's pro- Russia former president Viktor Yanukovych. He was on the payroll for  $10 million, it has just come out, in order to promote the Russian  perspective and Putin's propaganda in Washington, D.C., and throughout  the United States in order to change the course of U.S. politics.   Now, I am sorry to put these out there as a bunch of clues. I wish we  had a coherent story to tell. We don't, because what we need is a  comprehensive 9/11-style independent investigation to figure out what  precisely happened. In America you are presumed innocent until proven  guilty. Nobody is putting any of these people in jail, but it has come  out, despite their best efforts in some cases, that they are up to  their necks in the Russian connection.   What does that mean for American democracy?   What we know is there was a massive independent expenditure in 2006.  That is what we call it under our FEC law when you go out and spend  money to try to destroy one candidate and help another. There was a  massive foreign independent expenditure orchestrated by Vladimir Putin.   The question is: Was it, in FEC terms, a coordinated expenditure?  That is, did the Trump team actively work with them?   As we are saying, there are lots of clues that suggest it is so. I am  not willing to say that they were definitely in cahoots with them. I am  not willing to say that they were necessarily collaborating the  election. But the evidence accumulates every single day that points in  that direction.   Now every day in Washington, D.C., what we are doing is running  around because there is a coverup that has been unfolding. Today, of  course, we are dealing with a resolution in the House Judiciary  Committee to try to get to the bottom of what Chairman Nunes of the  House Intelligence Committee actually did when he ran over to the White  House with some information that he had about Trump apparently being  picked up incidentally in conversations that were being tapped by the  American intelligence community with foreign operatives. Again, it is  shadowy because we don't know the whole thing. But what we do know is  that Chairman Nunes went to the White House to tell President Trump or  his deputies before he told anybody here in Congress.   Now, we have been saying from the beginning we want an independent,  objective 9/11-style commission--no Democratic politicians, no  Republican politicians, and no elected officials. Let's agree on gifted  statesmen and stateswomen who can really get to the bottom of this if  we care about the truth. Their answer has been: No, we have got the  Intelligence Committee to do it instead.   But now what we have got is the Intelligence Committee chair  traveling back and forth to the White House, spilling the beans, which  undermines everybody's confidence in the integrity of the investigation  that is taking place into the Russian connection and what actually  happened in the 2016 election.   Mr. Speaker, in the American system of government, elected officials  have to have undivided loyalty to the American people. That is why we  have got the Emoluments Clause: no presents, no emoluments, no offices,  and no titles from foreign governments. That is why we swear an oath to  the Constitution of the United States of America. Each one of us who  has the great honor and privilege of coming to Washington, D.C., to  represent the people swear an oath to our Constitution and to our  people.    We are not a country, like so many, that are defined by one religion.  We are not defined by one race. We are not defined by one ethnicity. We  are not defined by one political party. We are not defined by one  political ideology. We are defined by one Constitution. That is what  unifies us as Americans. We must be constitutional patriots here and  insist upon our constitutional values and the rule of law for democracy  to be meaningful in the 21st century.   There is a new model of tyrannical government traveling all over the  world, and all the bullies and despots have found each other. They are  in league together. They want government as a moneymaking operation.  They want government as a moneymaking operation for private elites in  their country, whether it is in Russia or the Philippines or Saudi  Arabia. Sad to say, we are starting to see the development of that  right here in the United States of America.   So we have the opportunity and we have the responsibility to exercise  our rights as citizens under the First Amendment and to exercise our  privileges as Members of Congress under the speech or debate clause to  speak up against the march of tyranny all over the Earth. We have got  an obligation to resist the corruption--the same corruption that the  people in Russia were marching against on Sunday. We must demand real  answers about what took place in our Presidential election in 2016. The  intelligence agencies warned us that what happened in 2016 was a dress  rehearsal for what is going to happen the next time and the time after  that.   I want to say something about the geopolitics of this. Think about it  for a second:   Who has got the strongest economy on Earth?   We do, the freest, the original democracy. We have got the strongest  economy.   Who has got the strongest military?   We do.   Russia can't come close. But the way I understand what happened in  2016 was that Vladimir Putin--who is not an honest man, but he is a  clever man--decided that this was a moment of opportunity for Russia.  He is the former chief of the KGB. Let's not forget that. He is the guy  who said that the greatest catastrophe of the 20th century was the  collapse of the Soviet Union. He is an irredentist imperialist who  wants to go back and reconstruct the Russian empire.   But what he saw was an opportunity, which is that today the whole  world is linked, and it is linked by the internet. He created something  that I think of as a Manhattan Project for military conquest and defeat  of the liberal democracies in the 21st century.   He set about to figure out this question: How can we undermine and  subvert the liberal democracies?   These are open societies. America is an open society. We pride  ourselves on the First Amendment, on freedom of speech, and on free  dialogue and discussion.   So he said to himself: How can I subvert and undermine that?   The answer became very clear: to create--really on the cheap, because  compared to military might, this is pennies on the dollar--he was going  to create an internet army, in effect, to try to undermine and subvert  our democracy with fake news, with propaganda, and with paid trolls to  get information out to try to destroy the reputations of opposition  politicians and to try to promote the parties that he viewed as  ``within his camp.''   Guess what?   It still is going on today. It is still happening. We are not talking  about ancient history. We are talking about an ongoing project. That is  why I am proud to be a member of the minority caucus here, the  Democratic Party caucus, which is insisting that we create an  independent, objective, neutral, 9/11-style commission to investigate  the Russian connection and what happened with the attack on American  democracy in 2016.   We have got to get to the bottom of it. Two-thirds of the American  people in public opinion polls say that they support such a commission.  There is nobody who would oppose it except for somebody who has got  something to hide. But for the rest of us, we have every reason to get  to the bottom of this plot to destroy our election in 2016, and we have  every reason to defend this great constitutional democracy with  everything we have got.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 6 o'clock and 15 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, March 30, 2017, at 9 a.m.                            ____________________
