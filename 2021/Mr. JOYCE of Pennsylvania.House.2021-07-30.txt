 Madam Speaker, following months of  disappointing jobs reports, rising inflation, and irresponsible  messaging on how to combat the COVID-19 virus, the American people know  that Democrat policies are to blame for the rising inflation that our  Nation is facing.   Today, Americans are making less money than they were 1 year ago.  With annualized real wages down nearly 4 percent, it is families, not  politicians that are feeling the effects of President Biden's failed  economic policies. Inflation, very simply, is taxation, and it has  increased every month since President Biden has taken office.   While Democrats in Congress mocked concerns about rising inflation,  we saw the effects that this crisis is having at the gas station and at  the grocery store. Now, as experts warn that the effects of inflation  may last longer than anticipated, President Biden has suggested  flooding our economy with even more wasteful spending. Urging $100  bribes for individuals to get vaccinated and spending billions of  dollars for social programs will not fix our broken economy.   The American people know that this is a failure, and they know that  Democrat policy is to blame.                            ____________________
