 Mr. Speaker, I say good morning to America.   This is not a health bill that we are readying ourselves to vote on.  It is a tax bill for wealthy people.   I just left the Committee on Rules. We started our session there at 7  this morning. I have in hand a closed rule that will allow for 4 hours  of debate. Later on this afternoon, the Republicans will accomplish  what they set out to do.   The bill provides $274.9 billion in tax cuts for the highest income  Americans. Over half of the tax cuts in the bill go to millionaires. In  the year 2020, 61 percent of the cuts go to those earning more than a  million dollars.   At the same time, Republicans cut Medicaid by more than $880 billion.  That is money for poor people that will not have those benefits.  Republicans cut Medicaid by that amount for working families.   Donald Trump's people and his Cabinet will do very well.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, today is a sad day for this institution.   Why are we here? Well, after 13 hours at the Rules Committee on  Wednesday,  [[Page H2380]]  did we report to the floor the Republicans' replacement to the  Affordable Care Act? No.   And why not? Because the legislation was not extreme enough. It  didn't hurt enough people. It didn't make enough people uninsured. It  didn't give a large enough tax break to the wealthiest among us.   That 13-hour exercise yielded nothing except to reveal the callous  depths of the Republican Party's attempt to deprive health care from 24  million people.   So after my friends on the other side of the aisle added yet another  manager's amendment, bringing the total to five, and after stripping  away essential health benefits, we are here this morning to push this  extreme, dangerous, and callous bill under martial law.   But why are we really here? Is this bill actually about improving  health care in this country? By my estimation, and by the analysis of  virtually every healthcare group--Mr. McGovern has introduced some of  them: hospitals, medical organizations, and the nonpartisan  Congressional Budget Office--the answer is a flat-out, resounding no.   Premiums are going to rise. Millions upon millions of people will  lose health coverage. Essential benefits will be stripped away, and 400  of the wealthiest Americans will get a substantial tax cut, while  Medicaid is being cut by $880 billion.   Mr. Speaker, during that 13-hour marathon meeting that yielded  nothing but a rule allowing Republicans to continue to ram this measure  through Congress, I quoted from Scripture, from the King James Bible,  Matthew 25:45. It says:         Then shall He answer them, saying, Verily, I say unto you,       inasmuch as you did it not to one of the least of these, you       did it not to me.    My friends on the other side of the aisle often cite Scripture in  their legislative motivations. I ask them now: How does cutting the  benefits from the least among us, while showering more wealth upon the  wealthiest among us, square with these teachings?   In addition, Mr. Speaker, I noted to them that we hear from them all  the time about liberty. So I noted that, in the Preamble to the  Constitution, the document that guides our great Nation and that we all  swear an oath to uphold, that we are entrusted to also, and I quote  from the Preamble, ``promote the general welfare.'' I also note for you  that this charge is placed before the first mention of the word  ``liberty.''   Does stripping away of essential health benefits, which include  maternity and newborn care, pediatric services, and emergency services,  promote the general welfare?   Does cutting $880 billion from Medicaid promote the general welfare?   Does ensuring that, by 2026, 56 million people under the age of 64  will be left without coverage promote general welfare?   Finally, Mr. Speaker, in the debate at committee on this shameful  bill, I answered the Republican charge that this bill was about freedom  when I quoted a verse from Janis Joplin's ``Me and Bobby McGee.'' What  she was saying is: ``Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to  lose.''    Mr. Speaker, if this extreme bill becomes law, a bill  which has been rushed through Congress, amended without care, brought  before us without hearings, without a CBO score, without thoughtful  consideration, without a Democratic amendment being approved, and  without a clue, I fear--indeed, I know--that the American people will  find themselves with nothing left to lose when it comes to their and  their family's health care, which is the most perverse and wretched  kind of freedom as you may have ever seen.
