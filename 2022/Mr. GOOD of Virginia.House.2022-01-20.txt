 Mr. Speaker, today marks 1 year of total  Democrat control of the Federal Government--1 year of this Biden  administration. In addition to all the other disastrous policies and  the crises created by this President, it marks another year with 1  million babies being slaughtered in the womb in our country.   Tomorrow we will, once again, march for life here in Washington, DC,  and I will be privileged to join that march. May it be the last time  that we do that before the Supreme Court rightly overturns the brutal,  vicious, inhumane, dishonest, and inaccurate interpretation of the  highest law of the land--the Constitution--giving the right to  terminate a pregnancy in the womb.   Sixty-five million babies have been lost since that happened nearly  50 years ago. These are inventors, these are scientists, these are  ministers, and these are healthcare providers who are not serving and  helping our country here today.   Equality begins in the womb, and freedom begins in the womb, and the  science tells us that life begins in the womb. May the Supreme Court  overturn Roe, and may we begin to protect all innocent, precious life  in the womb.                            ____________________
