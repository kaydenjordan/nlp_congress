 Madam Speaker, today the Democratic majority is not  judging the President with fairness, but impeaching him with a  vengeance.   In the investigation of the President, fundamental principles which  Americans hold dear, privacy, fairness, checks and balances, have been  seriously violated, and why? Because we are here today because the  Democrats in the House are paralyzed with hatred of President Trump,  and until the Democrats free themselves of this hatred, our country  will suffer.   Now, if that sounds familiar, you have got a longer memory than the  Democrats. Those same comments, but addressing Republicans' actions  towards President Clinton, were made by Nancy Pelosi in 1998.   Could there be a clearer indication of the hypocrisy that fuels the  Democratic sham impeachment process currently taking place behind  closed doors?   If Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats truly care about, in Pelosi's own  words, ``the fundamental principles which Americans hold dear, privacy,  fairness, checks and balances,'' they will restore transparency and  integrity to this process.                            ____________________
