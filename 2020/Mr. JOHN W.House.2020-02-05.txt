 ROSE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the  Puppies Assisting Wounded Servicemembers for Veterans Therapy Act, or  PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act.   I thank the distinguished gentleman from Tennessee for yielding me  this time and for his service to the good people of Tennessee.   I also wholeheartedly thank Representative Stivers for approaching me  about cosponsoring this outstanding policy proposal. His leadership on  this issue is truly appreciated by me, but more importantly, by  America's veterans.   While we are enjoying a time of unparalleled economic growth in my  lifetime, a safer and more secure Nation, and 243 years of enduring  freedom made possible in no small part by the sacrifice of our  servicemembers, we also live in a time when approximately 20 veterans  are lost to suicide every day.   This heartbreaking reality calls us to action. Research has  demonstrated the powerful effect of service dogs in the lives of those  suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. These loyal companions  have been shown to lead to stronger mental health, greater purpose in  life, and renewed hope.   Today, I stand up for our veterans in Tennessee and all of our  veterans across the country who would find support from PAWS. I invite  my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to  [[Page H780]]  join us in supporting our veterans and vote for the PAWS for Veterans  Therapy Act.
