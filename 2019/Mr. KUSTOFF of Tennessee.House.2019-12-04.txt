 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague  from Oregon. I want to thank Chairman Pallone and Ranking Member Walden  for their hard work on this important bipartisan issue.   Robocall scams leave anyone with a cell phone vulnerable to fraud.  Today it is time for Congress to act. The TRACED Act expands the  authority for the Federal Government to punish these folks and will  help verify legitimate calls.   I want to thank everyone who worked to bring this bill to the floor  [[Page H9244]]  for a vote, and I urge all my colleagues to show their support.
