 Mr. Speaker, first, I want to thank Chairman Brady of  the House Committee on Ways and Means for his leadership of the  committee, and also Mr. Roskam and Mr. Thompson for their support here  on the floor today.   I also want to thank Congressman Raul Ruiz for cosponsoring this  legislation and making it bipartisan.   This legislation before us today, H.R. 1476, will improve access to  health savings accounts for Native Americans who choose to receive care  at Indian Health Service facilities by ending an unnecessary penalty  against them.   Mr. Speaker, if you or I were to use a health savings account, we  would be able to immediately make a contribution to it the day after  you receive care at a doctor's office. There is no prohibition on  making those contributions.   However, right now, Native Americans across the country, including my  constituents, cannot do the same thing if they receive treatment from a  doctor at the Indian Health Service. Instead, they are prohibited from  immediately saving the money they earned and must wait for 3 months  before they can make another contribution into the personal account  they use to provide for their health and that of their family.   This makes no sense. Instead, this commonsense legislation eliminates  the problem. If this bill becomes law, Native Americans will no longer  have to wait 3 months. They will be able to receive treatment from  Indian Health Service doctors near them and save money in their HSAs  whenever they want.   This is a bipartisan, patient-centered solution to a government- created problem.                                time  1500    It will benefit the Saginaw Chippewas in my district as well as  Tribes throughout Michigan and across the country. It will help those  who work hard to save money and take care of their families.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues for their support of this  legislation.
