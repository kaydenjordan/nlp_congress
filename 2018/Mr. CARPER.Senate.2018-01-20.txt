 Mr. President, as a native West Virginian, I want to say  how proud I am of our colleague, Mr. Manchin.   Perhaps you have heard the old saying: I am Tom Carper or I am so- and-so, and I approve this message. We do a lot of that on political  campaigns. Well, I approve of much of what Joe says, and today is no  exception.   My wife and I like to go to movies. We don't get to see much of them,  but over the holidays we had a chance to see a couple of them. One of  the best movies of this past year was a movie about World War II  Britain, ``Churchill.'' I am reminded, as we wander through this  impasse, of two things Churchill said. About democracy, he said,  ``Democracy is the worst form of government [devised by man] except for  all the [rest].''   Think about that. This is a hard way to govern, and we have proved it  again. A lot of democracies around the world prove it again year after  year after year.   Churchill knew we saved their behinds over in Britain in World War  II. We came to the rescue and helped turn the tide. He was always  grateful for that, but he used to like to poke fun at our country.  Another great Churchill quote was about America. He said this about  America: ``You can always count on America to do the right thing in the  end, after trying everything else.''   Think about that. This situation we are in right now with the  shutdown--a lot of people are calling it the Trump shutdown--whatever  you call it, I think it cries out for leadership.   I just want to quote comments of one person at the time, someone who  was not in elective office, but he said these words talking about  leadership during an earlier shutdown. This individual said:         Well, if you say who gets fired it always has to be the       top. I mean, problems start from the top and they have to get       solved from the top and the president's the leader. And he's       got to get everybody in a room and he's got to lead.    This person went on to say:         When they talk about the government shutdown, they're going       to be talking about the president of the United States, who       the president was at that time.    This individual goes on:         They're not going to be talking about who was head of the       House, the head of the Senate, who's running things in       Washington. So, I really think the pressure is on the       president.    The President will do what it takes to lead. Those comments were  given in 2013 during an earlier shutdown. Those are the words of Donald  Trump, criticizing then-President Barack Obama.   Think about those words then and think about those words today. The  President has ``got to get everybody in a room and he's got to lead''-- has got to get everybody in a room, and he has to lead. This was true 5  years ago, 4 years ago, and it is true today. With this President, we  find a willingness on the part of Senator Schumer, Senator McConnell,  Speaker Ryan, and Leader Pelosi responding to an invitation to go to  the President even tonight, go to the White House even tonight, and sit  down and try to hammer things out. It ain't going to be easy, but,  frankly, there is a lot of consensus here on what we ought to do, in  terms of the budget priorities, defense spending, and nondefense. There  is a lot more agreement than disagreement. We heard discussion about  that between Senator Manchin and our colleague from Alaska.   I think there is a fair amount of agreement, in terms of extending  coverage--maybe not permanent but extending the Children's Health  Insurance Program 6 to 10 years. The State and Federal partnership  covers about 9 million kids. There is a lot of agreement on that.   There is a lot of agreement on the Federal community health centers.  They provide a cost-effective, affordable approach to healthcare  coverage for primary care for people who don't have coverage, maybe  don't have any money, and they can get coverage and have access to  primary care, in many cases, in their own community. They are important  in Alaska, they are important in West Virginia, they are important in  Delaware, and they are important to the speaker from Missouri who is  going to succeed me. There is a lot of agreement there.    Frankly, you have a lot of agreement on what should happen to the  Dreamers, these young people who were brought here by their parents, in  many cases years ago. They grew up here and were educated here. In many  cases, they are working here. In a lot of cases, they are serving in  the military. They are teachers and police officers, and they are doing  all kinds of things.   It is a time in this country where we have roughly 3 million jobs  that are going unfilled because the folks who would like to do those  jobs in many cases don't have the education, the experience, the  interest in doing those jobs, the willingness. They don't have the work  ethics. In many cases, they can't pass a drug test.   It is a time where we are in the eighth year of the longest running  economic expansion in the history of the country. Barack Obama and Joe  Biden took office in 2009, at the bottom of the worst recession since  the Great Depression. They handed off to this administration a year ago  today the longest running economic expansion in the history of the  country, and for the past year, that expansion has continued.   One of the keys to making sure our economy expands is to make sure  the workforce our employers need is being provided by our schools--high  schools, public schools, colleges, universities, community colleges.  And at the very time when employers are saying, ``Look, when we open  our doors for business on Monday, there are going to be 3 million jobs  that we don't have anybody to come to work to fill,'' are we serious  about saying that, rather than enabling 800,000 or so Dreamers who have  the skills, who have the education, who have the work ethic, who want  to do the job--rather than letting you do those jobs, fill those jobs,  we are going to send you back to the country where you were born? And  by the way, we will send about 200,000 Salvadorans who came here at a  time of crisis in their country 10 or 20 years ago--we are going to  send them with you. Does that make sense?   As a former Governor who for 8 years led the State of Delaware to  actually cut taxes 7 out of 8 years, balance our budget 8 years in a  row, pay down debt, earn AAA credit ratings, and saw more jobs created  in 8 years than any 8-year period in the history of the State of  Delaware--I didn't create one of those jobs, but we sure know something  in Delaware about creating a nurturing environment for job creation.  That is what we do in our jobs. We don't create  [[Page S383]]  jobs; we help create that nurturing environment.   Basically sending close to 1 million people who are able to do jobs  that aren't getting done and wouldn't get done, sending them back to  the country where they were born--that makes no sense, no sense at all.   The last thing I will say is this about my little State. Delaware was  the first State to ratify the Constitution. I am very proud of that. We  were the first State to ratify the Constitution--on December 7, 1787.  For 1 whole week, Delaware was the entire United States of America. We  opened up. We let in Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and the rest,  and I think for the most part it has turned out pretty well. We are  struggling a little bit with it right now, but we will get through  this.   One of the keys in Delaware more often than not is working pretty  well--Democrats and Republicans working together, which is what is  needed here. We have had a whole bunch of Governors who did lead; who  were humble, not haughty; who had the heart of a servant; who believed  that Governors unite, not divide; who build bridges, not walls; who  don't try to tear other people down to build themselves up; who are  aspirational and appeal to our better angels. We had a couple of good  Republicans who did that--Michael Castle, Pete du Pont, and others. So  it will be done on a bipartisan basis.   Here are four reasons why Delaware continues to enjoy success, has  enjoyed success. There has been able leadership--and not just Governors  but legislators, Democrats and Republicans.   We have something we call the Delaware Way. To the amazement of a lot  of people, 2 days after the election every other year, winners and  losers get together in Georgetown, DE. In Sussex County, DE, the  southernmost county, the county seat, Georgetown--we have a big brunch  hosted by our community college in Georgetown. Democrats and  Republicans are there--the folks who ran against each other--and their  families and supporters are there.   When the brunch is over, we go outside and we get in these horse- drawn carriages, and winners and losers ride together, side by side,  with their families. There is a big parade, and thousands of people  come. Schools are closed. When the parade is over, we all gather in the  circle in the middle of Georgetown, and we have some speeches, some  inspiring patriotic music, and some prayers. Then the political leaders  of the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, and maybe the  Libertarian Party stand in front of the masses of people. They have  what looks like a big glass aquarium, and it is half full of sand. They  take an ax, and the party leaders lower this ax into the aquarium. They  fill it up with sand from Rehoboth Beach or Bethany or one of our five- star beaches. And then we go off, and people open up their houses, and  Democrats and Republicans spend time together. We lick our wounds and  sort of get to like each other again, and we go on to govern our State.   We use the four c's in Delaware.   This is my last point, and I will yield to Senator McCaskill, who is  ready to roll behind me.   There are four c's. We communicate. We talk to one another in my  State.   Last night when we were on the floor, there was a lot of  communication going on. That is important. We need to continue that  communication. But for God's sake, the President needs to invite our  four leaders--two from the House, two from the Senate; two Democrats,  two Republicans--and have real communication. He needs to provide air  cover for the Republicans in the House who are willing to take up a  reasonable compromise that I think we are willing to pass here in the  Senate. The President has to provide that air cover.   First of all, the first ``c'' is communication. Next is compromise.   In a compromise, nobody wins everything they want. Senator Schumer  was willing to put on the table what Donald Trump has been talking  about for years; that is, a wall, actually authorizing the construction  of a wall--not on every single inch or mile of the border with Mexico  but a good deal of it. That is what Donald Trump is talking about more  in terms of border security than anything else. Do I think that is a  great idea? No, I don't. In some places, a wall makes some sense, and  in a lot of places, it doesn't. There are a lot of other more cost- effective options. There are other things that could be more cost- effective that would enable our 20,000 Border Patrol folks to do their  jobs. But Chuck Schumer put on the table the authorization for building  the wall. That is a pretty good compromise, and that shows we are  willing to compromise.   So the second ``c'' is compromise. The third ``c'' is collaboration,  to actually work together on this stuff. The last ``c'' is civility, to  treat one another the way we would want to be treated. Communicate,  compromise, collaborate, civility--it doesn't work just in Delaware; it  works in States all over this country. It used to work in this place,  in this body, and we could use it again.   The quote that I used from Donald Trump from 4 or 5 years ago talking  about the leadership that Barack Obama needed to show--I think he did.  Sometimes we need to listen to our own words, look at ourselves in the  mirror and remember our own words. Mr. President, we would do well to  do just that.   I yield the floor.
