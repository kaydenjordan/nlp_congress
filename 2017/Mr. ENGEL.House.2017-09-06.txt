 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me,  and I want to pick up where Mr. Crowley left off.   I am for this aid. I am for this aid 100 percent. We should help  these people. As Americans, we should help people all over our country.  But it really hurts that those of us in New York and New Jersey, when  Superstorm Sandy came and we were begging for help, we had to wait 2  months for help, and our friends in Texas on the Republican side of the  aisle, except for one, voted against aid for New York, New Jersey, and  Connecticut.   And now they are asking for aid for Texas, which I support. But it  just goes to show, we never know where these disasters are going to  fall. It is incumbent on all of us that we support our fellow Americans  no matter where they are.   So I say to the people of Texas, my heart goes out for you. My vote  will be there. As much money as you need, you will have.   Mr. Speaker, but I wanted to say to my Republican friends from Texas:  What you did to us during Superstorm Sandy should not stand, should not  be done to any other people, anyplace in the country. We are one  country. We are Americans. We need to help those that need help. I am  for this 100 percent.
