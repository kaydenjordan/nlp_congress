 Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 1, the  polluters over people act. The truth is simple. We have no time to  waste in the fight against climate change.   This Republican bill would reverse years of progress, emboldening  polluters and repealing critical environmental regulations, all while  increasing the Federal deficit.   As a father of two young boys, I know this is not the future we want  to leave for our children.                                time  1700    Instead of rewarding fossil industries with more record-shattering  profits, we need to transition to a clean energy economy by expanding  on Democratic wins like the Inflation Reduction Act.   In my home State of California, we have seen the dangers that a  warming planet poses to our livelihoods and environment. Wildfires, sea  level rise, flooding, and extreme weather patterns can be fatal to our  communities.   My bayfront district is surrounded by water. Our communities are  threatened by sea level rise on both sides of our peninsula. H.R. 1  would only raise this threat.   H.R. 1 would prioritize the interests of Big Oil and protect  profiteers at the expense of our most vulnerable communities and  ecosystems.   Critical habitats like the San Francisco Bay would suffer. I recently  supported over $75 million in bay restoration funding--natural  solutions to sea level rise.   H.R. 1 would significantly harm those efforts.   The American people asked for lower costs, more jobs, and a livable  future, not shameless giveaways to Big Oil, not for the polluters over  people act.
