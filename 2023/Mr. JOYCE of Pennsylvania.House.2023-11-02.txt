 Mr. Speaker, last month, there were  269,735 attempted border crossings by illegal immigrants. The numbers  don't lie. Joe Biden's open border policies have unleashed a crisis,  making every State a border State.   I have been to our border and spoken to the agents on the ground who  are currently working tirelessly to handle the humanitarian crisis and  the national security crisis that continues to occur each day.   It is time for the Senate to pass the Secure the Border Act, which  would force the Biden administration to restart construction of the  border wall, increase the number of Border Patrol agents, end catch and  release, and finally deploy the new technologies that our Border Patrol  agents have requested in order to help secure our border.   Our communities cannot afford to wait any longer. It is time to fund  our Border Patrol and ensure that our agents have the tools and the  resources they need to stop the flow of illegal immigrants and the  individuals who cross our border from the terrorist watch list. They  are entering our Nation each and every day.                            ____________________
