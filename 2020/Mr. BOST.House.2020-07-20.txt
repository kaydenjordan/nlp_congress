 Madam Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Lamb, for joining  me as a coauthor of the legislation we have on the en bloc. I also  thank Chairman DeFazio and Ranking Member Graves for their support as  well.   Every year, 575 million tons of cargo travel through our inland ports  and waterways. That includes the Kaskaskia and America's Central Port  in southern Illinois.   Half a million American jobs depend on inland shipping. They are  vital parts of the transportation network and our Nation's ability to  compete globally.   Unfortunately, these small coastal ports and terminals have less  ability to compete for grants and capital to improve their efficiency  and compete against the large facilities. This puts them at a  disadvantage.   This amendment will help increase access to critical Federal funding  for small coastal and inland ports and terminals. Improving these  facilities will not only have a big impact on the economy, but it will  also help local farmers, miners, and manufacturers be more competitive.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
