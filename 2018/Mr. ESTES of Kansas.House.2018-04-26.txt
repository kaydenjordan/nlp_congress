 Mr. Chair, I rise today to propose an amendment  to section 232 of H.R. 4, the FAA Reauthorization Act.   As a Representative of the Fourth District of Kansas, which includes  Wichita, also known as the Air Capital of the World, I have a deep  appreciation for the importance of the aviation industry in our region  and country.   For more than 100 years, our community has pioneered aviation and  manufacturing. Today, the greater Wichita area is home to many of the  world's largest aviation manufacturers and produces nearly 50 percent  of all general aviation planes built.   Without question, aviation is a great source of pride for all  Kansans, and I want to thank Chairman Shuster and the Transportation  and Infrastructure Committee for their efforts to support the industry  and modernize the FAA.   As part of the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, Congress has tasked  the FAA administrator to establish a task force on flight standards  reform. I believe creating this task force to improve aviation safety  standards is a needed and overdue initiative.    H.R. 4 mandates the task force be comprised of  representatives from air carriers, general and business aviation,  repair stations, unmanned aviation systems, flight schools, and  aviation safety inspectors.    Today, I am offering an amendment to the task force to also include  representatives of aircraft manufacturers. I believe those responsible  for producing our Nation's aircraft can play a valuable role in  updating aviation standards and should have a voice.   I want to thank our colleagues for their attention to the industry  and consideration of this amendment, and ask that they support the FAA  Reauthorization Act.
