 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the consideration of all nominations on the Secretary's  Desk; that the nominations be confirmed; that the motions to reconsider  be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action  or debate; that no further motions be in order; that any statements  related to the nominations be printed in the Record; and that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.
