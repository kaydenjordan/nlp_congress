 Mr. Speaker, while my colleagues on the other side of  the aisle press forward with their partisan gimmicks, 800,000 young  people are still holding their breath. With time quickly running out,  they are wondering what their futures look like without DACA.   Will they lose their jobs? Will they have to drop out of college  after they have already paid tuition? Will they live in fear that ICE  will be waiting for them at any corner?   All these fears could be eliminated if Republican leadership allowed  a vote on the bicameral, bipartisan Dream Act. Instead of living in  fear or losing their job, the Dream Act would allow them to continue  working and add $22.7 billion annually to our U.S. GDP. Passing the  Dream Act will help our country reach the goal of 3 percent economic  growth.   The Dream Act would allow them to continue improving themselves and  their education. In the process, they would add $728 billion  cumulatively to our economy over a decade, due to an ``education  bump.'' The Dream Act would allow current teachers, nurses, soldiers,  engineers, high school and college students, and hundreds of thousands  of others to continue contributing to our economy and our country.   I call on my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the previous question and,  instead, bring the Dream Act forward for a vote. We have the votes, and  the urgency of passing the Dream Act is real.
