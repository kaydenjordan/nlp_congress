 Madam Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the  latest Consumer Price Index data released by the Bureau of Labor  Statistics just yesterday.   This new data shows a 7 percent annual increase in inflation--the  largest 12-month increase since 1982. The last time inflation was this  out of control, Michael Jackson had just released ``Thriller''. So from  moonwalking to now sleepwalking with President Biden, we have  continuously seen negative real wages, meaning that our pay is actually  decreasing when you account for inflation.   The President's only idea is to print and spend more money. Gasoline  is up 50 percent. Propane, kerosene, and firewood are up 34 percent;  and beef, veal, and bacon are up 18 percent. Higher inflation is  eroding the true purchasing power for all American families, and these  record-breaking CPI numbers underestimate the real cost of inflation.   Americans need leadership that will prioritize getting our economy  and our Nation back to its pre-pandemic performance.                            ____________________
