 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to strongly support H.R.  2382, the USPS Fairness Act. I have led, with my colleagues, this  important legislation that ends the unfair prefunding mandate for the  Postal Service and also solves the most pressing financing problem  facing our letter carriers and post offices across the United States.   Mr. Speaker, the USPS is the only Government entity--the only one-- which is mandated to prefund its retirees' health benefits. 100 percent  of the Postal Service's financial losses over the past 6 years--100  percent--are directly due and linked to this requirement.   This is an outdated policy which has forced the Postal Service into a  horrible financial position, which has prevented it from investing in  resources that would benefit all of our communities, no matter where we  live.   Moreover, Mr. Speaker, this legislation has widespread support from  the National Association of Letter Carriers, the American Postal  Workers Union, and the National Postal Mail Handlers Union.   This bipartisan bill will restore USPS' financial health by shoring  up that funding and ensuring that it has the resources to improve the  Postal Service for all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to support this legislation. This is the priority for our postal  workers, in addition to 6-day delivery as well as door-to-door service.  We have to get all three done for our postal workers, our letter  carriers, and our post offices that serve all of our communities.
