 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding  me time.   Mr. Speaker, make no doubt about it, the number one terrorist in the  world is the Ayatollah in charge of the butchery against his own people  in Iran. He is the number one guy--the most wanted man in the world, as  far as I am concerned, for terrorism lies at his feet.   He, along with the mullahs of Iran, continues to crack down violently  on the people of Iran who are exercising a human right to protest the  government that is in charge. The regime's brutality against its people  knows no limit. To silence the crimes of the Ayatollah in Iran, they  have blocked much of the internet and social media, including the  telegram and Instagram. We must make sure that this important line of  communication stays open for the Iranian people.   In 2009, there were about 1 million folks in Iran who had access to  social media. Now there are about 20 million people, I understand, who  have access to social media. Our administration must make sure that the  American businesses and technology are still available to allow the  Iranian people to document the regime's crimes against the people.   The Iranian people can bring about change on their own, but we must  help by providing the necessary tools to empower democratic movements  that the mullahs stand in fear of.   Mr. Speaker, in 2009, the Iranians rose up against the mullahs, but  our government merely watched the arena of freedom in the streets of  Iran while our government sat in the stands as a spectator. This is not  a spectator sport. This is about freedom and human dignity.   The United States must politically, publicly, and economically  support the people of Iran and let them know we will not be in the  stands as a spectator any longer, and we must penalize the mullahs and  the Ayatollah economically for their crimes.   And that is just the way it is.    Mr. Speaker, cracks are beginning to form in the  iron grip of the Iranian regime. The oppressed people of Iran have  taken to the streets to demand an end to the corrupt and brutal  dictatorship.   The mullahs in Tehran have stolen the wealth of the country and the  people, lining their own pockets and funding terror throughout the  Middle East.   Like in 2009, when the Iranian people rose up to confront the  corruption of the regime, these Iranians have been met with harsh  violence and been murdered in the streets. Thousands of others have  been imprisoned. In 2009, however, the United States sat in the stands  as a spectator and watched the Ayatollah crush freedom.   I applaud this President's show of support for freedom in Iran. The  United States must show political and public support for our friends  for liberty in Iran.   As President Kennedy once said: ``Let every Nation know, whether it  wishes us well or ill, that we will pay any price, bear any burden,  meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to  assure the survival and the success of liberty.''   Like our friends in Iran.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
