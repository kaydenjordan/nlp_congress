 Mr. Speaker, I would like to call  attention to the only bill subject to a rule this week in the House of  Representatives, the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement  Act.   Mr. Speaker, millions of Americans are unemployed right now due to  this unprecedented pandemic, wondering how they are going to make ends  meet, and thousands are dying each day from the COVID virus. But  instead of working to find a bipartisan solution to provide relief to  Americans, our Democratic majority wants us to convene this august body  to vote on pot legislation.   This is simply unbelievable. The Republican Senate has voted multiple  times on targeted relief that Republicans and Democrats agree upon, but  Senate Democrats have blocked each effort.   We all agree that more PPP funds need to be made available. We all  agree that unemployment benefits should be extended. We all agree that  our healthcare workers need additional funding.   Mr. Speaker, we need to prioritize the needs of the American people,  not Cheech and Chong. This is wrong and needs to be called out.                            ____________________
