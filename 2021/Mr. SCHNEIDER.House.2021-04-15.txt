 Madam Speaker, I am pleased to join with my colleagues  in recognition and celebration of the independence of the State of  Israel 73 years ago today.   Seventy-three years ago today, the United States became the first  country to recognize Israel, and I am proud to join those here in the  United States and around the world in wishing the people of Israel a  happy Yom Ha'atzmaut.   Today, we reaffirm the critical, unbreakable bond between our two  nations. The United States and Israel have a friendship rooted in our  shared values that goes back decades. Israel is our strongest ally in  the Middle East and one of our most important allies in the world.  Today, the cultural and societal bonds between our two countries  remains as strong as ever.   Today is a day of celebration for Israel: Celebrating her  perseverance, economic growth, cultural achievements, and democratic  values that have developed in the decades since their independence.   Israel's existence as a Jewish, democratic, secure state is vital to  both the Jewish community and the peace of the entire Middle East.   I vow to continue to do my work supporting and strengthening the  U.S.-Israel relationship so that we can keep working together for our  shared goals. Israel has become a country of innovation and growth, one  where there are prospects for peace in the region. I look forward to  continuing that relationship.                            ____________________
