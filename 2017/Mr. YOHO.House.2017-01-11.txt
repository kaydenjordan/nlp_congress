 Mr. Speaker, today is National Human Trafficking Awareness  Day, an issue close to my heart.   Human trafficking is nothing more than modern-day slavery. Last  Congress, the Foreign Affairs Committee shined a light on this scourge  that affects millions around the world and passed into law the  International Megan's Law, which attacks child sex tourism by child sex  offenders, improves international law enforcement cooperation, and  improves notices of child sex offenders traveling to the U.S.   We have come a long way in creating awareness, but more must be done.  According to the Polaris Project, from 2007 to 2015, over 25,000 cases  of human trafficking were discovered in the United States, and 7,700 of  these were minors. Over 100,000 calls were made to the National Human  Trafficking Resource Center hotline.   We all know this is an issue that does not discriminate. It can  affect everyone. In north Florida, over Christmas, a man was arrested  for trafficking a woman across five county lines. This case started  with him luring her to Florida over the Internet and ended when law  enforcement were able to save the victim after seeing her in adult  advertisements online.   I want to thank all those who were involved in bringing this person  to justice.   On this National Human Trafficking Awareness Day, we in Congress will  not look away. We will continue to fight the scourge called human  trafficking.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr.  Walker) for hosting this Special Order. The American people have  spoken, and it is time. The ACA, the Affordable Care Act--which it is  not, and we know that.   I want to take you back, a little history here. Back prior to 2009,  before the Affordable Care Act came out, 85 percent of the people in  America had health insurance either through their employer or on their  own. Fifteen percent did not have health insurance.   Yet, Congress, in their infinite wisdom, instead of fixing it for the  15 percent and getting them into the pool of people that had health  insurance, said: No; we are going to change it. We are going to change  it and disrupt the whole healthcare market and 20 percent of our  economy.   This is the epitome of legislative malpractice. This Congress was  controlled by one party, the Democratic Party, through the House, the  Senate, and the executive branch. They passed a 2,900-page bill at the  end of the year that nobody read. You can't do that in any other  business without going to jail.   President Obama sold us a bill of goods on a lie. If you want to keep  your doctor or your insurance, you can and your price will go down  $2,500.   Let me share three real-life stories. One was a 54-year-old man that  came into our office, single, making a six-figure income, could afford  insurance. He was going through the exchange. He changed his plan and  wanted to pay for it right then. They said: Don't worry about it, we  will send you a bill. They never sent him a bill, and his insurance got  canceled. He could not buy insurance because it was through the  exchange and the sign-up period had expired. He got fined whatever the  fine was. He got fined trying to do the right thing.   Another one is a friend of mine who owns a restaurant franchise. He  has 500 employees. He says: I can't afford to pay for the health  insurance. So he moved people from working 32 or 40 hours a week down  to 26 hours.   I could tell you a real personal story about a couple I know real  well. They came to Congress. Their policy got canceled. Their premiums  went up by over $11,000. Their deductibles went up and their coverage  went down. I know that couple real well because it is my wife and  myself.   The American people have spoken and given us the majority for a  reason, and that is to fix health care and allow the best healthcare  providers, the best medicine, the best research and the institutions in  America to provide that for all Americans and deliver that care to all  Americans.   The Republican Congress has a better way, and it starts with putting  health care back into the hands of the physicians to the patients. It  has a better way increasing access, the cure, the quality at a lower  cost with a stable transition so no one is left out. And it starts with  the repeal of ObamaCare.   I appreciate Chairman Walker doing this. This is a message we are  going to drive home and home and home. We are going to fix this, and  the American people will be better off and our economy will be better  off.
