 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the William ``Mac''  Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA, for Fiscal Year  2021, for which I served as a conferee.   For several months, I have worked with my House and Senate  counterparts to include 10 measures authored by Democratic members of  the Financial Services Committee within the NDAA. These bills would  help to protect the U.S. financial system, provide more remedies to  investors who were deceived by corporate wrongdoers, expand access to  housing assistance for our veterans, and direct the incoming Biden  administration to use its full authority to help relieve the student  debt crisis.   For years, the issue of shell companies has been ignored by this  Congress. This is why one of the first actions I took as chair of the  committee was to move legislation to prevent bad actors from using  shell companies to hide their activities, a provision I have I been  fighting for for over a decade, and I am very pleased it is included in  the conference agreement.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney from New York for her  tireless work on this provision and the Members and the many outside  stakeholders for their work on all the measures included in the  legislation.   I am also pleased to see the conference report reflected my work and  progress ensuring that technologies procured by the Department of  Defense are ethically and responsibly screened for potential bias.
