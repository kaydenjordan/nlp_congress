 Thank you all. If you have a seat, you can sit       down.        Mr. President, Mr. Vice President, Mr. President-elect, Mr.       Vice President-elect, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the       inauguration of the 45th President of the United States of       America.        Today, the legislative, the executive, and the judicial       branches of our constitutional government come together for       the inauguration of the 45th President of the United States.       Millions of people all over the world will watch and will       listen to this event.        (Applause.)        Thirty-six years ago, at his first inauguration--it was       also the first inauguration on this side of the Capitol--      President Ronald Reagan said that what we do here is both       commonplace and miraculous--commonplace every 4 years since       1789, when President George Washington took this exact same       oath; miraculous because we have done it every 4 years since       1789 and the example it sets for democracies everywhere.       Washington believed the inauguration of the second President       would be more important than the inauguration of the first.       Many people had taken control of a government up until then,       but few people had ever turned that control willingly over to       anyone else.        As important as the first transfer of power was, many       historians believe that the next election was even more       important, when in 1801 one group of people--arguably, for       the first time ever in history--willingly, if not       enthusiastically, gave control of the government to people       they believed had a dramatically different view of what the       government would, should, and could do.        After an election that actually discovered a flaw in the       Constitution itself, which was remedied by the 12th       Amendment, Thomas Jefferson at that inauguration, beyond the       chaos of the election that had just passed, said: ``We are       all Republicans; we are all Federalists.''        After 4 years of Civil War, Lincoln's second inaugural       speech tried to find reason for the continued war when he       pointed out that both sides ``prayed to the same God.'' He       had earlier written about those fervent prayers that ``one       side must be and both sides may be wrong,'' but in 1865 he       looked to the future--and the memorable moment in that speech       was--``with malice toward none and charity for all.''        In the middle of the Depression, the country was told that       the only thing we had to fear was fear itself. President       Kennedy talked about the obligation in a democracy to       country. The great question that day was ``ask what you can       do for your country.'' So we come to this place again,       commonplace and miraculous, a national moment of celebration       but not a celebration of victory, a celebration of democracy.        (Applause.)        As we begin that celebration, I call on His Eminence       Timothy Michael Cardinal Dolan, Reverend Dr. Samuel       Rodriguez, and Pastor Paula White-Cain to provide readings       and the invocation.        Cardinal DOLAN. The prayer of King Solomon from the Book of       Wisdom.        Let us pray.        God of our ancestors and Lord of mercy, You have made all       things, and in Your providence have charged us to rule the       creatures produced by You, to govern the world in holiness       and righteousness and to render judgment with integrity of       heart. Give us wisdom, for we are Your servants, weak and       short lived, lacking in comprehension of judgment and of       laws. Indeed, though one might be perfect among mortals, if       wisdom which comes from You be lacking, we count for nothing.       Now with You is wisdom who knows Your will and was there when       You made the world, who understands what is pleasing in Your       eyes, what is conformable with Your commands. Send her forth       from Your holy heavens. From Your glorious throne dispatch       her that she may be with us and work with us that we may       grasp what is pleasing to You, for she knows and understands       all things and will guide us prudently in our affairs and       safeguard us by her glory. Amen.        Reverend RODRIGUEZ. From the Gospel of Matthew, the fifth       chapter:        God blesses those who are poor and realize their need for       Him, for the kingdom of heaven is theirs. God blesses those       who mourn for they will be comforted. God blesses those who       are humble, for they will inherit the Earth. God blesses       those who hunger and thirst for justice, for they will be       satisfied. God blesses those who are merciful, for they will       be shown mercy. He blesses those who are pure in heart, for       they will see God. God blesses those who work for peace, for       they will be called children of God. God blesses those who       are persecuted for doing right, for the Kingdom of Heaven is       theirs. And God blesses you when people mock you and       persecute you and lie about you and say all sorts of evil       things against you because you are my followers, for you are       the light of the world, like a city on a hilltop that cannot       be hidden. No one lights a lamp and then puts it under a       basket. Instead, a lamp is placed on its stand where it gives       light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your       good deeds shine out for all to see, that everyone will       praise your heavenly Father.        Respectfully in Jesus's name.        Pastor WHITE-CAIN. We come to You, Heavenly Father, in the       Name of Jesus, with grateful hearts, thanking You for this       great country that You have decreed to Your people. We       acknowledge we are a blessed nation with a rich history of       faith and fortitude, with a future that is filled with       promise and purpose. We recognize that every good and every       perfect gift comes from You and the United States of America       is Your gift, for which we proclaim our gratitude.        As a nation, we now pray for our President, Donald John       Trump, Vice President Michael Richard Pence, and their       families. We ask that You would bestow upon our President the       wisdom necessary to lead this great Nation, the grace to       unify us, and the strength to stand for what is honorable and       right in Your sight.        In Proverbs 21:1, You instruct us that our leader's heart       is in Your hands. Gracious God, reveal to our President the       ability to know Your will, the confidence to lead us in       justice and righteousness, and the compassion to yield to our       better angels.        While we know there are many challenges before us, in every       generation You have provided us the strength and power to       become that blessed Nation. Guide us in discernment, Lord,       and give us that strength to persevere and thrive. Now bind       and heal our wounds and divisions and join our Nation to Your       purpose.        ``Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,'' the Psalmist       declared. Let Your favor be upon this one nation under God.       Let these United States of America be that beacon of hope to       all people and nations under Your dominion, a true hope for       humankind.        Glory to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.        We pray this in the Name of Jesus Christ. Amen.        (Performance by the Missouri State University Chorale.)        (Applause.)         Well, the Missouri State University Chorale       practices and performs about two blocks from my home in       Springfield, MO. So it was easy to find them. We are pleased       they are here.        It is also a great opportunity for me to introduce my       colleague, the Senator from New York, Chuck Schumer.         Ladies and gentlemen, it is an honor to       introduce the Chief Justice of the United States, John G.       Roberts, Jr.        The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, JOHN G. ROBERTS,       JR., administered to the President-elect the oath of office       prescribed by the Constitution, which he repeated, as       follows:        I, DONALD JOHN TRUMP, do solemnly swear that I will       faithfully execute the office of President of the United       States and will, to the best of my ability, preserve,       protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. So       help me God.        The Chief Justice. Congratulations, Mr. President.        (Applause.)         What a great honor to be able to introduce for       the first time ever, anywhere, the 45th President of the       United States of America, Donald J. Trump.        (Applause.)        The PRESIDENT. Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter,       President Clinton, President Bush, President Obama, fellow       Americans, and people of the world, thank you. We, the       citizens of America, are now joined in a great national       effort to rebuild our country and restore its promise for all       of our people. Together we will determine the course of       America and the world for many, many years to come.        We will face challenges. We will confront hardships, but we       will get the job done.        Every 4 years we gather on these steps to carry out the       orderly and peaceful transfer of power. And we are grateful       to President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their       gracious aid throughout this transition. They have been       magnificent.        Thank you.        (Applause.)        Today's ceremony, however, has very special meaning because       today we are not merely transferring power from one       administration to another or from one party to another, but       we are transferring power from Washington, DC, and giving it       back to you, the people.        For too long, a small group in our Nation's Capital has       reaped the rewards of government while the people have borne       the cost. Washington flourished, but the people did not share       in its wealth. Politicians prospered, but the jobs left and       the factories closed. The establishment protected itself, but       not the citizens of our country. Their victories have not       been your victories. Their triumphs have not been your       triumphs, and while they celebrated in our Nation's Capital,       there was little to celebrate for struggling families all       across our land.        That all changes starting right here and right now, because       this moment is your moment. It belongs to you. It belongs to       everyone gathered here today and everyone watching all across       America. This is your day. This is your celebration. This,       the United States of America, is your country.        (Applause.)        What truly matters is not which party controls our       government but whether our government is controlled by the       people. January 20, 2017, will be remembered as the day the       people became the rulers of this Nation again.        (Applause.)        The forgotten men and women of our country will be       forgotten no longer. Everyone is listening to you now. You       came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic       movement, the likes of which the world has never seen before.       At the center of this moment is a crucial conviction that a       nation exists to serve its citizens. Americans want great       schools for their children, safe neighborhoods for their       families, and good jobs for themselves.        (Applause.)        These are just and reasonable demands of righteous people       and a righteous public. But for too many of our citizens, a       different reality exists: mothers and children trapped in       poverty in our inner cities, rusted-out factories scattered       like tombstones across the landscape of our Nation, an       education system flush with cash but which leaves our young       and beautiful students deprived of all knowledge, the crime       and the gangs and the drugs that have stolen too many lives       and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.        This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.       We are one Nation and their pain is our pain. Their dreams       are our dreams. Their success will be our success. We share       one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny. The oath of       office I take today is an oath of allegiance to all       Americans. For many decades we have enriched foreign industry       at the expense of American industry, subsidized the armies of       other countries, while allowing for the very sad depletion of       our military.        We have defended other nations' borders, while refusing to       defend our own, and spent trillions and trillions of dollars       overseas while America's infrastructure has fallen into       disrepair and decay. We have made other countries rich while       the wealth, strength, and confidence of our country has       dissipated over the horizon.        One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores,       with not even a thought about the millions and millions of       American workers that were left behind. The wealth of our       middle class has been ripped from their homes and then       redistributed all across the world.        But that is the past. Now, we are looking only to the       future. We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to       be heard in every city, in every foreign capital, and in       every hall of power. From this day forward, a new vision will       govern our land. From this day forward, it is going to be       only America first--America first. Every decision on trade,       on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to       benefit American workers and American families.        (Applause.)        We must protect our borders from the ravages of other       countries making our products, stealing our companies, and       destroying our jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity       and strength. I will fight for you with every breath in my       body, and I will never, ever let you down. America will start       winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back       our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring       back our wealth. We will bring back our dreams.        (Applause.)        We will build new roads and highways and bridges and       airports and tunnels and railways all across our wonderful       Nation. We will get our people off of welfare and back to       work rebuilding our country with American hands and American       labor. We will follow two simple rules: Buy American and hire       American.        (Applause.)        We will seek friendship and good will with the nations of       the world, but we do so with the understanding that it is the       right of all nations to put their own interests first.        We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone but       rather to let it shine as an example. We will shine for       everyone to follow. We will reinforce old alliances and form       new ones and unite the civilized world against radical       Islamic terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from       the face of the Earth.        (Applause.)        At the bedrock of our politics will be a total allegiance       to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to       our country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.       When you open your heart to patriotism, there is no room for       prejudice. The Bible tells us how good and pleasant it is       when God's people live together in unity. We must speak our       minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always       pursue solidarity.        (Applause.)        When America is united, America is totally unstoppable.       There should be no fear. We are protected, and we will always       be protected. We will be protected by the great men and women       of our military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we       will be protected by God.        (Applause.)        Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger. In       America, we understand that a nation is only living as long       as it is striving.        We will no longer accept politicians who are all talk and       no action, constantly complaining but never doing anything       about it. The time for empty talk is over. Now arrives the       hour of action. Do not allow anyone to tell you that it       cannot be done. No challenge can match the heart and fight       and spirit of America. We will not fail. Our country will       thrive and prosper again.        (Applause.)        We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock       the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries       of disease, and to harness the energies, industries, and       technologies of tomorrow. A new national pride will stir our       soul, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.        (Applause.)        It is time to remember that old wisdom our soldiers will       never forget--that whether we are Black or Brown or White, we       all bleed the same red blood of patriots. We all enjoy the       same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great       American flag.        (Applause.)        Whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or       the windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same       night sky,  [[Page S365]]       they fill their heart with the same dreams, and they are       infused with the breath of life by the same Almighty Creator.        So to all Americans in every city near and far, small and       large, from mountain to mountain, from ocean to ocean, hear       these words. You will never be ignored again. Your voice,       your hopes, and your dreams will define our American destiny,       and your courage and goodness and love will forever guide us       along the way. Together, we will make America strong again.       We will make America wealthy again. We will make America       proud again. We will make America safe again. And, yes,       together we will make America great again.        Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America. Thank you.        (Applause.)         At this time I call on Rabbi Marvin Hier, the       Reverend Franklin Graham, and Bishop Wayne T. Jackson to       provide readings and the benediction.        Rabbi HIER. Eternal God, bless President Donald J. Trump       and America, our great Nation. Guide us to remember the words       of the Psalmist:        Who may dwell on Your holy mountain? One who does what is       right and speaks the truth, who knows that when you eat the       labor of your hands, you are praiseworthy that he who sows in       tears shall reap in joy, because the freedoms we enjoy are       not granted in perpetuity, but must be reclaimed by each       generation. As our ancestors have planted for us, so we must       plant for others. While it is not for us to complete the       tasks, neither are we free to desist from them.        Dispense justice to the needy and the orphan, for they have       no one but their fellow citizens, and because a nation's       wealth is measured by her values and not by her vaults. Bless       all of our allies around the world who share our beliefs.        By the rivers of Babylon we wept as we remembered Zion. If       I forget thee O Jerusalem, may my right hand forget its       skill. The doer of all these shall never falter. May the days       come soon when justice will dwell in the wilderness and       righteousness will abide in the fertile fields, and the work       of righteousness will be peace, quietness, and confidence       forever. Amen.        Reverend GRAHAM. Mr. President, in the Bible, rain is a       sign of God's blessing. And it started to rain, Mr.       President, when you came to the platform. It is my prayer       that God will bless you, your family, your administration,       and may He bless America.        The passage of Scripture comes from 1 Timothy, chapter 2:        I urge them, first of all, that petitions, prayers,       intercession, and thanksgiving be made for all people. For       kings, for all those in authority, that we may live       peacefully quiet lives in all Godliness and Holiness. This is       good and it pleases God our Savior, who wants all people to       be saved and come to a knowledge of the truth. For there is       one God, and one Mediator between God and mankind, the man       Christ Jesus who gave Himself as a ransom for all people. Now       to the King Eternal, Immortal, Invisible, the only God, be       honor and glory forever and ever.        In Jesus's Name. Amen.        Bishop JACKSON. We thank You, Father, for letting us share       this great moment together. Let us not take for granted the       air we breathe or the life You have given us. We were all       created by You with one blood, all nations to dwell upon this       land together. We are not enemies. We are brothers and       sisters. We are not adversaries, but we are allies. We are       not foes, but we are friends. Let us be healed by the power       of Your love and united by the bond of Your Spirit.        Today we pray for our 45th President, the Vice President,       and their families, and give them the wisdom to guide this       great Nation, the strength to protect it, and the hands to       heal it. We bless President Donald J. Trump. We ask that You       give him the wisdom of Solomon, the vision of Joseph, and the       meekness of Christ--Solomon who kept peace among many       nations, Joseph who dreamt better for the people, and Christ       who accepted us all.        O Lord, mend our hearts and stitch together the fabric of       this great country in the spirit of the legendary gospel       singer Mahalia Jackson:        Oh, deep in my heart, I do believe. The Lord will see us       through, I do believe. We are on our way to victory, I do       believe. We will walk hand in hand, I do believe. We shall       live in peace, I do believe. Oh, deep in my heart, I do       believe.        America, we shall overcome. May the Lord bless and keep       America, make His face shine upon us and be gracious unto us       and give us peace.        In the mighty Name of Jesus. Amen.
