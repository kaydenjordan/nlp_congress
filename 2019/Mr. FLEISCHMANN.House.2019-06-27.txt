 Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from  the Speaker's table H.R. 3401, with the Senate amendment thereto, and  concur in the Senate amendment. This bipartisan bill passed the United  States Senate with 84 votes and could be sent to the President's desk  for his immediate signature today.
