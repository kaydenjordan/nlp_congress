 Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the Wayzata boys  track team on winning the Minnesota State High School Championship.  Wayzata edged out second place to win, their third now, State  championship in the last 4 years.   The Trojans put on an impressive all-around performance, competing  particularly well in long distance and relay events. It was a well- deserved win for a program that has now become increasingly dominant in  recent years.   Mr. Speaker, we all know that success on the track takes dedication,  hard work, commitment to training, and raw athletic talent. Wayzata's  success is a testament to the skill of its young student athletes and  the commitment of its coaches.   I want to congratulate the coaches, the entire team, the families,  and the fans for winning the State high school championship.                            ____________________
