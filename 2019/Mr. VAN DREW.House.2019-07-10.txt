 Madam Speaker, a group of impressive young south Jersey  people, aged 8 to 11, hosted their second annual dog show at a local  park in Absecon, New Jersey. The event began in 2018 when Grace Marczyk  watched a dog show and felt bad for the mixed breeds. They weren't  allowed to compete.   Grace talked to her friend Zoey. Together, they formed a committee of  animal lovers, and they hosted a dog show that was inclusive to all  members of the species.   The competition is comprised of multiple categories, judged  exclusively by the kids, and concludes with different prizes being  awarded for the Best in Show.   At their first show, the kids raised $650, all of which was donated  to the Humane Society of Atlantic County. Their second show raised over  $2,000 for the Humane Society and nearly doubled its participants and  its sponsors.   These innovative, enthusiastic young people and their inclusivity and  love for animals is a truly great thing to see. We are lucky to have  them as part of our community in south Jersey.   It is said that a nation is judged by the way it treats its pets. If  it is, Madam Speaker, these are going to be fine young Americans.                            ____________________
