 Mr. President, I rise today to honor the life and  legacy of a dedicated public servant, Army veteran, proud West  Virginian, and my very good friend, Henry C. ``Hoppy'' Shores.   Put simply, Hoppy embodied what it means to be a true West Virginian,  and the legacy he has left behind is an important part of our heritage.  I believe that there is no greater accomplishment than being in a  position to give back to your community, and Hoppy's work in public  service truly benefited our home State in a profound way that touched  countless lives. First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt once said, ``Since you  get more joy out of giving joy to others, you should put a good deal of  thought into the happiness that you are able to give.'' In that spirit,  I am forever grateful to Hoppy for his commitment to his community and  our shared passion for serving the people of West Virginia.   Born in Dunbar in 1930 to the late Henry Eugene and Mary Elizabeth  Shores, Hoppy spent much of his life in the Kanawha Valley. He excelled  in athletics as a legendary running back for Stonewall Jackson High  School. As the star of his 1947 State championship team, Hoppy capped  off his high school career as a Kennedy Award winner. In addition, he  held a longstanding record in the 440-yard dash and was elected class  president his senior year. Even then, his leadership skills were widely  recognized. Following his glowing high school career, Hoppy attended  West Virginia University on the Loyalty Endowment Scholarship, where  his wide range of accomplishments continued.   Hoppy's life of service began in the U.S. Army, where he rose to the  rank of major. I have always said that West Virginia is home to the  most patriotic, hard-working people in the Nation; and Hoppy was no  exception. Returning to Kanawha County after his military  [[Page S611]]  service to our Nation concluded, Hoppy continued giving back as a coach  and supporter of one of the local Little League football teams. Hoppy  was well-known as a tenacious supporter of youth sports in the Kanawha  Valley and, for many years, would continue to support the youth of the  valley in a variety of initiatives. Good coaches win games, but great  coaches, like Hoppy, have a lasting impact on your life. They are  models for how to manage success and failure--and how to take the  lessons you have learned in athletics and apply them to your adult  life. I can only begin to imagine how many leaders Hoppy forged  throughout his time as a coach--and how many of his former athletes  still look up to him to this day.   Hoppy and his beloved wife Bronson, who shared his life for 68 years,  raised their four children in Charleston. Despite his illustrious life  filled with awards, accolades and achievements, Hoppy always considered  his family his greatest accomplishment of all. He built a successful  career in insurance; eventually, this career would culminate in the  Hoppy Shores Insurance Company. His impeccable work ethic was well- known, and all those he worked with considered him an honest, fair, and  kind soul.   As a successful businessman, family man, and youth sports supporter,  Hoppy extended his civic engagement to elected positions. Hoppy  dedicated 42 years to the Kanawha County Commission where he will be  remembered for his staunch commitment to Yeager Airport and the Kanawha  County Parks and Recreation board. He loved ``Hoppy's Little Express  Train'' and his big smile atop the engine brought joy to each and every  onlooker he rode past. As the longest serving Kanawha County  commissioner in history, with an unmatched record of public service,  the commission courtroom was named ``The Henry C. `Hoppy' Shores  Courtroom'' in his honor. I believe this outstanding tribute is a  testament to his dedication to the citizens of Kanawha County. In  addition to his 42 years on the Kanawha County Commission, Hoppy added  4 years of service in the West Virginia Legislature, where he will be  remembered as a tenacious advocate for his neighbors in the Valley.   Everything Hoppy stood for and represented lives on in the hearts and  minds of all who had the privilege of knowing him, myself included. I  was honored to call him a friend, and I know I join so many when I say  West Virginia has lost a shining star. Hundreds of tributes have poured  in about our friend Hoppy since his passing, but there is one tribute  that I think best shows who he was. Soccer was an emerging sport in the  State, and Kanawha County was deliberating building a major soccer  complex. The idea was hitting resistance, and it became the subject of  a county commission meeting. During the public meeting, a young girl  made a presentation about the importance of soccer in her life. Some  opponents of the project began heckling the brave young girl. It is  reported that the lack of decorum and bullying displayed by those  opponents angered Hoppy so much that he looked at fellow County  Commissioners Kent Carper and Ben Salango and said, ``Let's just do  it.'' And that is how the Shawnee Sports Complex came to be. I know  that every time I visit Shawnee, I will think of Hoppy siding with that  brave little girl and smile.   So many people have inspirational stories about Hoppy. It is my hope  that his many friends and family have found peace, strength, and  support in one another and in the support of our entire home State for  our shared loss of this wonderful person. He will be dearly missed by  all who knew him.   What is most important is that he lived a full life, surrounded by  the people he loved most. Gayle and I offer our deepest condolences to  Hoppy's wife of 68 years, Bronson; and their children, Henry, Sherry,  Scott, and Lynn; his many friends; and extended family. We will forever  keep Hoppy and his family in our thoughts and prayers.                            ____________________
