 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Honolulu  Little League on winning the 2022 Little League World Series.   This is Hawaii's fourth Little League World Series, and it is a true  privilege to represent the team, their coaches, families, and fans.   The Honolulu Little League played their first season in 1954 and is  one of the oldest Little League teams in the State. This particular  team's character and sportsmanship will be remembered long after their  victory this year. Their enthusiasm and love for baseball is  contagious, and all of Hawaii couldn't stop watching as they hit home  runs, struck out batters, and invoked the mercy rule over their  opponents.   I extend special commendations to Coach Gerald Oda, the team's  manager and coach. I also congratulate the families of the players who  have undoubtedly made their own sacrifices to provide this team with  the opportunity to succeed.   This team represents Hawaii's values of unity, teamwork, and  resilience. These Little Leaguers have become role models to our larger  community, and I am sure the next generation of Little League World  Champions in Hawaii watched this team and will be inspired by them. I  know I speak for all of Hawaii, Mr. Speaker, when I say how so very  proud we are.                            ____________________
