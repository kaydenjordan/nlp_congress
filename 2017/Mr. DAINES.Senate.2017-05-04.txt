 Mr. President, tomorrow, May 5, Hanna Harris should have  been 25 years old. Instead of celebrating a birthday, we will be  celebrating her memory. Hanna was a 21-year-old member of the Cheyenne  Tribe. She lived in Lame Deer, MT, with her 10-month-old son. The last  time she was seen alive was the Fourth of July of 2013. After that, she  went missing, and 5 days later, her body was found. Hanna was found to  have been raped and murdered.    For too long, the stories of missing and murdered American Indian and  Alaska Native women have gone unheard. In fact, according to the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, homicide was the third  leading cause of death among American Indian and Alaska Native women  between the ages of 10 and 24 years and the fifth leading cause of  death for American Indian and Alaska Native women between 25 and 34  years of age.   According to a study commissioned by the Department of Justice,  American Indian women face murder rates that are more than 10 times the  national average. Let me repeat that. American Indian women face murder  rates 10 times the national average. If this were the case in any other  community outside of Native communities, there would be public outcry,  but there hasn't been until now. In fact, yesterday the Senate approved  my resolution to designate May 5, Hanna Harris's birthday, as a day of  remembrance. It will be a day to join together to commemorate the lives  of those we lost tragically, like Hanna. It is a day to validate the  pain Tribal communities have felt and feel every day. It will mark a  national day of awareness for Native women and girls who have gone  missing or have been murdered.   I was joined by 12 of my colleagues in passing this resolution to  declare that the tragic loss of Native women and girls is not just an  issue, it is an epidemic, and I thank them for their support.   Tomorrow, on Hanna's birthday, I will walk with Melinda Limberhand  Harris, Hanna's mother, and with Tribal leadership, as well as members  in Lame Deer, MT, who have also lost a mother, a daughter, a sister, or  a friend. On May 5, we will remember RoyLynn Rides Horse, we will  remember Kenzley Olson, and we will remember the thousands of other  American Indian and Alaska Native women who have been killed or have  disappeared without a trace. And we will remember Hanna Harris on her  birthday tomorrow as we walk together in Lame Deer, MT.   Mr. President, I yield my time.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.  [[Page S2762]]         Mr. President, this week, I have the distinct  honor of recognizing the Thomas family for giving their time and talent  to serve as foster parents for children in Lake County. J.P. Thomas and  his wife, Tiara Thomas, have done honorable work by providing structure  and consistency in many young lives.   J.P. and Tiara began serving as foster parents in their early  twenties. The young couple took a short break from fostering as their  own family began to grow, but soon returned to serving as foster  parents in order to help their community. They have provided a positive  environment for 15 Montana children in their home on the Flathead  Indian Reservation. Throughout the challenging journey of serving as  foster parents, J.P. and Tiara give credit to the Cornerstone Faith  Center in St. Ignatius for helping them find the balance to meet the  demands of faith, family, fostering, youth sports, and work.  [[Page S2772]]    Montanans that provide structure and consistency to youngsters in  need are deserving of our support. When those Montanans are like J.P.  and Tiara and simply do what is needed in a humble and gracious manner,  their service can inspire others. Thank you, J.P. and Tiara, for all  you have done and are still doing to help others.                            ____________________
