 Madam President, I particularly appreciate, in light of my  comments in a moment, Senator Klobuchar's service. She has been a  pioneer as the first woman Senator from Minnesota. And I believe the  Presiding Officer, Senator Fischer, is the first female Senator from  Nebraska.                           Tribute to Marcy Kaptur    Madam President, I rise today to honor my colleague and my longtime  close friend, Marcy Kaptur. Marcy Kaptur serves down the hall on the  other side of the building. She has dedicated her life to serving the  people of Toledo and northern Ohio.   This Sunday, she will make history. She will officially become the  longest serving woman in the history of the U.S. Congress in either  House. On Sunday, she will have served in the House of Representatives  for 35 years, 2 months, and 18 days, breaking a record that was set in  1960 by I believe a Massachusetts Congresswoman. For 3\1/2\ decades,  she has been principled and she has been passionate about her family,  her community, and our country, and she has advocated for Ohioans. She  serves like nobody else.   She is the granddaughter of Polish immigrants. That is important to  her. She comes from a working-class family. That is important to her.  She is a practicing Roman Catholic. That is important to her. That  describes much of who Marcy is--Polish immigrant, working-class family,  Catholic faith.   Her father was a trucker and autoworker who became a small  businessman. Her mother worked at the Champion spark plug factory,  where, of course, she helped to organize a union. I say ``of course''  because of Marcy's not just understanding of the importance of the  labor movement but her feeling it in her bones, that a unionized  workforce is good for those workers, good for the company, and good for  the community, and we need more of that.   Marcy's story echoes that of so many of our generation. Her parents  worked hard. With the help of a union card, they earned their way to a  better life for Marcy and her brother. She became the first in her  family to graduate from high school and then college, and then she  ended up in the U.S. Congress. What a great country we live in.   Marcy has never forgotten those roots. If you want to know one thing  about Marcy Kaptur--who, as I said, works down the hall at the other  end of the building--know that she has never forgotten her roots. That  is what drives her. That is who she is. That is why she is such a  terrific public servant. That is why she is going to break the record  of 35 years, 2 months, and 15 days. She remembers her roots in Ohio's  Polish and Ukrainian communities and how much they matter.   Unemployment reached 19 percent in Toledo in the early Reagan years  when Marcy first ran for office. She said it was ``the condition of  working people that drove me to change my life and run for office.''  She has lived up to that ideal, fighting for working families in Ohio  for every one of the nearly 13,000 days she has served in Congress.   In my first year in the House, Marcy was a mentor to me. I worked  with her to fight against the North American Free Trade Agreement. She  showed me the way in understanding these trade agreements because she  knew they would mean job losses in Ohio. She knew these trade  agreements would push down wages. That is sort of the untold story-- something I don't think the President quite understands when he talks  about NAFTA even though he is right that NAFTA was bad for our country.  What NAFTA has done, which Marcy explained to me and understood for 25  years, is NAFTA also pushed down wages and is one of the reasons  working-class Americans, whether they are in Omaha or Cleveland, so  often don't get a raise. Unfortunately, Marcy was right.   Since then, as we have fought bad trade deal after bad trade deal,  Marcy has been a reliable ally and leader in our fight for a trade  policy that puts workers in Toledo and everywhere else in this country  first.   We have also worked together to protect another very important love  of Marcy Kaptur's, and that is our greatest natural resource, Lake  Erie. We fought for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. We joined  with Senator Portman on a bipartisan basis to stop the President's all  but elimination of the--why would the President of the United States  want to stop our cleanup of Lake Erie? That is why Marcy steps up. She  works to protect the lake from invasive Asian carp; she works with  farmers to prevent runoff into Lake Erie--all to protect the lake. It  is what the lake means to us in terms of drinking water, jobs,  commercialism, commercial development, and people just enjoying the  beauty of the lake.   She has gone to bat time and again for the auto industry. When some  called the auto industry dead, she fought back. Never bet against  American workers. Never bet against the American auto industry. Never  bet against Marcy Kaptur. That scrappy, fighting spirit is one of the  qualities I love most about Ohio, and you find it in abundance in Marcy  Kaptur.   No one fights harder for people in her district. Because of absurd  redistricting, her district now goes from Toledo all across northern  Ohio, only a few miles wide along the lake, all the way to the city of  Cleveland. In only 5 years, the people of Cleveland have gained the  same affection for Marcy as the people from Toledo have. You can see  the love and respect they have.    I remember once going to a rally in Toledo for President Obama.  People were excited to see him, of course. I  [[Page S1757]]  guess a few people may have noticed I was there too. But when Marcy  walked in, someone screamed ``Marcy,'' and there was pandemonium.  Everyone got to their feet as if a rock star had just taken the stage,  because in Toledo, a rock star had taken the stage.   She fights for the people of Ohio. She fights for her district. She  fights. She is known, more than anything, as a fighter for working  families. It is so fitting that she reaches this milestone during  Women's History Month. When she first joined the House, there were  fewer than two dozen women serving. She helped blaze a trail for  others. She even told the stories of the women who paved the way for  her in her book ``Women of Congress: A Twentieth Century Odyssey.''   Having Marcy in Congress matters for so many reasons. It mattes for  the hundreds of thousands of Ohioans she serves. It matters for the  perspective she brings as the daughter of working-class parents. As I  said, she was first in her family not just to go to college; she was  first in her family to graduate from high school, right in the  industrialized heartland.   As in Nebraska, Madam President, it matters to the little girls in  Toledo, who for 35 years--do you know how, when you are in school,  there is often a map or a chart of the Presidents? There was a calendar  in Brinkerhoff Grade School when I was a little kid in Mansfield, OH.  Every year, there was a calendar with all the Presidents' pictures on  it. When I was in school, all the Presidents looked alike. Some had  whiskers; some didn't. But they all looked alike because they were all  White guys. Right? That changed in 2008. I was hoping it would change  in 2016. It didn't. That is beside the point.   Marcy Kaptur--because she is the Congresswoman for Toledo, little  girls growing up in Toledo since 1982 have realized there is someone to  look up to. In Scottsbluff and in Lincoln and in Kearny, NE, they will  now look up to having a woman Senator from Nebraska. Ohio has never had  a woman Senator or woman Governor, but they have had Marcy Kaptur. That  has mattered to little girls for 35 years, as they see a picture of  their Representative in the local paper, the Toledo Blade. It is not  just another man in a suit but someone who looks more like them,  someone they can grow up to be.   I want to thank Marcy. She is not in the building now, but I want to  thank Marcy for her service to Ohio. I hope we get to keep working with  Marcy Kaptur for another couple of decades. The voters would have to  approve that, but I am hopeful that we will.                           Tribute to Rachel Petri    Madam President, I also want to talk about somebody else who is  sitting in this Chamber who will continue, as her career advances, to  be a role model for the people of this country and the people of her  community. A daughter of Eastern Ohio, Rachel Petri has done  communications work for me for a number of years.   She is leaving our office to, of course, return to her home State of  Ohio. She has been a joy to work with. She has been a pleasure to work  with. She is so smart and so committed, with an incredible work ethic.  I am honored that she has spent part of her life working with me in our  office in Washington, DC, and I thank her for her service.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
