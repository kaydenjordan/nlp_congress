 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for       the quorum call be rescinded.         Mr. President, we are debating, discussing, and hopefully       concluding our work on something called an Omnibus appropriations bill.       I certainly decry the method by which the committee, the Senate, and       the Congress work in regard to appropriations bills. I am a member of       that Appropriations Committee, but there is no reason--none--that we       could not do as we are supposed to do, as we are intending to do--12       separate appropriations bills, one at a time.        It is an opportunity for the committees to have hearings with       witnesses to debate and discuss the content of that appropriations       bill, pass it out of the committee, send it to the Senate, and let       other Members of the Senate who are not on the Appropriations Committee       amend, discuss, and debate that section of what today, tonight, this       week becomes this large, all-encompassing bill.        We all would be better off if we broke this down into the 12 separate       parts that are now combined into this one large bill. We would know       much more about it, the deliberations would be more forthright, and we       would have less likelihood of something being contained in the bill       that there was objection to it being there.        I hope in the new Senate, the new Congress beginning in January, we       as appropriators, we as Members of the Senate, work hard to go back to       the way things were before I was ever in the Senate in which there is a       budget, 12 appropriations bills, and then fill in the spaces on that       budget. Then, ultimately, every Member of the U.S. Senate has input       into the outcome.        I want to highlight something that is in the appropriations bill that       we are discussing and considering at this point in time. Before I do       that, I want to, again, indicate that one of the most important       components to me in this legislation is the opportunity for us to more       fully fund those who serve in our military and to better care for our       veterans who have served.        There is some suggestion that we are rushing to complete this       legislation before the new year. The reality is, we are--again, because       of the process that we have failed to follow, we are behind in the       system. It is not that we are advancing a bill that was something to       take advantage of in the future. We are 3 months behind in passing an       appropriations bill that was due at the end of the fiscal year       September 30, 3 months ago.        And if we wait to pass an appropriations bill into the new year--we       are supposed to have our appropriations process completed in March--we       will just be beginning the discussion, debate about the old bill--the       bill for this year--at a time in which we are supposed to be advancing       the conversation, debate, and outcome of a bill to fund the new year.        And in the process of doing so, we will have left our military at       flatline funding. And the challenges we face in this country are so       significant that no additional dollars to the Department of Defense for       even a short period of time--months, 6 weeks, 3 months, a year--that is       very damaging, particularly in these days of significant defense       inflation. And so it is important for us to complete our work in a       timely fashion.        And, unfortunately for us, that timely fashion is already 3 months       ago. In this bill, in a bipartisan fashion, we were successful in       adding a number of provisions to the bill that advanced the cause of       those who served our Nation. So my point, first of all, is for those       men and women who serve in our military today, they deserve something       different than old funding or no funding or continued funding at a       flatline level.        And for our military men and women who have served in the past, our       veterans, they deserve many of the provisions that are now included in       the appropriations package.        Our military, as we know, is comprised of many selfless Americans who       signed up, volunteered to serve. It is through their sacrifices, their       family's sacrifices, that they have protected and preserved the gift of       freedom that we have in this country and what we should always cherish.        In asking brave people to serve, men and women, generally young, we       make, as a Nation, a promise to them and to their families that their       government will assist them in successfully returning to civilian life       after their service.        Specifically, I think we promise those who serve help for them in       transitioning to civilian life through education, training, and       economic assistance, to provide them medical care for their injuries or       diseases incurred during their service, and to compensate them       financially if those injuries prevent them from meeting their full       earning potential.        As we consider the fiscal year 2023 appropriations package, there are       a few specific veterans bills that have been included in this       legislation to give the Department of Veterans Affairs the tools and       resources they need to meet the changing needs of America's veterans.        One is the Joseph Maxwell Cleland and the Robert J. Dole Memorial       Veterans Benefit Healthcare Improvement Act, long last name, honoring       two previous Members of the U.S. Senate--including my successor in the       seat I hold in the U.S. Senate, Senator Bob Dole.        He himself, not only a Kansan but a significantly wounded veteran and       an individual who never stopped fighting for his fellow veterans, it is       an honor to name this legislation with his respect in mind.        This legislation, described in that title, delivers new benefits and       improved resources for the VA, including a specific bill that I       introduced, one that is--we call in short words GHAPS, Guaranteeing       Healthcare Access to Personnel Who Served. That act builds upon       previous legislation and efforts to continue to lay a groundwork       necessary to transform the VA into a modernized innovative healthcare       system.        It includes protections to safeguard veterans' access to care from       highly qualified providers in VA medical facilities and through the       VA's Community Care Network to help veterans across the country,       including those in rural--a significant component of my State and the       Presiding Officer's--and remote communities, that those veterans get       the care they need when they need it and where they want it.        It would also require the VA to establish a pilot program to empower       veterans by letting them schedule their own appointments, just like       they would be able to do if they were seeking care elsewhere.            [[Page S9740]]              Additionally, this package includes another piece of legislation, the       STRONG Veterans Act, a set of mental health legislation, including the       REACH for Veterans Act. This legislation requires the VA to make key       improvements to the Veterans Crisis Line and to conduct outreach on the       rollout of 988 as the new suicide and crisis hotline. Additionally, the       STRONG Act includes my 9/11 Veterans' Mental Health Care Improvement       Act, which would require the VA to expand access to mental health care,       increase its mental health workforce, and direct the department to       conduct critical research on brain health.        Lastly, this mental health package includes a bill to improve mental       health and suicide prevention outreach to American Indians and Alaska       Native veterans. We must make certain that our country is doing all it       can do to honor its promise to care for those who have borne the battle       and for their survivors.        I urge the passage of the provisions in this bill that are so       important to veterans, it is included in the entire omnibus spending       package.        I know that the Presiding Officer has dedicated attention to the       veterans that you know and care about. I look forward to working with       you and my colleagues as we continue this effort to make certain that       those who served our country receive what they were entitled to.        This bill, in its entirety--beyond just these provisions related to       veterans--is a way we can help those who serve our Nation today and       honor, respect, and provide for those who served our Nation in the       past.        I yield the floor.         Mr. President, thank you, and I thank the Congresswoman--      excuse me--the Senator. I am headed to the House this evening, and I       have served in the House.        I join my colleague in efforts to see that this legislation, the       Afghan Adjustment Act, is advanced, that it moves forward.        The chaotic evacuation from Kabul stranded thousands of Afghan allies       behind enemy lines. For two decades, countless Afghans stood by our       servicemembers and risked their lives and their families' lives to       support our troops in Afghanistan.        Veterans of the Afghan war are calling for Congress to provide safety       and certainty for their allies and friends who assisted them in battle.       This includes the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, Veterans of       Foreign Wars, the American Legion, and many others.        The Afghan Adjustment Act will keep our promise to those who risked       their lives for America while also protecting our national security.        A veteran from Kansas, Slate Deister from Leavenworth, stated the       following in support of the bill:                   This is a critical piece of legislation that supports our            nation's veterans and warfighters by ensuring that we honor            our allies during America's longest war. If Congress does not            act to support its allies by passing the Afghan Adjustment            Act, potential allies in future combat zones are going to be            less likely to support the U.S. mission after seeing our            Afghan partners abandoned.              At the time in which the individuals--a number were being evacuated,       but many left behind. Our offices, my staff and I, received over 1,000       inquiries from Kansas. ``Inquiries'' really isn't the right word.       ``Pleas''--pleas for help.        Over 1,000 Kansans related to us the challenges that their friends,       their supporters, their comrades faced as a result of being left behind       in Afghanistan in those frightful 2, 3, 4 weeks in which so much       uncertainty and our ability to evacuate was so lacking.        Over 1,000 Kansans asked for my help. And while we were successful on       some occasions, so many were left behind in such tragic circumstances       and with such emotional appeals, emotional results from those who       wanted to make certain that those who helped save their lives, they       helped save theirs.        My hometown pastor's daughter was a missionary--she and her husband--      in Afghanistan. Their plea to me was: Please help get Christians out of       Afghanistan because we know--we know--they will be murdered if left       behind.        We must answer these calls and establish a pathway for our Afghan       partners to begin a new life in safety.        We worked--and Senator Klobuchar mentioned this--we worked to       ensure--before we sponsored this legislation, we worked to ensure--and       we had tremendous help and cooperation from the original sponsors, that       we wanted to ensure this legislation protects our national security.        I was pleased to work with Senator Klobuchar and others to bolster       the vetting process for newly arriving Afghans.        The updates outline the specific requirements, including mandatory       in-person interviews for all applicants and Agency briefings to       Congress on proposed vetting procedures prior--prior--to implementation       of the vetting process.        It also mandates that the State Department develop a contingency plan       for future emergency evacuations, including standard practices for       screening and vetting foreign nationals to be relocated to the United       States.        I urge my colleagues--I thank my colleagues who are sponsors and       advocates for this bill. I thank Senator Klobuchar for the invitation       to join her on the Senate floor this evening, and I urge our colleagues       to support this bipartisan effort to help those who helped us.        I yield the floor.
