 Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the conferees  of the National Defense Authorization Act, NDAA, were announced, and I  am deeply grateful to serve another year on this committee for fiscal  year 2020.   I will continue to promote peace through strength and work to  champion repeal of the widow's tax. Our surviving spouses have waited  long enough.   As of this week, my bill, the Military Surviving Spouses Equity Act,  has 376 cosponsors from both sides of the aisle. In fact, it has the  highest number of cosponsors of any bill in the current Congress.   In a time of constant disagreement, I am thankful to come together  and for the bipartisan support this bill has received. I am  disappointed it did not receive a standalone vote, but I will fight to  keep it in the NDAA. It is now time to ax the widow's tax.   I am dedicated to supporting our servicemembers, veterans, and  military families. I look forward to working with the entire NDAA  conference committee and President Donald Trump to advance this  bipartisan legislation.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
