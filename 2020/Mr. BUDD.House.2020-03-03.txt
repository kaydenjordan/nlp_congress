 Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the coronavirus.   I want to reassure folks that since we first learned about this  virus, our government has been very proactive in its response.   The President took charge and assembled a task force, headed by the  Vice President, that brought together the best and the brightest  doctors, scientists, and health experts that our country has to offer.   The President also took the crucial step of implementing a travel ban  on China to slow down the spread of the outbreak within our borders.   While our government is appropriately handling the spread of the  coronavirus, our citizens can help as well.   Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to go to cdc.gov, follow the latest  developments, and learn about easy ways that you can avoid getting  sick.   America must always be ahead of the game on viral threats like these,  and I am proud to say that our leaders are doing a great job.                                time  1030     Essential Support Faith-Based Organizations Provide for Communities     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight the essential  support that faith-based organizations give to the communities around  them, including during times of crisis.   During Hurricane Florence, in 2018, volunteers from Samaritan's Purse  were on the ground after the hurricane had devastated thousands of  homes across my State.   Lorraine Jenkins, a resident of New Bern, my mother's childhood home  in North Carolina, said that she ``had faith but needed a little more  strength'' when she returned to her home to find it flooded with 18  inches of water. Thankfully, several volunteers from Samaritan's Purse  were there to pray with Lorraine to give her the strength that she  needed.   During Hurricane Dorian, in 2019, the Salvation Army provided over  43,000 meals, 55,000 drinks, 25,000 snacks, and 48 full cleanup kits to  victims.   Mr. Speaker, faith-based organizations also provide key support  services to children, many of whom are victims of the opioid crisis.  This crisis has left over 92,000 children in foster care and in need of  loving homes. Faith-based adoption agencies play a pivotal role in  finding homes for these children.  [[Page H1445]]    Sadly, despite the clear benefits faith-based organizations provide  to the communities around them, there remains an ongoing push to strip  them of Federal funding or to even shut them down for following their  sincerely held religious beliefs. That is why, this week, I am  introducing the Equal Treatment of Faith-Based Organizations Act, along  with several of my colleagues.   My bill codifies into law parts of the recently proposed HHS rule to  ensure equal treatment for faith-based organizations. My bill reverses  the discriminatory policy from the previous administration that  required faith-based providers of social services to disclose their  religious affiliation and refer potential clients to other providers.  My bill also allows faith-based organizations to apply for Federal  funding on equal footing with secular organizations.   Mr. Speaker, the Federal Government has no business discriminating  against faith-based organizations purely on the basis of their  sincerely held religious beliefs. I am proud to lead this legislation  and to protect the good work that faith-based organizations do every  day.                            ____________________
