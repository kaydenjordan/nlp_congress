Is that correct?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.    Mr. President, I am advised we are not in a quorum call.  Is that correct?   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.    Mr. President, yesterday we took a giant step toward  delivering on our promise to the American people to provide relief from  the failures of the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as ObamaCare.   Over the last 7 years, we have discussed what our solution would look  like, and everybody who has been willing to participate in that  conversation--sadly, not our Democratic colleagues, who simply refuse  to do so, but every Member of our conference--has engaged in  discussions and has had input on how best to accomplish the goal of  providing people affordable coverage, increased access, market  stability, and better care.   We can talk about all of the details, but basically what this boils  down to is how to provide people with access to quality, affordable  health care. I know some of our friends across the aisle thought the  Affordable Care Act was it, but it failed. It started with the promises  that were made by President Obama when he sold this to the American  people, saying: If you like your policy, you can keep your policy; if  you like your doctor, you can keep your doctor. He said that premiums  would go down $2,500 for a family of four, none of which have proved to  be true--none of which have proved to be true.   Now we find that in many parts of the country, insurance companies  are pulling out, limiting if not denying altogether people's access to  coverage within the exchanges. We know what has happened to premiums.  Since 2013, they have gone up 105 percent nationally--a 105-percent  increase in premiums.   People find that their deductibles are so high that they effectively  are self-insured. They have been denied the benefit of their own  insurance. Nominally, they may have insurance, but the fact is, if you  go to the hospital, you are going to be responsible personally for what  is not covered by that deductible.   Even our colleagues across the aisle admit that ObamaCare has failed  to provide stable access to insurance markets, but their solution has  been to pay more money to insurance companies. I would call that an  insurance company bailout without any reform, without any changes in  the basic structure of ObamaCare, which has caused this failure.   What we have tried to do on this side of the aisle--and we have  repeatedly invited our Democratic colleagues to join us because  optimally this would be a bipartisan effort, but so far they have  refused to participate whatsoever and really are focused solely on  trying to blow up the current process.   What we have said we want to accomplish are four things. We want to  stabilize the insurance markets. We want to bring premiums down so they  are more affordable. We want to protect people with preexisting  conditions. We want to put Medicaid--the safety net for low-income  Americans--on a sustainable path.  [[Page S4245]]    Of course, as you might imagine with something as complex as  healthcare, we have had a number of opinions on how best to achieve  these goals. Even as approaches and ideas have differed, one thing has  remained constant: the belief that the status quo is simply  unacceptable. It is unacceptable.   Take, for example, one of my constituents in Texas, who wrote me  recently to say that his monthly insurance premium under the Affordable  Care Act had nearly tripled, to $690, and his deductible, to my earlier  point, went from $1,500 to $6,000.   I don't know many people--unless they happen to be well-to-do--who  can afford to absorb those sorts of increases in premiums and  deductibles. Because his coverage went from a PPO, a preferred provider  organization, to an HMO, a health maintenance organization, some of his  doctors are no longer in the network, forcing him to switch healthcare  providers entirely.   This story is certainly not unique. It is typical. This is the norm  under the Affordable Care Act. I often hear from Texans who would  rather drop their coverage and pay the costly fine rather than have to  pay for insurance that will cost them more and more each month, which  they can't afford.   Here is a telling statistic. More than 400,000 Texans who earn less  than $25,000 a year have decided to pay the penalty rather than to be  forced to buy the insurance they can't afford, so many of them pay the  penalty because of the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act.  They are left with nothing, other than having to pay the penalty as  required by the law. That is not a solution. That is why I hope that  someday we can get out of this rut and off of the talking points on  each side and say: What can we do to try to provide people access to  affordable health care? That is the key.   People are going to make their own decisions based on their own  economic self-interest. If you are a young person, you might decide:  What I would like to do is to buy a policy that will cover me in  emergency circumstances if I have to go to the hospital, but I don't  want to have to pay for all the bells and whistles that raise the  price. You can't do that under the Affordable Care Act and take  advantage of the tax subsidies that everybody else can. It is basically  a false promise.   I also heard from another small business owner in Donna, TX, who was  forced to fire four employees just to comply with the employer mandate  or otherwise owe the government more than $100,000 in fines that he  said could bankrupt his business. Those are the kinds of decisions that  ObamaCare is forcing. Rather than hire enough people--or if you have  more than 50--you decide you need to fire people in order to avoid  these penalties that come from the employer mandate. That is not good  for the economy. That is not good for the job prospects of hard-working  Texans.   I shared the story of a constituent in Needville, TX, who, after a  50-percent increase in his monthly premiums, still lost his doctor  because the doctor wouldn't accept his ObamaCare plan.   Then there is the emergency room employee in North Texas, who wrote  me to say that she has seen a significant increase in the Medicare and  Medicaid patients in the emergency room because fewer and fewer doctors  would accept these patients.   In my State, only about one-third of doctors will accept a new  Medicaid patient because it pays at such a low rate. We have a better  idea that will make people up to 350 percent of the Federal poverty  level eligible for a tax credit they can use to buy private insurance,  which will increase their access to care and make it more affordable.  We have coupled that with something called the innovation and stability  fund, in which we have taken the authority out of Washington and sent  it back to the States to let Governors and State legislators and  regulators at the local level design policies that meet the needs of  the people in the States.   The basic structural failure of ObamaCare was to assume that you  could write a one-size-fits-all plan for 320 million-plus people that  would work. It hasn't. We know that. That is not speculation; this is  based on experience.   I know my colleagues across the aisle have heard similar stories from  their constituents, as well, but apparently they don't seem to care  very much about that. Otherwise, they would join with us in trying to  improve the status quo, which they have refused so far to do.   One thing about the procedure that we are undertaking here is that  any Senator who wants to offer an amendment to improve the bill or even  offer a complete substitute to the bill is entitled to do so, and they  will get a vote on that. Our colleagues on the Democratic side, despite  hearing from their own constituents that they are hurting as a result  of the status quo, appear not willing to lift a finger to help them.   Indeed, the only proposal I have heard from the other side--I have  heard two. One is an insurance company bailout, which does nothing to  effect reforms that would ultimately address the structural problems  with ObamaCare or else they say: We want to have a single-payer system,  which will bankrupt the country. Those are their solutions.   On Monday, I noted that in an effort to try to unite their deeply  divided party after last year's elections, our Democratic colleagues  unveiled an economic agenda aimed at, they say, lifting up lower and  middle-class Americans. That is an admirable goal.   If Democrats are really serious about helping lower and middle-income  Americans, one glaring and immediate action they could take is to join  us in alleviating the burdens placed on these very same folks by  ObamaCare--the types of people I have been talking about back in Texas,  whom I know exist in their States as well.   If the Democratic leader refuses to help get rid of one of the  biggest economic burdens on lower and middle-income Americans, then his  plan is not worth the paper it is printed on. What they are offering is  false hope. Unless you are willing to deal concretely with the problem  here and now, that is just another campaign promise--one they will not  be able to keep until they address what the failures of the Affordable  Care Act have imposed on low- and middle-income Americans.   Simply stated, ObamaCare is a failed experiment. It has failed  because Washington has tried to do too much at the expense of  individual choices, individual liberties, and family control over what  are deeply personal decisions.   With each day that passes, ObamaCare keeps getting worse. The  premiums for 2018 will soon be announced by the insurance companies,  and we are going to see double-digit increases again, over and above  what ObamaCare has seen so far--105-percent increases since 2013  alone--on top of that.   After yesterday's vote, we now have the opportunity to provide relief  from this failed law. I know Members have a lot of ideas about how to  fix the mess that ObamaCare has left us, but that was precisely why it  was so important for us to get on the bill yesterday, so Members on  both sides of the aisle can offer amendments and share their ideas.   Do you know how many Democrats voted to get on the bill and begin the  debate and offer amendments? Zero, zip, nada. Their protestations that  they somehow want to do things on a bipartisan basis really have fallen  flat, as demonstrated by their own failure to act.   If they were really interested in working with us to do something on  a bipartisan basis, why wouldn't they take advantage of this  opportunity to do so?   Last night we began the process of considering amendments, including  one from my colleague in Texas, Senator Cruz, who has a plan to provide  people who choose a lower cost premium insurance product the  opportunity to do so, as long as the State also requires a  comprehensive plan as well. This is something that is ideal for many  people who want an insurance safety net but don't necessarily want  their health insurance to pay for their regular medical expenses or  doctor visits. They can handle those through a health savings account  or some other way.   Later today we will continue to work toward bringing relief to  millions of Americans suffering from the failure of ObamaCare.  Yesterday was a big step toward ending ObamaCare and the first step  toward ending the mandates, the  [[Page S4246]]  penalties on low- and middle-class Texans who are having to choose  between buying unaffordable insurance or paying a penalty that their  government is forcing them to pay. We are going to end that.   We are going to end the job-killing employer mandate, which is  forcing employers either to lay people off or not hire additional  people because they don't want to run into the additional costs  required by the employer mandate.   Then there is the single mom, whom I met in Tyler, TX, a few years  back. She said: I want to work full time. I want to work at least 40  hours a week, but the restaurant where I work figured out that if they  put me on part time, 29 hours a week, then they wouldn't be required to  meet the mandates of the Affordable Care Act.   What this single mother, who wanted to work full time, was forced to  do because of ObamaCare was to work part time. Do you know what? She  can't make it on 29 hours a week, so she has to get two jobs.  Effectively, she had to go from 40 hours a week doing a job she  enjoyed, which helped her pay the bills, to working two jobs in order  to make ends meet.   We can and we should do better, and we invite our colleagues across  the aisle to join us, if they will.   People keep talking about a secret process. Well, this is about as  open and transparent as it gets. Everybody will have an opportunity to  offer an amendment, to discuss what is in the amendment, and to vote on  it. To the extent that the Senate's work product differs from what the  House of Representatives provides us, we can go to a conference and  work out those differences. That is how the legislative process is  supposed to work. Sitting on your hands and complaining about something  while offering no effort to try to help solve the problem simply boils  down to hollow words. Unfortunately, that is all we have been hearing  so far.   We hope our colleagues will change their minds and join us. Insurance  bailouts with reform are not the answer, a single-payer system is not  the answer because it will bankrupt the country, but we are more than  happy to entertain any reasonable proposal from our colleagues across  the aisle. We will guarantee they get a chance to debate it and to have  a vote on their amendment. I don't think they could ask for anything  more.   The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton).
