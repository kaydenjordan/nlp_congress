 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I remember well the day I stood here and raised my right  hand and swore before God and country that I would support and defend  the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and  domestic, and that I would bear true faith and allegiance to the same.   If you believe in the oath you took and they were not just empty  words, you must vote to support H.R. 4.   If you believe that Black and Brown people, Asian citizens, Native  Americans, language minorities, students, the poor, rural and urban  citizens are part of ``we, the people,'' you must vote to support H.R.  4.   To quote our former colleague, the Honorable Barbara Jordan: ``We,  the people. . . . I was not included in that `We, the people.' . . .  But through the process of amendment, interpretation, and court  decision, I . . . am finally . . . included in `We, the people.'''   She went on to say: ``My faith in the Constitution is whole. It is  complete. It  [[Page H9314]]  is total. I am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the  diminution, the subversion, the destruction of the Constitution.''   The Constitution is the very foundation of our democracy. If your  faith in the Constitution is whole, complete, and total, you must vote  for H.R. 4.   Sadly, the United States has a long, dark history of denying or  restricting the right of people to vote who look like me.   The Black Brigade of Cincinnati, the Buffalo Soldiers, the Tuskegee  Airmen, they protected, fought, and many died for this country, but  their ability to vote was either outlawed or suppressed.                                time  1045      John Lewis and Dr. King were attacked. Fannie Lou Hamer was  brutally beaten, and Medgar Evers was shot down in his very own  driveway.   We, the people.   The 14th Amendment says that: ``All persons born or naturalized in  the United States . . . , are citizens. . . . No State shall make or  enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges . . . of citizens. .  . .''   The 15th Amendment guarantees: ``The right of citizens of the United  States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or  by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of  servitude.''   We are all we, the people.   The 24th Amendment prohibits the payment of poll and other taxes to  vote. I believe that the purchase of unnecessary forms of  identification and payment of fines and fees are just other forms of  poll taxes.   And nowhere in the Constitution does it say, if you do not vote in  one election, you lose your right to vote. Voting is a right; it is not  a requirement. Your right to vote is not a use-it-or-lose-it situation.  In my opinion, purging is a constitutional violation.   The same goes for closing polling places and moving them so far that  it takes hours to travel there and back, or reducing early voting hours  such that it discriminates against those who use those shortened hours.   I implore you not to place party over patriotism, wrong over right. I  ask you to do the right thing. Our Nation needs to know if your faith  in the Constitution is whole, if it is complete, and if it is total.  And if it is, you will vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4.   How many more generations will be required to fight for their  constitutional right to vote?   We are the greatest democracy in the history of the world against  which all other democracies are judged. If your faith in the  Constitution is whole, complete, and total, you must do the right  thing, not the political thing.   Do the right thing. Vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4.
