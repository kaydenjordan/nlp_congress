 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I just want to read from the title of the bill.   ``H.R. 350, 117th Congress, 2d Session. To authorize dedicated  domestic terrorism offices within the Department of Homeland Security,  the Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to  analyze and monitor domestic terrorist activity and require the Federal  Government to take steps to prevent terrorism.''   Well, we already know what this looks like. We have already seen this  happen. The Department of Justice went after parents who showed up at  school board meetings to voice concerns about what was happening in  their child's school.    Never forget what they did. They put in place this apparatus to  report, to snitch, on parents.   The timeline here, I think, is so important. September 29, last fall,  the leftwing political organization National School Boards Association  writes a letter to the Biden administration asking exactly what this  bill does. It says: Use domestic terrorism/counterterrorism measures  against parents.   And guess what. Five days later, the Attorney General of the United  States writes a memorandum that does just that, again, what this bill  would codify and put into practice. He sends out a memo to every single  U.S. Attorney around the country. In that memo, he says: Set up a  dedicated line for threat reporting, a snitch line on parents.   And guess what happens after that. Sixteen days after that, the FBI  sends out an email to agents all across the country saying: When you  investigate these parents, when you are doing this, parents who  reported on the snitch line the Attorney General established, put this  designation, this threat tag label, on their name. All of that  happened, and we know it happened, because whistleblowers came forward  and told us about two dozen cases where this took place.   This bill is going to codify exactly what they have been doing. That  is why this bill is so harmful.   One of the situations, one of the cases, a mom who showed up at a  school board meeting was reported, and the person who filed the  complaint said: Well, she is in the group Moms for Liberty, and she  owned a firearm. Imagine that, a mom who cares about freedom and  actually exercises her Second Amendment liberties.   Now, what happened in Buffalo we know is as wrong as wrong can be,  but this legislation wouldn't prevent the terrible crime that took  place there. This bill is the same bad bill that Democrats pulled 2  weeks ago because a few of them actually had concerns about First  Amendment protected activity and what this legislation could do. Again,  specifically, it says it wants to create new offices to investigate  folks in our armed services, in our military, and in our law  enforcement for the possibility of infiltration by white nationalism.                                time  1815    But, of course, it says nothing about threats from the left, threats  like antifa. We know what happened the summer of 2020. It says nothing  about that.   This bill is dangerous because we have already seen the weaponization  of government. We saw it in the IRS a few years ago. We have seen it in  the FBI,  [[Page H5146]]  as I just pointed out, most recently the Department of Justice working  with the FBI to go after parents. This bill formalizes what we have  already seen. That is why it is so dangerous.   I urge a ``no'' vote on the legislation, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, we don't give cover to anything. White nationalism is  wrong. We have always said so. Everyone knows that.   But I tell you who does give cover, when the chairman of the  Judiciary Committee says that antifa is a myth, that is giving cover.  That is a statement made by the chairman of the House Judiciary  Committee after we had testimony from FBI Director Wray talking about  the dangers of antifa, after Attorney General Barr told us that antifa  was involved in instigating and participating in violent activity. Talk  about giving cover. Give me a break.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Gaetz), my friend and colleague.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from Georgia (Mrs. Greene).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Clyde).    Will the gentleman yield?    Mr. Speaker, is it legitimate political discourse what is  going on in front of the Supreme Court Justices' homes all last week,  maybe even as we speak? Was it legitimate political discourse what took  place over 100 days straight in Portland, Oregon, where antifa attacked  a Federal court building? Was that legitimate political discourse as  well?    Mr. Speaker, the majority leader of the House just said  we don't condone violence by anyone. That statement is just not  accurate.   The entire summer of 2020, folks in the Democratic Party said rioters  and looters were peaceful protestors. Republicans have condemned  violence every time it happened. When it happened on January 6, we said  it was wrong. When it happened in the summer of 2020, we said it was  wrong, but they didn't.   The Democratic chair of the Financial Services Committee said to the  rioters and looters that summer ``get more confrontational.'' The Vice  President of the United States supported the effort to raise money to  bail those rioters and looters out of jail.   We should condemn all violence, and we should prosecute people who  commit crimes. We shouldn't be raising bail money to get them out of  jail, and we shouldn't be encouraging with the comments people make as  happened all that summer from the Democrats and from the left.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina  (Mr. Bishop) to control the balance of my time.
