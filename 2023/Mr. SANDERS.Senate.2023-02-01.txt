 Mr. President, since 2010 I have sponsored a  State of the Union essay contest for Vermont high school students. This  contest gives students in my State the opportunity to articulate what  issues they would prioritize if they were President of the United  States.   This is the contest's 13th year, and I would like to congratulate the  seven volunteer judges who helped choose the contest winners and  finalists. The contest relies on its committed team of judges. The  judges take time to review each essay and evaluate the diversity in  writing that engages students and will benefit them for years to come.  The judges' willingness to participate in this project reflects their  dedication to both the students and our state, and for that, I  graciously thank them.   The judges include:         Andrew Chobanian of Oxbow High School--participant for one       year        Lauren Conti of Stowe High School--participant for one year        Jason Gorczyk of Milton High School--participant for ten       years        Krista Huling of South Burlington High School--participant       for ten years        Mary Schell of White River Valley School--participant for       one year        Sarah Soule of Middlebury Union High School--participant       for five years        Terri Vest of Twinfield Union School & Vermont Virtual       Learning Collaborative--participant for thirteen years    I am very proud to enter the State of the Union Essay Contest judges  into the Congressional Record to recognize their contributions.                            ____________________     Mr. President, since 2010, I have sponsored a  State of the Union essay contest for Vermont high school students. This  contest gives students in my State the opportunity to articulate what  issues they would prioritize if they were President of the United  States.   This is the contest's 13th year, and I would like to congratulate the  382 students who participated. It is truly heartening to see so many  young people engaged in finding solutions for the problems that face  our country. To my mind, this is what democracy is all about.   A volunteer panel of Vermont educators reviewed the essays and chose  August Howe as this year's winner. August, a junior at Twinfield Union  School, wrote about the impact of misinformation on our society and our  democracy. J Lahue, a freshman at Burr and Burton Academy, was the  second place winner. J wrote about how to address political  polarization. Keenan Wallace, a junior at Twinfield Union School, was  the third place winner, with an essay on unions and labor rights.   I am very proud to enter into the Congressional Record the essays  submitted by August, J and Keenan:             WINNER, AUGUST HOWE, TWINFIELD UNION SCHOOL, JUNIOR         This past Sunday, January 8th, 2023, rioters stormed       official capitol buildings in Brazil. The incident parallels       in many ways the January 6th attack on the U.S. capitol, the       two-year anniversary of which had passed just two days prior       to the Brazil riot. Both events were caused, in part, by       misinformation campaigns waged primarily on social media       platforms. Both instances are extreme examples of what can       happen when misinformation forces people into action against       problems that don't exist. Both instances are proof as to why       the rise of misinformation and fake news on social media is       one of the major problems facing our country.        The past 25 years have seen the rise of the internet and       subsequent social media platforms. Starting out as a place to       connect with people on a personal level, these platforms have       grown to dominate the online landscape and now serve as many       people's primary source of information. They have strayed       from their original purpose, developing into money generating       machines that rely on user's constant engagement. Tapping       into people's psychology is the main way social media       platforms and those on it obtain such participation, and       unfortunately, negative and emotionally-manipulating content       is what gains the most attraction. As a result, social media       platforms breed negativity, division, and ultimately,       distorted opinions that turn into mis- and disinformation and       fake news on just about every subject out there.  [[Page S195]]         The solution to such a problem is complicated and far from       perfect, but there are still a few options. Social media       platforms are essentially news sources at this point, yet       they are not held to the same legal standards. News sources       are liable for the content they release, social media       platforms, however, are exempt from such liability by Section       230, a law passed by the U.S. Congress that protects all       providers and users of interactive computer services from       liability for the content on these platforms, regardless of       whether it is true or false. Originally created to protect       internet user's speech, Section 230 now enables people to       exercise their freedom of speech and introduce mis- and       disinformation into the media stream without consequence. By       repealing Section 230 and holding social media companies       responsible for the content on their platforms, we will hold       them to the same standards as established news outlets, and       force them to do more to stop the spread of misinformation on       their platforms.        Equally as important as holding companies accountable is       encouraging the education of the general public on media       literacy and critical thinking skills to identify       misinformation and fake news. An educated population is       essential to a well-governed population, and that education       must now include media literacy. Programs should be       implemented in schools, starting as young as elementary       students, to teach how to identify fake news and be media       literate.        Regulating social media platform like standard news       outlets, and educating the general population are the best       ways we can defend our country's democracy from the threat of       misinformation in social media.           SECOND PLACE, J LAHUE, BURR AND BURTON ACADEMY, FRESHMAN         Political polarization, or the divergence of political       beliefs away from the center towards ideological extremes, is       a prominent problem and a threat to democracy. Americans       continue to create more divides between people who have       opposing views, and the result, an astounding lack of empathy       plagues our country. The 2019 government shutdown and the       violent January 6th insurrection were both major consequences       that stemmed from political polarization. This rise of       extreme ideologies can be attributed to various factors, such       as media partisanship, hostility between political opponents,       and economic inequality. These factors then lead to       congressional gridlock, lack of trust, an increase in       violence, and, most importantly, a lessened sense of       community. But, there are steps that, if taken, could stop       polarization at its roots.        To solve political polarization, I propose a new bill,       titled The Unity Act, to address the underlying problems.       This bill would create forums to unify people and cultivate       common ground by promoting dialogue and understanding and       addressing economic inequality. While political polarization       is a scary threat to democracy and the Nation we live in, we       can bridge the divides with the following measures.        The first way the bill would eliminate polarization is by       targeting economic inequality. By increasing the minimum wage       to just 10 dollars and 10 cents, around four million people       would be taken out of poverty. Similarly, investing in       education, especially Pre-K, would improve economic mobility.       Furthermore, The Unity Act would expand the Earned Income Tax       Credit to bring children above the poverty line. These       reforms would solve economic inequality, a major cause of       extreme ideologies because inequality leads to social       divisions.        With the investment in education, the bill would also       encourage middle schools to teach media literacy and how to       differentiate between fake and factual information. Teaching       this important skill at a young age would lessen the negative       effects of misinformation. The bill would also recommend       schools teach tough topics to create more dialogue and thus       reduce the risk of extreme partisan views.        While these reforms would address the underlying problems,       the major initiative would target polarization through       Citizen Assemblies. Citizen Assemblies would be held in the       counties of each State monthly. They would bring people       together to speak about divisive issues that need to be       addressed. Assemblies would select participants in the same       way as jury duty so they could engage in political       deliberation with their ideas directed towards the State and       National Government. These assemblies would effectively       establish common ground to reduce extreme partisan views.        In conclusion, political polarization is an increasing       problem that undermines democracy through issues like lack of       trust and a lost sense of unity. By correcting economic       inequalities, bettering the education system, and introducing       Citizen Assemblies, polarization can be slowly eliminated. If       passed, The Unity Act would create a bridge to improve the       welfare of American citizens by cultivating common ground.       Especially as newer and more partisan issues emerge, it is       imperative that we strive towards a more cohesive Nation by       addressing political polarization.         THIRD PLACE, KEENAN WALLACE, TWINFIELD UNION SCHOOL, JUNIOR         One of the most pressing issues facing our society today is       the issue of labor rights. Recently there has been a slew of       confrontations between workers and corporations, from       Starbucks and Amazon to the threatened rail strikes earlier       this year, 2022 has been tumultuous. The way that each of       these confrontations were negotiated either within the       corporation or, in the case of the rail strikes, by the       United States Government sends an important message, our       workers' rights are not the priority.        In November of this year Starbucks employees organized a       walkout at more than 100 Starbucks locations in protest of       Starbucks repeated refusal to negotiate contracts with labor       unions. Many workers cited being underpaid, understaffed and       overworked. But Starbucks has been adamant in their anti-      union stance, giving pay increases selectively to locations       that had not voted to unionize, firing union organizers,       refusing to negotiate contracts with union representatives,       and taking steps to prohibit union elections at its stores.       Unfortunately, this union busting attitude is not exclusive       to Starbucks. At Amazon, one of the world's largest       corporations, the same issues repeat themselves. Low pay,       oppressive and, at times unsafe working conditions, as well       as aggressive anti-union policies are also apparent there.        Earlier this year the 12 largest rail unions threatened to       strike in protest of low pay and a lack of paid sick leave.       Because of the massive economic impact, a strike like this       would have the US government stepped in. In November       President Biden brokered a deal between the major rail unions       and the rail corporations. This deal promises a 24 percent       wage increase over the next five years, but it critically       lacks any guaranteed paid sick days. This lack of sick days       led four of the 12 major unions to reject the deal. Despite       this Biden stepped in and asked Congress to impose the deal       onto the Unions, disregarding their decision. This sets a       precedent for corporations like Starbucks and Amazon to       disregard labor unions.        The framework for the solution is already in place. The       National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is an agency that was       created to enforce the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).       This agency is responsible for helping organize unions and       they step in when corporations violate the NLRA.       Unfortunately, the NLRB is tremendously underfunded and since       2014 it has received no budget increases, resulting in an       effective budget cut of more than 20 percent due to       inflation. Additionally, under the Trump administration the       agency's leadership was gutted, further challenging the fight       for unionization. Under Biden the NLRB's performance has       increased, but it is not enough. By increasing the NLRB's       funding, its ability to organize unions, achieve justice for       wronged workers and keep corporations in check would increase       dramatically.        Increasing funding for the NLRB is a simple, low cost       solution to a problem that has plagued the American working       class for decades. A stronger NLRB would not only be a boon       for workers, but also a valuable tool for the government to       check the ever-increasing power that corporations hold over       our democracy.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the  Record some of the finalists' essays written by Vermont High School  students as part of the 13th Annual State of the Union Essay contest  conducted by my office.   The material follows:                                 Finalists            JACOB ANTONOVICH, BELLOWS FREE ACADEMY FAIRFAX, SENIOR         My grandfather, Robert Antonovich, got drafted into the       Korean War where he served in the Army. At the present moment       he lays dying, at home, and without much dignity. My       grandfather is in dire need of hospice as he goes through his       last stages of life but at 88, he is unable to afford       privatized healthcare and my grandma (aged 90) is of little       help. Fortunately, as a result of my grandfather's service he       is entitled to receive benefits from the Department of       Veterans Affairs (VA). What upsets me is that where a       privatized hospice service could be there in 24 hours, after       almost two weeks, the VA is still unable to get anyone there       to help my grandfather walk through his last life with the       dignity he deserves.        Beyond my grandfather, millions of Americans who put their       lives on the line to serve this country are stuck without       much dignity. According to the National Coalition for the       Homeless; between 130,000 and 200,000 veterans are homeless       on any given night which represents between one fourth and       one fifth of all homeless people. After putting their lives       on the line, why are so many veterans being dumped on the       streets in such poor conditions? Many of these problems could       be fixed by providing proper funding and ensuring that the       security of veteran relief organizations is a top priority.       For instance, of the $300 Billion budget for the VA only       about one percent was spent on homeless care programs. The       VA's budget is even less for community care, which covers       hospice services. Based on the 2023 Budget submission for the       VA, less than .0004 percent of the budget was allocated to       community care. To make matters worse, hospice care is only a       portion of that already small percentage leaving very little       money to help those in need.        The poor treatment of veterans is a major problem in this       Nation. To fix this, I suggest  [[Page S196]]       that more money be allocated to these specific areas of the       VA as to ensure that no veterans are left homeless, and that       all who served have a chance to live the remainder of their       lives in dignity rather than the abject squalor that many are       forced to live in today. I am still hoping that the VA will       be able to get hospice care to my grandfather before it's too       late, but with how a large portion of veterans in this Nation       are currently being treated, I'm not so sure. I hope that       through the hard work of our Nation's legislators, no       veterans will ever be left behind like the thousands of       veterans who are homeless today or my grandfather who is yet       to receive the care he needs at a price he can afford.                 ANDREW BARRETT, OXBOW HIGH SCHOOL, SOPHOMORE         Mental Health America (MHA) unveiled in 2019-2020, that       ``20.78 percent of adults in America were experiencing a       mental illness.'' Mental health awareness is a minuscule       topic compared to most political conversations, but it cannot       be disregarded. Millions of American citizens face mental       illness; most go without treatment due to the expense and       shortage of mental health professionals. Mental health is       prominent in society, and its awareness needs improvement.       What is the solution? Increased funding for mental health       care, and early schooling on mental health is crucial for       advancement.        Lately, due primarily to the pandemic, there has been a       spike in mental illness. Mental illnesses like depression can       disrupt people's capacity to function, whether at school,       work, home, or social life. As of 2020, 12.1 million adult       Americans experienced profound thoughts of suicide.       Additionally, MHA states, ``half (54.7 percent) of adults       with a mental illness do not receive treatment,'' and ``59.8       percent of youth with major depression do not receive any       mental health treatment.'' Mental illness can lead to       substance use disorder, proving hazardous to those suffering       from mental illness and potentially to others around them.       Society needs to be a safe place where individuals are       comfortable and capable of seeking support.        The leading solution to the mental health crisis is better       funding for mental health care. Funding would come from       America's military spending. According to World Population       Review, America has the highest military budget and is       greater than the following ten countries combined. There is a       shortage of mental health specialists, and seeking aid is       unaffordable for most. A large portion of adults (42 percent)       with a mental illness ``reported they were unable to receive       necessary care because they could not afford it,'' according       to MHA. Therapy and care are too expensive for most people,       proving problematic in overcoming mental illness. Therapy       presents a sense of hope. Dr. Lloyd Sederer, a psychiatrist,       states, ``When there is hope, there is reason to participate       in treatment, to learn to manage the disease, and to reach       for life when faced with setbacks.'' Altogether, funding for       treatments and mental health care would help reduce the       mental health emergency in America.        Along with funding for mental health care, social standards       need to change. There cannot be a stigma around mental       illness. People should feel comfortable and aware of mental       illness. Education on the matter is critical to accomplish       this because mental illness is real. If taught the subject at       a young age, people are provided awareness, and they will       feel comfortable seeking help and helping others.        Mental health is an immensely influential element of every       person's life.                ALEXANDER CALIFANO, CRAFTSBURY ACADEMY, JUNIOR         In recent months, the Supreme Court has been at the center       of American political debate as it prepares to rule on a       number of crucial cases. Among these is Students for Fair       Admission vs. Harvard in which the Court will decide the       future of affirmative action.        In 1964, the Civil Rights Act was signed into law by Lyndon       Johnson, legalizing affirmative action in the United States       with the goal of preventing discrimination in hiring       practices. This protection was later extended into the realm       of college admissions. The ability of universities to use       affirmative action as a tool to level the playing field for       historically disadvantaged groups is now in jeopardy. Those       who oppose affirmative action argue that by favoring       historically disadvantaged groups, universities discriminate       against other groups. That is simply untrue. The goal of       these practices is to promote student diversity, which       benefits all of us by expanding our intellectual horizons and       inviting us to view the world from new perspectives. The       diversity that affirmative action policies foster is       responsible for spreading knowledge of and empathy for people       from all walks of life and all races and cultures. If the       Supreme Court outlaws affirmative action, it won't just be       historically disadvantaged groups that will be hurt. We would       all suffer by losing an invaluable part of the educational       system.        To prevent the Supreme Court from restricting the range of       educational opportunities available to racial groups already       struggling to make their way in this country, Congress should       make good on its endless promises to help Americans by taking       concrete action. This year, the Respect for Marriage Act       codified the right of individuals to enter into interracial       and same-sex marriages, protecting them from the caprices of       the Supreme Court. Congress should similarly codify       affirmative action policies. Such codification would ensure       that affirmative action can fulfill its intended purpose of       advancing historically disadvantaged groups while, at the       same time, giving America's future leaders a chance to       interact regularly with students who represent the diversity       of knowledge, beliefs, opinions, and ethnicities that make       American universities the best in the world and which have       made this country strong. Furthermore, by allowing policies       that help historically disadvantaged groups succeed, we will       be living up to this Nation's founding ideal--the notion that       all men are created equal. We can help make that dream a       reality by reversing the effects of race- based prejudice,       discrimination, and violence.        If the Supreme Court decides to end affirmative action,       Congress must move to protect the rights of educational       institutions to craft admissions policies that would ensure       that applicants aren't punished for their race, ethnicity or       lack of resources and that future generations of students       aren't deprived of the diversity of thoughts, opinions, and       ancestries that have made America such a powerful force for       good.              LEAH KUHNERT, WOODSTOCK UNION HIGH SCHOOL, JUNIOR         Climate change is perhaps the most unavoidable issue facing       our world today, yet is often pushed off by lawmakers       worldwide in favor of other issues. Although fixing climate       change is a complex task, addressing environmental impacts by       sector is an important step towards taking much-needed action       before the effects of climate change are irreversible.       According to the EPA, agriculture accounted for 11 percent of       US greenhouse gas emissions in 2020. This is why, as a       country, we must take action to decrease industrial       agriculture and turn towards regenerative farming techniques.        Governmental subsidies are what currently drives the       dysfunctional system of industrial agriculture. The       Agriculture Act of 2018 section 1202 outlines the crops       eligible for governmental subsidies, which include ``. . .       wheat, corn, grain sorghum, barley, oats, upland cotton, long       grain rice, medium grain rice, soybeans, designated oilseeds       . . .'' etc. These subsidies have effectively supported the       growth of specialized farms that mass produce only one of       these crops. The problem with this is that over-tilling and a       lack of crop diversity in these industrial farms destroy the       health of the soil. This renders ineffective the natural       process of carbon sequestration that relies on healthy soil,       contributing considerably to climate change.        An essential step that can be taken is to re-evaluate how       subsidies are used and how they impact the environment. These       subsidies have created a system that primarily benefits       commercial agribusinesses in the long run. Meanwhile, it       disadvantages small farmers who raise a diverse range of       crops and livestock. When prices for industrially produced       foods are driven down by subsidies, small farmers are forced       to lower their prices in response, causing losses in revenue.       It isn't necessary to get rid of agricultural subsidies       altogether, but it's critical to change how they're used.       Instead of offering permanent funds to artificially prop up       monoculture, subsidies should be used as a specific and       short-term tool to support farmers in switching to more       regenerative and diverse crop production.        A study by the University of Vermont found that       regenerative farming methods, such as rotational grazing,       crop rotation, and cover cropping result in the sequestration       of atmospheric carbon, unlike specialized farming methods.       Regenerative farming techniques contribute to a more       sustainable agricultural system while also helping mitigate       the effects of climate change.        Switching to regenerative farming practices also makes       economic sense. By growing a more diverse selection of crops,       farmers are less vulnerable to revenue loss in cases of a       failing crop. Additionally, regenerative methods allow       farmers to do more with less land, which means spending less       money on farmland. Effective land use increases the health of       the soil and extends the lifetime of the farmland, and the       rotation of crops and livestock ensures a more sustainably       symbiotic system. Regenerative agriculture will contribute to       the stability of farmers in America, while also reforming the       food economy. Most importantly, this change will help to       mitigate the imminent destructive effects of climate change       that we're facing now more prevalently than ever. It's time       to end our subsidy system that rewards irresponsible and       unsustainable farming.            ELLA MATTEI, NORTHFIELD MIDDLE & HIGH SCHOOL, FRESHMAN         It is a basic human right to have access to healthy,       affordable food to create the best future possible for future       generations. Food accessibility is getting worse and worse       each year, even in a farming State such as Vermont; food is       getting more expensive to transport creating a higher price.       This inevitably causes problems for people with a low income       to have access to healthy food. Food deserts are an       increasing problem in poor neighborhoods and towns, and they       don't have enough money to fix them. Food deserts are       generally associated with low-population areas, abandoned or       vacated homes, high unemployment- rated areas, or less-      educated people.        Food deserts are more common in Black neighborhoods       according to a 2014 study from Johns Hopkins University. They       found that black and urban areas have a severe lack of       supermarkets while white areas had the most and mixed-race       areas were a mixed bag.  [[Page S197]]       The idea of people not getting their basic needs met because       of a characteristic of them such as their skin color is mind-      blowing. America claims to be a great country but won't feed       people because of the color of their skin. More than 39       million people in America suffer from hunger each year and       about 9 million of them are children. In America, we are       supposed to protect our citizens and the fragile minds of our       youth. Instead, there are children starving and we have not       made much progress to solve this nationwide problem. Here in       Vermont, 1 out of 4 people know somebody facing food       insecurity, and 2 out of 5 Vermonters are facing food       insecurity personally.        To fix food insecurity, we must invest our Nation's       resources to support healthy food access to all populations.       60 years after LBJ's War on Poverty, it is embarrassing that       the richest Nation on Earth, which feeds other countries,       could possibly have people starving. If the government were       serious, it must invest in local community-based solutions.       Urban farms in places like Detroit should be a model for the       rest of our country's food deserts. Creating food-sharing       programs, and making more Federal food assistance programs       should also be a priority for this new Congress. They should       also create more food pantries where people can donate food.        Many people would argue that it would be too expensive to       fix this national crisis because it would cost around $37       billion a year until 2030, but America is the wealthiest       country in the world and if we can afford to have the most       nuclear weapons when each weapon costs $8.4 million, we are       capable of feeding our citizens. Everybody deserves a chance       at being fed.           LEILA MCMILLIAN, SOUTH BURLINGTON HIGH SCHOOL, FRESHMAN         Equality, respect, and understanding are things that       everyone deserves even, if not especially, those who are       psychologically or physically different. People with       disabilities or neurodivergence are often ridiculed or       avoided because they process and navigate the world around us       differently. It is my opinion that if other people actually       understood more about what it is like to be different than a       ``normal person'', then they might sympathize more and       bullying or other mistreatments might become less of a       problem.        According to an NPR article; ``A new study suggests that       nearly a third of children and adolescents with disabilities       has experienced violence--defined as physical, emotional or       sexual abuse as well as neglect. It's everything from being       struck or verbally attacked by a family member to       cyberbullying. And they're reportedly twice as likely to       experience violence as young people without disabilities.''       Because of the greater likelihood of being bullied for being       different, people might be less inclined to say anything if       they need help for fear of being ridiculed. A person might       hide their actions or needs to fit in with ``normal'' people,       but if they really need help and are too afraid to ask for       it, then serious problems like fights or school shootouts       could break out more often.        People with neurodivergence or disabilities are often seen       as abnormal and people make such a big deal out of their       differences that it pretty well separates them from the rest       of society. According to NPR; ``A tremendous number of kids       are affected. An estimated 291 million children and       adolescents--slightly more than 1 in 10--have disabilities       such as hearing or vision loss, epilepsy or intellectual       disabilities.'' Our kids should not have to be the subject of       other's disgraceful humor, or be the butt of their jokes.       They should be able to grow up in a world that accepts people       for who they are, not what they are or what other people       think they are. They should have equal chances to work in       good jobs as any other person, because they are people too       and should be treated as such. Some people might not see the       problem as it is though, people all over the world have been       accused of witchcraft because of their differences, or have       been called cursed. ``It is not an easy issue.'' Says Fran       Kritz, a health policy reporter based in Washington, D.C.       ``We're talking about something that has multiple causes and       can't be treated with a vaccine or intervention. We have to       create new social norms and educational, social service,       health and other systems that prevent and respond effectively       to violence against children with disabilities. We need to       ensure that systems are sufficiently supported financially       and that personnel have ongoing training.'' We are people too       and we all deserve equality and respect as anyone does.             ALAINA ROGERS, BELLOWS FREE ACADEMY FAIRFAX, JUNIOR         The gun violence epidemic is an extremely serious issue       facing America today, and it continues to get worse.       According to the CDC and Pew Research Center, 45,222 people       lost their lives to gun violence in 2020, which is the most       recent year for which complete data can be found. As I have       grown up, I have seen the number of gun violence stories       hitting the news increase year after year. I have watched my       school crack down on safety and lockdown procedures. I have       been repeatedly made aware of the threats local schools have       had to deal with in recent years, and I have seen the strain       that gun violence has put on our country while nothing is       done about it. Gun violence has been a prominent issue in       America for many years, and it is only getting worse. It is       time for us to take action.        There are steps our Federal Government can take to prevent       gun violence. Common sense gun laws that limit access to       these deadly weapons are crucial to ending this crisis.       Universal background checks must be strengthened, and the       loopholes that allow private sales, transfers of guns from       one person to another, and sales of firearms at large gun       shows to bypass background checks must be closed. According       to FBI records, more than 300,000 illegal firearm sales were       blocked by background checks in 2020. Background checks are       effective when they are conducted and have earned bipartisan       support from the vast majority of Americans. Eighty-eight       percent of Americans support universal background checks.       However, these background checks can only truly protect us if       they are required at the Federal level for all firearm       purchases and transfers.        In addition to strengthening universal background checks,       assault rifles and high- capacity magazines must be banned at       the Federal level. These weapons are designed with the       purpose of killing other human beings and have no place in       American society. Assault rifles and high-capacity magazines       have the capacity to kill many people quickly, making them       highly dangerous. There was a Federal ban on the sale and       import of assault weapons from 1994 to 2004, and studies show       that mass shooting fatalities were 70 percent less likely       during that time. A ban like this must be reinstated and the       prospect has received bipartisan support.        Gun violence is a very complex issue. Many things need to       happen to truly ensure domestic tranquility. However, the       first and most crucial step is to enact common sense gun       laws, and we must take action quickly. 2022 was a challenging       year for both our country and the State of Vermont in terms       of gun violence, with both the Buffalo and Uvalde mass       shootings and skyrocketing crime rates in the Burlington       area. As we wait to solve this problem, tens of thousands of       people lose their lives every year. It is imperative that we       take action, to protect our current generation and ensure       that future generations grow up feeling safe and secure in       their communities and their country.                 HANNAH SMILEY, MILTON HIGH SCHOOL, SOPHOMORE         365 days. 648 mass shootings. 44,208 people dead due to gun       violence this year alone. No family has been left untouched       by the immense harm caused by gun violence. Everywhere we go,       we live in constant fear of being attacked or losing someone       we love. It has changed the way we as Americans live our       lives. This isn't the so-called ``American dream'' so many       speak of. In fact, gun violence has stripped the most       important part of our Constitution from us; our right to       live.        Our country has become, dare I say, accustomed, to gun       violence. Some may even call it our ``new normal''. We're       almost numb to the constant news of shootings all over the       country. It seems as though we can't escape it, now more than       ever. Pew Research Center states that since 2010, the number       of total gun violence deaths has increased by 43 percent.       These deaths include suicide, mass shootings, and homicide.       When looking at these statistics, we often fail to realize       that these ``statistics'' are actually real people. Real       families. Real lives.        In order to see the full picture of gun violence, it's       important to hear stories from survivors themselves. In a       2021 interview, Ashley, a Sandy Hook shooting survivor who       was only seven at the time of the widely known school       shooting, claims to have PTSD from this event. She said, ``It       was just a whole lot of anxiety that I had never felt as a 7-      year-old. I had hardly even felt sadness . . . It kind of       made us realize that the world's not all sunshine and       rainbows, I guess.'' Ashley's story is heartbreakingly       terrifying, yet it's not unique. Her story sounds like       countless others who've described similar feelings of anxiety       and trauma. Survivors feel as though they can't escape the       terrors. How can we, as human beings, continue to let       innocent people lose their lives to gun violence?        There are several solutions to the issue of gun violence in       the US, the main one being stricter gun laws. For example,       Japan, a country with one of the lowest gun violence rates in       the world, has issued strict gun control laws. The process of       purchasing a gun in Japan is both time-consuming and       expensive. Those interested in purchasing a gun must undergo       a multi-step process consisting of a gun safety class,       recurring written exams, mental and physical health checks,       an extensive background check, and gun storage inspections.       According to The New York Times, in 2020, around 192,000       licensed firearms were purchased in Japan, which is fewer       than the number of registered guns in Alabama. For context,       Japan's population is roughly 20 times Alabama's population.       America's obsession with guns has triggered an epidemic of       hate and violence.        We must act on the issue of gun violence by issuing and       enforcing stronger gun control laws to make our country a       safer place for everyone. This solution is vital to American       life as we know it.                 JOSHUA STEARNS, HANOVER HIGH SCHOOL, JUNIOR         The most basic tenet of our democracy is that politicians       are chosen by the people. First observed in 1812,       gerrymandering has allowed politicians to define their       districts to choose their voters, overriding the will of the       people. Districts are as old as our Nation and play an       instrumental role in who victors  [[Page S198]]       up and down the ballot, thereby defining our communities.       With the Nation more polarized than ever, gerrymandering has       become increasingly ambitious in the past decade.        In the Constitution, the framers stipulated that ``the       Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every       thirty Thousand,'' but today the average congressional       district has 747,184 constituents. The Permanent       Apportionment Act of 1929 capped the number of       representatives at 435. Since then, the population of our       country has nearly tripled, causing an explosion in the       number of Americans per congressional district. Beginning in       1967 with the Uniform Congressional District Act, every State       was mandated to conduct elections for the House of       Representatives using single-member-districts (SMDs). This       requirement normalized gerrymandering as politicians       throughout the country manipulated boundaries to select their       voters and maximize their chances of victory in subsequent       elections.        SMDs empower politicians of both parties, Democrats and       Republicans, to gerrymander. Gerrymandering can be clearly       observed after the 2020 redistricting in Democratic-      controlled States like Illinois and Republican-controlled       States like Wisconsin. Gerrymandering directly influences       many of the important issues we face today, from abortion to       gun control to climate change. While both parties       gerrymander, it has tended to skew elections towards       Republicans nationally, particularly because district       manipulation in Southern States results in the       disenfranchisement of people of color, one of Democrats' most       important voting blocs. In Georgia, where Senator Raphael       Warnock won a majority of the vote in 2022, Democrats won       only 35 percent of the State's U.S. House seats. In contrast       to SMDs, multimember-districts (MMDs) combined with       proportional representation award each party a certain number       of seats based on the percentage of the votes garnered. Using       MMDs, Georgia Democrats would have been awarded about half of       the U.S. House seats. Such is the case in many States. This       representation discrepancy caused by gerrymandering could       have wildly changed the outcome of the 2022 elections.        This method by which we select those who represent us in       the peoples' house, intended by the founders to be       representative, currently is undemocratic. Just because       gerrymandering has been part of our political fabric for       centuries does not mean that it should endure. Should we not       choose to further democratize our Nation?        Solving this systemic issue will not be easy--most       institutionalized processes are difficult to reverse. But it       is possible. To do so, we must begin with repealing these two       Congressional Acts which have undermined our democracy, and       we must transition to proportionally representative MMDs. To       fully realize the possibility that is our democracy, we must       also increase the number of representatives of the peoples'       house, to ensure the fair, equal, and meaningful       representation of every citizen of this great country.       Because every American deserves equal representation.                LYLA TRIGAUX, BURLINGTON HIGH SCHOOL, FRESHMAN         Despite living in Vermont, one of the most progressive       states when it comes to LGBTQ rights, I still see       discrimination in my day to day life. In my neighborhood       alone, there are hateful stickers plastered all over signs,       claiming someone ``can't be born in the wrong body.'' As a       freshman in high school, I fear for my transgender classmates       who are targeted by these stickers, and I also fear for those       who have to experience discrimination like this in school, as       well. School is supposed to be a foundation for building a       healthy and happy life, but for the nearly two million youth       in America who identify as LGBTQ, school too often becomes       the opposite. Congress must pass bills like the Safe Schools       Improvement Act to make our school system and our country a       more inclusive place.        Bullying at school can not only prevent youth from       learning, but it can also pose a threat to their wellbeing.       LGBTQ youth are at an increased risk of being bullied.       According to the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, 32 percent       of lesbian, gay or bisexual students said they have been       bullied on school property, compared to 17.1 percent of       straight students. This negative environment can lead to       serious outcomes for these students, from failing to graduate       to taking their own lives. According to the Trevor Project,       the suicide rate of LGBTQ youth is more than four times       higher than the suicide rate of straight, cisgendered youth,       and feeling unsafe at school is a contributing cause. With       lives on the line, we must take steps to make our schools       safer for everyone.        The Safe Schools Improvement Act was a bill introduced to       the House in 2021 aimed at stopping bullying and harassment       in schools. The bill requires schools to enact policies to       not only prohibit, but also prevent bullying and harassment       based on protected categories like gender identity and sexual       orientation. Preventing these incidents from happening in the       first place is what makes this bill a good solution. While       supporting LGBTQ youth after bullying or harassment has       already occurred is important, it's not enough. Schools being       able to stop it from happening in the first place is what can       save someone from trauma. Making this bill a law may also be       a quicker process than writing a whole new one. According to       the Trevor Project, of the LGBTQ youth that seriously       consider suicide each year, at least one attempts it every 45       seconds. The faster we pass this bill the more lives it may       be able to save.        All students deserve equal access to education and the       chance to learn without the distraction of threat to their       safety and mental wellbeing. For too long, LGBTQ youth have       had to endure a hostile school environment. Supporting the       Safe Schools Improvement Act is an important step towards       ending bullying, protecting students' rights, and saving       lives.            SAMANTHA URBINA, BELLOWS FREE ACADEMY--FAIRFAX, JUNIOR         As of the 2020 census almost 19 percent of the United       States population are Latino or Hispanic. Latinos are the       second largest ethnic group, the largest minority group and       our history is being glossed over in our high school       education, being forgotten in a country founded by       immigrants. Correcting this injustice starts in the       classroom. For example, there is not any mention of our       contributions during the world wars. I know there was though,       my great uncle, a Mexican-American, was part of the 101st       Airborne division during World War II. From what I can       remember of all the history that I have learned from       elementary school to now, there has been little to no mention       of the colonization of Latin and Central Americans or any       Latino history or contributions to the United States. The       Chicano movement was active during the 1960s and Hispanic-      Americans were also fighting for equality during this time,       but almost all of the attention in class and textbooks was       focused on Civil Rights for Black Americans, Women, and       Native Americans. Talking to my friends from other high       schools such as Essex, Champlain Valley Union, Colchester and       Burlington said they had little to no education on Latino       history. Either it was barely mentioned in a world history       class, only talked about cultures in Spanish class or a short       unit about North American Indigenous peoples.        The lack of education is part of the reason for the       stereotypes and misinformation about Latinos and who we are.       Latino history in America is American history and it should       be added to the curriculum, and the excuse that areas that       don't have a large population of Latinos-like Vermont-don't       need to learn that part of history is wrong and demeaning. It       causes us to feel invisible in our own home and school.       Learning and being educated is connected to how everyone       thinks as an adult. The lack of Latino history taught can       lead to prejudice and biases against this group of people.       Drowning out those loud voices that talk with hatred gets us       one step closer to complete equality and equity between       everyone, it won't be perfect but the hope is that it will be       better.        Progress starts here. Celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month       is not enough, we can do better than that. School Boards       should change the curriculum to include everyone's history,       even if there aren't students that are Latino, by not       teaching inclusive history it is like we don't exist. In a       world history class; tell the story of the colonization of       Latin and Central American countries. In American History;       let the students know that Latinos had a part in our wars, in       the Civil Rights movement, that our voices were loud enough       to be heard. Change starts with a clear view of United States       education standards shifting to be as inclusive as they       claim, changing for all the Latino kids who feel invisible to       be proud of who they are and where they come from.          GRETCHEN WERTLIEB, SOUTH BURLINGTON HIGH SCHOOL, FRESHMAN         When you think of global warming, you probably think of       factories, vehicles, and anything else that emits gas, or,       more scientifically, greenhouse gasses. But there is one huge       factor that not many people think of. Something we contribute       to every day. Food waste.        Feeding America is the largest food rescue organization in       the country. They send all that food to people in need of       meals or food banks. According to Feeding America, about 108       billion pounds of food is wasted every year. That's       equivalent to 130 billion meals that could go to people in       need. All in all, around 40 percent of all food is wasted in       the US, which comes out to about $408 billion a year.        Even if you can get fresh food easily from your local       grocery store, your family farm, or somewhere else, food       waste impacts you more than you think. Food waste sitting in       landfills produces tons of methane, a greenhouse gas even       more dangerous than carbon dioxide (CO2). ``In the       United States, food waste is responsible for more than twice       as many greenhouse gasses than commercial aviation, leading       some experts to believe that reducing food waste is one of       our best shots at combating climate change'' (New York       Times). Greenhouse gasses trap heat in by drifting up into       the air and mixing with other gas molecules. In an article       from MIT through the Climate Portal, Jesse Kroll, Professor       of Civil and Environmental Engineering and Chemical       Engineering, is quoted as saying ``Greenhouse gas molecules       will absorb light . . . This traps the energy, which would       otherwise go back into space, so it has the effect of heating       up the atmosphere''. This, combined with so many other       factors of global warming, is enough to heat our planet to       the point of destruction.        Although it's a big problem, food waste still has some       people skeptical about solutions. Some people don't have a       place to  [[Page S199]]       compost food, or don't know what to do with it. It's also       hard to know what to do with the already giant piles of food       in landfills. One thing we can do to decrease food waste is       talk to people about it. Getting your neighborhood or town       involved with simple practices like composting or a community       garden can make a difference. You can also be more mindful       when buying produce at the store. The majority of foods in       landfills are foods that don't look as pretty as what you       would see in a store. Just because that tomato is misshapen       or the lettuce has a brown spot doesn't mean they aren't       edible.        Another good way to decrease food waste is donating to       organizations that rescue food, like Feeding America. You can       also donate directly to your local food bank, which provides       meals for families in need. This is a great option, because       food waste also contributes to food insecurity. Whatever you       may choose to do, we can all be more mindful when thinking       about our food consumption and the consequences.                            ____________________
