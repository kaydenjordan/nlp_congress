 Mr. Speaker, I have the honor of serving as  chairwoman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland  Security. The subcommittee is charged with overseeing the funding of  our Nation's longest continuous seagoing service, the United States  Coast Guard.   Since the Coast Guard's founding in 1790 by Alexander Hamilton,  Americans have relied on this service to protect our maritime  interests. The Coast Guard has secured our sovereignty in times of war  and peace and safeguarded the American public during times of national  catastrophe.   As one of the five branches of the U.S. Armed Forces, the Coast Guard  serves as a critical link between the Department of Defense and the  Department of Homeland Security.   My role as chairwoman of the DHS Appropriations Subcommittee and  previously as the subcommittee's ranking member has afforded me the  opportunity to more fully appreciate the challenging work of the men  and women of the Coast Guard. This includes saving more than 11,000  lives after the devastating impacts of Hurricanes Maria, Irma, Harvey,  Florence, and Michael, to the cumulative interdiction of 432 tons of  cocaine over the past 2 years.   One of the greatest exemplars of Coastie dedication and effectiveness  is Captain Adam Chamie, who has served as the Coast Guard liaison to  the House of Representatives for the past 2 years.   Adam has consistently demonstrated an ability to effectively convey  the critical needs of the Coast Guard to both Members of Congress and  staff, while also supporting the Coast Guard's responses to the needs  of States and congressional districts across the country.   Over his 2-year tenure as liaison, he has helped facilitate the Coast  Guard's two largest annual funding levels in the service's history.   On April 18, 2019, Adam will take command of Coast Guard Sector Key  West, an area from the Bahamas to Cuba encompassing 55,000 square  nautical miles.   While his departure is a loss to the House, the men and women of the  Coast Guard serving along the Florida Keys will greatly benefit from  his leadership and his commitment to the Coast Guard's core values of  honor, respect, and devotion to duty.   I wish Captain Chamie fair winds and following seas as he starts a  new chapter in his career.   Today, I ask my colleagues to please join me in recognizing this  great American and Coast Guardsman for his selfless service to our  Nation.                            ____________________
