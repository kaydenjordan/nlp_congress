 Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the incredible people of  Oakland County, Michigan, and Michigan's 11th District, let it be known  that the very first action of the new Republican majority was to add  $100 billion to our national debt, to aid the ultra-wealthy and the  non-tax paying corporations, to add to our deficit at the expense of  the middle class.   We saw this before, Mr. Speaker. In fact, we have seen this time and  time again: threats to the fiscal integrity of our Nation, ballooning  of our debt, and the Democrats come in time and time again to clean it  up.   Since being sworn into Congress, my office has helped more than a  thousand constituents navigate IRS-related issues, illustrating the  ongoing and vital need for adequate funding for this Nation, helping  people who are seeking a tax return, helping the small business owners.   The most rewarding call you can make as a Member of Congress: Have I  helped you today?   The truth is, Mr. Speaker, we must unite, we must continue to come  together, and we must continue to deliver for the people who elected  us.                            ____________________
