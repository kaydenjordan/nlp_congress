 Madam Speaker, we all know that elections matter, so I  would like to congratulate the students of Haverford High School for  receiving the Governor's Civic Engagement Award. This award is given to  Pennsylvania high schools that register over 85 percent of their  eligible students to vote. Haverford High was 1 of 4 Philadelphia area  schools and 1 of 23 schools in our Commonwealth to receive this  noteworthy award.   At a time when some States are imposing restrictions on voting, we  should all follow the lead set by the students at Haverford High. They  worked to educate their peers and bring them into the electoral  process. This Congress should do the same.   We need to ensure that our schools give students a thorough civics  education so that they have the knowledge and tools necessary to fully  participate in our democracy. We need to expand voting rights and  access to the ballot, as we are doing with passage of bills like H.R. 1  and H.R. 4.   Again, Madam Speaker, I want to congratulate the students of  Haverford High School for their outstanding achievement and for being  an example for all of us to follow.                            ____________________
