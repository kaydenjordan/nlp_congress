 Madam Speaker, it is summer, and Hoosiers all over the  great State of Indiana are renewing our proud and longstanding  tradition of attending our great county fairs.   County fairs are a time for communities to gather, to celebrate, and  to encourage young Hoosiers in agriculture. My team and I have spent  our summer attending county fairs across Indiana's Sixth District. I  encourage all Hoosiers to attend their local county fair and the  Indiana State Fair, which runs from July 29 through August 21.                         Decatur County Bicentennial     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Decatur County and  its county seat, Greensburg, Indiana, in its bicentennial celebration.   Decatur County and the wonderful city of Greensburg were founded in  the year of 1822 by veterans and war heroes of the War of 1812, and it  still stands today as a model county and city. Decatur County and the  city of Greensburg will long stand as a beacon of hope from the  communities filled with hospitality to the famous Tree City courthouse.   So, Madam Speaker, I ask that all Hoosiers and Americans join us in  celebrating Decatur County's grand bicentennial.                          Henry County Bicentennial     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor and celebrate the  bicentennial of Henry County, Indiana. Henry County was officially  founded on June 1, 1822. Henry County is home to the Indiana Basketball  Hall of Fame and served as the home court to the movie ``Hoosiers'' in  Knightstown. A museum and the birthplace of Wilbur Wright also finds  its home there. Henry County includes the Old National Road, the oldest  of the great crossroads of America.   So, Madam Speaker, I ask that all Hoosiers and Americans join us in  celebrating Henry County's grand bicentennial.                  Honoring State Representative Tom Saunders     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor State Representative  Tom Saunders. Representative Saunders is retiring after nearly three  decades of public service, and I am proud to join Hoosiers in  celebrating a friend who has had an immeasurable impact on our  beloved Indiana.    Representative Tom Saunders has long served as a distinguished voice  on behalf of the people of Henry County and our entire State;  therefore, Madam Speaker, I wish him an enjoyable retirement, and I  thank him for his many years of service.                         Fighting for Hoosier Farmers     Madam Speaker, I rise today because Hoosier farmers are  struggling under Democratic leadership here in Washington, D.C. While  many of us understand the cost of inflation on our pocketbooks, we  often forget that inflation is clobbering farmers who produce our food  and fuel. Under President Biden's policies, farmers are struggling to  just break even as input costs outpace commodity prices.   So, Madam Speaker, after many letters I have written to multiple  agency heads, I regret to report that Democrats are not, in fact, the  party of all Americans. I will never stop fighting for Hoosier farmers  and the agricultural industry here in the Nation's Capitol.                     Thanking Greenwood First Responders     Madam Speaker, I rise today to say a hearty thank you to  the brave and courageous first responders who serve the community of  Greenwood, Indiana. When tragedy hit their community last week they  were the first on the scene to respond. We commend local and Federal  authorities for their swift and coordinated action. I thank the  Greenwood Police Chief James Ison and Johnson County Sheriff Duane  Burgess for their leadership, and I thank all of those who serve with  them.                       Inflation, Inflation, Inflation     Inflation, inflation, inflation.   Madam Speaker, inflation is costing the average family $6,000 per  year--$6,000 per year.   For Hoosiers, this is gas and groceries, college tuition, and car  repairs. Despite Democrats' denial, we all know where this is headed: a  recession. We are in it. Hardworking Hoosiers cannot afford Democrats'  policies any longer.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  stop crushing the American Dream with their out-of-touch policies.                            ____________________
