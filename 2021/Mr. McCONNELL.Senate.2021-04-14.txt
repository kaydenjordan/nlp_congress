 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, ``Biden takes the easy way out of  Afghanistan. The likely result is disaster.'' This is the morning's  lead editorial from one of the Nation's most liberal newspapers.   The administration has decided to abandon U.S. efforts in  Afghanistan, which have helped keep radical Islamic terrorism in check,  and bizarrely, they decided to do so by September 11. Apparently, we  are to help our adversaries ring in the anniversary of the  9/11 attacks by giftwrapping the country and handing it right back to  them.   Here is what this administration's own national intelligence threat  assessment says will happen:         The Taliban is likely to make gains on the battlefield, and       the Afghan government will struggle to hold the Taliban at       bay if the coalition withdraws support.    This is a quote from this administration.   In 2019, the Democratic leader and the now chairman of the Foreign  Relations Committee expressed outrage that the previous administration  considered hosting Taliban officials for discussions around the date of  September 11.   But now a Democratic administration is going to skip the negotiations  and just surrender an entire country back to the Taliban on the very  same date? Our President should remember what happened when the Obama  administration let political considerations rush a retreat from Iraq-- total chaos and bloodshed and ISIS.   Two years ago, I wrote a bipartisan amendment that warned a  Republican administration against recklessly withdrawing from  Afghanistan or Syria. A supermajority of Senators right here voted for  it. A supermajority of Senators voted for it, warning that the  terrorist threat had not abated. Where are the Democratic voices today?  I hope we will hear from some of them.   Unfortunately, this mistake in Afghanistan is one of several  instances of this new administration's surrendering leverage without  making America, our allies, or our interests more secure.   In January, President Biden extended the New START agreement with  Russia by Executive order for 5 years--no strings attached, no  concessions secured, not even a shorter term extension to keep up  pressure on Russia to cooperate on a better agreement. Just a gift--a  gift.   And then there is Iran. Senior administration officials have gone  from denigrating the former administration's ``maximum pressure''  strategy to simply begging for direct talks with Iran, to proactively  offering to remove sanctions that are ``inconsistent with the JCPOA.''  So which sanctions exactly are inconsistent with the JCPOA? Our  sanctions on Iran's terrorist organizations or its ballistic missile  program?   Most Republicans would be thrilled if President Biden could actually  secure a better deal that holds Iran accountable. Giving up the  leverage of sanctions before we even get to the table--before we even  get to the table--or just return to a bad deal is certainly not a good  sign.   It would be hard to support any deal that isn't part of a broader  strategy that also confronts the nonnuclear threats Iran poses to  America and to the region.   On China, the administration's tough talk has been welcome, but its  proposal to cut defense spending after inflation suggests there is less  interest in walking the walk. We will not keep pace with China and  Russia by cutting defense spending to placate fringe parts of the far  left.   The American people need and they deserve a foreign policy that puts  our security, our partners, and our interests ahead of the reflexive  desire to break with the last 4 years at any cost--at any cost.   If this administration wants a successful legacy on the world stage,  if they want accomplishments that will endure, they need to put  American strength back at the center and come back to a bipartisan  mainstream.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, on a completely different matter,  we know Democrats are desperate to create a national controversy over  voting regulations, but the facts and the truth keep getting in the  way.   For more than a year, we have seen a coordinated campaign to call any  [[Page S1909]]  American institution that occasionally frustrates liberal activists an  evil relic of Jim Crow. Let me say that again. For more than a year, we  have seen a coordinated campaign to call any American institution that  occasionally frustrates liberal activists an evil relic of Jim Crow.   When these talking points came into circulation last summer, their  focus was the legislative filibuster here in the Senate, except it was  Senate Democrats who had just used the legislative filibuster to kill  Senator Tim Scott's police reform, body camera, and anti-lynching  legislation.   Two days ago, our colleague the assistant Democratic leader suggested  he now opposes the filibuster because it was used back in the 1920s to  block an anti-lynching bill. To be clear, our colleague from Illinois  was a loud and proud defender of the current Senate rules as recently  at 2018. This isn't about the 1920s. It is not about the 1920s. It is  about Democrats wanting different sets of rules, depending on whether  or not they happen to be in the majority.   Our colleague didn't need to go back nine decades to find instances  of Democrats' filibustering a Republican anti-lynching bill. He only  needed to go back 9 months. He didn't have to go back to the 1920s but  just go back 9 months to find an example of Democrats filibustering an  anti-lynching bill.   Last summer, 44 Senate Democrats locked arms and filibustered Tim  Scott's police reform, body camera, and anti-lynching legislation  because it was not far left enough or anti-police enough. That is the  irony here. If any recent Senate filibusters have been reminiscent of  the 1920s, it was when Democrats killed a Republican anti-lynching bill  just last summer.   Here is the truth. Our colleagues can't defend any of the details of  their radical policies. So they want to change the subject--change the  subject--by any means necessary.   Look at voting regulations. The recent bill passed in the State of  Georgia mandates more days of early voting than plenty of Democratic- run States allow. It continues no-excuse absentee voting, which some  blue States do not allow. There is no factual standard by which its  overall approach is radically more restrictive than the rules in place  in many other States, blue or red.   The Washington Post has given the White House its worst rating,  four--four Pinocchios--for repeated lies about Georgia and the election  law. But the President and his staff just keep on doubling down.   One of our colleagues who represents Georgia put his name to a public  statement--to a public statement--with inaccurate information about the  bill.   In the Rules Committee, the Democratic leader shouted angry attacks  at things the Georgia law simply doesn't do.   Why the fake narratives? Why the falsehoods? We all know why. For  more than 2 years, Washington Democrats have been desperate to pass a  sweeping partisan takeover of our democracy. It is packed--packed--with  shameless provisions that have nothing to do with ballot access.   They want to take the bipartisan Federal Election Commission, make it  a partisan body, and give Democrats the majority. They want to send  taxpayers' money to political campaigns. They want to expand  Washington's policing of Americans' speech. They want to neuter voter  ID and mandate ballot harvesting in all 50 States. Strangely enough,  for multiple years now, this exact same power grab has been their  answer to every changing circumstance. When they didn't like the  outcome of the 2016 election, Democrats said our democracy was broken  and only this takeover could fix it. Then, in 2020, they got the result  they liked. Suddenly, this same bill became the way to simply preserve  a system that functioned well.    There seems to be no situation where this attempted power grab is not  the Democrats' answer. I think we can learn tomorrow that an asteroid  was hurtling toward Earth, and Democrats would say our only hope was to  pass H.R. 1.   This isn't about responding to recent State laws. It is not about  justice or equity. Washington Democrats want to rewrite all 50 States'  election laws. They want to take over the Federal Election Commission.  And they have been trying out different justifications for multiple  years straight to get what they want.   Any Federal law addressing the ground rules of our democracy has a  special obligation to be sober, to be factual, and to be bipartisan.  The Senate has done just that in the past. We have passed reasonable  laws by huge, bipartisan margins making it easier to vote but harder to  cheat.   So ask yourself: Why won't Democrats today deal in truth and facts?  Why do they keep using the same smears to distract from their policies?  Why are they hell-bent on a bill that passed the House with purely  partisan support but bipartisan opposition? Talk about tipping your  hand.                            ____________________
