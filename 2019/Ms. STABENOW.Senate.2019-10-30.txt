 Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to  Congressman John Conyers, Jr., a civil rights icon, lifelong public  servant, lover of jazz, and champion for his beloved hometown of  Detroit.   Congressman Conyers was born in Detroit on May 16, 1929, and spent  the next 90 years fighting for his city, our State, our Nation, and the  equality of all people. He deeply understood the challenges Detroit  families face. In the words of Kary Moss, executive director of ACLU of  Michigan: ``He was of Detroit and for Detroit.''   He knew what it was like to wake up and head to the factory; after  graduating from Northwestern High School, he worked as a welder at a  Lincoln plant before earning bachelor's and law degrees from Wayne  State University.   He knew what it was like to serve this Nation in uniform; he enlisted  in the Army and served a tour of duty during the Korean war.  [[Page S6296]]    He knew what it was like to fight for equality; he marched alongside  Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in Selma, AL; cofounded the  Congressional Black Caucus; and even hired civil rights icon Rosa Parks  as a secretary and receptionist in his office.   He knew what it was like to devote his life to public service,  spending 53 years in the U.S. House of Representatives and rising to  lead the Judiciary Committee. He fought to make Dr. King's birthday a  national holiday, protect the Voting Rights Act, change mandatory  sentences for nonviolent drug offenders, and create death benefits for  police officers and firefighters who died in the line of duty.   Public service was his calling, and jazz was his passion. He had an  encyclopedic knowledge of this most American form of music, gained  through hosting a jazz radio show in the 1970s and spending as much  time as possible in Detroit's jazz clubs. He introduced a congressional  resolution in 1987 designating jazz as ``a rare and valuable national  American treasure'' and helped establish the Smithsonian Jazz  Masterworks Orchestra.   Only five people in history have served longer in the House of  Representatives than Congressman Conyers, and the people of Detroit  always knew that Congressman Conyers, sporting a crisp shirt and dapper  suit, was in their corner.   My deepest condolences go to his wife, Monica; his sons, John and  Carl; his family and many friends; and the city of Detroit.                            ____________________
