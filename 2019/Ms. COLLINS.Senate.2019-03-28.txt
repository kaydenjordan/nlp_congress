 Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along with the  senior Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, the Smithsonian  American Women's History Museum Act. This bill would establish an  American women's history museum in our Nation's Capital.   American women have made invaluable contributions to our country in  every field, such as government, business, medicine, law, literature,  sports, entertainment, the arts, and the military. Telling the history  of American women matters, and a museum recognizing these achievements  and experiences is long overdue.   In 1999, a Presidential commission on commemorating women in American  history concluded that an ``appropriate celebration of women's history  in the next millennium should include the designation of a focal point  for women's history in our Nation's capital.'' In 2014, Congress took  an important step toward realizing this goal when it passed legislation  creating an independent, bipartisan commission to study the potential  for establishing such a museum in Washington, DC. Following 18 months  of study, the bipartisan commission unanimously concluded, ``America  needs and deserves a physical national museum dedicated to showcasing  the historical experiences and impact of women in the country.'' I  could not agree more.   The bill we are introducing takes the next step toward creating this  national museum. Incorporating the recommendations of the bipartisan  Commission, the bill would establish a national museum to collect,  study, and create programs incorporating and exhibiting a wide spectrum  of American women's experiences, contributions, and history. The  Smithsonian Institution would be the governing body, ensuring that this  museum is free and open to all who visit Washington, DC. Following the  Commission's recommendation, the Smithsonian has begun an American  Women's History Initiative to increase its research and programming  related to American women, past and present.   Mr. President, this year we commemorate the 100th anniversary of  American women's suffrage and the decades-long fight for women's  equality at the ballot box. The story, leaders, and lessons of women's  suffrage are among the most powerful in our nation's history. Amid  celebrations of that historic moment, I can think of few better ways to  honor those women and that momentous achievement than by passing this  legislation. A museum dedicated to women's history would help ensure  that future generations understand what we owe to those American women  who have helped build, sustain, and advance our society.   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, along with the  senior Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, the Smithsonian  American Women's History Museum Act.
