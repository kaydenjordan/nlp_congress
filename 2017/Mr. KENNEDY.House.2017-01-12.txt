 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow this body is set to vote on a  budget resolution that would dramatically cut Federal funding for  Planned Parenthood. But today there is still time to reconsider that  proposal and listen to the thousands, if not millions, of men, women,  and children who are urging us not to because they understand the  impact in our communities better than almost any of us here today.   Now, this isn't just about blocking a woman's constitutional right to  her own healthcare options, although that would be bad enough. This is  about gutting Medicaid reimbursements for preventive care and family  planning, revoking every single dollar for 360,000 lifesaving breast  exams and 4 million tests for sexually transmitted diseases. This is  Congress choosing political gamesmanship at the expense of Americans'  health, particularly those who cannot afford care otherwise. This is a  tactical strike on low-income women and families.   In my home State of Massachusetts, it would immediately deny access  to care to nearly 10,000 patients covered by MassHealth. For these men,  women, and children, it is not as simple as walking to the nearest  community health center, because over 50 percent of Planned Parenthood  centers across our country are found in medically underserved  communities.   For the elderly woman in need of cancer screening, there would be  nowhere else to turn. For the young expectant mother in need of  prenatal care, there would no longer be a community doctor that she can  trust. For the dad whose son is in need of strep throat treatment, the  only option left may be an unaffordable trip to the emergency room.   Mr. Speaker, if this is intended to be a warning shot on a  constitutionally guaranteed right to have an abortion, my Republican  colleagues are missing their target and, instead, they are aimed right  at poor Americans.   I urge every Member of this House to talk to their constituents who  have received care at Planned Parenthood centers before voting on this  bill. I ask them to listen and understand the life-altering impact that  it will have on the families who can least afford it.                            ____________________
