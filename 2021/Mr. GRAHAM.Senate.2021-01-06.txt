 Many times, my State has been the problem. I love it.  That is where I want to die but no time soon.   Tim and I have a good relationship. I love Tim Scott. In 1876, South  Carolina, Louisiana, and Florida sent two slates of electors--they had  two Governors, by the way--and we didn't know what to do. Why did South  Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana do it? To hold the country hostage to  end Reconstruction. It worked.   The Commission was 8 to 7. It did work. Nobody accepted it. The way  it ended is when Hayes did a deal with these three States: You give me  the electors. I will kick the Union Army out. The rest is history. It  led to Jim Crow. If you are looking for historical guidance, this is  not the one to pick.   If you are looking for a way to convince people there was no fraud,  having a commission chosen by Nancy Pelosi, Mitch McConnell, and John  Roberts is not going to get you to where you want to go. It ain't gonna  work. So it is not going to do any good. It is going to delay, and it  gives credibility to a dark chapter of our history. That is why I am  not with you, but I will fight to my death for you. You are able to  object. You are not doing anything wrong. Other people have objected. I  just think it is a uniquely bad idea to delay this election.   Trump and I have had a hell of a journey. I hate it being this way.  Oh, my God, I hate it. From my point of view, he has been a  consequential President. But today, the first thing you will see, all I  can say is, count me out. Enough is enough. I tried to be helpful. But  when the Wisconsin supreme court ruled 4 to 3 that they didn't violate  the Constitution of Wisconsin, I agreed with the three, but I accept  the four. If Al Gore can accept 5 to 4 he is not President, I can  accept Wisconsin 4 to 3.   Pennsylvania went to the Second Circuit. So much for all the judges  being in Trump's pocket. They said: No, you are wrong. I accept the  Pennsylvania Second Circuit that Trump's lawsuit wasn't right.   Georgia, they said the secretary of state took the law in his own  hands, and he changed the election laws unlawfully. A Federal judge  said no. I accept the Federal judge, even though I don't agree with it.   Fraud. They say there is 66,000 people in Georgia under 18 voting.  How many people believe that? I asked: Give me 10. I haven't had one.  They said 8,000 felons in prison in Arizona voted. Give me 10. I  haven't gotten one.   Does that say there are problems in every election? I don't buy this.  Enough is enough. We got to end it.   Vice President Pence, what they are asking you to do, you won't do  because you can't.   Talk about interesting times. I associate myself with Rand Paul. How  many times will you hear that? The mob has done something nobody else  could do to get me and Rand to agree. Rand is right. If you are a  conservative, this is the most offensive concept in the world that a  single person could disenfranchise 155 million people.         [T]he President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the       Senate and the House of Representatives, open all       certificates and the votes shall then be counted;-The person       having the greatest number of votes for President shall be       President.    Where in there does it say that Mike can say, ``I don't like the  results; I want to send them back to the States; I believe there was  fraud''?   To the conservatives who believe in the Constitution, now is your  chance to stand up and be counted.   Originalism, count me in. It means what it says.   So Mike--Mr. Vice President, just hang in there. They said: We can  count on Mike. All of us can count on the Vice President. You are going  to do the right thing. You are going to do the constitutional thing.  You have a son who flies F-35s. You have got a son-in-law flying F-18s.  They are out there flying so we can get it right here.   There are people dying, to my good friend from Illinois, to make sure  we have a chance to argue among ourselves, and when it is over, it is  over. It is over.   The final thing. Joe Biden. I have traveled the world with Joe. I  hoped he lost. I prayed he would lose. He won. He is the legitimate  President of the United States. I cannot convince people, certain  groups, by my words, but I will tell you by my actions that maybe I,  above all others in this body, need to say this. Joe Biden and Kamala  Harris are lawfully elected and will become the President and the Vice  President of the United States on January the 20th.   (Applause, Senators rising.)   The VICE PRESIDENT. The majority leader.
