 Mr. President, I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I join my colleagues today during  Police Week to honor the work of our Nation's law enforcement officers.   Being a law enforcement officer is one of the toughest jobs that  there is, but it is also foundational to a functioning society. We rely  on these brave men and women to protect and serve our country every  day.   Unfortunately, many officers are being driven out by a wave of anti- police rhetoric on the heels of bad actors who operated outside of  their training. We need to have trust between law enforcement and  citizens. Without it, our society frays and decays.   Over the course of this week, my colleagues are sharing many stories  of law enforcement officers stepping up to help their fellow citizens  in times of need and build trust with the communities that they serve.   We are lucky to have many brave and honorable officers in Alabama and  around this country.   I think about Officer Jonathan Espino from the Decatur Police  Department. Last year, Officer Espino responded to a medical call. A  man was trying to bring his mom back to life, trying to perform CPR.  Officer Espino took over for the man after he arrived and began CPR.  Just before medical personnel arrived, the woman's heart started  beating again, and she was gasping for air. He saved her life.   I think of Officer Wesley Harrison from the Abbeville Police  Department. Officer Harrison received a call that a woman was in a  burning building. Officer Harrison arrived on the scene minutes later  and was able to carry the elderly woman out of the structure, with the  help of another investigator.   These police officers went above and beyond the call of duty, and  lives were saved because of their heroism. But we know such an  important job comes with great risk. Just last week, Alabama honored  the 11 law enforcement officers who gave the ultimate sacrifice the  last 2 years. In the last 2 days alone across the United States of  America, four law enforcement officers have been killed. We are forever  grateful to each of these officers who have laid down their lives in  service for their community.   How would you like to every day wake up, put a uniform on, a badge on  your chest, a gun on your side, leave your family, walk out the door,  knowing it might be the last time you ever walk into that home or see  your family? That is what happens to these law enforcement officers  every day of their career, which is why I firmly believe we need more  support for law enforcement, not less.   They need more training so they can be better at handling difficult  situations. This is especially true as we see an uptick in mental  health issues all across this country. They need targeted resources so  they can recruit the best and brightest for these important roles in  the community and across our country. Let's invest in the resources  that they can ensure all law enforcement officers are a true force for  good for all people across their State and across this country.   Part of keeping communities safe is making sure our law enforcement  officers have the authority they need to enforce compliance with our  current laws. This is especially necessary as we see a flood of  immigrants coming into our country illegally.   Right now, unless State and local law enforcement agencies have an  agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, if an officer  encounters an illegal alien in the course of performing their normal  duties in their hometowns, they cannot arrest or detain that individual  for immigration purposes.   Right now, ICE arrests are low, even while illegal border crossings  are historically high. Under President Biden's enforcement of our  immigration laws, which has fallen dramatically, arrests by ICE for the  last 4 months have fallen 66 percent. Under the Biden administration,  ICE has released at least 3,700 inmates. Alarmingly, 1,800 of those  were charged or convicted of crimes including homicide, rape, assault,  child abuse, and more. Secretary Mayorkas recently limited the places  where ICE and CBP can enforce the law. Many Federal law enforcement  officers fear that the Biden administration will further restrict where  they can do their jobs.   If the Federal Government will not enforce the immigration laws, our  State and local law enforcement should be empowered to do so. That is  why today I introduced the Empowering Law Enforcement Act, which grants  inherent authority to State and local officials to enforce our Nation's  immigration laws.   Additionally, my bill will give Federal authorities the flexibility  to extend the amount of time they can detain criminal aliens. If a  State or local law enforcement entity is detaining an alien, this bill  would require Homeland Security to take that illegal alien into custody  upon request from that entity.   The bill ensures that State and local authorities can get reimbursed  for the cost related to the incarceration and transportation of the  alien.   The Empowering Law Enforcement Act is about common sense. If the  Biden administration won't enforce the law, let's empower those who  will. I urge my colleagues to support this practical solution to a very  real and very serious problem.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Ms. Sinema):   S. 1585. A bill to add suicide prevention resources to school  identification cards; considered and passed.
