 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, over the last few days, since the death  of  [[Page S7330]]  President George Herbert Walker Bush, we have heard about his life and  his legacy. It has been, really, a celebration of a life well lived. It  is hard to imagine someone packing more into 94 years than George H. W.  Bush packed into his life. We heard about his time in the Navy, when he  volunteered after Pearl Harbor, became a naval aviator, was shot down,  and was saved by a submarine that popped up and rescued him. We, of  course, know about his devotion to public service, but we also learned  a lot more about his sense of humanity, his humility, his loyalty, and  his optimism.    Sometimes in Washington it seems like the message is all negative,  and I think this has been a delightful contrast, reflecting on his life  and his contribution.   I have said previously, talking about President Bush, that there is  nothing as powerful as a good example. I think his example is one we  all ought to contemplate and perhaps strive to emulate in our own way  and in the way we conduct our business here.   When people disagree with us, it doesn't mean they are bad people;  they are just people with different ideas. We ought to respect one  another enough to actually debate those ideas, rather than engage in  name-calling and denigrating the level of discourse among us because  people watch us too. They watch how we conduct ourselves here, and they  take some cues from that in how they conduct themselves online, in PTA  meetings, in our communities, and in our States.   This has been a delightful week. It has been kind of an emotional and  exhausting week as we have grieved with the Bush family but at the same  time, as I said, celebrating an incredible life.
