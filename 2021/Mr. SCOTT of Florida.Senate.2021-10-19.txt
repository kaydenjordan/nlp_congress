 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  the order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, as if in legislative session,  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate  consideration of S. 2997, which is at the desk. Further, I ask  unanimous consent that the bill be considered read a third time and  passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table.    Madam President, this time last year, we still  didn't know how much longer this pandemic would last. We didn't know  when the vaccine trials would be completed. Thankfully, by December,  the vaccine had been approved and brought normalcy back to the lives of  many Americans. The Trump administration worked with public and private  partners, doctors and scientists across our country to develop a safe  and effective vaccine in record time. It was a feat of science, and it  was an example of what Americans can do when we are working together.   I had COVID, and I am grateful that I was able to get vaccinated. I  hope that all Americans talk with their doctors and consider making the  same decision. It is a personal decision every individual gets to make.   That is not how President Biden sees it. Lately, the Biden  administration has decided to try and take this decision out of the  hands of the American people. With this recently announced  unconstitutional vaccine mandate for private businesses, King Biden  again is saying that government knows best and has taken choice away  from families in Florida and across the country.   That is not what the American people expect government to do.  Government's role is to give Americans all the information and data it  has so they can make the right decision for their individual family.   That is exactly what I did when I was Governor of Florida. In the  face of life-threatening hurricanes, I made sure Florida families were  informed. I went out and made sure everyone knew exactly what to expect  and how dangerous the storm could be, but I didn't issue mandates  because that is not what governments should do.   When I was Governor of Florida, we had the Zika healthcare crisis,  which impacted newborns. Rather than placing mandates on pregnant women  or restricting their travel to areas with local transmission of Zika,  we simply informed Floridians, worked to be as transparent as possible,  and offered free Zika testing to all pregnant women in Florida.   But, again, that is not the approach--that is not the approach--Joe  Biden has decided to take. President Biden has decided that threatening  corporations and businesses and misleading the American people is a  better option.   It is dishonest and authoritarian, and it is no way to lead a nation.  Americans should be free to make choices they feel are in the best  interests of their own health and the health of their loved ones.   In December, President Biden promised he would not require Americans  to be vaccinated or require that they carry vaccine passports. But here  he is, less than 10 months into his Presidency, breaking promise after  promise and going back on his word.   How can the American people believe anything he says? Americans are  sick and tired of the government telling them what to do and are more  than capable of making the right choices to protect themselves, their  family, and their neighbors.   But even as there are some of us in this Chamber who disagree about  national vaccine mandates for private businesses, I wanted to try to  find some common ground. Food stamps, supplemental assistance for  women, infants, and children, and free and reduced lunch programs are  programs run through the U.S. Department of Agriculture and provide  food to hungry families and are some of the most basic of programs our  government provides to those in need.   For kids who are at school and who come from families who are  struggling, I am saying you shouldn't have to be vaccinated in order to  eat. Or for families who have trouble putting enough food on the table,  I am saying you shouldn't have to be vaccinated to get groceries.   I wish--I hoped--my colleague would agree. I offered a simple bill to  say that families who need food stamps and additional support for  women, infants,  [[Page S7051]]  and children shouldn't have to be vaccinated in order to have a full  stomach.   I was a poor kid growing up. My parents struggled to put food on the  table, but my colleague is telling families like mine growing up that  they don't care about their personal choices: If you want to be able to  eat, you have to get a shot.   This is ridiculous. This is un-American. This is an attempt by  President Biden to take over every aspect of your life. I am not going  to stand for it. The American people are not going to stand for it.   I hope every household in America sees what happened on the floor  today.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  the order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I want to talk about two  things as we are waiting for Senator Wyden.   First, I have been hearing all across the State of Florida, people  are really concerned about the Democratic proposal basically to look at  everybody's bank accounts.   The latest is that the proposal will take it from looking at every  $600 transaction or $600 account to $10,000. Well, if you look at it,  almost everybody has a $10,000 account because what they are talking  about is cumulative dollars.   So why does the IRS want to look at everybody's accounts?   It is for one reason. The one reason is to take more dollars out of  somebody's pocket.   We can't let this happen. We have a right to privacy in this country.  We should be able to not have to tell the government everything we buy.  If you want to buy a sofa or anything, you shouldn't have to tell the  Federal Government.   So I completely oppose this significant overreach by the Democrats  trying to look into everybody's bank accounts, because that is exactly  what it would do.                                 Supply Chain    Madam President, the second thing I want to talk about is the supply  chain. We have a significant problem in the supply chain. Not only do  we have a big problem, but if you look at what is going to happen with  regard to the vaccine mandate, it is going to cause even more problems.   My dad was a truck driver. If he had to choose, he would have a tough  choice if he wasn't comfortable, for whatever reason, getting the  vaccine--and I took the vaccine and I had COVID--then he is going to  lose his job, which is going to impact a lot of American families. It  is going to cause the supply chain to be in worse shape, and it is  going to cause even more inflation.   So with President Biden's recently announced unconstitutional vaccine  mandates for private businesses, the President is saying government  knows best and is taking choice away from families all across our  country, but clearly my State of Florida.   That is not what the American people expect government to do. The  government's role is to give people information. Give them the  information and let them make good choices. They will make good  choices.   My parents didn't have much of an education, but they could make good  choices. They figured out what was good for our family.   These decisions should be up to individuals, not government. That's  why I asked consent to pass S. 2997, and, unfortunately, the Senate  Democrats objected. I hope we can find some common ground.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2998    Madam President, I hope everyone here believes you should not have to  receive a vaccine in order to obtain a Social Security check or Social  Security disability check. Forcing families to choose between receiving  Social Security and choosing to get vaccinated is a terrible choice.   That is why I introduced legislation to protect Social Security  recipients and ensure that Biden won't be able to strong-arm them into  compliance with his unconstitutional mandate.   As if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 2998, which is at the  desk. I further ask that the bill be considered read a third time and  passed, and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid  upon the table.    Mr. President, well, clearly I am pretty  shocked. By objecting to this bill, my colleague is suggesting that it  is acceptable for the government to deny Social Security checks to  American seniors and checks to those who are physically disabled  because they have made a personal medical choice to not receive the  vaccine.   This is not farfetched. The Biden administration is already doing it  to companies, and people are out of a job. The Social Security system  is meant to help those who have spent their lives working in this  country, and disability checks are designed to help those who cannot  work. These checks are not a tool for government to impose its will on  the people, just as it shouldn't be the position of the Biden  administration to require companies to enforce the vaccine mandate.   But if you are on Social Security or your parent is receiving Social  Security checks, this is what my colleague is suggesting by blocking  this legislation: Get the vaccine or go broke.   As we all know, prices are going up, and the Social Security  Administration just announced a record cost-of-living increase in  benefits to keep up with Biden's inflation crisis. Individuals  dependent on Social Security still need to get gas and groceries to  survive. By objecting to this simple bill, my colleague is comfortable  offering an ultimatum: Get the vaccine or go broke. It is wrong--it is  wrong to the core--and the American people know it.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 2999    Mr. President, perhaps my colleague may agree with me on a different  point--that vaccine mandates shouldn't be tied to participation in  Medicare, Medicaid, or CHIP. There are more than 60 million Americans  on Medicare and more than 80 million Americans receiving Medicaid or  CHIP assistance. These programs are important for ensuring that our  families, our seniors, and our kids can stay healthy and have access to  a doctor. No one should be deprived of healthcare because they have  chosen not to receive the vaccine. It would be simply unethical to do  so. It seems like pretty common sense.   My proposal would protect individuals on Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP  from any overreaching vaccine mandates, like the President has done  with  [[Page S7052]]  companies, and ensure that a personal medical decision does not strip  them of the access to healthcare they need.   Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 2999,  which is at the desk. I further ask that the bill be considered read a  third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, first of all, let's remember  that the President is requiring a vaccine mandate if you have a job. So  there are people there who are going to lose their job because they,  for whatever reason, are uncomfortable getting the vaccine. So this is  not farfetched.   I thought my colleagues had gone too far by suggesting it would be  acceptable for the government to tie vaccines to Social Security  checks, but this is another level of insanity. My colleague is  comfortable denying healthcare to someone because of their vaccine  status. It is really quite ironic because for the past 10 years, we  have had Democrats falsely claim Republicans want insurance companies  to be able to deny coverage based on preexisting conditions. But here  we have it right here on the Senate floor--Democrats are doing exactly  what they have falsely accused Republicans of. They want to be able to  deny healthcare to Americans who have not received the vaccine.   Does anyone really think that denying healthcare to people who don't  want to get the vaccine for whatever reason is truly in the best  interest of public health? What do you do when someone is a bit  hesitant on the vaccine? And we all have met people like that. For my  Democratic colleagues, the answer is simple: Take away their  healthcare.   Do you need to refill your arthritis prescription? It seems Democrats  want to make sure that pharmacists charge you more unless you get the  shot. Maybe it is time to get your physical. If you have been on  Medicaid, you are left with two options: Either get the shot or go home  because the Democrats don't want you to get your ears checked or your  blood work completed unless you have met their standard of getting the  shot.   Whether you like it or not, some people are not comfortable. It  doesn't matter how poor you are; they are willing to strip you of your  health insurance and take away your ability to get your prescriptions  unless you get the vaccine.   The American people know these choices are wrong, and the fact that  my colleagues stand by their decision I think is outrageous.                      Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3000    Mr. President, now, hopefully, we can get to some common ground. I  think our colleagues disagreed on some of these things, but let's see  if we can find another one they will agree on, and that is access to  housing.   The Department of Housing and Urban Development provides a wide  variety of housing programs meant to help individuals and families in  need of a home and those who are struggling and down on their luck.  They help with everything from loans to first-time home buyers to  homeless shelters and housing assistance. More than 5 million people  currently receive some kind of housing assistance from HUD.   I can't imagine anyone would think that the government should mandate  vaccines for Americans who need to have basic access to housing or be  able to limit, if you don't want to get the vaccine, your access to  housing.   Mr. President, as if in legislative session, I ask unanimous consent  that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 3000,  which is at the desk. I further ask that the bill be considered read a  third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.    Mr. President, well, first off, the Senator  might not know I grew up in public housing, so I do have a little bit  of knowledge about public housing, and we had public housing for my  constituents as Governor of Florida. So I watched my friends struggle  to make do.   Let's all remember that President Biden promised us that he would not  require anybody to get the vaccine or require vaccine mandates, and  that has clearly changed.   So, you know, my parents didn't have much of a formal education, but  they worked hard, and they made the best choices they could with the  information they had, and they focused on the well-being of our family.  So it is baffling to me that my colleague might be willing to tell a  family like mine that a vaccine was a precondition to have a roof over  their head. I am surprised that Senate Democrats are willing to look in  the eyes of struggling families and say: We can't help you unless you  have been vaccinated first--which is actually going on right now when  you are telling people in this country that if you don't get  vaccinated, you lose your job. You will lose your job, so you will not  be able to pay the rent; you will not be able to afford your house; you  will not be able to afford to put food on the table. That is exactly  what is going on. So this is not farfetched.   These HUD programs were not meant to be used to force somebody to get  a vaccine. So I am shocked that my colleague would object.   My colleagues have objected to several proposals. All my proposals  are designed to make sure that there is no government overreach. Why is  this important? Because let's remember, Joe Biden promised he would not  require anybody to get a vaccine, and he went back on that promise. I  don't believe anybody sitting on this floor should ever be in a  position to say that they are OK with somebody not getting in a  government program because they haven't had a vaccine--food assistance,  Social Security, healthcare, or housing, any of them.   Now, look, I want to be clear. I had COVID. I got the vaccine, and I  hope every American will consider getting the vaccine. But it is a  decision that every American gets to make. They should talk to their  doctor and make a decision for their family, and our government should  never be in a position to tell somebody to get a vaccine.   We can't give people an ultimatum to comply with unconstitutional  mandates or go without anything--Social Security, healthcare, housing,  food benefits, or a job--which is going on all across this country  right now. It is a gross overreach by the Federal Government at a time  when we need more information and more compassion, not mandates from an  administration more focused on advancing its socialist agenda than  looking out for every American.   So, unlike Joe Biden and Democrats in Washington, I don't believe the  government knows best. I grew up in a family--and my parents didn't  have much of an education, but they did the best they could for our  family. They worked hard. They made choices to make sure we all stayed  safe. They didn't rely on a government program other than to get  information. They were trying to get good information from the  government and make their own choices.   So with that, I am very disappointed that my colleagues would  disagree.   I yield the floor.
