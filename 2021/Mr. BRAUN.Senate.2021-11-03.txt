 We are here today because of the vaccine mandate. When I  got back home over the break, I never had so many friends and fellow  business owners who actually made it a point to find me and tell me  that this can't be happening.   With the full navigation that we have taken through COVID, I have  always been clear: Take it seriously. We don't know how this is going  to end up.   It has been over a year and a half. The point back in Indiana is that  most businesses, schools, all organizations have put protocols in place  to where it has not been an issue. It has been a nonissue of, really,  transmissions within the workplace.   We finally get through it, we found the rhythm of what works, and now  you have a mandate that says: Hey, Federal employees, Federal  contractors--they contacted me too. Some think they will lose 10 to 25  percent of their workforce. Businesses are in the same place.   When you look at what we have done, where we are, it just does not  make sense. That is why I am leading the Congressional Review Act  effort to try to get all Senators on my side--some on the other side of  the aisle--to say: Hey, we don't need it. Enough is enough.   Look at the practical reasons because businesses and other  organizations have tried and they have been successful at keeping their  employees and their customers safe and healthy. This is coming at a  point in time where it is going to be salt in the wound. It  [[Page S7703]]  will be the biggest wallop these entities have had, especially when we  have been paying them to keep their employees, up to 500 employees. Now  we are going to force them to lose them en masse down to 100. It  doesn't make sense. That is why I am glad I am leading the effort and  glad other Senators are here talking about it.   Please pull back on something that is beyond the pale, that we don't  need, and that is going to hurt the places we have been trying to help.   I yield to the Senator from Florida.
