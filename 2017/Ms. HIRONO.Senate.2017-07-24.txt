 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Madam President, it is unconscionable that the U.S.  Senate will soon be voting on a measure that would force between 22 and  32 million people to lose their health insurance. This vote is  particularly unconscionable when you consider that each Member of this  Chamber has high quality health insurance that will be there whenever  we need it--and we all will, as I recently found out.   I know as well as anyone that we are all one diagnosis away from a  serious illness. When I was diagnosed with kidney cancer not too long  ago, I had the peace of mind of knowing that I was covered and that  insurance would make the cost of treating my illness more manageable.  Many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have found comfort in  having high quality health insurance as they confront serious illnesses  and injuries of their own.   Every American deserves that same peace of mind. That is why I am  fighting for universal healthcare that is a right for every American,  not a privilege reserved only for those who can afford it. This is  something we can and should be working on in a bipartisan fashion.  There are a lot of great ideas we could be debating and considering to  move us toward this bipartisan goal.   Instead, the majority leader and his allies are forcing a vote on  TrumpCare, a mean, ugly bill that will deprive tens of millions of  people across our country of the healthcare they deserve.   Although some have argued over the past week that this vote is doomed  to fail, we can't be complacent. We have to keep fighting because if  TrumpCare becomes the law of the land, it would be devastating for tens  of millions of people across the country, harming the poorest, sickest,  and oldest members of our society. It would undermine protections for  Americans living with serious and chronic conditions, who could face a  reimposition of yearly and lifetime caps on their care. It would impose  an age tax on people 50 to 64 years old, which would allow insurance  companies to charge them up to five times more for insurance because of  their age. I could go on.   For hundreds of thousands of people in Hawaii and tens of millions  more across the country, TrumpCare is not an abstract proposal that  would have no relevance to their lives. I have heard literally from  tens of thousands of people from across Hawaii about the devastating  consequences TrumpCare would have on their lives. Hawaii is a small  State. To think that literally over 20,000 people in Hawaii have  contacted my office to tell me the devastation that TrumpCare will  bring to their lives--this is because insurance is personal. They have  spoken out against this bill loudly and clearly because healthcare is  personal.    Keith Moniz from Maui has a particularly compelling story to tell.  Keith's brother, Lester, after working as a custodian for more than 40  years at St. Anthony School, lost his job and his health insurance.  Only a few short months later, Lester had a debilitating stroke that  left him permanently disabled. Fortunately, Keith's brother was able to  obtain Medicaid coverage and is now a long-term resident at Hale Makua  Health Services on Maui, where nearly 80 percent of all patients and  residents rely on Medicaid to pay for their necessary care.   Keith was very clear about what would happen if TrumpCare succeeded  in making large cuts to Medicaid.   I quote Keith:         It would be devastating. We had a difficult time taking       care of him--    His brother, Lester--         when he was at home, and he's gotten the care that he needs       at Hale Makua. It would be a big loss . . . I don't know what       we would do, where we would be able to move him to.    Alvin, another resident at Hale Makua, was paralyzed in a car  accident in 2006. Alvin lived with his aunt and uncle for a short time  after his accident, but the complexity of his care was too much for  them to handle on their own. Alvin has lived at Hale Makua for almost  11 years now. He gets daily physical therapy and receives the  supportive, life-sustaining care he needs. He would not be able to  afford to live at Hale Makua without support from Medicaid.   When asked, Alvin had a simple message for people in Washington, DC,  who are trying to make huge cuts to Medicaid.   I quote Alvin:         I'm not a politician, but I know that these programs really       help those who are in need. I really hope that they would       take a longer look at it and realize that these are programs       the elderly and disabled need.    People like Lester and Alvin are depending on us to keep up the fight  against this mean, ugly bill until it is defeated for good. As we  contemplate what is next, I hope we can come together across party  lines to stabilize insurance markets and continue our work to provide  universal healthcare for every American.   I should think that each and every one of us who represents some  800,000--well, our entire State. I used to be in the U.S. House. There,  you have districts, and I represented about 800,000 people. Of course,  as a Member of the Senate, I represent the whole State. I should think  that all of us who represent literally the 300 or so million people all  across our country would care about the healthcare of every single one  of our constituents, and TrumpCare is not the way to ensure that.   The fight continues.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Dee Williams,  a fellow in my office, be granted floor privileges for the remainder of  today's session.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Dee Williams,  a fellow in my office, be granted floor privileges for the remainder of  today's session.
