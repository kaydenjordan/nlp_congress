 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of the 230th  anniversary of the settlement of my hometown, New Hartford, New York.   New Hartford was settled in early 1877 by Jedediah Sanger, who was in  search of the American Dream. By 1789, Jedediah had brought his entire  family to New Hartford and built a sawmill and gristmill. The village  began to flourish with farmers who provided New Hartford and the  surrounding communities with fresh produce and a variety of dairy  products.   Today, the town of New Hartford strives to maintain Jedediah Sanger's  original vision and ideas. It is home to numerous retail stores,  restaurants, and churches, while remaining an extremely civic-minded  and generous community.   In fact, our own New Hartford Central School District, my alma mater  and the same school from which my son graduated from 30 years later,  consistently ranks as one of the very best schools in New York State  and among the top public schools in the country.   Fun fact: I actually live across the street from the house I grew up  in, my childhood home, and I now live in a home that I purchased from  our former Congressman, Alexander Pirnie, who once served in this great  Chamber.   Please join me in honoring and celebrating the 230th anniversary of  New Hartford, New York.                            ____________________
