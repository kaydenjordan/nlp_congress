 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.  [[Page H7325]]     Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on  Rules, I call up House Resolution 513 and ask for its immediate  consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 513         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 3697) to       amend the Immigration and Nationality Act with respect to       aliens associated with criminal gangs, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The amendment printed in the report of the       Committee on Rules accompanying this resolution shall be       considered as adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be       considered as read. All points of order against provisions in       the bill, as amended, are waived. The previous question shall       be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any       further amendment thereto, to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on the Judiciary; and (2) one motion       to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 2.  On any legislative day during the period from       September 15, 2017, through September 22, 2017--         (a) the Journal of the proceedings of the previous day       shall be considered as approved; and        (b) the Chair may at any time declare the House adjourned       to meet at a date and time, within the limits of clause 4,       section 5, article I of the Constitution, to be announced by       the Chair in declaring the adjournment.        Sec. 3.  The Speaker may appoint Members to perform the       duties of the Chair for the duration of the period addressed       by section 2 of this resolution as though under clause 8(a)       of rule I.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only,  I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr.  Hastings), pending which I yield myself such time as I may consume.  During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the  purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on House Resolution 513,  currently under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring forward  this rule on behalf of the Rules Committee.   The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 3697, the Criminal Alien  Gang Member Removal Act. Before I discuss the rule, Mr. Speaker, I  would first like to take this opportunity to thank all the first  responders who have been working tirelessly in the wake of Hurricanes  Harvey and Irma, and to send my thoughts and prayers to those who have  suffered loss because of these storms.   Georgia saw much of Hurricane Irma's devastation firsthand, and I  would like to thank the men and women who are responding to the people  in need and rebuilding our communities. I am grateful to all of those  who have played and are playing a part in these recovery efforts.   As someone who is still back home without power, I understand the  need that is going on in Florida all the way up through northeast  Georgia. This is truly a ``from the beach to the highlands'' kind of  issue, and we are continuing to thank our law enforcement, our first  responders, and especially those that work for the power companies and  others getting the utilities back on that we take for granted so many  days. I just want to say thank you to them.   Mr. Speaker, the rule before us today provides for 1 hour of debate  equally divided between the chairman and ranking member of the  Judiciary Committee. The rule also provides for a motion to recommit.   Yesterday, the Rules Committee had the opportunity to hear from two  of my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Johnson from Louisiana  and Ms. Lofgren from California. Much of H.R. 3697 received  consideration by the Judiciary Committee as part of a larger bill, the  Michael Davis, Jr. and Danny Oliver in Honor of State and Local Law  Enforcement Act.   After a lengthy and thorough debate, the Judiciary Committee marked  up and reported favorably that legislation on May 24.   As a cosponsor and strong supporter of the Davis-Oliver Act, I hope  to see that legislation pass before the full House. Today we have an  opportunity to increase public safety by moving an important piece of  that bill forward as H.R. 3697.   I want to recognize Representative Barbara Comstock, my colleague  from Virginia, for introducing the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal  Act. I also want to thank Representative Comstock and this bill's  cosponsors--Chairman Goodlatte, Chairman Sessions, Congressman Peter  King, and Congressman Labrador--for their work on this issue.   From fiscal years 2016 to 2017, ICE agents made over 8,000 gang- related criminal arrests, leading to over 2,600 convictions. America's  families, friends, and neighbors are watching the problem of  transnational gang violence grow, and ICE reports that membership of  these gangs is comprised largely of foreign-born nationals. Many of  these gang members terrorizing our streets are here illegally.   MS-13, in particular, has experienced growth at the expense of  American neighborhoods and public safety. In fact, the Department of  Justice has said that MS-13, which originated in Central America, has  10,000 members in the United States, and 40,000 members worldwide. As  if this wasn't a clear enough threat, the other transnational gangs are  on the rise as well.   Sophisticated gang leaders have recognized that our immigration  system is susceptible to exploitation and have taken advantage. MS-13  violence has hit communities in Boston, New York, Virginia, and  Washington, D.C., particularly hard, but the problem is not limited to  these areas.   In my home State of Georgia, ICE agents recently arrested an  individual who played an active role in a murder in Virginia. In  northern Virginia, at least eight murders have been attributed to MS-13  since last November. This is unacceptable.   While it is not the only step we can take, one major way we can help  to address this problem is to make sure that transnational gang members  who are seeking to bring their tactics to our soil do not exploit our  immigration laws. We need to use all the tools in our toolbox to  address this problem of gang violence, and the underlying bill we are  considering today helps us do that. It recognizes that transnational  gang members have taken advantage of our immigration laws while  addressing existing flaws in our system.   This bill becomes clear that Congress will uphold its duty to protect  the safety of the American people and provide critical tools to law  enforcement.   Importantly, while this bill cracks down on criminal alien gang  members and strengthens our system, it preserves due process and burden  of proof protections. The Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act takes  the commonsense step of ensuring that criminal gang members are  ineligible for asylum, special immigration, juvenile status, and  temporary protected status.   The bill also adds grounds of inadmissibility and deportability for  criminal alien gang members, and it requires that criminal alien gang  members are kept in custody prior to and during the immigration court  proceedings.   Mr. Speaker, under New York City's sanctuary city policy, a criminal  alien who was an admitted gang member was allowed to leave Rikers  Island after serving time for another offense. This was a particularly  egregious case of how flaws in the system are serving gangs, but it  also highlights the clear challenge under existing statutes.    Under current law, the criminal alien's self-admission of gang  affiliation is not reason enough to deport  [[Page H7326]]  that individual. To be deported, the alien has to be convicted of  another independent crime, even if he or she admits to being part of a  gang.   In Houston, two MS-13 members kidnapped three young girls, ultimately  killing one. These individuals, gang members from El Salvador, were in  the United States illegally.   In yet another instance, a sheriff's deputy in Frederick County,  Maryland, was attacked by a known member of MS-13. This is disturbing  on its own, but what makes it even more so is that the gang member had  been previously apprehended and released by Customs and Border Patrol.   For each of the stories I have shared with you today, there is  another that I haven't. The violent and brutal actions of transnational  gangs operating on our soil have led to far too many tragedies as they  prey on our vulnerable neighborhoods, recruit children, and commit  unthinkable crimes.   Mr. Speaker, let me also make it clear that these violent gangs are  targeting immigrant communities. According to the police chief in  Maryland, MS-13 has ratcheted up its extortion of immigrant families  and businesses. The gang threatens not only the individuals in the  United States, but their families back home if these law-abiding  immigrant individuals don't meet the gang's demands.   Concern for our fellow citizens tells us that we should not be  admitting these individuals to our country, and we should be removing  them when they commit crimes or yoke themselves to gangs that  perpetrate violence.   These criminal alien gang members should not be let back onto the  streets to victimize more people while their immigration proceedings  are ongoing, and they shouldn't be allowed to exploit our laws to gain  the benefits reserved for the vulnerable individuals seeking to enter  our Nation.   The Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act makes important strides in  protecting the safety of our citizens and our communities.   Mr. Speaker, we in this House are taking a stand against the  senseless violence and lawlessness and the criminal enterprise that  these gangs bring to our soil. We are strengthening our laws against  transnational gangs and ensuring criminal alien gang members can and  will be removed from this Nation.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as she may  consume to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. Roby).    Mr. Speaker, I would advise my friend from  Florida that I have no more speakers on this side, and I am ready to  close.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I believe today's debate has made this very clear. We  are talking about gang members from some of the most violent gangs in  the world. We are talking about removing members of those gangs that  are in this country and are attempting to come to this country  illegally.   We are a nation of laws. It is our duty to uphold those laws and to  strengthen those laws when necessary. This is a time when it is  necessary.   We are not talking about singling out certain community groups,  religious groups, or law-abiding citizens as someone said on the other  side or would have you believe. We are talking about strengthening and  enforcing our laws against known criminal alien gang members who are  putting our communities at risk and threatening our citizens and legal  residents.   The Federal Government's highest responsibility is to protect the  safety of our Nation and the American people. Cracking down on illegal  criminal alien gang members is one critical way we can do that.   The Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act takes important strides to  better combat gang violence, and I look forward to supporting this rule  and the underlying bill to strengthen public safety and uphold the rule  of law.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time, and I move the previous question on the resolution.
