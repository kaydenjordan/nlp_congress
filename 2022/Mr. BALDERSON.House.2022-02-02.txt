 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my concerns with  H.R. 4521. I want to talk for a moment not about China but about  Licking County, Ohio, and the district I represent.   Licking County, located on the outskirts of Columbus, was cast into  the national spotlight last month when a major U.S. tech company  announced an initial $20 billion investment to build the first phase of  what they plan to grow into the world's largest semiconductor  manufacturing facility. This investment will put Licking County at the  epicenter of a new silicon heartland and at the forefront of addressing  the Nation's semiconductor shortage.   This investment will have an economic ripple effect throughout the  region. Indeed, it will benefit our entire country.   Semiconductor chips are crucial components to products Americans use  every day, including cars, computers, cell phones, and virtually every  electronic device in our homes. Since the early 1990s, the United  States' share of semiconductor manufacturing has fallen from 37 percent  to just 12 percent today. Asian countries now account for more than 70  percent of semiconductor chip manufacturing globally.   The COVID-19 pandemic and its following supply chain disruptions have  brought this issue to the forefront for every American. One concern for  Americans in the market for a new car is the empty lots of dealerships  as automobile production lines wait for chips from Asia.   Failing to address the shortage of semiconductor chips could have  dire consequences for our national security. With production of U.S.  military defense systems dependent upon access to these chips,  overreliance on foreign countries leaves U.S. national security  interests vulnerable, too. We cannot allow ourselves to be held hostage  by the imbalance of foreign chip production.   The United States is not alone. Other countries are waking up to this  reality, too. As I speak, the European Union is developing CHIPS  legislation in an effort to quadruple their production of semiconductor  chips by 2030. Falling further behind in chip manufacturing is a  national security issue that we just can't afford.   I am honored to represent a community that will soon play a leading  role in addressing the global chip shortage and producing these  components vital to our modern economy. I am excited that we have an  opportunity to help grow U.S. manufacturing of chips to epic  proportions with a much-needed investment.   The CHIPS for America Act investment will level the playing field and  let U.S. manufacturers compete in this market. But, once again,  Democrat leadership is doing it the wrong way.   My constituents, and all Americans, were hopeful that the majority  here in Congress had learned from their recent failures about what  happens when these packages become too big, too costly, and too  partisan. The CHIPS Act presents Congress with a golden opportunity to  finally pass a bipartisan, commonsense investment that would bolster  American competitiveness on the world stage. Unfortunately, the CHIPS  Act constitutes a small fraction of the bill's overall price tag, which  is over $300 billion.   Instead, the House Democrats worked behind closed doors with no  Republican input and managed to bury good provisions under a mountain  of unrelated policies that have nothing to do with American  competitiveness.   In their hasty attempt at a partisan victory, the Democrats' bill  funnels $8 billion to the unaccountable U.N. Green Climate Fund, which  has already given $100 million to the Chinese Communist Party.   It pours billions of dollars into offshore climate change resiliency  programs instead of holding China, the world's worst polluter,  accountable for its own destructive emission standards.   It also creates unlimited visas and immigration pathways for Chinese  nationals with STEM degrees. This allows the CCP to handpick which  Chinese nationals apply for visas and opens the door for CCP to use  unlimited visas to encourage espionage and the theft of sensitive  technologies.   It also creates climate change officers within the Foreign Service,  weakening our diplomats' focus on our core national interests.   In an effort to improve this bill, I offered commonsense amendments  to encourage domestic manufacturing of critical products. I also  offered amendments to remove the billions of dollars in partisan  spending for global green new deal programs and shift focus on what  this bill should be about.   Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today is proof House Democrats  learned nothing from their disastrous Build Back Better blunder. Rather  than allowing American economic competitiveness to be a rallying point  for bipartisanship, the majority's all-or-nothing approach makes this  yet another missed opportunity.    If this bill advances to conference committee, I am hopeful that the  conferees will focus on areas of bipartisan, bicameral agreement like  the CHIPS Act. It is past time to bolster this production here at home.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to stop with the messaging bills  and bring a piece of legislation to the floor that can win strong  bipartisan support. Together, we can ensure that the serious business  of American competitiveness gets the careful consideration and support  it deserves.                            ____________________
