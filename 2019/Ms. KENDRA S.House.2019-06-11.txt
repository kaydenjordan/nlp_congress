 HORN of Oklahoma asked and was given permission to  address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)    HORN of Oklahoma. Madam Speaker, I rise today to talk  about an important achievement that changed the world as we know it.   In just over a month, we will celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 mission. On July 20th, 1969, for the first time ever, human  beings walked on the Moon.   Apollo 11 was indeed a giant leap. It inspired and continues to  inspire generations to explore. The discoveries and technology that  come out of America's investment in space not only help us better  understand the universe but fundamentally change our modern life.   Apollo 11 is one of America's greatest achievements, and I am proud  to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, as well as in  both the House and the Senate, on resolutions that commemorate and  celebrate this achievement.   Celebrating the Apollo 11 mission ensures that future generations  will not just remember, but also take us further into space  exploration.   As a lifelong Oklahoman, I also want to acknowledge the unique  contributions of Oklahoma astronauts. In each week leading up to the  Apollo 11 mission celebration, I will highlight Oklahomans who shaped  our knowledge and discovery within space.                            ____________________
