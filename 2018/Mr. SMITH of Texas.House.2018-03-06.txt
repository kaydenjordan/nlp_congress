 Mr. Speaker, the special counsel investigation  has pushed way beyond its authorized purpose.   Recent reports indicate that individuals have been questioned about  President Trump's business activities prior to his entering the 2016  campaign. The private interests of Trump family members also are being  probed.   These lines of investigation clearly violate the scope of the special  counsel, which is limited to: ``. . . any links and/or coordination  between the Russian Government and individuals associated with the  campaign . . .''   In the interest of justice, the investigation must be limited. The  Deputy Attorney General should do so immediately to ensure a fair  process.   A rogue investigation should not be allowed to continue.                            ____________________
