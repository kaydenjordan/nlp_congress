 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Nadler for  yielding, and I thank the sponsor of this bill, Cheri Bustos, for her  hard work.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my strong support for this  bill, H.R. 4445. As a former judge, I have a very deeply held belief  that everybody should have their day in court. It is a simple  principle: Everybody should have their day in court. That is the  essence of ``justice for all'' in our country. Every time we say the  pledge and we end with ``justice for all,'' we have to demonstrate that  we mean it.   Survivors of sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace  deserve to have their voices heard. By ending forced arbitration in  lawsuits involving sexual assault or sexual harassment claims, we  ensure survivors are given a real choice of whether to go to court or  to arbitrate their claim. Abusers will no longer be able to misuse  arbitration law with dubious agreements and fine-print clauses to hide  their violence and silence their victims.   I am proud that we are taking firm, bipartisan action to ensure  justice for sexual harassment and sexual assault victims. I am proud  that we are making sure that when little kids across America say  ``justice for all,'' that it truly means for ``all.''   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4445.
