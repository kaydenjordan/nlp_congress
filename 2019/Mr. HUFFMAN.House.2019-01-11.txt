 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I  rise today in support of this bill to reopen our national parks and end  the Trump shutdown.   Over the last 3 weeks, the conditions in our national parks have  reached unacceptable and unsafe levels as park employees are furloughed  without pay and forced to keep quiet about the ongoing damage.   Here is what some of it looks like: dirty diapers, coffee cups, and  burrito wrappers. That is just the start of what Congresswoman Jackie  Speier and I saw this past weekend as we joined volunteers for a trash  cleanup at the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, which we both  represent. It took only a few minutes for us to fill two 32-gallon  trash cans with waste.   We may soon have enough trash building up in our national parks to  build a wall.   Is that the idea, Mr. Trump? Is that the backup plan, to have our  parks, park visitors, and our professional park staff pay for the wall  you said Mexico would pay for?   Mr. Speaker, the damage from the Trump shutdown does not end there. I  have more than 25 federally recognized Tribes in my district. Each of  those communities faces serious financial insecurity as a result of  this shutdown. I refuse to stand by as Indian Country suffers, as our  national parks suffer, and as millions of Americans suffer, so that  Donald Trump can pretend he is building a medieval border wall.    We need the House and Senate to pass the Interior appropriations  bill. We need the President to sign it to prevent further degradation  of our public  [[Page H494]]  lands and protect the health and safety of Tribal communities.   This government does not belong to Donald Trump. It belongs to the  American people. It is time to reopen the government.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote.
