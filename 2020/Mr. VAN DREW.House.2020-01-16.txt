 Mr. Speaker, today, I recognize Evan Michael Holmes  from Troop 95 in Upper Township on the attainment of his Eagle Scout  rank. Eagle Scout is the highest rank obtainable from the Boy Scouts of  America, and only 4 percent of all boys ever achieve this prestigious  recognition.   Eagle Scouts are more likely to dedicate their life to service, and  his service is very special. He is planning to join the Navy in  February 2020. I was proud of Evan's beautiful Court of Honor that was  celebrated earlier this month, and I congratulate Evan.   Mr. Speaker, we are proud of Evan and look forward to big things in  the future from him. Some of us look for heroes in celebrities--God  help us. Some look for heroes here in Washington--equally, God help us.  But my heroes are individuals, young men like Evan, who do more, who  work harder, and who know what it is to be a true American and a good  person, who really care for and love their families and the people  around them.   Mr. Speaker, I wish Evan the very best, and may God bless him.                            ____________________
