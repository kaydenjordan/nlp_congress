 Mr. Speaker, when the United States military shows up,  kings and kingdoms fall to their knees. As the great philosopher Toby  Keith once said, ``We put a boot in their ass, it's the American way.''  Our military preeminence is unmatched, our brand is dominance. But our  greatness lies in temperance. America first means power under control.   Overzealous executives have wrenched away a precious power bestowed  on this body. I am here to remind them: Congress declares war, not Joe  Biden, not some woke general. Congress, the people, must debate,  decide, and then, if absolutely necessary, declare war.   The Constitution is our compass, not the feelings of some bought-off  military-industrial complex war hawk who uses emotion to justify  America's entry into every overseas conflict. Congress must reclaim our  power to declare war, and if we do declare, we must define what victory  looks like. The sons and daughters of America are too precious to waste  on the altar of globalism.   America first, always and forever.                            ____________________
