 Mr. Speaker, a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic requires  bold investment, and that is what the American Rescue Plan is.   This bill invests $20 billion to get shots in arms and make sure  everyone knows where, when, and how to get a vaccine.   Many students are back in school or are going back soon. California  will get $15 billion to reopen safely and keep schools open to make up  for lost time.   We have also invested in the backbone of our economy: small  businesses. In fact, economists believe this bill can bring us back to  near full employment in about a year.   To ensure local governments can keep providing essential services,  this bill delivers over $259 million to cities and counties in my  district alone.   Finally, this package invests in the American people. Direct  payments, unemployment benefits, tax credits, and healthcare subsidies  will help lift 12 million people out of poverty.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to voting for this bill.                            ____________________
