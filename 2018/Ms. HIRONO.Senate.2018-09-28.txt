 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, these are the remarks I would have given  at this morning's Judiciary Committee markup after the perfunctory and  dismissive way the chairman treated the minority members of the  Judiciary Committee. I walked out in protest. Here are the remarks I  would have given at the committee markup.   I am in disbelief that we are here today voting on Brett Kavanaugh's  nomination to the Supreme Court. Outrageous does not begin to describe  the present circumstances. Yesterday we heard from Dr. Christine Blasey  Ford, who spoke with genuine and raw emotional power about being  sexually assaulted by Brett Kavanaugh. Even though it was more than 30  years ago, her memory of the assault was clear and vivid. This kind of  recall is typical of sexual assault survivors. She was sincere and  authentic. She was 100 percent credible, and I believe her.    By contrast, Brett Kavanaugh came to this committee and refused to  give us straight answers. He would not call for an FBI investigation.  He repeatedly stated that the other people who were at the gathering  where Dr. Ford was attacked had ``rebutted her testimony.'' That is not  true. His alleged accomplice in the attack, Mark Judge, claimed he  didn't remember--a far cry from rebutting her statement. He claimed he  didn't remember, refused to testify, and then went into hiding. Patrick  Smyth and Leland Keyser said they simply don't remember--again, hardly  a rebuttal.   Dr. Ford said yesterday:         I don't expect that P.J. and Leland would remember this       evening. It was a very unremarkable party. It was not one of       their more notorious parties, because nothing remarkable       happened to them that evening.    In fact, even though she doesn't remember, Leland Keyser said she  believes Dr. Ford's account.  [[Page S6369]]    In addition to making misleading statements--which is a pattern with  Judge Kavanaugh--he accused Democratic Senators of coordinating a plot  to sabotage his nomination. Clearly, he was speaking to an audience of  one: President Trump. A nominee for the Supreme Court so rattled that  he would buy into a vast conspiracy theory is astounding and dangerous.  Let's not forget his exact words. Judge Kavanaugh said:         This whole two-week effort has been a calculated and       orchestrated political hit fueled with apparent pent-up anger       about President Trump and the 2016 election, fear that has       been unfairly stoked about my judicial record, revenge on       behalf of the Clintons, and millions of dollars in money from       outside left-wing opposition groups.    With that nakedly political screed, Brett Kavanaugh showed us who he  really is: a partisan political operative with an agenda--the very  worry that kept him from confirmation to the DC Circuit for 3 years.  His own words reinforced a concern that I and many of us here have that  he cannot be a fair and impartial judge.   Setting aside the unvarnished political view--from a potential  Supreme Court Justice, no less--the crux of the matter before us today  is whether Dr. Ford was credible when she said that she is 100 percent  sure that Brett Kavanaugh is the person who sexually assaulted her. On  that issue, Brett Kavanaugh admitted, even without watching her  testimony, that Dr. Ford did not play a part and was not part of any  imagined partisan plot. So what we are left with is his own recognition  that Dr. Ford has no political motive and no reason to lie. I challenge  anyone who watched her testimony to claim that she did not tell us the  truth.   Dr. Ford wasn't the only woman to come forward with an account of  sexual misconduct against the nominee. Two other women have provided  credible accounts that deserve real investigation. But whether it is  one woman or three women, my Republican colleagues are letting nothing  stop them from plowing through to get Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme  Court as soon as possible. Even before the committee had a chance to  hear from Dr. Ford, Chairman Grassley had already scheduled today's  vote.   By voting to support this nominee, Republican colleagues are sending  a message loud and clear: Sexual assault survivors should not come  forward because we are not going to listen to you. They will not be  believed, and their lives will be up-ended in the process. That is  exactly what happened to Dr. Ford.   As far as I am concerned, there was never a serious effort by the  committee to get to the truth. Today's vote signals to the men and boys  in America that you can demean and assault women--especially if you are  in a position of power and influence. There will be no consequences. It  won't even prevent you from becoming a Supreme Court Justice.   Yesterday, accusations flew from the other side of the aisle about  deliberate efforts to make up accusations and undermine Judge  Kavanaugh's nomination, but Democrats didn't need to manufacture  additional reasons to oppose Judge Kavanaugh's nomination. As I have  maintained before, his record demonstrates a pattern of misstating the  facts. He wasn't candid yesterday. He wasn't candid in his testimony to  the committee when he testified at his 2004 and 2006 confirmation  hearings or when he testified at his confirmation hearing for this  nomination in 2018.   I also found his candor lacking in the judicial opinions and legal  arguments he authored. For example, as my colleagues have talked about  in the past, Judge Kavanaugh was not honest with the committee in 2004  and 2006 when asked about matters that he worked on, and his emails  from the White House show that he was not honest about his awareness of  receiving stolen documents from Manny Miranda. In a case I am familiar  with--Rice v. Cayetano--he demonstrated what could only be called a  deliberate misstatement of the facts that he presented to the U.S.  Supreme Court. He had to have known that what he wrote about the  politics and culture of Native Hawaiians was not true. He filed an  amicus brief in that case, and at his hearing a few weeks ago, Judge  Kavanaugh misstated the holdings of Rice and refused to correct his  misstatement when I gave him a chance to clarify.   I will say that I am one of the few people in the Senate who attended  the oral argument in Rice. I know what the Supreme Court based its  decision on, and he totally misstated the Supreme Court's decision.   Advocates for our Native communities are stepping up and taking  notice. The Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement and the Alaska  Federation of Natives issued statements that strongly urge the Senate  to reject the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh. They and other groups  representing indigenous peoples have come forward to explain how Judge  Kavanaugh's views of the rights of indigenous peoples are deeply  flawed. These are the kinds of attitudes that he expressed in his  amicus brief in Rice v. Cayetano.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the following  statements in opposition of Judge Kavanaugh's nomination or that  criticize his views of indigenous people be printed in the Record. They  are from the Department of Hawaiian Home Lands, the Office of Hawaiian  Affairs, and the Alaska Federation of Natives.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    State of Hawaii,                                 Department of Hawaii Home Lands,                                                 September 18, 2018.      Statement of Hawaiian Homes Commission Chairman Jobie           Masagatani on the Nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to Serve           as a Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court         Aloha Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein:       Having reviewed his writings and his statements in public       proceedings, we find that Judge Kavanaugh neglected to       recognize the history of actions by the United States       government that has clearly established a trust       responsibility not only on the part of the United States, but       also the State of Hawaii for the lands that were set aside       under Federal law in 1921 to provide for a permanent homeland       for native Hawaiians (Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920)       and for the betterment of the conditions of native Hawaiians       (Hawaii Admissions Act of 1959).        The Hawaiian Homes Commission Act set aside approximately       203,500 acres of land in what was then a Territory of the       United States, the Territory of Hawaii, to assure that the       indigenous, native people of Hawaii could be returned to       their lands.        In the ensuing years, in the exercise of its constitutional       authority, the U.S. Congress enacted more than 160 Federal       laws designed to address the conditions of native Hawaiians.       Additionally, upon its admission into the Union of States in       1959, the United States and the State of Hawaii agreed that       the provisions of the Constitution of the State of Hawaii       should reflect their respective responsibilities, including       trust responsibilities, for the lands and resources       designated to provide for the betterment of the conditions of       native Hawaiians.        The lands and resources authorized under Federal law to be       reserved for native Hawaiians in 1921 are today administered       by the Hawaiian Homes Commission and the Department of       Hawaiian Home Lands.        Our fiduciary duties and responsibilities to the       beneficiaries of the Hawaiian Homes Commission Act are of       paramount importance to existing and future generations of       the indigenous, native people of Hawaii, to the State of       Hawaii, and to the United States.        We cannot embrace nor endorse the views of those, like       Judge Kavanaugh, who would deny our history, the Federal and       State laws which have been enacted on the foundation of that       history, including the right of the indigenous, native people       of Hawaii to exercise self-determination under Federal law       and policy.                                   ____                                                   State of Hawai`i,                                      Office of Hawaiian Affairs,                                                 September 24, 2018.      Re Nomination of Judge Brett Kavanaugh to the U.S. Supreme           Court.         Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein: The       Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA) greatly appreciates this       opportunity to provide comments regarding the nomination of       Judge Brett Kavanaugh to be an Associate Justice of the       United States Supreme Court. In particular, given that       Supreme Court precedent pertaining to OHA has become the       subject of questions during Judge Kavanaugh's nomination       hearing, our agency is compelled to clarify the record as it       pertains to our organization, our work to better the       conditions of Native Hawaiians, and the rights and status of       our beneficiaries as Indigenous people.        As Judiciary Committee Member Mazie K. Hirono indicated       during Judge Kavanaugh's nomination hearing, Native Hawaiians       are the original, first people of the Hawaiian Archipelago,       who exercised sovereignty for at  [[Page S6370]]       least a thousand years prior to recorded contact with the       Western world. Congress has acknowledged that ``. . . . prior       to the arrival of the first Europeans in 1778, the Native       Hawaiian people lived in a highly organized, self-sufficient,       subsistent social system based on communal land tenure with a       sophisticated language, culture, and religion.'' The Native       Hawaiian people established and maintained the Kingdom of       Hawai`i, first as a united monarchical government, and later       as a constitutional monarchy, at all times under the       leadership of a Native Hawaiian head of state.        Judge Kavanaugh's description of the Rice decision may have       left some Committee Members and observers with another       impression. Senator Hirono asked the nominee about an amicus       brief he submitted in Rice, as well as an op-ed he wrote for       The Wall Street Journal, in which he argued that OHA's very       purpose was inconsistent with the principles and language of       the U.S. Constitution. When asked to explain these views,       Judge Kavanaugh stated that by a vote of 7-2, the majority of       the U.S. Supreme Court had agreed with him, and that the       Court found violations of both the Fourteenth and Fifteenth       Amendments.        This is erroneous.        As stated earlier, the majority's decision was limited to       the manner in which OHA's trustees were elected under the       Fifteenth Amendment. To quote U.S. Supreme Court Justice John       Roberts, then an attorney representing the State of Hawai`i       in the Rice case, ``. . . the majority's opinion was very       narrowly written and expressly did not call into question the       Office of Hawaiian Affairs, the public trust for the benefit       of Hawaiians and native Hawaiians, but only the particular       voting mechanism by which the trustees are selected.'' In       limiting its holding to OHA's means of electing trustees, the       majority chose not to adopt arguments and conclusions made by       then-practicing attorney Brett Kavanaugh, with respect to       OHA's purpose and mission.        The extreme nature of Judge Kavanaugh's arguments, both his       examples and his conclusions, may have played a role in the       majority's failure to incorporate them in Rice. For example,       he compared OHA's mission of serving Hawaii's Indigenous       people to an interracial marriage ban to maintain white       supremacy. He argued that allowing Native Hawaiians to elect       their own trustees to manage their trust ``. . . could usher       in an extraordinary racial patronage and spoils system'' of       national consequence. Little explanation is given as to why       treatment of the Indigenous people of Hawai`i in a manner       similar to the treatment of other Indigenous people in the       United States would have such dramatic consequences. At the       time of his writing, Judge Kavanaugh may not have been       familiar with Congress's clear legislative understanding that       its relationship with Native Hawaiians is based on its       recognition of Native Hawaiians as an Indigenous people and       not based on race.        Through the process of the Committee's review of a portion       of Judge Kavanaugh's writings during his time with the Bush       Administration, we learned that he continued to hold and       advance extreme views against Native Hawaiian rights after       Rice. Disregarding the Court's decision not to adopt his       arguments against the constitutionality of Native Hawaiian       programs, Judge Kavanaugh offered the same arguments as legal       advice when reviewing administration testimony on       legislation. Given his reported acknowledgement of his lack       of exposure to Indigenous people's law, it is concerning that       he has held so tightly to arguments hostile to Native       Hawaiians.        His past actions and the recent nomination hearing leave       OHA with many doubts. We sincerely hope that if a case       concerning Native Hawaiian rights comes before Judge       Kavanaugh's court, be it the D.C. Circuit or the U.S. Supreme       Court, he will look more closely at the facts before the       court. Facts that include the actions that Congress, the       Executive, and the State of Hawai`i have all taken, within       the framework of the U.S. Constitution, in recognizing the       unique status of Native Hawaiians. During his hearing, Judge       Kavanaugh acknowledged Congress's ``substantial'' authority       to deal with matters concerning Native people, though he       offered few specifics beyond that statement. Judge Kavanaugh       may find it interesting that in the years following Rice,       Congress and the Executive have continued to pass legislation       and establish programs to benefit Native Hawaiians, regularly       with the acknowledgement of the legal and political       relationship OHA has articulated throughout this letter.        In closing, OHA hopes that this letter has brought some       clarity to questions raised as part of the process of       considering Judge Kavanaugh's nomination. OHA hopes that the       Committee understands the need we feel to clarify the record       about Rice, and to address certain arguments espoused by       Judge Kavanaugh prior to his taking the bench, which are not       only inaccurate, but threaten the rights and resources of the       beneficiaries that OHA exists to serve. Until and unless       Judge Kavanaugh is able to correct the aforementioned       misunderstandings and misconceptions, should a case involving       the rights or political status of Native Hawaiians come       before him, perhaps a recusal would be in order. Finally, OHA       wishes to bring to the Committee's attention concerns voiced       by American Indian and Alaska Native groups, who share our       concerns with Judge Kavanaugh's record on Native law.            Sincerely,                                                Colette Y. Machado,      OHA Board of Trustees Chair.                                   ____                   [From the Alaska Federation of Natives]                     AFN Opposes Kavanaugh Appointment         The Alaska Federation of Natives is the oldest and largest       Native organization in Alaska. Our membership includes 186       federally recognized Indian tribes, 177 for-profit village       corporations, 12 for-profit regional corporations, 12 not-      for-profit regional organizations, and a number of tribal       consortia that compact and contract to run federal and state       programs. For over 50 years, AFN has been the principal forum       and voice for Alaska Natives in addressing critical issues of       law and policy, including the nomination of U S. Supreme       Court justices.        The federal judicial appointment and confirmation process       is designed to thoroughly vet nominees. As such, we did not       immediately weigh in on President Trump's choice to replace       retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. However, the questions and       colloquies that came out of Judge Brett Kavanaugh's Senate       Judiciary hearings last week has necessitated us taking a       position. AFN joins our colleagues and friends across Indian       country in strongly opposing Judge Kavanaugh for the Supreme       Court because of, among other things, his views on the rights       of Native peoples.        Judge Kavanaugh's Position on the Indian Commerce Clause is       Erroneous. Congress' plenary power over Indian affairs is       grounded in the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The       clause gives the Congress the power to ``regulate commerce       with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with       the Indian tribes.'' Judge Kavanaugh concedes this point.       However, like Justice Clarence Thomas--the most senior       justice on the Supreme Court, he challenges the clause's       application to affairs beyond trade. This impacts Alaska       Native tribes, corporations, organizations and consortia       because their dealings with Congress presently extends to a       host of federal programs concerning their members, resources       and governments.        In the 2013 Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl decision, Justice       Thomas contested Congress' authority to enact the Indian       Child Welfare Act, reasoning the Indian Commerce Clause only       provides federal authority over Indian trade. Because most       federal laws concerning Indians lack a nexus to Justice       Thomas's narrow definition of trade, they would unlikely       survive the scrutiny he urges. The result would be a       wholesale reshaping of the body of law and policy that has       governed Indian affairs for the past century and a half.        Legal observers tracking Judge Kavanaugh believe he is       further to the right than Chief Justice John Roberts. Thus,       he may agree with Justice Thomas that Congress only has       plenary power to regulate direct commerce with Indian tribes,       nothing more. Confirming a nominee with this viewpoint would       be disastrous for Alaska, and would roll back the gains of       self-determination and usher back in the losses of       termination.        Judge Kavanaugh's View of the Special Trust Responsibility       is Misguided. The federal government has a special trust       relationship with federally recognized Indian tribes. The       relationship commands the highest moral and legal       obligations, and is rooted in early federal-tribal treaties,       the U.S. Constitution, federal statutes, and opinions of the       U.S. Supreme Court. Judge Kavanaugh's writings demonstrate a       limited view of the federal government's power to deal with       Native peoples under this relationship. Specifically, he       would only extend the special trust relationship to Indian       tribes that have with his preferred history of federal       dealings, including territorial removal and isolation. This,       too, impacts Alaska since Alaska Native have a unique federal       experience and few reservations were established.        During his Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Judge       Cavanaugh questioned the legitimacy of Native Hawaiian       recognition, citing their different treatment by the federal       government, and the fact that they do not live on       reservations or enclaves. If he remains of the view that the       special trust relationship only extends to Indian tribes with       his brand of federal history, including territorial removal       and isolation, he could very well rule that Congress lacks       the authority to deal with Alaska Natives. This thinking       could overturn much, if not all, of the Alaska Native Claims       Settlement Act, as well as all other federal legislation and       regulations addressing Alaska Natives, tribes, corporations       and organizations. To confirm a nominee who does not       understand or appreciate the position of Native Hawaiians,       and who could weaken the special trust relationship Alaska       Natives share with the federal government, would be       imprudent.        Judge Kavanaugh's Assessment of the Political       Classification Doctrine is Troubling. The political       classification doctrine announced in the 1974 Morton v.       Mancari decision, that focusses on and Indian person's       membership in a federally recognized tribe rather than his or       her ancestry to avoid strict scrutiny review of federal       legislation and regulation that benefits Indians, would be       extremely vulnerable if Judge Kavanaugh were to ascend to the       Court. For the reasons outlined above, he would likely align       himself with Justice Thomas on the issue, and the two of them       would likely work to persuade their fellow justices that the       relationship between an Indian person's status politically       and their race is open for interpretation. Judge Kavanaugh       does not accept this well-  [[Page S6371]]       established legal doctrine. Confirming a nominee who is       unable to grasp the necessity of federal programs based on       the political classification doctrine, and articulate why       they must be protected, would be unwise.        AFN strongly urges the U.S. Senate to vote against Judge       Kavanaugh. The documents that have been released so far in       relation to his nomination demonstrate how troubling his       confirmation would be for Native peoples, particularly Alaska       Natives and Native Hawaiians.     It is deeply troubling to have a Supreme Court nominee  for a lifetime position who isn't candid with us about the facts or  straight with us about the law.   In Garza v. Hargan, he did it again. In that 2017 case, he wrote a  dissent in which he misapplied the law and treated the case as if it  were about parental consent. It was not. The case, which was about  whether a 17-year-old undocumented young woman could be released from  immigration custody to have an abortion, did not involve the question  of parental consent. But he sat there at his nomination hearing, and  when I asked him about it, he said that was a case involving parental  consent--a total misstatement of the issue in the case. In that case,  this young woman had already received a proper judicial bypass from a  Texas judge that allowed her to make her own decisions. So that had  nothing to do with having to require parental consent; she had already  overcome that. But that wasn't good enough for Judge Kavanaugh. He  inserted his own views about legal issues not even present in the case.  This is just one example of his outcome-driven approach to important  cases before him.   At the hearing, I also asked him about the pattern that was revealed  in his numerous dissents. In several of those cases, his own colleagues  called him out for misrepresenting the facts and the law. Just last  year, in United States v. Anthem, the majority said that Judge  Kavanaugh ``applies the law as he wishes it were, not as it currently  is.'' In a 2008 case, Agri Processor v. NLRB, the majority wrote that  Judge Kavanaugh's dissent ``creates its own rule.'' Instead of  following Supreme Court rules, they said that Judge Kavanaugh's dissent  abandons the text of the applicable law altogether. It is pretty  telling when your own colleagues on the court feel so strongly about  your dissent that they will actually call you out on it.   When this nomination first came to the Senate, I was skeptical. I  said that if the President's nominee to the Supreme Court is anything  like the nominees he has been sending to the lower Federal courts, I  expect we will see a nominee handpicked by the Federalist Society and  the Heritage Foundation intent on carrying out their rightwing ideology  supported by the President. It turned out to be much worse than I  imagined. Not only was the nominee someone who fit that description; it  became clear that he was someone who lacked candor, credibility, and  character. This has been displayed at every turn.   After hearing from Dr. Ford and Brett Kavanaugh yesterday, the  editors of America Magazine--a well-respected Jesuit weekly--withdrew.  They originally endorsed Judge Kavanaugh. This group withdrew their  endorsement of Judge Kavanaugh. They said:         While we previously endorsed the nomination of Judge       Kavanaugh on the basis of his legal credentials and his       reputation as a committed textualist, it is now clear that       the nomination should be withdrawn.        If Senate Republicans proceed with his nomination, they       will be prioritizing policy aims over a woman's report of an       assault.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a portion of a copy of  this article be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From America Magazine, Sept. 27, 2018]    The Editors: It Is Time for the Kavanaugh Nomination To Be Withdrawn                              (By The Editors)         Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony before the Senate       Judiciary Committee today clearly demonstrated both the       seriousness of her allegation of assault by Judge Brett M.       Kavanaugh and the stakes of this question for the whole       country. Judge Kavanaugh denied the accusation and emphasized       in his testimony that the opposition of Democratic senators       to his nomination and their consequent willingness to attack       him was established long before Dr. Blasey's allegation was       known.        Evaluating the credibility of these competing accounts is a       question about which people of good will can and do disagree.       The editors of this review have no special insight into who       is telling the truth. If Dr. Blasey's allegation is true, the       assault and Judge Kavanaugh's denial of it mean that he       should not be seated on the U.S. Supreme Court. But even if       the credibility of the allegation has not been established       beyond a reasonable doubt and even if further investigation       is warranted to determine its validity or clear Judge       Kavanaugh's name, we recognize that this nomination is no       longer in the best interests of the country. While we       previously endorsed the nomination of Judge Kavanaugh on the       basis of his legal credentials and his reputation as a       committed textualist, it is now clear that the nomination       should be withdrawn.     In addition, Robert Carlson, president of the American  Bar Association, the ABA, issued a letter urging the Judiciary  Committee of the Senate to not vote on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination  until there is an FBI investigation into Dr. Ford's account of sexual  assault. The ABA explained that ``deciding to proceed without  conducting an additional investigation would not only have a lasting  impact on the Senate's reputation, but it will also negatively affect  the great trust necessary for the American people to have in the  Supreme Court.''   I agree. Brett Kavanaugh does not have the credibility, candor,  character, or, I would say, as we saw yesterday, the temperament to be  on the Supreme Court. His presence on the Court under this kind of  cloud will weaken the Court. I cannot support this nomination.   I would like to end the remarks I would have given at the markup but  am giving on the floor now. I would like to say that my colleague  Senator Jeff Flake has said that he would not be able to vote on the  confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh without an FBI investigation into the  current allegations. I support that. I have no idea whether the  Republican leadership is going to allow a timeout for that kind of  investigation to occur--an investigation that I and other Democratic  members of the Judiciary Committee have been calling for, for what  seems like months.   Of course, I would want an FBI investigation to be thorough. I do not  want some kind of a peripheral investigation to give cover to Senators  who are wavering. I would want an investigation by the FBI to be  thorough, to be real, to provide us with the kind of information that  we need to make a determination as to the credibility, candor, and  character of Judge Kavanaugh.   I yield the floor.
