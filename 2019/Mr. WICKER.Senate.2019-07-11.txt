 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in  morning business.    Madam President, I call to the Senators' attention today  a disturbing article in the June 29, 2019, issue of The Economist, on  pages 36 and 37. It is about the military buildup in China and the way  it affects the United States. It says:         Xi Jinping wants China's armed forces to be ``world class''       by 2050. He has done more to achieve this than any of his       predecessors.    I will quote from the lead of this article in The Economist.         Over the past decade, the People's Liberation Army (PLA)       has been lavished with money and arms. China's military       spending rose by 83 percent in real terms between 2009 and       2018, by far the largest growth spurt in any big country. The       splurge has enabled China to deploy precision missiles and       anti-satellite weapons that challenge American supremacy in       the western Pacific. China's leader, Xi Jinping, says his       ``Chinese dream'' includes a ``dream of a strong armed       forces''. That, he says, involves ``modernising'' the PLA by       2035 and making it ``world-class''--in other words, America-      beating--by mid-century. He has been making a lot of       progress.    In the second column of this article, it goes on to say:         He has done more in the past three years to reform the PLA       than any leader since Deng Xiaoping.    This quote is not from some advocate of defense spending but is from  one of the leading publications, The Economist.   I say to my colleagues, we need to be mindful of the threat that is  arising to the United States from around the globe--not only from  China, as I have just read, but also from Vladimir Putin's Russia, from  Iran, and from international terrorism. There is a deteriorating  security situation in almost every sector of the globe. The fact that  the United States has always been super supreme and able to defend the  free peoples of this world is being challenged. We can no longer assume  that any war would never be a fair fight. That has been the goal of the  United States if we have to go to war. And we want to avoid war. But  the best way, in our judgment, as a national strategy down through the  decades, to avoid conflict of any kind is to make sure that if America  ever gets in a fight, it will not be a fair fight; it will be a fight  where we have overwhelming superiority, so no one will dare challenge  the sea lanes and the freedom that we stand for in the United States of  America. That is being challenged today.   I would submit to you that it is a good time for the United States to  point out that we passed the National Defense Authorization Act--the  NDAA--on a huge bipartisan basis. It was 80-something votes to 8. It is  just unbelievable, the way we came together under the leadership of  Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Reed, his Democratic counterpart,  working together as professionals, as legislators, and as Americans to  send a strong statement that we need to go from the $700 billion that  was spent last fiscal year to $750 billion to give our troops the pay  raise they need, to recognize the sacrifice they have made, and to give  our military--the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines--the tools they  need, the equipment they need, and the innovation and manufacturing  they need to get us where we need to go.   We went through a 7- or 8-year period when--we ought to all be  ashamed because our fingerprints are all on it, those of us who were in  office at the time. The distinguished Presiding Officer was not a  Member of the Senate at that time, but those of us who were, we got our  fingerprints on it, Republicans and Democrats. Somehow, try though we  might, say what we might, we were unable to prevent sequestration from  happening--an unthinkable result. The military branches couldn't  believe this was happening and couldn't believe Congress would be so  irresponsible, but somehow we were.   We have righted the ship over the past 2 years. It would be  unthinkable to me, my fellow Americans, after making the progress to  get back on the right track and return to responsible defense spending  and responsible stewardship of our national security, if somehow we  heeded some voices we have been hearing in Washington, DC, and around  the country during the past few days about a continuing resolution,  perhaps--maybe a continuing resolution of an entire year. The thinking  there is, well, we just do a continuing resolution, and that will  amount to level spending, and we can live with that.   I just left a hearing on the confirmation of GEN Mark Milley as the  next, I hope, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and I asked him  about that. Would a continuing resolution simply be level spending, and  might we be able to live with that? And he absolutely made the point  which we all know if we study the law. It is way more than level  spending. It stops innovation. It stops the new starts. It stops  everything that we planned in the NDAA, which we passed with an  overwhelming bipartisan vote, and it makes it against the law for the  shipbuilders to do anything new and for the people working on our next- generation aircraft to do anything new. It stops them in their tracks.  It creates uncertainty in every branch of the military. And then we  have to pay millions and billions to get back going again. It is an  unthinkable result. Surely we can avoid that as Republicans and  Democrats.   Let me quote now-retired Secretary Mattis. When he was asked about  this very subject on a recent occasion, Secretary Mattis said this:         I cannot overstate the impact to our troops' morale from       all this uncertainty. The combination of rapidly changing       technology, the negative impact on military readiness       resulting from the longest continuous stretch of combat in       our Nation's history, and insufficient funding have created       an overstretched and under-resourced military.    According to Secretary Mattis, ``Under continuing resolutions, we  actually lose ground.''   We need a budget deal. We need a 2-year budget deal, as we have had in the past. Give our defense  leaders, the Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries, as well as the ones  who put on the uniform and agreed, for a career, to put themselves in  harm's way--give them the certainty they need in order to defend  against the threats The Economist talked about and the threats General  Mattis talked about. Give them that certainty.   A new CR--a continuing resolution--would prevent us from having that  certainty. It would delay maintenance for the Harry S. Truman aircraft  carrier. It would prevent a guided missile frigate program we already  authorized from even starting. This would happen September 30 if we go  to a continuing resolution. It would cripple research and development,  and it would prevent the Pentagon from aligning its funding with  upcoming priorities.   We need to realize a fact of life around here. I didn't exactly get  my way in the election last November. If I had my druthers, the House  of Representatives would have remained in Republican hands, with a  Republican Speaker and a Republican Chair. The voters, in their wisdom,  decided to vote for divided government last November.   Our team was elected to continue leadership in the U.S. Senate. The  Democratic team was elected to leadership in the House of  Representatives. And I can assure you, if I were writing a defense  appropriations bill, which is half of discretionary spending, and all  of the other appropriations bills, which is so-called nondefense  discretionary, it would look far different from the bill  [[Page S4783]]  Speaker Nancy Pelosi proposes to write. I can assure you that it would  look different and that we would have less domestic spending. But the  fact of life is that Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, is the one  who guides legislation here in the Senate, and Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat  from California, is the one who guides legislation on the floor of the  House of Representatives, and if we get a bill passed, we are going to  have to get a compromise bill passed. If anybody within the sound of my  voice doesn't realize this, they don't understand government. They  don't understand the dynamics that have taken place since Philadelphia  in 1776 and Philadelphia again in 1787, where give-and-take had to  occur, but we moved things along for the greater good.   We can come to an agreement, or we can show ourselves to Vladimir  Putin's Russia as unable to govern adequately, and we can show  ourselves to Xi Jinping's China as unable to make the tough decisions  to protect Americans. We have that choice, and we have a willingness on  this side of the aisle and on the other side of the aisle. I was with  some of my Democratic and Republican friends from the other body just  yesterday. I think there is the willingness there. We are going to have  to have an agreement that the administration will sign on to because  the President's signature has to be affixed to this.   Now is the time--July 11, 2019--to get this decision made, before we  leave for August. I would hope we wouldn't leave for August until we  get that number agreed to. We come back after Labor Day, and then it is  brinksmanship, and then suddenly it is shutdown city, and that is being  threatened. Russia knows this, the Iranian leadership knows this, and  China knows this. Let's do it now.   So I call on the Democratic and Republican leadership in the House, I  call on our leadership, and I call on our President to get down to  business in the next few days. Let's go ahead and make this decision  that we know will eventually have to be made, make a responsible  decision and send a message to the rest of the world that we intend to  take care of our security.   I yield the floor.
