 Mr. President, reserving the right to be object, I am  glad to be here today. I think it is important for us to have this  debate. This is a debate. People on the other side of the aisle say it  is not one.   I heard my colleague from Ohio talking earlier about slogans,  slogans, slogans. This is all about slogans.   I cannot believe the degree to which the accomplishments by the  Ukrainian people are being diminished on this floor or being diminished  in this debate. It is absolutely disgraceful.   They are this close to winning this war. There is a freeze today on  the battlefield, on the frontline, in part, because Putin knows exactly  what is going on here. He knows about the debate that is going on here.  He knows, my colleagues, that he is losing on the battlefield. He  understands that. NATO understands that. Xi Jinping understands that.  He knows that.   He is losing on the battlefield. He is counting on winning on Capitol  Hill. He is counting on winning on this battlefield. Let me tell you  something. This isn't about slogans.   Let's talk about what Ukraine has done over the last 2 years. I  haven't heard anybody talk about that in this discussion or this  debate. I hope my colleagues on the other side are listening because  you will not hear, in your lifetime, a list of greater courage or  sacrifice than what you will hear from Ukrainians, and it is not  slogans.   They defeated and reversed the Russian attack on Kyiv--which, by the  way, Kyiv was supposed to fall in 72 hours. They reversed that. They  forced Russia to retreat from Chernihiv and Sumy. They won the battle  of Kharkiv. They took back Kherson. They took back Snake Island.   Ukraine has taken back more than half--more than half--of the land  that Russia took from them in this invasion, colleagues, more than  half. Nobody 2 years ago would have predicted that. Everybody would  have said Putin would never relinquish that land.   They almost singlehandedly restarted commercial grain trade with Asia  and Africa. Why does that matter? That matters so that the whole rest  of the world can be fed, so they will stay in the fight that we have  led that no other country can lead but the United States of America,  even though my colleagues on the other side have gotten tired.   Last month--read it. Look it up. I will put it in the Record. There  was an amazing article over the weekend about this in the New York  Times, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                  [From the New York Times, Nov. 12, 2023]         How Ukraine, With No Warships, Is Thwarting Russia's Navy         In a small, hidden office in the port city of Odesa, the       commander of the Ukrainian Navy keeps two trophies       representing successes in the Black Sea.        One is the lid from the missile tube used in April 2022 to       sink the flagship of the Russian Black Sea Fleet, the Moskva,       a devastating blow that helped chase Russian warships from       the Ukrainian coast. On the lid is a painting of a Ukrainian       soldier raising his middle finger to the ship as it bursts       into flames.        The other is a key used to arm a British-made Storm Shadow       missile that slammed into the headquarters of the Russian       fleet in Sevastopol on the Crimean Peninsula.        We dreamed of making a beautiful recreation park for       children in this place, to take away the center of evil that       is there now,'' said Vice Adm. Oleksiy Neizhpapa, the       Ukrainian naval commander.        He held the key in his hand, and although his eyes were       tired, he said there was nothing to do but fight.        ``Sevastopol is my hometown,'' he said. ``For me, it is my       small homeland, where I was born, where my children were       born. So, of course, I dream that the time will come,       hopefully soon, that we will return to our naval base in       Sevastopol.''        Despite having no warships of its own, Ukraine has over the       course of the war shifted the balance of power in the naval       conflict. Its use of unmanned maritime drones and growing       arsenal of long-range anti-ship missiles--along with critical       surveillance provided by Western allies and targeted assaults       by Ukraine's Air Force and special operations forces--have       allowed Ukraine to blunt the advantages of the vastly more       powerful Russian Navy.        ``At this point, the Russian Black Sea Fleet is primarily       what naval strategists term `a fleet in being': It represents       a potential threat that needs to be vigilantly guarded       against, but one that remains in check for now,'' said Scott       Savitz, a senior engineer at the RAND Corporation, a       federally financed center that conducts research for the       United States military. ``Remarkably, Ukraine has achieved       all this without a substantial fleet of its own.''        Admiral Neizhpapa cautioned that Ukraine remains vastly       outgunned on the Black Sea. It lacks the battlecruisers,       destroyers, frigates and submarines that populate the Russian       fleet. Russian planes still dominate the skies above the sea,       and Russia still uses its fleet to launch long-range missiles       at Ukrainian towns and cities, threatening armed forces and       civilians alike.        On Wednesday, a missile struck a commercial ship pulling       into the port of Odesa, killing the pilot and wounding three       crew members. It was the first civilian vessel hit since       shipping to Odesa resumed in late August.        The Russia Navy also dominates the Sea of Azov, a body of       water connected to the Black Sea by the narrow Strait of       Kerch, and is increasingly using Azov ports in the occupied       cities of Mariupol and Berdiansk to help alleviate logistical       challenges on land.        Ukraine has nevertheless managed to negate some of those       advantages and lately has gone on the offensive. Over the       last two months, it has launched both stealthy nighttime       operations by small units on jet skis and powerful missile       strikes. Those strikes have hit not just the Sevastopol       headquarters but also a Kilo-class submarine and a       shipbuilding plant in eastern Crimea, an attack that damaged       a new missile-carrying Russian warship.        The latter strike ``will likely cause Russia to consider       relocating farther from the front line,'' the British       military intelligence agency reported on Wednesday.        Ukrainian officials also said that the Russian strike on a       civilian ship as it pulled into port in Odesa would not stop       the shipping. About 100 cargo vessels carrying more than 3.3       million tons of agricultural and metal products have made the       journey in a little over two months, according to Western and       Ukrainian officials.        Even as forward movement on the ground has largely       shuddered to a halt, with neither Russian nor Ukrainian       forces able to break through heavily fortified lines, Ukraine       has effectively turned around 10,000 square miles in the       western Black Sea off its southern coast into what the       military calls a ``gray zone'' where neither side can sail       without the threat of attack.        And Admiral Neizhpapa stressed that Ukraine's combined       armed forces and its security services were all playing       integral roles in the battle of the Black Sea.        James Heappey, Britain's armed forces minister, told a       recent security conference in Warsaw that Russia's Black Sea       fleet had suffered a ``functional defeat'' and contended that       the liberation of Ukraine's coastal waters in the Black Sea       was ``every bit as important'' as the successful       counteroffensives on land in Kherson and Kharkiv last year.        The war at sea has also demonstrated the impact of emerging       technologies, transforming long-held theories about naval       warfare in ways that are being studied around the world,       perhaps nowhere more closely than in China and Taiwan.        The classical approach that we studied at military maritime       academies does not work now,'' Admiral Neizhpapa said.       Therefore, we have to be as flexible as possible and change       approaches to planning and implementing work as much as       possible.''  [[Page S5490]]         For example, he said, it takes years to develop and build       warships and more time to update them to meet new challenges.       Yet maritime drones are evolving every month.        Admiral Neizhpapa acknowledged that Russian air superiority       over the Black Sea is a problem and has stressed the value       that F-16 fighter jets would bring to Ukraine's naval war.       The United States has pledged F-16s, but Ukrainian officials       have said they are unlikely to be seen in Ukrainian skies       before next summer.        Russia's main response to setbacks at sea has been a       relentless bombing campaign aimed at crippling Ukrainian port       infrastructure and punishing the people of Odesa. In recent       weeks, its naval aircraft have been dropping ``mine-like       objects'' in the shipping lanes from Odesa, the admiral said,       but shipping has not stopped.        ``Of course, they want to stop our initiative by all       means,'' he said. ``But we believe that they will not       succeed.''        While much attention over the past 20 months has focused on       the land war, Europe's largest since World War II, a desire       to control the Black Sea was a key factor in President       Vladimir V Putin's decision to invade Ukraine. In 2014, when       Russia illegally annexed Crimea, Ukraine lost nearly all of       its ships; about 5,000 of its sailors defected, cutting the       size of its navy by two-thirds.        Despite Ukraine's recent intensified assaults, Crimea still       functions like a huge aircraft carrier parked off Ukraine's       southern coast. It is a critical logistics hub for Russian       occupation forces in the south, a base for Russian fighter       jets and attack helicopters, and a platform to launch missile       and drone strikes across Ukraine.        Admiral Neizhpapa is fond of citing an adage of Alfred       Thayer Mahan, the famed American naval officer and historian:       ``A nation must defend its own coast starting from the coast       of the enemy.''        For the admiral, who left the peninsula in 2014 with other       sailors who remained loyal to Ukraine that means taking the       war to Crimea.        Russia, however, is also adapting and bolstering its       defenses.        What we did a year ago is no longer working or is not       working as effectively,'' Admiral Neizhpapa said. ``We have       to be flexible and change our tactics.''        Ukraine must not only innovate, he said, but also deploy       new weapons quickly. Ukraine has unveiled several iterations       of uncrewed surface vessels, and officials recently offered a       glimpse of what they said was Ukraine's first unmanned       underwater vehicle.        Christened Marichka and measuring about 20 feet from bow to       stern, the vessel can travel beneath the surface of the waves       for more than 600 miles, although the size of its payload has       not been made public and there is no evidence that it has       been used in combat.        About two dozen Russian ships and one submarine have been       damaged or destroyed since Russia launched its full-scale       invasion, Admiral Neizhpapa said. Oryx, a military analysis       site that counts only losses that it has visually confirmed,       has documented at least 16 damaged or destroyed ships.        Standing in front of a classified chart that lists damage       done to Russian vessels, Admiral Neizhpapa said he had no       time for what he called ``wishful sinking''--any exaggeration       of what Ukraine has achieved.        There are still scores of powerful Russian warships that       Ukraine wants to take off the board. On Friday, Ukraine's       intelligence agency released a video of a naval drone attack       on two ships that it said played an important role in the       layered air defenses that protect Russia's fleet. The extent       of the damage was not clear.        ``The enemy also learns very quickly, and he also makes his       own conclusions, counteracting our actions,'' Admiral       Neizhpapa said. ``The war at sea can only be won with new       solutions that must be implemented as quickly as possible.''     Mr. President, they largely neutralized the Black Sea  Fleet. They don't even have a real navy. They don't have a navy.  Through their dedication and through their imagination and their  willingness to sacrifice, they have managed to neutralize the Black Sea  Fleet.   There is nobody who thought they could do this. This is all while  Russians outnumber Ukrainians 3 to 1 on the battlefield.   I heard from my colleagues, how much more American lives, how much  more American treasure? There is not an American losing their life. The  Ukrainians are losing their lives in the name of democracy.   In total, Ukrainians have killed 300,000 Russian fighters. Thank you,  Ukraine, for doing the work that NATO has not been asked to do, that  the United States has not been asked to do.   Putin knows he is losing this war in Ukraine. The only question that  he has is, is he going to win the war here in the U.S. Congress? Who is  going to lose Ukraine?   And the people who are here today saying this is not a lesson from  World War II; this is a lesson from World War I, these are the people  who are going to lose Ukraine.   Do we have any right to be fatigued, colleagues, when we haven't lost  100,000 people, when all we are being asked to do is manufacture the  weapons that Ukraine is using on this battlefield, putting American  people to work to support Ukraine and democracy? That is what we are  being asked to do. Can we possibly be fatigued at this moment?   I suppose we could be having a very different debate if Ukraine  hadn't been as successful as they have been, but they have been  successful. What we know is, if we roll over now for Vladimir Putin, if  we stop providing Ukraine with their weapons--and they are out of  bullets. They are out of bullets as we stand here today. They have $1  billion left. If we stop providing them with resources, if we stop  providing them with the intelligence that we provided them, they are  going to lose this war. President Zelenskyy came here and told you that  we will win this war if you stick with us; we will lose this war if you  abandon us.   We cannot abandon Ukraine at this moment.   I know I have other colleagues on the floor who need to speak today.  I am glad this has been recorded for history. I am glad today's debate  has been recorded for history because when they ask who lost this war  to Vladimir Putin, it is not going to be a question of rhetoric or  debate points; it is going to be a question of a war that we were  actually on the verge of winning and a war that we walked away from and  lost with repercussions to every single corner of this world, including  where Xi Jinping is sitting right now in Beijing. And don't forget  about it. Don't forget about it.   I yield the floor.
