 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of a longtime  central New York ovarian cancer advocate, Mary Gosek, who recently lost  her own tremendous battle with the horrible disease.   Through her work as president of the Oswego Chapter of Hope for  Heather, Mary devoted countless hours to educating women and men  throughout our community on the symptoms and causes of ovarian cancer.  Her great passion for finding a cure inspired many and gave hope to  those who were suffering.   Mary's strength and determination was most visible in her efforts to  raise awareness for ovarian cancer. Whether she was working together  with her husband, Ed, to turn the Oswego State's ice hockey arena teal,  organizing a teal takeover of the Oswego Speedway, or sharing her own  experiences in Washington or Albany, Mary was committed to saving  lives. Her spirit and tenacity in the fight against ovarian cancer will  always be remembered. May it serve as an inspiration for others.   In Mary's memory, I will continue to advocate for increased funding  for research into cures, treatment, and prevention so that we can  someday know a day free of ovarian cancer. May her name forever be  remembered in the Congressional Record.   Rest peacefully, Mary.                            ____________________
