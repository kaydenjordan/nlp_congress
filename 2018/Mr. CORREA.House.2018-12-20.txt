 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to urge the House to concur in the Senate  amendments to H.R. 4227, the Vehicular Terrorism Prevention Act of  2017.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the Senate amendments to H.R. 4227.  They are technical in nature and would enhance H.R. 4227, a bill to  require the Department of Homeland Security to report to Congress on  what it is doing to help emergency responders and private sector  partners counter the threat of vehicular terrorism. It would also  explain how DHS is using existing DHS programs like grants, information  sharing, training, and research to help in this effort.   I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, as threats to our homeland continue to evolve and as  violent extremists seek to exploit soft targets, the risks posed to our  innocent bystanders from vehicular terrorism continues to grow. A vote  today to concur with the Senate amendment to H.R. 4227 is a vote to  bolster preparedness and response to these emerging threats.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to address this body, and I  demand that the Government of Vietnam respect human rights, religious  freedom, and international law as it pertains to an American citizen,  Michael Nguyen, who is being held without formal charges, under arrest  in Vietnam.   This unjust imprisonment raises issues, especially since he has never  broken the law in the United States. He is a loving father, member of  the local church, business owner, and model American citizen.   Yet, when he was traveling to Vietnam to visit his elderly relatives,  he was arrested. Why? We don't know. Apparently, he has been arrested  for ``activity against the people's government,'' yet we don't know the  circumstances or the reasoning.   We ask one very simple thing from the Government of Vietnam: to play  by the rules, respect human rights, respect religious freedom, and  release Mr. Michael Nguyen, an American citizen who is being detained  without formal charges.    Mr. Speaker, I urge that he be safely released and that he be  returned to his family in the United States.
