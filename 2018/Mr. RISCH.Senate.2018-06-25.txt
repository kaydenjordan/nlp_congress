 Mr. President, as you may know, I was a strong supporter  of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that passed this body and was signed into  law last year. With every passing day, we are hearing more about the  positive effects this law is having on the economy as a whole and about  companies, both large and small, making investments in their employees  and in their businesses. In identifying the positive impacts that the  law has had on the overall economy and for individual taxpayers, it is  sometimes forgotten that small businesses have also benefited from the  law. As chairman of the Senate Committee on Small Business and  Entrepreneurship, I supported the tax law because I believed it would  reduce taxes for the small businesses that employ millions of workers  all across America, while allowing small business owners to invest in  new equipment and increase economic growth. A few weeks ago, I began  this series of speeches to bring attention to small businesses that  have benefited from this law.   While many news reports have focused on the impact that the new tax  law has had on individuals and large corporations, I rise today to  discuss how Quake Manufacturing, a small business in Fort Wayne, IN,  has benefited from tax reform. Quake Manufacturing produces high- quality machined parts for its customers. The company uses high-tech  computer numerical control, CNC, machines to manufacture several types  of metal and plastic fixtures, gauges, prototype parts, and mass- produced parts. Quake Manufacturing employs 12 workers, has an 8,000- square-foot facility, four CNC machining centers, and six lathes.  Hermann Quake started the company in 1990 and has watched as the  company has expanded into the automotive and consumer goods sectors. In  1999, Hermann retired, and his son Paul took over day-to-day operations  of the family business.   Because of the tax law that was passed last year, this family-owned  small business has already been able to invest more in its employees.  After the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law, demand for  manufactured parts increased and business quickly picked up for the  company. Due to this renewed economic confidence, Paul was able to give  all of his employees a one-time $1,000 bonus and a gym membership and  increase employee benefits by adding long-term disability, short-term  disability, and dental insurance to their health plans. These  investments in his employees will help him to attract and maintain  qualified workers, which is important in an industry that prides itself  on attention to detail. Tax reform has had a tangible impact on small  businesses like Quake Manufacturing and their employees. Overall, the  new law has increased small businesses' confidence, allowed businesses  to increase employee bonuses and benefits, while also lowering taxes  and spurring new capital investment.                            ____________________
