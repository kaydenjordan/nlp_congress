 Mr. Speaker, prescription opioids and heroin addiction are  ravaging our Nation, causing heartache and pain for millions of  American families, and destroying our communities. This is no secret.   In my own home State of Illinois, opioids contribute to nearly 1,200  overdose deaths in 2016. Heroin played a role in those deaths of  another 1,000 people, many of whom started with prescription drugs.   According to the Illinois Department of Public Health, more people  die from opioid drug overdose than from homicide and motor vehicle  accidents.   These aren't just numbers or statistics. The people battling  addiction are moms and dads and neighbors and students. Addiction  doesn't care about your race, your gender, your income, your political  leanings. It is an issue that affects everyone because it impacts every  community and every person we love.   Congress took an important step last year in passing the  Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. This bipartisan legislation,  which was signed into law, created a coordinated and balanced strategy  for communities to tackle issues regarding prescription and opioid  abuse in their communities.   Just last month, Congress voted to fund programs designed to prevent  and treat opioid and heroin use. But the real leaders of this effort  will be citizens in our local community. Many local police departments  now offer drug drop boxes. Parents, especially, are on the front line  of this issue and are responsible to educate our children about the  dangers of prescription medication.   If you see someone struggling with addiction, please encourage them  to speak to their local drug and alcohol commissioners.   Completely ending addiction nationwide may not be possible, but  together we can save lives and begin to put hope back in our  communities.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor U.S. Navy Seaman Bobby  Temple, a 19-year-old who died during the attack on Pearl Harbor in  1941. He was one of 400 sailors who lost their lives aboard the USS  Oklahoma and whose remains were buried in a mass grave.   In 2015, the Navy started a project to identify each of the remains  and bring closure to the families after 75 years. Bobby's bravery was  honored during a memorial service in O'Fallon, Illinois, last week  before his remains were laid to rest in the National Memorial Cemetery  of the Pacific in Honolulu, Hawaii.   As a veteran myself, it is with heavy heart that I honor Bobby's  heroic service and pray God's blessing for his peaceful rest.                            ____________________
