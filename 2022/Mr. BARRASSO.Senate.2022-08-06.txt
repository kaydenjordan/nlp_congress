 Madam President, last year, Democrats in this body  passed a party-line spending bill, and they spent us into record-high  inflation. Ever since then, this has been nothing but bad news for the  working families of this country.   We have seen the worst inflation in 40 years. Prices have gone up  faster than wages month after month after month. Fifteen months in a  row now, prices are up faster than wages.   Now, Democrats' inflation has caused a recession. As a result,  working families are finding it much harder to get by. They can't keep  up. The average family can afford less today than they could the day  that Joe Biden took office--much less. The savings rate hasn't been  this low since the great recession. People are having to spend their  savings. Credit card debt is at an alltime high.   But the worst gut punch is about to happen right now, making all the  pain the Americans have suffered now extend for a longer period of  time. If Democrats pass this bill that is on the floor today, this  inflation crisis is going to get worse.   For weeks, there have been rumors that Democrats were working hidden  behind closed doors on another reckless tax-and-spending bill. The  American people knew it would be bad, and the bill that we are looking  at now is worse than expected.   Of course, the Democrats wrote it in secret. They didn't want the  American people to know what was inside it. Now, here we are, late on a  Saturday afternoon, and the Democrats are trying to cram it through  before people even get to read it. Members of my party were wanting to  read it earlier today. It wasn't even available, likely because it  wasn't even written yet.   I understand it is over 700 pages long. An earlier version, I saw 725  pages, with a cost of over a billion dollars a page.   Democrats call it their bill that they intend to try to use to reduce  inflation. But the more likelihood is that it will lead to double-digit  inflation. Haven't seen that since Jimmy Carter was in the White House.   The Wharton School of Business does a budget model. It says that this  bill, from everything that they have read so far, will actually  increase inflation for the next 2 years. It is bad enough for the  American people today. They can't put up with it for another 2 years.   Now, I am told that the Wharton analysis is usually the economic  analysis that the Senator from West Virginia, Joe Manchin, uses. Well,  I hope that Senator Manchin and every Member of this body pays  attention to that Wharton study.   A chorus of economists is saying the exact same thing as the experts  are telling us from Wharton. There is a nonpartisan group called the  Tax Foundation, and it says ``this bill may actually worsen  inflation''--worsen inflation. That is why I say we are looking at the  possibility of double-digit inflation. It is 9.1 percent now.   Democrats' favorite economist, Mark Zandi, says that the bill would  almost have no effect on inflation. How is it going to lower inflation  if it has no effect on inflation? And that is from a favorite of the  Democrats.   The Congressional Budget Office says the bill would have a negligible  effect on inflation. Clearly, there is broad agreement among experts  that the bill will not lower inflation.   Democrats were warned the last time, March of 2021. Democrats are  being warned again this time. And they  [[Page S4067]]  are ignoring the warnings. But it doesn't take an economist to tell you  that this bill would be a disaster for working families.   The bill is going to mean more taxes, more spending, higher prices-- right in the middle of the combination of an inflation time and a time  of recession.   The cost, the burdens, of this bill are going to be borne by the  working families of this country.   Now, this bill is going to hit working families from all sides.  First, let's take a look at the taxes. Tax revenues were already at  record highs in this country--not enough for the Democrats but record  alltime highs of tax revenue.   Democrats want more--a lot more. The Democrats' inflation bill would  increase taxes by nearly half a trillion dollars. Now, this includes a  blatant violation of Joe Biden's campaign promise when he said he  wouldn't raise taxes on middle-class families.   The Joint Tax Committee says that this bill will raise taxes on the  very people that Joe Biden said he wasn't going to come after. The  Joint Tax Committee actually said the bill will raise taxes on people  at nearly every level of income. It will affect you, every one of you,  all across this country.   Now, Democrats, of course, want to raise taxes on American energy. It  has been their claim since day one when Joe Biden basically put the  target on the back of American energy and pulled the trigger. And,  amazingly, they want to do it in the middle of an energy crisis.   Remember, this is the energy crisis that the Democrats have created.  When Joe Biden declared war on American energy, American families  started paying the price and have been paying the price ever since  then.   The bill does nothing to open up exploration for energy and American  oil on American properties on Federal lands. No. It includes a new tax  on American oil and gas production. This tax alone will raise the cost  of energy for half of the households in America.   Now, this is at a time when one-third of the inflation in this  country is driven by the cost of energy. When you take a look at the  cost of food, energy is a component of that. Growing food, getting food  to market--all of those things are related to energy. That tax alone is  going to shrink the economy and cost jobs.   There is also a new tax on imported oil. And Joe Biden's energy  policy has been, basically: Please send us some oil. It was his policy  last year when he went to Glasgow. And he actually asked Vladimir Putin  to send us more oil from Russia as Russia was planning to invade  Ukraine. He is trying to cut a deal with Iran to get Iranian oil.  Venezuela--he sent emissaries to Venezuela asking for oil. And he went  hat in hand last month to Saudi Arabia saying: Please send us more oil.   And then the Democrats put in their bill an excise tax on that oil  that the President is begging to have sent to America. And then to add  insult to injury, they indexed the tax to inflation--high inflation  begetting more inflation. It means the more inflation the Democrats  cause, the higher the prices go up. More taxes, more inflation.   This is a vicious cycle of Democrat taxes and Democrat inflation. As  a result, the pain at the pump is going to get worse. Yet the worst  punishment of all is for American coal production.   Now, I am proud to say Wyoming has been America's No. 1 producer of  coal for decades. Coal is still the most affordable, reliable energy  known to man. It is used all over the world. Yet in this bill, the  Democrats want to raise taxes on coal companies by up to 16 percent of  their income.   Well, I am from a coal State. Senator Manchin is from a coal State.  He and I worked together on the Energy Committee. He is the chair; I am  the ranking member. Here is what the West Virginia Coal Association has  said about what is in this bill that we are going to be voting on  starting tonight. Joe Manchin's home State coal association said:        Why support anything Chuck Schumer, Joe Biden, Nancy       Pelosi, or John Kerry want for coal?   They go on to say:        It is incomprehensible why any miner [coal miner] would       support the Manchin-Schumer legislation.   This is going to punish West Virginia directly, and it is going to  punish the hard-working people of Wyoming. It is also going to punish  their customers who rely on affordable energy.   These taxes are clearly going to get passed on to the consumer--in  other words, higher prices, more inflation. Economics 101.   The Democrats also want to raise taxes on savings and investment at a  time when seniors are hurting. Seniors are already watching their  savings go down and their taxes go up. Inflation is so bad that there  are reports that seniors are moving in together because they can't  afford to pay the rent.   Yet Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden want to raid their 401(k)s. This bill  also contains a hidden tax increase. That is because the bill would  nearly double the size of the IRS.   Now, Democrats think that giving the IRS 80 billion additional  dollars to hire additional auditors--tens of thousands, over 80,000  more auditors at the IRS, an army of auditors--that they are going to  be able to squeeze another $200 billion out of American taxpayers.   They are not talking about a couple of rich people here. Eighty-six  thousand auditors aren't needed to go after a couple of billionaires.  They are going after mainstream America. They are going after families,  farmers, after small businesses.   The IRS is already one of the most powerful and unaccountable  bureaucracies in the Federal Government. But the Democrats say: Not  enough. We want to put you on steroids so you can squeeze more money  out of the families of this country.   The Joint Tax Committee says almost all of the money raised by  supersizing the IRS would come from those making less than $200,000 a  year. That is the Joint Tax Committee.   So the billionaires in San Francisco and Manhattan who run the  Democrat Party, they are going to be just fine. It is working families  who always foot the bill for liberal policies.   So what are Democrats going to do with half a trillion in new taxes?  Well, they want to do what they do best: give taxpayer dollars to their  closest friends and their biggest political contributors. That includes  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars for the big  fans of the Green New Deal.   The bill puts American taxpayers on the hook for more than $315  billion in green energy loan guarantees. This will be billions and  billions for projects like Solyndra that went bankrupt when President  Obama was in the office and Joe Biden was Vice President. You would  have thought Joe Biden had learned those lessons from the horror  stories of the money being lost, the taxpayer dollars wasted in  projects that went bankrupt one after another after another.   The bill would give billions and billions for rich people to buy  electric vehicles. Unlike other vehicles, electric vehicles, they pay  no gas tax, which is how, of course, in this country that we pay for  the roads and the bridges and the highways. Democrats want to cut them  a big check as well. This is welfare for the wealthy.   The bill also includes supersized ObamaCare subsidies for people  making well over $100,000 a year. It is also welfare for the wealthy-- supersized subsidies on steroids.   Now, the subsidies were put in place at the beginning of the  pandemic. They were supposed to be temporary. Yet Democrats seem to  want them to continue forever. If Democrats extend these subsidies  permanently, this bill would not actually help at all with the deficit.  It would clearly add to the national debt.   In other words, Democrats are using the same sleight-of-hand  accounting gimmicks that they tried last year. Nine months ago, when  Democrats tried things like this in their Build Back Better Plan that  failed, even Senator Manchin admitted that it was ``smoke and  mirrors,'' a shell game, and budget gimmicks.   The Democrats are back to their old tricks right now. Here we are, 9  months later. The difference is, inflation is a lot, lot higher. The  pain people have gone through is felt more deeply.   Not a single Republican is going to vote for this monstrosity. No  Democrat should either. Joe Biden's economy is already the worst  economy that most Americans have ever experienced in their lifetime.   If Democrats pass this bill, it is going to get worse. And so I urge  my colleagues, don't inflict this kind of pain  [[Page S4068]]  on the American people in the middle of a recession. The American  people are hurting enough.   I yield the floor.    I call up amendment No. 5409 and ask that it be  reported by number.    I rise in support of the amendment to require the  Secretary of the Interior to conduct supplemental onshore oil and gas  lease sales by the end of 2022.   The Biden administration went 18 months without holding quarterly  lease sales as required by the Mineral Leasing Act.   That failure to hold lease sales has contributed to high gasoline and  natural gas prices, record inflation, and has increased our dependence  on foreign adversaries.   When the Secretary finally was forced to hold sales in June, she  reduced the available acreage by 80 percent.   This amendment would require the Secretary to hold supplemental lease  sales this year, offering the previously deferred acreage, which has  gone through multiple rounds already of environmental review.   Instead of pleading with dictators in other countries to increase oil  and gas production, we should expand American production. My amendment  will do just that for people who care about the pain at the pump.   I would ask other Senators to join in support.
