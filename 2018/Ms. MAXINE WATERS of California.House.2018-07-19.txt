 Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak about  the child abuse at the southern border.   Three months have passed since the Trump administration announced the  zero-tolerance policy that led directly to the humanitarian crisis we  now witness today. Three months later and, still, thousands of children  remain separated from their families.   This week, Federal judges announced a complete, one-week pause on all  family deportations, as well as mandatory  [[Page H6578]]  counseling for traumatized children. The courts seem almost as fed up  with this administration as the American people and have set deadlines  for the Trump administration to act.   The deadline to reunite all remaining separated families is just 6  days away. If the Trump administration fails to meet the deadline for  even just one single child, then Congress must hold all those  responsible for this national tragedy accountable.                            ____________________
