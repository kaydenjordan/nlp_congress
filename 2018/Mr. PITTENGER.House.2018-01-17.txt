 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Pembroke, North  Carolina, named 2017 Small Town of the Year by the North Carolina Rural  Assembly.   Pembroke, population 3,000, is home to the University of North  Carolina at Pembroke, as well as the Lumbee Indian Tribe, two wonderful  organizations with whom I am actively involved.   Much of southeastern North Carolina has been decimated by poorly  negotiated international trade deals and the loss of traditional  industries. Pembroke is fighting back by participating in a first-in- the-Nation innovation and entrepreneurship program and is working to  build its economy by focusing on healthcare, construction, and  agribusiness.   Congratulations to Mayor Charles Gregory Cummings, Council Members  Locklear, Jones, Sampson, and McNeill, Town Manager Tyler Thomas, UNC  Pembroke Chancellor Robin Cummings, Lumbee Tribal Chairman Harvey  Godwin, and the entire Pembroke community on this outstanding  achievement.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak on behalf of our Nation's  greatest tragedy. I would like to thank Chairman Smith so much for his  leadership over the past 35 years. He has been unrelenting in his  commitment and support of life, and I have the deepest respect for him.   Today marks Roe v. Wade's 45th anniversary. Since that ignoble  decision, over 60 million precious, innocent unborn babies have been  intentionally killed by abortions in the United States.   In light of the anniversary and the March for Life event, I would  like to share the words of the late Mother Teresa:   ``But I feel that the greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion,  because it is a war against the child, a direct killing of the innocent  child, murder by the mother herself.   ``And if we accept that a mother can kill even her own child, how can  we tell other people not to kill one another?   ``How do we persuade a woman not to have an abortion? As always, we  must persuade her with love, and we remind ourselves that love means to  be willing to give until it hurts. Jesus gave even His life to love us.   ``So the mother who is thinking of abortion should be helped to love,  that is, to give until it hurts her plans or her free time, to respect  the life of her child. The father of that child, whoever he is, must  also give until it hurts.''   Mother Theresa goes on to say:   ``By abortion, the mother does not learn to love but kills even her  own child to solve her problems.   ``And, by abortion, that father is told that he does not have to take  any responsibility at all for the child he has brought into the world.  That father is likely to put other women into the same trouble. So  abortion just leads to more abortion.   ``Any country that accepts abortion''--Mother Theresa says--``is not  teaching its people to love, but to use any violence to get what they  want. This is why the great destroyer of love and peace is abortion.''   The work of this body, Mr. Speaker, must be to correct this tragedy  to protect the lives of those who cannot speak for themselves.   We hope and pray for those who stand in darkness on this grievous  loss of life and who have been advocates of abortion. Who would know  the mind of God regarding these 60 million precious souls, that He may  have given to some of them the cure for cancer or Alzheimer's or  Parkinson's or many other diseases? God is merciful, but we must  recognize our own responsibilities and affect for our own actions.   This week, we have the opportunity to outlaw the diabolical practice  of killing babies who survive an abortion, something incredibly  barbaric, by passing the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act.   I also urge my colleagues to join me in support of the No Abortion  Bonds Act, legislation I introduced to block Planned Parenthood and  other abortion providers from using tax-exempt, taxpayer-backed bonds  to finance their abortion clinics.   Ours is a great cause, greater than us, greater than this generation.  It is a battle for the very soul of what we stand for as a nation.
