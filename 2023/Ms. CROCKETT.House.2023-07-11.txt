 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to commemorate a leader of  the north Texas Pakistani community, Mr. Hafeez Khan.   There are over 50,000 Pakistani Americans living in my home of north  Texas, a prosperous, hardworking community that grows every single  year.   Mr. Kahn has used his position as a prominent business leader in  Dallas to advocate for the Pakistani-American community, both in Texas  and across the country.   When Mr. Kahn heard that part of the beautiful Pakistani Embassy here  in Washington was set to be sold, he stepped up to purchase the  property and preserve its historical and cultural significance. For the  Pakistani-American community, the Embassy building here in our Nation's  Capital is more than just a piece of property. It has served as a place  of welcome, community, and support for this vibrant, thriving immigrant  community.   Mr. Speaker, thanks to Mr. Kahn's philanthropy, this setting will  serve as a landmark of Pakistani culture for years to come.                            ____________________
