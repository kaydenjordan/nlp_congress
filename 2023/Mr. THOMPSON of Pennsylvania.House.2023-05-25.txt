 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize  Memorial Day.   Our Nation's greatness was earned by the sacrifices of a few so that  freedom and liberty would come to all.   This weekend, we remember their sacrifices and their service. Every  year on the last Monday of May, people across this Nation gather in  town squares, at memorials, and in cemeteries of our fallen heroes to  pay tribute to those who gave it all. This Nation is united by our  liberties and freedoms that our men and women in uniform take an oath  to protect and defend.   We will always honor our brothers and sisters who fought in battle to  uphold our way of life, and we will never stop searching for those who  are missing.   May God always carry them and all our servicemembers in the palm of  His hand.  [[Page H2602]]    This Memorial Day, as we raise the Stars and Stripes, as we lay  wreaths at monuments, memorials, and cemeteries, let us remember that  our freedom is thanks to those who served and those who died in  sacrifice.                            ____________________
