 Mr. President, I will start by congratulating Senator  Klobuchar, who was on the floor earlier to speak about the  Congressional Accountability Act, and Senator Blunt for their hard work  to enact legislation that will make this place work better. It is a  rare display of bipartisanship, coming together to improve our  processes with regard to sexual harassment and other issues, and I  thank them for that.   Earlier this week, some of us talked about the veterans bill that  passed this Chamber--another sign of bipartisanship. It passed with a  big vote, and it will help our veterans in Ohio to get the care they  need, where they want it. Going into Memorial Day, I am very glad it  passed.   We have heard a lot of concerns that my colleagues raised about  veterans not being able to get the care they wanted in their hometowns  or the specialist they wanted or not being able to get reimbursed  appropriately for care outside of the VA system, and now they will be  able to do it.   Another part of that legislation that helps our veterans deals with  an issue that is affecting all of the States in this body and sadly has  become an epidemic in our country; that is, the opioid epidemic. It is  an issue that some of our veterans are facing when they come back from  service. Some have PTSD. Some have traumatic brain injuries and other  injuries that require procedures. In response to the acute pain and  some of these other conditions, they are given opioid medication. As a  result, sadly, a number of our veterans have become addicted to  opioids.   This legislation will help by, No. 1, cutting back on the  overprescribing of opioids but also by using nonaddictive pain  alternatives--medicines that do not have opioids in them--and other  forms of therapy to help them deal with pain. These therapies will now  be used more in our VA hospital system. That is a good thing for our  veterans.                            ____________________     Mr. President, talking about the opioid issue, sadly,  this is gripping my State of Ohio in a way that has caused us to have  more deaths by opioids than any other cause of death. But it is not  just Ohio; it is an epidemic because now, nationally, it is the No. 1  cause of accidental death, and for Americans under 50, it is the No. 1  cause of death, period. This makes it the worst drug epidemic we have  faced in this country--the worst since, we will recall, back in the  1980s and 1990s when we were very concerned about cocaine and other  drugs. This has become the worst drug epidemic we have ever faced.   We had a tele-townhall meeting this week where I called several  thousand Ohioans. We had about 20,000 people on the call at any one  time. During that call, we had a survey question. Among other  questions, it asked about opioids, and it asked a very simple question:  Do you know someone who has been personally affected? Have you been or  do you know someone who has been personally affected by this opioid  epidemic? The numbers were shocking this week. Typically, over half of  the callers say yes. That is how bad it is in Ohio. This week, it was  66 percent--two-thirds of the callers. Thousands of people in Ohio  reported back from a tele-townhall. So it is not a self-selected group;  it is people who have called in to talk about various issues, and 66  percent said they know someone who has been directly affected by this  opioid addiction issue.   It has unfolded in three waves. The first wave was really  prescription drugs, and this was back in the late 1990s and into the  2000s. There were pill mills in Southern Ohio and other States.  Kentucky and West Virginia were hit hard. This was medication that was  being abused, in many cases leading to an addiction.   The second wave was the heroin wave. This was when heroine became  more readily available and was actually less expensive than  prescription drugs, and many people turned to heroin. That heroin led  to many more overdoses and other issues, including diseases associated  with the use of needles, hepatitis C and others.   Now there is a new wave, and the new wave, sadly, is even more deadly  than the first two. It is what is called synthetic opioids or synthetic  heroin. The one that you have probably heard of is called fentanyl,  sometimes carfentanil, which is even more powerful. It is truly at  epidemic levels in my State, and it is being made worse by this new  wave of synthetic heroin.   There are other drugs, as well, that are affecting us in our country.  In my own State, in some regions of Ohio, crystal meth now coming up  from Mexico is creating a bigger problem. Cocaine is certainly an  issue. But as I have looked at the statistics and traveled the State,  it is clear that our No. 1 issue is opioids and that synthetic  opioids--50 times more potent than heroin--are the new face of the  opioid epidemic.   Fentanyl was involved in about 37 percent of the deaths in Ohio as  recently as 2015. By 2016, it was responsible for 58 percent of the  overdose deaths. So it has gone from 37 percent to 58 percent in 1  year. We don't have all the numbers yet for 2017, but unfortunately the  numbers we do have from various regions of the State indicate that 2017  is going to be just as bad, if not worse. Columbus, OH, as an example,  has seen a staggering increase in opioid overdoses due to fentanyl.  Two-thirds of the county's 2017 overdose deaths were due to fentanyl-- two-thirds.   I am told by law enforcement that fentanyl--again, this drug that is  so deadly that a few flakes of it can kill you--has also been sprinkled  into other drugs. I have talked to recovering addicts who told me their  stories about finding out that they were actually taking fentanyl when  they thought they were taking another drug. It has been sprinkled into  other street drugs, according to law enforcement and some of these  recovering addicts I have talked to, including cocaine, even including  marijuana, and including heroin.   Just last week, two men in the Toledo area were arrested for drug  conspiracy with the intent to distribute. A little more than half a  pound of fentanyl was seized upon their arrest. Half a pound of  fentanyl would be equivalent to about 1 cup of fentanyl--small enough  to fit into a ziplock bag in your kitchen. Yet that one drug seizure of  1 cup was enough fentanyl, according to experts, to kill 16,000 people.  Remember, just a few flecks of it can  [[Page S2910]]  kill you. That is more than half of the population of Toledo, where  this arrest took place. That is how dangerous these drugs are.   Fentanyl comes mostly from laboratories in China, and mostly it is  shipped to the United States through a Federal agency; this is, the  U.S. Postal Service. It is unbelievable to me that we are not doing  more to push back on this given that it is actually a government entity  through which the experts say most of this fentanyl is coming in,  primarily from one country, primarily through the post office.   We looked into this in an 18-month investigation in the Senate  Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair. Our  investigators revealed just how easy it is to purchase fentanyl online  and have it shipped to the United States. The drugs can be found  through a simple Google search, and overseas sellers essentially  guarantee delivery if the fentanyl is sent through the U.S. Postal  Service.   I have spent time talking to Postal Service employees about this,  including back home in Ohio, and they don't want to be any part of  this. No. 1, it is very dangerous. You can imagine, if these packages  leak--I talked earlier about the dangers of fentanyl--people can be  subjected to it, exposed to it, overdose themselves, even die. Also,  they don't want to be any part of it because they don't want to see  these poisons coming into our country--that they are delivering--and  going to an empty warehouse or a post office box or even being  delivered to someone's home, and during our investigation, we found all  three. We found in several instances that people had received fentanyl  through the mail and then had died of overdoses. We would have tracked  that from hearing who had died and being able to track some of the  payments and shipments. So there is no question that people are  receiving fentanyl at their homes and taking it and dying. No one wants  to be a part of that.    Why is the post office the preferred way for these drugs to come? Why  do the traffickers say: If you send it through the post office, then  delivery is guaranteed. It is really pretty simple. The U.S. Postal  Service is exempt from a Federal law that was passed post-9/11. In  2002, Congress passed a law that required the private carriers--think  FedEx or DHL or UPS--to get advance electronic data from their  customers, which would then be provided to law enforcement, and it  would tell law enforcement where the package is from, what is in the  package, and where it is going. With that information, using big data  analytics, Customs and Border Protection has been able to identify  suspicious packages because they have this data on the packages coming  in--every package, 100 percent of the packages. They then are able to  pull these packages off line, test them, and not have this poison come  into our communities.   The same is not true, unfortunately, with regard to the U.S. Postal  Service. Until we began this congressional investigation and began to  push the Postal Service, there was very little electronic data being  provided on any packages from the Postal Service. Now, remember, there  are 900 million packages coming in a year. How can law enforcement  possibly find the suspect packages without having this data and without  having good detection equipment to be able to find it? It is like  finding a needle in a haystack. But with this information, they are  able to be much more effective, as they have been with these private  carriers--DHL, UPS, FedEx, and so on.   Under pressure from Congress, over the last year or so, the Postal  Service has been getting some data on international packages. Last  year, they received data on about 36 percent of their packages, based  on the testimony they have given us, meaning that the United States  received about 318 million packages without any of the screening,  without any of this data on it at all. So 36 percent is an improvement,  but still the vast majority of packages are not being stopped.   By the way, 20 percent of the packages that were identified by law  enforcement as being problematic based on the amount of electronic data  that was provided--20 percent of those packages were not presented to  law enforcement, based on the testimony we received.   Finally, we learned that even though 36 percent of the packages had  some sort of data, much of that data was not useful. It was not  decipherable, not helpful for law enforcement.   So we have a long way to go, and we have a crisis in front of us. It  is time for Congress to act because it is clear to me that the Postal  Service needs this congressional mandate to more expeditiously close  this loophole that is allowing this deadly poison to continue coming  into our homes and onto our streets.   Again, this is the No. 1 killer in my home State of Ohio, and when we  look nationally, this is the new face of the opioid epidemic. There is  legislation to deal with this. It is called the STOP Act. It is a  bipartisan bill I introduced with Senator Amy Klobuchar. She spoke on  the floor earlier. We talked earlier about getting this legislation  passed. This legislation will close the loophole. It will insist that  our international mail screening take place, and it will stop some of  this deadly fentanyl from coming into our communities. It will simply  hold the Postal Service to the same standard as private mail carriers  and require that within 1 year, they get electronic data on all  packages entering the United States. It is fair, it is commonsense, and  it is going to make a big difference in our communities.   By the way, that is why about one-third of the Senate and about half  of the House of Representatives have already signed on as cosponsors of  our legislation. It is bipartisan. It is bicameral. The President's  Opioid Commission--we remember that President Trump asked a bunch of  experts to come together, led by Governor Chris Christie, to have a  commission look at this opioid issue and come up with recommendations.  One of the recommendations: Pass the STOP Act. Keep some of this  fentanyl out of our country.   Last week, the House Ways and Means Committee took up our  legislation, and I appreciate their doing that. Sadly, what they  reported out was a weaker version of the STOP Act than is necessary to  address this problem.   Their version gives the Postal Service, as an example, 4 years to  implement these changes at a time when this is a crisis. Remember, it  is increasing every year, to the point of being the No. 1 cause of  death in my State and in many other States.   It also only requires them to get data on 95 percent of packages--not  100 percent--eventually.   It also gives the Federal Government the ability to waive the  requirement altogether if it is ``in the national security interest of  the United States.'' I hate to see them use that waiver. How could it  possibly be in the national security interest of the United States of  America not to have information to give to law enforcement to stop  something this deadly from coming into our country? That makes no  sense. I know from what I have seen and heard in Ohio that we need this  and we need it now. We need this data on all foreign packages. That is  in our national security interest, not setting lower screening  standards or creating a loophole to evade accountability.   I am encouraged that the Ways and Means Committee chairman, Kevin  Brady, has acknowledged these concerns. By the way, having spoken to  him, I know he has a passion for addressing this issue.   I know he is personally committed to coming up with legislation that  works. We need to resolve these differences, get this legislation to  the floor of the House and the Senate, and get it passed so that we can  begin to stop the fentanyl flooding into our country. It is at the  forefront of the epidemic that we see around the country. It is taking  lives. It is sidelining workers.   The No. 1 cause of crime in my State is related to opioids. Often,  the criminal acts committed--such as burglary, shoplifting, and fraud-- are to pay for the habit. It is crippling communities. It is breaking  families apart. It is doing so at an alarming rate.   This morning, we had testimony in the Committee on Finance regarding  rural healthcare, and some of the providers were talking about the  fentanyl crisis. I asked them what they are doing about it and how it  is going, particularly with regard to kids who were born with what is  called neonatal abstinence syndrome, meaning they were  [[Page S2911]]  born to an addicted mother, and they have to be taken through  withdrawal as a baby. These little babies you could hold in the palm of  your hand are having to go through withdrawal.   They told me that the foster care systems in their States are  overwhelmed; mine is, in Ohio. We have more kids under State  supervision and in foster care than ever. We can't find foster families  fast enough because so many of the parents are unable to take care of  the kids. There are more grandparents and great-grandparents than ever  having to step forward and take care of these kids. It is affecting our  communities in so many ways.   The STOP Act alone isn't going to solve of all of these problems. We  get that. We have passed legislation around here in the last year and a  half to increase prevention and education and to increase treatment and  longer term recovery. That is very important, and we need to do more of  it. We have new legislation to take that to the next level.   But combating this crisis at its source by making it harder for drugs  to enter our country is certainly a step we can, and should, take. It  is only common sense. At the very least, it would reduce supply and  help to drive up the cost of this drug. One of our problems is that the  drug is powerful, but it is also relatively inexpensive.   We have an opportunity with the STOP Act to make a real difference  for families in every single State represented in this Chamber. If you  are not already a cosponsor, I hope you will join us in this effort. If  you are a cosponsor and you support this, I hope you will talk to your  leadership, both sides of the aisle.   Let's get this to the floor. Let's get a vote. Let's ensure we are  doing everything we possibly can to stop this poison.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
