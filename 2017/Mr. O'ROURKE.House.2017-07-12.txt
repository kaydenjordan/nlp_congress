 Mr. Speaker, there are tens of thousands of veterans in  this country who have served this country; put their lives on the line,  literally; and saved the lives of countless other servicemembers who,  because of their service, have mental healthcare-related conditions  like post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, which contributed to them  having an other than honorable discharge.   Mr. Speaker, with an other than honorable discharge, those veterans  are unable to go into a VA and see a mental healthcare provider,  despite the fact that they are more than two times likely to take their  own lives.   Now that we all know this, I hope that Members will join me in  cosponsoring the Honor Our Commitment Act, which I introduced with Mike  Bost in the House and Chris Murphy in the Senate. It is bipartisan and  bicameral. It honors our commitment and obligation to those  servicemembers who did right by this country, and it will save lives.   I look forward to the full support of this Chamber, passage of this  bill, and having the President sign it into law.                            ____________________
