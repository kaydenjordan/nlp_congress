 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank the  gentlewoman for yielding and for her leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 7301, the Emergency  Housing Protections and Relief Act.   Through no fault of their own, New Yorkers and Americans across this  country are struggling to pay their rent or make mortgage payments.  Even worse, people experiencing homelessness and survivors of domestic  violence have seen their limited options for safety and shelter dwindle  due to the pandemic's impact on social services.   The bill is a bold and necessary step toward providing economic and  housing relief for millions of Americans.   It expands the eviction moratorium to protect all renters and the  foreclosure moratorium to protect all homeowners. It creates a $100  billion emergency rental assistance fund and provides nearly $13  billion targeted money for homeless grants, housing choice vouchers for  people experiencing homelessness, and survivors of domestic violence.   Nobody should lose sleep about how they are going to keep a roof over  their head while they are suffering through a pandemic.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this necessary and important bill.
