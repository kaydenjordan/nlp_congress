 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, at 5:30 p.m., all postcloture time on the  Lee nomination be considered expired; further, that if confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table and the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action. I ask that  following disposition of the Lee nomination, the Senate vote on the  cloture motions for the Vitter, Bulatao, and Rosen nominations;  finally, that if cloture is invoked on those nominations, the  confirmation votes on the Vitter and Bulatao nominations occur at noon  on Thursday and the Rosen confirmation vote occur at 1:45 p.m. on  Thursday, May 16, and that if confirmed, the motions to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about Police  Week and some legislation we have introduced to honor and support our  men and women in blue called, not surprisingly, the Back the Blue Act.  With regard to the comments of my friend from Illinois, who was  bemoaning the fact that there didn't seem to be bipartisan legislation  that could come to the floor of the Senate, be debated, voted on, and  passed with concurrence of the House of Representatives and the  President's signature, I note that, actually, there is a lot we could  be doing together.   I have been on the floor a number of times describing the  humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. That is  something we could work together to address. I have introduced  bipartisan and bicameral legislation with my friend and colleague Henry  Cuellar at the House of Representatives that would address that  humanitarian crisis and, I believe, take big steps toward stopping it.  That is something we could do together.   I know the Democratic whip from Illinois doesn't particularly like  the idea that President Trump is nominating highly qualified people for  the judiciary and for executive branch nominations--the types of people  we are voting on today and will vote on tomorrow. Obviously, that is  not high on his agenda, but I submit that there are a lot of other  things we could do besides fixing this humanitarian crisis.   We could work on roads and bridges together. I know that Chairman  Barrasso of the Environment and Public Works Committee is soliciting  the views of a number of Senators and is going to come to the floor,  hopefully, in the next couple of months with some ideas on what that  infrastructure package should look like. I actually think that is the  best way to handle that.   Again, these are nonpartisan issues. Infrastructure is not a partisan  issue, but figuring out how to pay for it is the biggest challenge.   I note that Ms. Pelosi, Senator Schumer, the Democratic leader, and  the President met and talked about a $2 trillion pricetag. Well, it  seems to me that is backward. We ought to be talking about what sort of  plan makes sense and where we can get the votes to build consensus on  that plan rather than saying that we want to spend this much money on a  plan to come.   That is why I think the committee work that is being done in the  Senate, in the Environment and Public Works Committee, and, hopefully,  in the House is so important. Once the Environment and Public Works  Committee makes a proposal and votes that out of the committee on a  bipartisan basis, then, the Senate Finance Committee will be asked to  come up with a way to pay for it. That is always the part that people  want to talk about the least, but it is important.   It is important we not continue to spend money we don't have and  increase our deficits and debt. Rather, we need to come up with a user- fee model, which is what the gas tax is designed to do, and find a way  not to pay for that infrastructure and deal with the congestion and  traffic by just borrowing from Peter to pay Paul, literally just  increasing the money we borrow and giving that tab to our children and  grandchildren to pay back. There are a lot of really good ideas out  there and ones on which I think we ought to work together.   I don't share the dystopian views of the Senator from Illinois in  terms of the Senate. The Senate is not broken. It is just a matter of  political will to try to work together to get beyond the petty  disagreements that seem to come up every day and to just do our work.  Sometimes you don't necessarily appear on TV or have your name appear  in lights when you are doing that sort of hard work, but it is  essential to get the Senate's work done and, indeed, to get the work of  the American people done. Those are some things we could work on  together if there is a political will to do so.   Mr. President, this week, tens of thousands of Americans will make  their way to Washington for National Police Week, our annual  opportunity to honor the brave men and women in blue who have lost  their lives while protecting our communities.   Of course, this includes many officers from Texas. I am particularly  proud of the Fort Worth Police Pipes and Drums Band and the Texas  Department of Public Safety Pipes and Drums Corps that performed on the  National Mall yesterday.   Law enforcement is a calling answered by a select few. These brave  men and women have chosen a difficult and sometimes dangerous life,  dedicated to upholding the law, defending or civil liberties, and  protecting our cities and our neighborhoods. They wake up each morning  and put on a uniform, never knowing what the day may hold. It requires  a lot of courage and sacrifice--both from the officers and their  families--and I am grateful for those who selflessly serve our  communities each day.   Each year for Police Week, we honor the law enforcement community to  remember those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. One of the most  emblematic reminders of that sacrifice is the National Law Enforcement  Officers Memorial, which is here in Washington, DC. It is a beautiful  tribute to the Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials who  have died in the line of duty and features marble walls filled with  more than 21,000 names. Each of those names represents an American  hero. Sadly, this year, we add the names of 13 Texans to that memorial.  These officers gave their lives in service to their communities and to  our country, and we thank them and their families for their sacrifices,  and we remember and honor their names.   Each year for Police Week, we pay tribute to those who go to work and  never come home. We honor the lives of those we have lost. We share in  the grief of their families, and we promise never to forget the stories  of heroism they left behind.   While we remember the fallen this week, I hope we will also take time  to consider how we can do more to support and serve those who have  taken the oath to defend us.   Throughout my career in public office, I have had the pleasure of  interacting with law enforcement officials from across my State and,  certainly, here at the Federal level, including our incredible Capitol  Police officers. I am continually impressed and inspired by their  professionalism, their conviction, and their unwavering commitment to  enforcing the law, and I want to ensure that they have what they need  when they put on that uniform with confidence every morning.   Last Congress we made a lot of progress, and two bills that I  introduced then are now law. The first is the Justice Served Act, which  I introduced with my colleague Senator Klobuchar, another example of  bipartisan legislation. This bill provides grants to State and local  governments to prosecute cold cases by making sure the newly tested DNA  evidence is used to investigate and prosecute unsolved cases. The  Justice Served Act helps to ensure that violent criminals are taken off  the streets and brought to justice.   We also passed legislation I introduced with Senator Peters from  Michigan to authorize the Project Safe Neighborhoods program at the  Department of Justice. This is a nationwide partnership among Federal,  State, and local law enforcement and prosecutors who use data-driven,  evidence-based, and trauma-informed practices to reduce violent crime.  It is inspired by a successful program that was initiated at the State  level in Texas, when I was attorney general, but the truth is it  started in the Eastern District. I believe it was in Virginia. Of  course, it was designed to focus on reducing gun crime and gun violence  by targeting those who repetitively used firearms in the commission of  violent crimes.   We were glad to use the examples in Virginia and in Texas to bring  the model to the Nation and to promote this proactive and collaborative  approach to prevent violence in our neighborhoods.  [[Page S2889]]    I am appreciative of the fact that our colleagues have seen fit to  work together to pass both of these bills and of President Trump for  signing those, but I know there is a lot more that we can and should  do.   Today I am introducing another piece of legislation called the Back  the Blue Act, which I am introducing along with our colleagues Senator  Cruz from Texas and Senator Tillis from North Carolina. This  legislation sends a strong message to the more than 900,000 law  enforcement officers serving in our country that we support them and  that we will not tolerate any act of violence against them, period.   In recent years, we have seen brutal and inexcusable attacks on law  enforcement officers across the United States, including one in Texas  that rocked our entire State.   In 2016, a man killed five police officers and injured nine others in  Dallas. It was a sobering reminder of the danger these officers face  every day and a call for us to take action to do more to support them.   This bill makes clear our support for these public servants who  dedicate their lives to protecting and serving us. The Back the Blue  Act would add stiff mandatory penalties and make it a Federal crime to  kill or attempt to kill a law enforcement officer, a Federal judge, or  a federally funded public safety officer. It would also make it a  Federal crime to assault a law enforcement officer.   There is zero justification for attacking a police officer--none. We  need to show that we value their lives, and we need to make it  absolutely clear that we will hold those who carry out crimes against  them accountable. The Back the Blue Act sends that message loud and  clear.   I think it is important to point out that this legislation would also  help make our communities stronger by allowing grant funds to be used  for efforts that help foster more trust between the police and the  communities they protect. This bill would better serve the men and  women who work tirelessly in our communities each day.   There is no doubt in my mind that our Nation is better and safer  because of the hard work and dedication of our law enforcement  officials. Here in the Senate we should do all we can to help them do  their job as effectively and as safely as possible. The Back the Blue  Act would be a great start.   I hope my colleagues will consider this legislation and decide to  support it and, more importantly, show our law enforcement across the  country that we stand shoulder to shoulder with them.                                  ______                                         By Mr. KAINE (for himself, Ms. Baldwin, Mrs. Feinstein, and Ms.          Hirono):   S. 1483. A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 to require  institutions of higher education to have an independent advocate for  campus sexual assault prevention and response; to the Committee on  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
