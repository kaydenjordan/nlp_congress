 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of impeaching again the  [[Page H173]]  worst President in the history of the United States.   Since his first day in office, this President has spent 4 years  abusing his power, lying, embracing authoritarianism, and radicalizing  his supporters against democracy.   This corruption poisoned the minds of his supporters, inciting them  to willingly join with white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and paramilitary  extremists in a siege of the United States Capitol Building, the very  seat of American democracy.   The Republican Party is now the Trump party. And I want you to know  that this is a Trump power grab that will not stop. It will not stop  with attacking the Capitol and our State legislatures. This President  intends to exercise power long after he is out of office.   It is reported that the President of the United States watched the  invasion of our Capitol from the Oval Office and seemingly enjoyed it.  I want you to know we should be concerned that the Republicans will  defend him, and he is capable of starting a civil war.   He must be impeached. He must be stopped now.
