 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life and memory  of a true community leader, Mr. Robert ``Bob'' Aichele, of Lancaster,  who passed away at the age of 92 on Tuesday. Bob was a friend to  everyone and would always greet you with a signature warm smile.   He spent his life in service to others, in service to the Nation as a  seaman first class in the United States Navy, a veteran of World War II  and the Korean War.   He also served his community, serving as the president of many boards  and associations, and was a Manor Township supervisor for more than 25  years.   When he was not serving the community he loved, Bob was with his  family. He is survived by his loving wife of 67 years, Mary Anne, five  children, 15 grandchildren, and one great grandchild.  [[Page H857]]    Madam Speaker, my prayers and condolences are with his family, with  those who grieve, and all those who had the opportunity to know Bob. I  know I always appreciated his friendship and I will cherish the time  that we had together.   While we mourn the loss of Bob, we must also give thanks for the life  that he lived and the time that we had to spend with him.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong opposition to the PRO  Act.   Today's egregious legislation really is mislabeled. It is called the  Protecting the Right to Organize Act, but it really should be renamed  the Unfair to American Workers, or the UAW, Act.   I strongly agree that our constitutionally guaranteed rights, like  the freedom of association, should be protected, but this bill doesn't  strengthen protections for all Americans. This bill upsets the balance  between the right of employees to form a union and the right of  individuals to refrain from joining a union.   H.R. 2474 deliberately speeds up the union election process so that  employees do not have the time to fully vet the pros and cons of  joining a union.   This bill also strips away critical privacy rights by forcing  employers to hand over sensitive private employee information, such as  where an employee lives, what work shifts they work, and more.   Why do they want this information? So union leaders can stalk and  harass employees until they agree to sign up.  [[Page H885]]    The PRO Act, in fact, leaves no corner of labor law untouched. This  bill will disrupt the franchise model to eliminate a franchisee's  ability to operate their business as their own, and it even decimates  the sharing economy by codifying California's ABC test.   What is worse, this bill repeals every right-to-work law in the  Nation, forcing millions of Americans to contribute to a union that  they don't need or that they don't want.   I offered a commonsense amendment to this bill that would require  unions to seek employee consent when using dues for political purposes,  but my amendment was blocked by Democrats from being even debated on  the House floor.   My colleagues on the left will claim that economic inequality has  resulted because of declining union membership, but we know this isn't  true. The economic success that we are seeing today, particularly for  minority groups who have historically faced the most inequality, is  changing thanks to policies put in place by a Republican Congress and  by President Trump. Wage growth is rising faster today for minorities  and individuals most impacted by economic inequality than for any other  group.   Rather than innovating to become more attractive to employees so they  want to join, unions are trying to change Federal law to stack the deck  against hardworking Americans.   Americans aren't rejecting union membership because current labor law  acts as a barrier to forming one. They are declining to join because  they are sick of seeing union leaders harass and coerce their  colleagues; line their own pockets with dues, as we have seen exhibited  in the recent racketeering acts committed by former UAW leaders; and  use employee dues to support political platforms that don't align with  an individual's views.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this harmful power grab.
