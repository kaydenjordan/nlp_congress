 Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1, the For  the People Act. This is really just a takeover of elections by  Washington, D.C.   Madam Speaker, I got a chance to go through some of this bill--790  pages. Most of these things would basically eviscerate Florida's  election law.   You see, I served in Florida's legislature. We had the responsibility  for adjusting legislation law from time to time. Our State was a State  that went through hanging chads in 2000, and we have made the  adjustment systematically in the State legislature to make sure that  Florida has the very best election laws in these United States.   You see, on election night, November 3, we were done counting around  9:30. We knew the results by 10 o'clock. We have absentee ballots, we  have voter ID, we have early voting, and we have a robust count system  on election day.   The people of Florida have never been disenfranchised when it comes  to elections. The people of Florida have come accustomed to having a  voter system that works. And what this body is trying to do with H.R. 1  is completely destroy Florida's election laws. That is, to me,  ridiculous. This Capitol should never allow that. If we are going to do  anything, we should replicate what Florida has actually done.    Madam Speaker, I am sorry. It keeps falling down.   Madam Speaker, I was trying to make a point--    Madam Speaker, the point is clear: 33 States have voter  ID laws. Many States have already taken care of these problems  themselves. State legislatures should be changing their laws. This  Capitol should not. And the people of the State of Florida definitely  do not want the things that are in this bill. Our system is the best.  Frankly, leave Florida alone.                            Parliamentary Inquiry
