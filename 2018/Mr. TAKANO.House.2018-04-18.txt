 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Kathleen  Daley, a lifelong Riverside resident and a dedicated member of our  community who passed away last week.   For more than a decade, I had the privilege of serving with Kathleen  on the Riverside Community College District Board of Trustees. And  though she was a conservative Republican, and I a progressive Democrat,  never did our ideologies keep us from finding common ground when it  came to serving our students.   She taught me what it means to work with people who have a different  way of seeing things. Her deep understanding of budgeting was vital to  lifting the college out of severe financial hardship. Through her  service to the college, as well as to many local nonprofit  organizations, Kathleen's commitment to our community improved the  lives of people across the Inland Empire region.   My condolences go to Kathleen Daley's family and friends.                            ____________________
