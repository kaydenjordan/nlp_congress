 Madam Speaker, March is National Nutrition  Month, and I am proud to join my colleagues, Representatives Judy Chu  and Jackie Walorski, in leading H.R. 1551, the Nutrition Counseling  Aiding Recovery for Eating Disorders Act, or the Nutrition CARE Act for  short.   Madam Speaker, eating disorders account for one death every 52  minutes and can impact the lives of individuals across their lifespan.  This mental illness does not discriminate, but longstanding health  inequities, implicit bias, and stigma contribute to why people of color  with eating disorders are half as likely to be diagnosed or to receive  treatment.   The Nutrition CARE Act would provide Medicare part B coverage for  medical nutrition therapy for beneficiaries with eating disorders,  meaning hundreds of thousands of Medicare beneficiaries who identify as  Black, indigenous, or people of color would have coverage of a key  treatment component.   Madam Speaker, I am proud to help lead this effort, and I urge my  colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 1551 and bring it to the floor of this  Congress.                            ____________________
