 Mr. Speaker, I, too, rise in strong support of  this legislation.   Every single week, I make phone calls to Hoosiers back home, and I  hear every night on those phone calls how hard they are working to  build a better and brighter future for themselves, for their families,  and for their children; but they understand that, in order to have a  brighter, better future, they must have a future. I hear on the phone  every single night how concerned they are that there won't be a future  with all that they see, all that they read, all that they hear about  these threats from North Korea.   We in Congress have heard their pleas to do something, that enough is  enough, that threats against Guam, that ICBMs flying off the Peninsula,  that nuclear tests, that the time has come for decisive action, and  decisive action is what we are taking here.   The toughest financial sanctions ever put in place, that is what this  bill does, and that is what we need to put in place to ensure that we  demand real change from North Korea, that we demand that they stop  threatening Americans and the American way of life.   Mr. Speaker, I support this legislation, support the work that is  being done to confront this challenge once and for all, and this bill  demands the question: Will you do business with the United States or  will you do business with North Korea?   Mr. Speaker, I am excited to stand up in support of this legislation.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the  balance of my time.
