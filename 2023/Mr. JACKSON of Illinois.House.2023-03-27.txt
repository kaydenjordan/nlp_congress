 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that  all Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend  their remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of this  Special Order.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today to coanchor  this CBC Special Order alongside the Honorable Cori Bush of Missouri,  founder of the first Congressional Caucus for the Equal Rights  Amendment.   For the next 60 minutes, members of the CBC have an opportunity to  speak directly to the American people on finally getting the equal  rights across the finish line and recognized as the 28th amendment to  the U.S. Constitution, 100 years after it was first introduced in the  House of Representatives, an issue of great importance to the  Congressional Black Caucus, Congress, the constituents we represent,  and all Americans.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate and honor the incredible  efforts of African-American women who have advocated for the equal  rights amendment, ERA, throughout history. Their resilience, passion,  and determination have driven the relentless pursuit of gender equality  and justice for all.   In the 1970s, prominent Black women like Pauli Murray, Shirley  Chisholm, Flo Kennedy, and Barbara Jordan were instrumental in  advancing the cause of women's rights and the ERA.   When the 28th amendment is finally recognized as part of the United  States Constitution, Black women deserve to have significant credit for  its passage. Their legacy reminds us of the power of unity, conviction,  and perseverance in the face of adversity. Let us not forgot the  profound words of feminist lawyer and civil rights advocate, Pauli  Murray, who testified for the ERA at a 1970  [[Page H1457]]  Senate Judiciary Committee hearing. She said, ``As a constitutional  lawyer, a woman, and a Black person, I can say with conviction that  Black women as a group have the most to gain from the adoption of the  equal rights amendment.''   Let us draw strength from these words of Congresswoman Shirley  Chisholm, who proclaimed in her speech in 1970, ``I am for the equal  rights amendment.''   ``This is what it comes down to: artificial distinctions between  persons must be wiped out of the law. Legal discrimination between the  sexes is, in almost every instance, founded on outmoded views of  society and the prescientific beliefs about psychology and physiology.  It is time to sweep away these relics of the past and set future  generations free of them.''   Mr. Speaker, let us be inspired by the words of Representative  Barbara Jordan, who said, ``The equal rights amendment is a mandate for  change. It is a standard by which to measure our future legal and  social constructs. . . . The equal rights amendment is for men and  women. It is a constructive force for liberating the minds of men and  the place of women. It is inclusive.''   As we pay tribute to these trailblazing Black women, it is crucial to  recognize that the fight for gender and racial equality is still  ongoing. The number of Black women in Congress remains  disproportionately low compared to the diverse population they  represent.   As of today, only 57 women of African-American ancestry out of 12,505  people who have served in this august body have ever served in this  Congress, a mere fraction of the total number of Representatives and  Senators who have shared and served throughout our Nation's history.   Only two African-American women have ever served in the Senate and  none in the Governor's mansion. The Senator is Democrat Carol Moseley  Braun of Illinois, elected in 1992, and current Vice President, Mrs.  Kamala Harris.   This underrepresentation is a call to action for all of us, a  reminder that we must continue to strive for a government that is truly  representative of the people it serves. We must also recognize that the  fight for gender and racial equality is not limited to the Halls of  Congress.   Across our Nation, countless Black women and women of color continue  to face barriers in access to education and access to healthcare and  access to employment opportunities and access to equal pay.   The struggle for justice and equality is a daily battle fought by  millions of women who refuse to be silenced or sidelined in their  pursuit of a more just and inclusive society. It is our responsibility  as citizens and as leaders to ensure that the voices of Black women and  women of color are heard, their concerns are addressed, and their  contributions are acknowledged and celebrated.   We must work together to dismantle the systems of oppression and  discrimination that continue to hold back so many of our sisters,  daughters, and mothers from reaching their full potential. As we  continue to push forward, let us remember the words of the great civil  rights leader, Reverend Martin Luther King, who said, ``The arc of the  moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.''   Let us then bend that arc toward justice together and make the equal  rights amendment a reality for all.   In the name of all those who have fought for justice, for equality,  and for the rights of women, let us say amen.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Ms. Bush).
