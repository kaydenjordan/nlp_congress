 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 100th  anniversary of Kettering University. Located in the heart of Flint, MI,  Kettering University provides world-class education and has helped  propel students into careers that sit on the forefront of innovation.   In 1919, in the infancy of what would become the automotive  stronghold within Southeast Michigan, Kettering University began as the  School of Automobile Trades, eventually renamed the Flint Institute of  Technology, under the direction of Mr. Albert Sobey, who trained  mechanics and engineers for Buick.   The General Motors Corporation would then take over administering the  institute, establishing the General Motors Institute, GMI. The  institute continued to train not only engineers and mechanics but also  managers and administrative staff. This training was highly successful,  and in 1945, GMI added a fifth-year thesis requirement and became a  degree-granting college.   Due to innovation through the 1950s and 1960s, GMI continued to  evolve with the inclusion of majors such as electrical engineering and  added over 70 new courses. Presidents Guy R. Cowing and Harold P.  Rodes--who updated labs, equipment, and began building the campus as we  know it today--added buildings such as the Campus Center and Thompson  Residence Hall.   In the early 1980s, GM divested itself, which led to GMI becoming a  private, nonproft university, but it was not until 1998 that the  institution changed its name a final time to honor one of the founders  of the institution, Charles Kettering, who was an early and strong  proponent of professional cooperative education. Kettering University  continued to grow and develop as technologies and advancements changed  throughout the late 1980s and 1990s.   Today, Kettering University offers a variety of programs in addition  to engineering related programs which include pre-med, bioinformatics,  engineering, physics, and the expansion of their business program,  including a master of business administration degree. Kettering  University continues to evolve to meet the needs of a technology- infused and rapidly changing society, whether in the automotive  industry or in science and business. This includes new projects such as  the GM Mobility Research Center and ventures into autonomous vehicles  as well as artificial intelligence.   In addition to their academic initiatives, Kettering University has  consistently given back to the Flint community through service and  community engagement. Kettering helped establish the University Avenue  Corridor Coalition to beautify and draw investment to the area.  Students continue to give back through community service, whether it is  helping to clean up a yard or engineering a solution to aid the greater  community. During the height of the Flint water crisis, when the  community was in dire need of assistance, a group of Kettering's  engineering students took action and developed an adapter to allow  water filters to be accommodated to all types of faucets.   Kettering University has become a hub of modernization and  inventiveness, proven by their ranking as fourth in the country in  producing alumni who hold patents. Kettering's alumni have become  leaders in a variety of fields and lead notable organizations such as  Henry Juszkiewicz, who is the former chairman and CEO of Gibson Guitar,  James McCaslin, former President and COO of Harley-Davidson  [[Page S6089]]  Motor Company, and Mary Barra, current chairman and CEO of General  Motors Corporation. Kettering's graduates have reshaped industries and  continue to do so today.   Throughout its 100-year history, Kettering University has fostered an  environment of innovation, ingenuity, and community. The university is  deeply rooted in the city of Flint and has been an indispensable  partner in the city's development and renewal. I ask my colleagues to  join me in recognizing this important milestone in the history of  Kettering University as it celebrates its centennial.                            ____________________
