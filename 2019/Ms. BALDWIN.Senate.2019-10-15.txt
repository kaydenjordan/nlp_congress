 Mr. President, I rise on behalf of nearly 25,000 workers  and retirees in Wisconsin who have paid into the Central States Pension  Fund.   It has been 3\1/2\ years since the Treasury Department denied an  application by the Central States Pension Fund to slash pensions that  had already been earned by thousands of plan members. In that time,  retirees have organized at home. They have called on their Members of  Congress. They have also come to Washington countless times--all to  remind us of the promises they were made when they earned their  pensions and to fight for a solution to this looming crisis.  [[Page S5784]]    I have been proud to work side by side with Wisconsin workers and  retirees and with Senator Brown to introduce the Butch Lewis Act. This  legislation will put failing multiemployer pension plans, including  Central States, back on solid ground, and it does so without cutting  the pensions retirees have earned.   (The remarks of Ms. Baldwin pertaining to the introduction of S. 2598  are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills  and Joint Resolutions.'')    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I introduce my legislation today to help  shore up the government's insurance plan for these pensions. The  Pension Stability Act would add funding to the Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation's multiemployer program by imposing a fee on financial  firms that are convicted of financial crimes.   This weekend, I was in Endeavor, WI. I was meeting there with  retirees who meet once a month at the fire station in order to update  one another on the progress here in Washington. In the months since the  House passed the Butch Lewis Act, there hasn't been much progress to  speak of. The Senate hasn't taken up the bill, and no other proposals  have been presented. All the while, retirees and workers in the Central  States Pension Fund continue to doubt their retirement security.   If Washington does not act, workers and retirees face massive cuts to  the pensions they have earned over decades of hard work. I have come to  the floor many times over these past 3\1/2\ years to remind this body  about the retirees who stand to lose 50 percent--some more than 50  percent--of their pensions if Washington fails to act. Since then,  nothing has been done, so I am here to, once again, remind my  colleagues that this is about a promise that must be kept.   This is about a promise made to Bob Brockway, who stands to lose more  than half of his monthly pension. Bob retired in 1999. He has made the  trip to Washington to be a part of the solution even though Margie, his  wife, would rather he stayed at home. He also organizes the meetings  that are held every month in Endeavor.   This is about a promise made to Thomas from Hartland, WI. Thomas is a  72-year-old retired semitruck driver and an Army veteran.   He is also a cancer patient, and his wife has significant medical  bills.   Thomas wrote to me this summer. He said:         I've put many, much-needed home repairs on hold since this       whole mess started. We have had no vacations or any other       extravagances since I retired. We did nothing wrong. We paid       into Central States and somehow the government dropped the       ball.    This is about a promise made to Donald and his wife Janet in Beaver  Dam, WI. Donald wrote to me to tell me the following:         After 25 years working at a company where I earned a       pension as part of a wage and benefit package, I retired. I       retired four years ago because my body wouldn't let me       perform tasks in the factory that could more easily be       performed in my younger years. My pension and Social Security       allow me to pay for heat, electricity, food and maintenance       on my home. A 50 percent reduction in my monthly pension       payment would mean we could no longer afford visiting our       children or grandchildren, buying Christmas and birthday       gifts, or seeing an occasional movie. And without this       pension, I doubt we could afford the most basic of household       expenditures.    This is about a promise made to Mary in Greenfield, WI. Mary wrote to  tell me the following:         My story is simple. In November 2014, my husband passed       away. In December, I learned the bad news about my pension.       Worrying all this time has taken its toll. What will I be       able to afford? I will probably have to move. I need a new       car, but that's on hold. The list goes on. I am turning 70 in       a few days and I never thought at this age I would have to       worry about how I will survive.    If Washington does not act, we will be breaking a promise made to 1.5  million retirees nationwide. Pension promises must be kept. So once  again I will say: Washington needs to act, and we need to do it now.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN:   S. 2600. A bill to promote minimum State requirements for the  prevention and treatment of concussions caused by participation in  school sports, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health,  Education, Labor, and Pensions.
