 Mr. Speaker, I don't know if I can top my friend from  California's great white shark attack or talking about airline delays,  but we are going to do something that is particularly amusing and fun.  We are going to talk about why the fiscal house of the United States is  collapsing.   For a number of folks who have watched my floor presentations, a lot  of this is going to be familiar.   This is a primer, particularly for our new Members. Right now, we  have hundreds and hundreds of new staff with the new Members here in  the House of Representatives. Hopefully, on the thousand-some  televisions around the campus where you have C-SPAN on, please, if you  actually are interested, if you really want to understand how much  trouble we are in, give me a few minutes of your time. Actually, give  me almost an hour of your time.   Let's sort of walk through the reality. I am going to walk through  some of the solutions that are absolutely wrong, and then we are going  to talk a little bit about the reality of the math; and the punch line  we are going to come back to multiple times, is really simple.    The primary driver of U.S. sovereign debt is our demographics. Those  of us who are baby boomers, we got old. And the political class here,  unless we are willing to tell the truth, there is no path to saving us  from a failed bond auction, a failed debt crisis, a world where we all  live dramatically poorer. And it doesn't have to be that way.   Look, I know I am a broken record, but damn it, somehow, we have got  to get this to start to sink in. So let's actually walk through some of  the reality.   I always start with this chart because it is just easy to get your  head around. This is 2022.   Now, the funny thing is, it looks like 2023, the percentage that is  mandatory, that means it is on autopilot. Members here, people like me,  we won't vote on it. This is Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid. These  things that are a formula.   This percentage actually went down in this budget year. It is not  going down because we are spending less money; it is because we are  spending so much more money on discretionary, it actually took several  points more of the percentage of spending.   Now, a lot of that was one-time spending. We will fade back down, but  you got to get your head around the majority. The vast majority of U.S.  spending is what we call mandatory. It is entitlements. It is you get  because you work so many quarters. It is because you turned a certain  age, because you are a certain Tribal group, because you are a certain  level of poverty, you get these benefits, and they are automatic. It is  a formula.   And then over here, you see this little green part, that is  discretionary. That is what we call nondefense discretionary. This is  what everyone thinks of as government. That is your foreign aid, that  is your FBI, that is the IRS, that is all of those things.   And here the blue, that is defense. I am going to show you in some  charts later, my brothers and sisters on the left, will often throw out  rhetoric of cut out defense, get rid it.   Believe it or not, it is not even enough money to keep us in balance.  You could get rid of every dime of defense. There needs to be an  understanding of reality. Your government is an insurance company with  an Army. I know that sounds like trying to be somewhat humorous, but it  happens to be the truth.   Think of it that way. So what is the primary drive, if I came to you  right now and said, you are a new Member of Congress, you have made a  passionate pitch to your voters that you are going take on the deficit.   Did you stand in front of your voters and tell them over the next 30  years, 100 percent of the deficit is Medicare and Social Security? The  rest of the budget, according to the Congressional Budget Office,  actually has a positive balance.   Over the next 30 years, and this is based on the 2022 numbers, with  inflation some of this is actually worse today. And we are not going to  get the updated numbers till probably mid-February using the  Congressional Budget Office.   Functionally, the shortfall of Medicare is about 75 percent of all of  our borrowing. The shortfall of Social Security--and the reason you put  that on there, understand, look at the Social Security actuary report.  It is not Republican; it is not Democrat. These are people that  actually own calculators.   With the COLA that was just given, you lost almost a full year of  life. So there is this trust fund. Yes, it is Social Security money  that we have paid in over the years. It is in loan to the Treasury. The  Treasury gives special Social Security T bills and then when Social  Security needs money, they cash them in with Treasury. Fine.   And then, actually, the Treasury goes out and borrows other money.  That money runs out in about 10 years. Two years ago, I believe, the  Social Security actuary report said, when the trust fund runs out, our  brothers and sisters who are 65 and older or who are 62 and older or  whoever are just taking a Social Security check will get about a 27  percent cut.   I think last year's actuary report said about 25 percent cut. It is  based on--here is our projection of the revenue and FICA taxes we take  in today, and then it goes out the door.   There is some data out there that says 10 years from now, unless we  fix Social Security, you are going to double poverty among seniors.  What is the moral aspect there? How many of this body are ready to  actually deal with the political nightmare cascade of the trolls who  lie--oh, excuse me--the politicians, trying to tell the truth about a  multi-multi-multi-multitrillion-dollar system that is out of money and  the negative shortfall. You do understand, I think the model said like  in the next 60 years, 65 years, it is like $212 trillion short.  [[Page H196]]    That is just the Social Security trust fund, and it is gone in about  10 years. It lost almost a full year of actuarial life with this year's  COLA.   These are the things that we are here to fix instead of the trite  crap we come behind these microphones and talk about. These are the  things that destroy a society because it breaks our promises.   Don't laugh at me. My wife and I are both 60 and I have a 6-month- old. We adopted another child. When my 6-month-old is 25 years old, two  things: We either blow up the debt and deficit, which we are probably  going to do that, too, or double the U.S. taxes.   When he is 25 years old, we have to double corporate taxes, import  fees, tariffs, everything else, every we call a receipt, we got to  double.   It means top marginal rates like 70-something percent. That is just  the Federal. Do you understand what these numbers mean? This was based  on having $114 trillion of borrowing in today's dollars, and these  calcs were done before this inflationary cycle.   This is what takes down a republic. How serious is this body really  about telling the truth about the math?                                time  1715    Let's walk through the fragility. Once again, I am doing this  substantially for the new Members and the new staff here to understand  what reality is. All day long, you are going to get pitched by people  with shiny objects or: ``I need you to regulate this so I don't get  competition in my business in the home district.'' ``I want some free  money.'' ``I want you to give me a grant.'' We get this inbound all day  long.   We get the crazy conspiracy theory that has nothing to do with  reality, and that consumes our time instead of thinking about this math  and coming up with actual solutions.   We have come to this floor over and over with solutions, except it  seems to terrify our brothers and sisters here because it means, A,  telling the truth about the math, and then it means we have to do  things really differently. You have to legalize technology. You have to  legalize the disruption because it is not about changing who pays.   Before I do this, let me see if I can explain this. For my fans on  the left who love ObamaCare, the ACA, understand that it is a financing  bill. It just moves the money around. I get subsidized over here, but  this group has to pay.   The brilliant Republican alternative was a financing bill. Now, we  actually did a more elegant job of spreading it along the curve so you  got some efficiency, but it was still a financing bill. It is who had  to pay and who got subsidized.   Medicare for All is a financing bill.   None of those ideas in regard to healthcare change what we pay. They  just move around who pays. Until the conversation becomes about what we  pay, you can't save us because the debt doesn't change.   With my very last board, I am going to do something that is a little  cranky and a little mean. I am going to make fun of some of my own  work, but I am going to tell the truth that a lot of times when we talk  10 years to balance, you do realize one of the things we are doing is  saying we are going to take this portion of the spending and are just  going to give it back to the State.   We are going to take this portion of the spending and make the users  of Medicare, or users of this group, we are going to make the  individuals pay. We are going to take it off the Federal books, but we  don't change the spending as you would do the calculation as a  percentage of the GDP, or gross domestic product.   That is what is so important here. Unless we legalize the disruption,  and do this quickly--I had a meeting earlier in my office today with  someone that is really smart. He has been here for a long time. He is a  medical doctor. He is one of my favorite Members: David, you have to go  slower. People aren't going to embrace it. The bureaucracy is going to  fight you. Do you know how many vested interests there are in the  lobbyist class and down on K Street?   We are watching the numbers erode. I am going to show you a slide  here that, structurally, 10 years from now, we may have a structural $2  trillion a year deficit. That is the structural deficit, and half of  that will be just interest.   Is this body ready to tell the truth about the math? Because the math  will always win.   One of the other things that terrifies me here is that we are not  telling the truth about the fragility of interest rates. I am going to  do two or three slides here, but you start to look at what happens if  interest rates are up. Rising interest rates could push up the national  debt toward 300 percent.   Get this. If the mean interest is 3 points over what CBO projected  last year, which, believe it or not, is actually closer to the mean of  interest we have paid over the last 30 years, so we go back to what was  normal for the last 30 years, we are at 345 percent of debt to GDP. It  is all gone.   If you care about the poor, there is no more money for them. If you  care about defense, there is no more money. Basically, every dime is  just covering interest. Government is gone.   The fantasy that goes on around here of let's talk about shiny  objects but avoid the real crisis ahead of us--I am going to show a  bunch of slides that the Democrats' proposals of raising taxes doesn't  work and a bunch of the Republican ideas of let's get rid of waste and  fraud. We will get rid of foreign aid.   Do you realize every dime of foreign aid covers about 12 days of  borrowing? Last year, we borrowed $43,600 a second.   How much of the conversation here is about my little Matthew, who is  6 months old? What is his future like?   Does anyone here give a damn about your kids, your grandkids, your  own retirement?   This is everything. This will take us down. Will this body take it  seriously?   You start to look at the charts. This is where we are at right now.  Understand, the CBO model is now starting to look at that 10 years from  now, 2032. That may seem like forever, but it is 10 years. What were  you doing 10 years ago? Do you remember? It wasn't that long ago.   We are heading toward a structural cost just over $1 trillion, just  in interest, just the interest cost. Now, add on another $1 trillion  interest in spending, and remember, in that 10 years, just Medicare and  a portion of Medicaid go up $1.1 trillion. The total budget 10 years  from now goes up, I think, just a little less. The CBO model from a  year ago was about $2 trillion more that we are spending.   We take in about half a trillion-plus more on due tax receipts. It  basically means you are heading toward a structural deficit close to $2  trillion a year, and that is the baseline.   Now, how many of you ran for office here and said, ``I am going to  balance the budget''? Okay. Your structural deficit 10 years from now  is $2 trillion. What are you about to do? ``I am going to move it to  the States and let them pay for it. I am going to play a shell game. I  am going to tell my voters it is waste and fraud. I am going to tell my  voters I need to tax businesses more.''    We got old. I am sorry, but go back to that second slide. Every dime  of the borrowing for the next 30 years is three-quarters Medicare, one- quarter Social Security.   Look at the comments that will be on the video of this and people  say: ``Oh, that is not true. Get rid of Ukraine.'' Fine, strip it, but  you just got rid of 12 days, 14 days of borrowing.   It is this lack of ability to do math here, but I am glad everyone  gets their feelings satiated.   You have to understand this is the baseline we are at right now.  Thirty years from now, half of all tax receipts go just to interest. In  Ways and Means, we call it tax receipts, tax revenues, whatever you  want to call it. Half of it.   There is a model out there that if we are 2 points higher than the  CBO model, in 30 years--it actually comes closer to 25 years--all  receipts, if we kept the same tax code so all the things expire, all  the tax reforms, we go back to the bad old days, and we have 2-point  higher interest rates, so that is still lower than the previous 30-year  mean. Every dime of tax receipts in about 25, 28 years, every dime goes  just to cover interest. There is no more government. We are nothing  more than a bond house paying out interest.   Does anyone here understand this? Doesn't this make anyone nervous?  Am I the only idiot getting up here and  [[Page H197]]  trying to point it out, saying we are going to fall off the cliff? Does  anyone else care?   This is the stuff that is real, but we are going to have a great  conversation of virtue signaling probably over the next couple of  weeks.   The math is out there for everyone. Anyone that is watching, just go  to CBO, some of the other groups that give a darn about the debt. It is  all over the charts. You can get emails every single day talking about  what is happening and the differentials.   We all ignore it because it is really uncomfortable to go home and  stand in front of an audience of your voters and tell them the truth  because we have lied to them for so long.   The Federal Government has a spending problem. Now, this may not look  like a lot, but you start to look at average tax receipts. I have two  or three slides that if you ever want to argue this--I have done this  with leftist groups trying to show when we raise taxes and when we  lower taxes, we always get within a certain band of about 18 to 20  percent of tax receipts in as part of the size of the economy.   There is just this sort of law of physics and taxes. You raise taxes  really high; the economy and growth slows down; you get 18 to 20  percent of GDP in taxes. You lower taxes; economy grows; you get about  18 to 20 percent in taxes to GDP. It is just about 100 years' worth of  data, okay? It is what it is.   What is happening is our spending, you see this huge spike there.  That is COVID. We went to crazy town. It became an excuse to fund every  dream, every group, trying to buy the vote for you.   Then, you go back to our baseline, and that baseline grows and grows.  You have to understand that spending here, in just about 10 years,  crosses about 25 percent of the entire economy. Yet, our best model is  we might be getting 18, 19 percent of the economy in taxes. That  differential year after year buries us.   It is not falling revenues. Look at it. Even in the long term, the  best CBO data still has us hovering around 19 percent of the economy in  tax receipts, and it is within the mean of functioning since the 1960s.   There were years here where we had very high marginal tax rates, some  years where we had very low marginal tax rates, and look at the band.   Do you see, if I go way out, if I go out to 30 years, our spending  hits 30 percent of the entire economy? Thirty percent of the entire  economy is spending, and every dime of this growth out here is  demographics. It will be the shortfall of Social Security and Medicare.   Why is that so hard? It is not Republican or Democrat. We got gray.  Look at my hair.   There are fixes. I have come here dozens of times. I have walked  through innovative solutions that disrupt the price of healthcare, that  disrupt the bureaucracy, that make us more efficient, that make us  grow. We ignore them because, it turns out, complex problems require  complex solutions, and it is not one magic bullet.   I am sorry. Am I allowed to say ``bullet''? It is not one magic  solution.   It turns out you have to do a dozen things, and you have to do them  all at once. Yes, you have to fix immigration. You have to legalize  technology. You have to change the way bureaucracies work so that  bureaucracies start using these supercomputers to collect data instead  of making you fill out paperwork.   There are solutions out there, but damn it, this place needs to get  rid of its 1990s solution and join this century.   I bring this board just to knock down one of my leftist friends who  always said, ``But you guys did tax reform, and you cut receipts.'' We  are taking in $1 trillion more a year today than we did the year after  tax reform.   It is spending $1 trillion more today, so that is like a 25 percent  growth in receipts, in revenues, in tax receipts post-tax reform  within, functionally, 4 years.   Don't tell me it is the tax reform because the tax reform grew the  size of the economy. Do you remember what it did to the Social Security  trust fund? It saved us for a couple of years because there were so  many people working.   Could you imagine if we hadn't had the tax reform when we hit the  pandemic? Could you imagine, if we hadn't had that healthy economy,  what the numbers would have looked like?   I am sorry, I know this is repetitive, but there is a reason I am  saying it over and over. I am trying to break through to people who  have never really thought about the truth of the math.   Eliminating every dime of defense, in the long term, does nothing.  Think about that. Here is defense. Defense is going to be sitting  around 2.7 percent of GDP, and we are heading toward a time where just  Social Security and the healthcare entitlements out here are over 15  percent of the size of the economy.                                time  1730    So defense is under 3 percent of the size of the economy, just Social  Security and the health entitlements are over 15.   Does anyone see the issue?   But, yet, I will have my brothers and sisters on the left say: It is  defense, we need to cut it. Fine. It doesn't do anything. The scale of  the dollars is so out of control, we have got to stop living in a  fantasy world.   I know it is good politics. I know it is good virtue signaling. You  get your reporters and constituents at home going: Yay, that is true.  None of them own a calculator and if they do there are no batteries in  it.   You have got to understand, entitlement programs--I don't like it  when you call these entitlement programs; call them anything you want;  call them mandatory spending; Call them earned benefits, they are  earned benefits--it is a societal problem. I don't give a damn what you  call them, it is still about the spending.   You need to take a look at what it is driving. Over here is the  growth over those years: defense, just Social Security, other  mandatory, Medicare, all these, the growth in these mandatories here.   How many Members here are bold enough to tell the truth?   Because when you tell the truth on this stuff you get attack adds,  you get groups that raise money, lie about it, beat the crap out of you  if you are a Member of Congress. I can't talk about that, David. In  that case, you can't actually talk about the debt and deficits.   Medicare. Medicare. Medicare. Much of my life I have done healthcare  finance. As a child, I was in my State legislature for a couple terms  and I was working on our Medicaid system. Even then, you'd have the  experts come sit you down, and say: You do realize how much trouble we  are in.   Well, here we are 30 some years later. Look at the curve. The curve.  This isn't that long from now. We are looking at numbers that are only  functionally a decade from now. This drives all policies. If you are a  Member and say: I care about the environment.   Where are you going to get the money?   I care about defense.   Where are you going to get the money?   Healthcare is consuming everything.   I believe CBO in a couple weeks is going to update these numbers and  they are going to look much uglier. We have some of the back-of-the- napkin math we have done with the Joint Economic Committee, but I used  last year's CBO number for this chart.   Here is my point, once again: Over the next decade there is  functionally a trillion dollars of additional spending on Medicare. If  you add in Medicare and Medicaid, it is one-something. Take a look  here. When you get out here, this is a $1.1 trillion increase, that is  nine budget cycles from now. It is not 10 years. It is nine budget  cycles from now.   So if I came to you and you saw the earlier chart, it said, okay, a  decade from now if the nominal interest rates stay where they are at,  our interest cost is $1 trillion a year a decade from now. Now my  additional spending on Medicare and Medicaid is an additional trillion  dollars.   Does anyone start to see where a structural deficit of $2 trillion a  year is?   Now, you promised your voters you are going to balance the budget.   What are you going to do?   Just stop paying the interest on our debt? Okay.   Stop paying Medicare? Stop paying Medicaid? Fine.   How about Social Security?  [[Page H198]]    Because remember, 10 years from now the trust fund is gone. Our  brothers and sisters who are on Social Security that rely on it are  going to take what, around a 25 percent cut.   Are we going to let that happen?   It is coming. The math is real. You can't pretend it away. And you  start to look at some of the lunacy that we get from our friends on the  left. Oh, let's just tax more. Even a 100 percent tax rate on small  businesses and upper-income families, you can't even come close. So  take all their money, and just assume that you live in some magic  fantasy world where everyone keeps working. Let's live in fantasy.   This is what you get. My spending in 30 years is--my borrowing is  about 12.4 percent of GDP. If I take every dime of someone who makes  $500,000 or more, the next dollar, we just take it, you get about 5  percent of GDP, and that is pretending people would keep working. The  math is the math, and we need to stop lying.   Look, if you don't believe me, you go look up CBO. Go to Brian Riedl,  Manhattan Institute, he does a beautiful job of taking OMB data, CBO  data, some of the others out there, and puts it on charts so that it is  absorbable. He walks through all of your solutions.   What if we repeal the tax cuts and raise the taxes on low-income  people?   How about if you get rid of every tax idea that is out there?   All the Democrat solutions. You still fall incredibly short. You get  a fraction of what is required. You go on some of the other solutions  that have been offered. No easy pay-fors for Social Security or  Medicare programs. Everything falls short. I need more than 6 percent  of GDP. And if I take almost every solution, I only pick up a fraction  of that. The math is the math, and the math will win.   Now, here is the point where I am going to make some of my own  friends on my side a little cranky; I am going to tell the truth. Many  of the solutions we run around here and tout: We are going to balance  in 7 years. We are going to balance in 10 years.   Do you understand the fraud?   We say: Well, we are going to cut Medicare. Okay. We are going to  shift it to the individual. We are going to do this. We are going to  take Medicaid and we are just going to cut our spending because we  handed it back to the States. They are shell-gaming the math. They  are not willing to actually tell the system we are going to legalize  technology.    This exists today. The thing that looks like a large kazoo, you can  blow into it, it tells you you have a virus. It bangs off your phone to  know you are not allergic to certain antivirals, and orders your  antivirals, allowing that algorithm, that technology, to write a  prescription.   You can't do that?   Why?   Do you know anyone with a diabetic pump?   All day long that algorithm is prescribing to them.   We have got to get this out because if you can't have that type of  technology disruption--my other idea is a much grander theory.   Five percent of our brothers and sisters who have multiple chronic  conditions are over half of our healthcare spending. We are in the time  of miracles where we are seeing cures. We, as a body, need to basically  do an Operation Warp Speed as a way to save ourselves from our own  crushing debt. Bring those cures.   If it is true that a San Diego company--which has just been bought up  and was working with CRISPR--has now cured about a half a dozen people  of type 1 diabetes--and we are trying to bring out one of their  researchers to come talk to us in February--if it is true, if there is  just the slightest opening of a door, there is a path there.   I know that is type 1. I know type 2 we have our health issues. What  we do in our farm bill--the fact that so much of our society has become  almost self-destructive with obesity--yes, I may have just hurt your  feelings--but dammit, when government has to pay 70 percent of all  healthcare costs, we as a society should care.   I represent the population of probably the second highest per capita  diabetes in the world, one of my Tribal communities in Arizona. When I  meet people who are blind in that community, who have lost parts of  their feet, is that compassion?   So what would happen if we can marry up legalizing the technology  that will make your life easier and more convenient and make you  healthier?   Yes, it means that you don't walk into the urgent care center,  because you have a breath biopsy in your home medicine cabinet.  Legalize the technology.   Then we push as hard as we can, if we are in the age of miracles,  cure, cure, cure because that is more moral and compassionate. And,  dammit, it has an amazing effect on U.S. debt.   Do you remember how many times I showed you that 31 percent of all  Medicare spending is related to diabetes? What would happen if you cut  half of that?   Yes, it is lifestyle. Yes, it is what people eat. Yes, it is  exercise.   What would happen if we can give people back islet cells that produce  insulin again?   We found a way to cure hepatitis C. When I first got here, this body  was getting ready to try to figure out how to have hundreds of  thousands of people get liver transplants, and it was going to bankrupt  Medicaid systems all over the country. Then someone came up with a  hepatitis C cure. It was really expensive, and we bitched about the  cost of it, except for the fact that it cured them. And 7 months later  there was a second drug that crashed the price.   Was that moral?   Of course it was.   Was it really good economics?   Was it just compassion?   Yes.   I need this to become part of our lexicon that the solution is  disruption through technology. Optionality. But it is also the morality  of we need to push those cures out because it is really good economics.   Instead of giving lists of things of here is how we are going to cut  the debt and deficit, we are just going to shift it to someone else to  spend.   Is this body--and particularly to the freshmen and the freshmen staff  that I have been trying to talk to with this speech--this will be the  most important stuff you deal with in your time here. It is not the  shiny object that may get you on FOX News tonight. It is not the shiny  object that gets you applause when you go into your townhall meeting.  Oh, we did this.   This stuff is hard. It is complicated. You are going to be lobbied  like a war. They are going to spend money in your district beating the  crap out of you because you are taking away their money.   It also saves this country and gives my little Matthew, who is 6  months old, a future. That is the morality.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the  House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m. tomorrow.
