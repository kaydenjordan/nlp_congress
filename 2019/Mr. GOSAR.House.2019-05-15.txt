 Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Bishop for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the current form of  H.R. 375.   In 1988, Congress enacted the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, or IGRA,  with the intent to restrict casinos to Tribes' original reservations.  H.R. 375 reverses a major 2009 Supreme Court decision, and the bill  would lead to future abuses of IGRA.   The bill gives unelected bureaucrats a blank check to take any land  in trust without respect for impacted communities, including other  Tribes. More importantly, H.R. 375 allows reservation shopping and for  lands to be taken into trust for off-reservation casinos in places  where States, local governments, and other Tribes oppose such action.   H.R. 375 will result in a flood of new off-reservation casinos that  cause harm to States and local communities. Many of these casino  locations that are nowhere near Tribes' historic reservations will be  handpicked by gambling investors and Washington bureaucrats.   If H.R. 375 passes, all Tribes would have to do in order to get land  taken into trust and open off-reservation casinos is to show that they  are federally recognized by the Department of the Interior.   In the Natural Resources Committee markup of this bill, the gentleman  from the Second District of California, Mr. Huffman, and I engaged in a  productive debate on this bill. We both agreed to try to find common  ground on which to respond to my concerns about off-reservation casino  abuse and the valid concerns brought to the committee by State and  county governments. Bringing H.R. 375 up via suspension this week and  not allowing any amendments prohibits us from making good on that  agreement.   H.R. 375 should have been amended prior to being brought to the floor  to address these bipartisan concerns.   Taking land into trust divests the affected State and local  governments of jurisdiction. When land is taken into trust, for  example, the Tribe will not pay any applicable taxes on the land, but  the county or city in which the land is located might nonetheless be  required to supply the Tribe with county and city services, and non- Tribal residents will pay for it. At least consultation should be a  minimum.   The bill as currently drafted therefore increases the power of an  unelected bureaucracy to divest nonconsenting State and local  governments of jurisdiction over their land. This, by itself, is a  great cause of concern.    Let's be clear about H.R. 375 and how a bill of this scope and  magnitude deserves more careful consideration than is being given here  today.   Currently, there are almost 600 recognized Tribes in the United  States, about 240 of which have gaming operations. H.R. 375 removes the  dam that provided some restraint on the number of Tribal casinos and  would be a dramatic departure from existing Federal law that has been  in place for almost a century.   Before voting on this bill, I hope Members all understand that H.R.  375 will open the floodgates to off-reservation Tribal casinos all over  the United States. If H.R. 375 passes, all federally recognized Tribes  will be eligible to receive land in trust and potentially open off- reservation casinos. This includes any Tribe recognized by the  Department of the Interior that was ineligible to receive land in trust  and/or was denied land in trust prior to H.R. 375.   According to the National Indian Gaming Commission fact sheet, as of  2016, approximately 329, or 58 percent, of the recognized Tribes had no  gaming operations.   President Trump opposes H.R. 312 and with good reason. That bill  gives land in trust and a casino to a single Tribe that is otherwise  ineligible to receive those benefits, as well as reverses Federal court  and Interior decisions. But H.R. 375 does all that and more.   Instead of giving land in trust to only one Tribe, it lets an  unelected bureaucracy give whatever land it wants to all recognized  Tribes. Thus, the same concerns that exist with respect to H.R. 312,  which we will be talking later about, exist at an even greater level  with respect to H.R. 375.   The purpose of considering bills under suspension is to dispose of  noncontroversial measures expeditiously, but H.R. 375 has controversy  written all over it.   H.R. 375 has ridden alongside H.R. 312 largely unnoticed, and no one  has pointed out two crucial facts: one, that it exists as a contingency  plan in case its sister bill, H.R. 312, fails; and two, that its effect  would be national rather than local.   H.R. 375 and H.R. 312 are two heads of the same snake, one large, one  small. Senator Warren, regardless, will get her casino if either bill  passes.                                time  1415    Further, passage of H.R. 375 will allow for new off-reservation  casinos to be opened in your States and communities and for land to be  ripped away from local jurisdictions without recourse.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Bishop for the opportunity to  [[Page H3816]]  speak on this important issue. I urge all Members to vote ``no'' on  H.R. 375. Send it back to get consultation, at least, put in.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume in  strong opposition to H.R. 312.   H.R. 312 is contrary to the view of the Department of the Interior.  It contradicts a Supreme Court decision and aims to reverse Federal  court decisions on this matter in order to build a massive 400,000- square-foot, off-reservation gaming complex for the benefit of Genting,  a foreign Malaysian gaming company.   H.R. 312 creates two reservations for the Mashpee Tribe of  Massachusetts:   One reservation will be the town of Mashpee, the Tribe's historic  reservation lands. No casino will be allowed within the geographical  boundaries of the town of Mashpee.   The other reservation is, oddly, 50 miles away from Mashpee, in the  city of Taunton. This site is not part of the Tribe's historic  reservation and was selected by the Tribe and Genting for a billion- dollar casino project because of its proximity to the Providence, Rhode  Island, casino market, 20 miles distant.   There is no reason for the second reservation, other than to build an  off-reservation casino 50 miles away from the Mashpee Tribe, where they  currently reside. In fact, the new off-reservation casino will be only  20 miles from the New England Patriots' football stadium and, again, 50  miles from the Mashpees' historic reservation.   In 1988, Congress enacted the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, with the  intent to restrict casinos to Tribes' original reservations. By placing  land in  [[Page H3818]]  trust for the Mashpee Tribe for gaming in Taunton, H.R. 312 creates an  off-reservation casino, which is inconsistent with congressional  intent. This is often called reservation shopping, and it is an abuse  of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.   The Tribe's lawyers knew that reservation shopping was a political  headache, so they went to the bureaucrats within the BIA to obtain the  two reservations through administrative action. RedState recently  reported:         No one is more desperate for H.R. 312 to succeed than       Genting Malaysia. If the casino doesn't come through, the       Tribe doesn't have to pay Genting back the over half a       billion dollars it borrowed.    H.R. 312 is a financial bailout for Genting. The Tribe is swamped  with a $500 million-plus debt to Genting, and there is no way the Tribe  can ever pay this back and still make enough money to sustain itself.  Genting, therefore, will be the real owner of the project, not the  Tribe.   This kind of arrangement where the creditor practically controls the  financial future of a debtor Tribe is contrary to the Indian Gaming  Regulatory Act, which requires every Tribal casino to be 100 percent  tribally owned.   At the committee hearing on this bill, counsel for the Governor of  Rhode Island testified that H.R. 312 will cause the State significant  harm with regards to revenues for education, infrastructure, and social  programs and is contrary to the limitations contained in the Indian  Gaming Regulatory Act.   Moreover, the American Principles Project also reported on the ties  between convicted lobbyist Jack Abramoff and the Mashpee Wampanoag  Tribe, stating:         The expansive Abramoff investigation uncovered major       corruption within the Mashpee Wampanoag Tribe. Its chief,       Glenn Marshall, pled guilty in 2009 to multiple Federal       charges, including embezzling Tribal funds and campaign       finance violations committed while working with Abramoff to       secure the Federal recognition of the Tribe in 2007.    For my Republican colleagues: The bill was opposed by 10 of the 13  voting Republicans during the committee markup, including the ranking  member, Rob Bishop; President Trump tweeted that he opposed the bill  and urged Republicans to do the same; House Minority Whip Steve Scalise  also sent an email recommending Members vote ``no'' on H.R. 312. Do you  really want to vote for Elizabeth Warren's top Tribal priority?   For my Democratic colleagues: Representatives Cicilline and Langevin  strongly oppose this bill, and it is opposed by the Democratic Governor  of Rhode Island. The bill is also ``strenuously opposed'' by other  federally recognized Tribes in Massachusetts.   For Members on both sides of the aisle: Do you really want your name  tied to a Tribe that only received Federal recognition in 2007 as a  result of shady lobbying by Jack Abramoff? Do you really want to vote  for a $500 million bailout for a former gaming corporation?   In short, H.R. 312 authorizes an off-reservation casino, bails out a  foreign corporation from major financial problems of its own making,  reverses the judgment of a Federal court, and contradicts the Supreme  Court ruling.   Wow, all in one breath.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members on both sides of the aisle to vote  against H.R. 312, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I want to make sure that my colleagues on the  other side understand that, as the city of Mashpee, no one has any  problems, but it is the city of Taunton that is part of the problem,  and that is where we have the gist. So I caution them to watch their  rhetoric.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr.  Cole).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island so  that we may have a quick colloquy.   As the gentleman made mention, it was locals in Taunton that actually  sued; is that true?    I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island.    Does the gentleman think that the court in which they sued  had any of the information skewed in front of it, in front of their  jurisdiction?    All this information that we are hearing, that is myth  versus fact; is that true?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for engaging in the  colloquy, and I reserve the balance of my time.     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Langevin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the rhetoric coming from the other side is hot and heavy  like I don't know what I am talking about with Native American Tribes  when I have lived my whole life in association with Tribes. So let's  get through some of the false myths that are out here that continually  are being talked about.   Now, the myth is that Congress has done this for other Tribes, i.e,  we have heard about the Gun Lake Tribe.   Fact: That is false. This will be the first time, as my colleague  from Rhode Island said, that Congress would overturn a Federal Court  decision where the court ruled that the Tribe did not meet the Federal  standard to have land taken into trust, a State-recognized Tribe.   Myth: The Tribe is facing extinction unless Congress acts.   That would be false. The Mashpee Tribe will not lose its Federal  recognition and will continue to receive Federal benefits and funding  even if H.R. 312 does not pass. Further, if this is not solely about a  casino, then my amendment should have been considered and adopted in  committee. The amendment was a compromise that would have secured a  reservation for the Mashpee for all purposes but not gaming.   Myth number three: H.R. 312 is not a casino giveaway nor a case of  reservation shopping.   Fact: It is both. There is no reason for the second reservation other  than to build an off-reservation casino 50 miles away from where the  Mashpee Tribe currently resides. If this weren't solely about a casino,  then my amendment would have also been adopted in committee.   Myth: The two tracts of land in the town of Mashpee and the city of  Taunton both are sites within the Tribal historical territories. My  colleague from Massachusetts actually alluded to this.   That would be false. The Mashpee Tribe will build a massive, 400,000- square-foot, off-reservation casino away from their Tribal land on the  border. That would be Taunton, Rhode Island.   In 1988, Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act with the  intent to restrict casinos to Tribes' original reservations. By placing  land in trust for gaming in Taunton 50 miles away from the Tribe's  historic reservation--he also brought that point up, that it wasn't  their traditional land--what Congress intended in the Gaming Regulatory  Act would be severely harmed.    Myth: This bill has nothing to do with approving a specific casino  project.   Fact: We actually heard it again from the other side. If that were  the case, then my amendment would have been made in order and received  votes or deemed adopted at the committee level. The amendment would  have secured a reservation for the Mashpee Tribe for any nongaming  purposes.   These may include, but not be limited to, the construction and  operation of Tribal government facilities and infrastructure, housing,  a hospital, a school and library, a museum, a community center,  assisted living for Tribal elders, business development, natural  resources management, the Tribe's exercising its government  jurisdiction over Tribal members, and many other Tribal uses.   The next myth is that H.R. 312 is not a bailout.   H.R. 312 is not a bailout? In fact, the Malaysian hedge fund, Genting  Malaysia, that is underwriting the casino--yes, underwriting this  casino.  [[Page H3822]]    The Mashpee Tribe will not receive a penny of revenue from the casino  for many years, if ever, because of the massive size of the $500  million-plus debt they have incurred to Genting. Genting, therefore,  will be the real owner of the project, not the Tribe.   This kind of arrangement where the creditor practically controls the  financial future of a debtor Tribe is contrary to the Indian Gaming  Regulatory Act, which requires every Tribal casino to be 100 percent  tribally owned.   The last myth: The Mashpee Tribe will go bankrupt if H.R. 312 does  not pass.   Fact: The Mashpee Tribe will only be required to repay its debt to  the Malaysian company underwriting the deal if H.R. 312 is enacted and  the casino is approved.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I just want to address Congress' intent, under article  I, section 8.   As I said before, the Mashpee reservation of the city of Mashpee is  not of consequence. It is the area outside of their previous homeland  of Taunton that is of discussion. That is only the aspect here. What  has happened here is the bypassing of protocol and law that actually  causes the problem.   So let me give you a little bit of background about why I have this  problem.   We had seen previous abuse in the past where the off-reservation land  was taken in a trust against the will of States, compacts, and local  communities for the sole purpose of building new casinos.   This was certainly the case of the Tohono O'odham Nation right in  Arizona when they acted against the fellow Tribes, the State of  Arizona, and the general public to open an off-reservation casino in  Glendale, despite agreeing to a voter-approved compact not to build any  more casinos in the Phoenix metro area until the compact was  renegotiated. Litigation discovery and audio recordings affirm this  shameful conspiracy implemented by the Tohono O'odham.   I am concerned that this bill as written will encourage future abuse  in that regard and allow for more off-reservation casinos to be built  against the objections of local communities.   Furthermore, there is no CBO score for this bill. There is no  committee report that I have seen. We are pushing this bill through  that has no chance of being signed into law without amendment and  without knowing the full ramifications of this legislation.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Let's go back to some more of the myths.   The Mashpee Tribe will lose its Federal recognition and benefits if  H.R. 312 does not pass.   Once again, that is false. The Mashpee Tribe will not lose its  Federal recognition and will continue to receive Federal benefits and  funding even if H.R. 312 does not pass.   Here is the next myth. It was the intent of Congress for all Tribes  to have land and trust under the IRA of 1934 regardless of when the  Tribes obtained Federal recognition.   Fact: That is not what the Supreme Court said in Carcieri v. Salazar.  The Supreme Court said that the Tribal aspect of the IRA of 1934 does  not authorize the Secretary of the Interior to place land in trust for  Tribes that were not under Federal jurisdiction on the date of  enactment of IRA, or 1934.   Fact: There is no evidence that Congress, in 1934, thought that off- reservation gaming would turn into the controversial mess it has become  today.   Myth: After a Federal judge struck down the Obama administration's  second definition of Indian analysis, the Trump administration chose  not to defend the decision.   Fact: The Trump administration chose not to defend the decision  because the judge said it was ``not even close,'' and the Obama  administration had not used this analysis in any other Tribe's trust  land case. It was used once only for the Mashpee. The Court remanded  the matter back to Interior for an examination under the same ``first  definition of Indian'' analysis used for all other Tribes.   In applying the Obama administration's analysis used for all other  Tribes, the Trump administration determined the Mashpee did not  qualify, and yet Tribes blame the Trump administration for something  the Obama administration could have done years ago but chose not to.                                time  1515    Could the fate of a billion-dollar casino be the reason why the Obama  administration bent the rules? I wonder.   H.R. 312 doesn't amend the IRA. It doesn't amend any law. Rather,  H.R. 312 declares the Obama action struck down by the U.S. district  court to be lawful and proper. The bill also orders the court to  dismiss the lawsuit concerning the casino property and to prohibit the  filing of any future lawsuit over it.   Mr. Speaker, we constantly see over and over again, the problem with  H.R. 312 is it is once again being rushed to the floor.   I want to reference a letter from Eagle Forum and highlight,  basically, their reservations.   ``This bill is a deceptive plan to undermine the Federal Government's  decision to deny the Mashpee Tribe land for a new casino. The Mashpee  Tribe has previously engaged in questionable financial and lobbying  dealings. They are currently $450 billion in debt to Genting, a foreign  Malaysian gaming company, because of this project.   ``The Tribe has no way of paying the company back, which means  Genting will be the true owner of this project. Taxpayers should not be  responsible for the bailout of their irresponsible dealings.''   Down further it goes:   ``Just the issue of gambling alone has been devastating to families  across the United States, especially among Native Americans.''   Further down it goes:   ``For these reasons, we urge you to vote `no' on H.R. 312, Mashpee  [[Page H3823]]  Wampanoag Tribe Reservation Reaffirmation Act.''   I also want to reference Americans for Limited Government:   ``The House of Representatives should reject H.R. 312, the Senator  Elizabeth Warren-led attempt to punch piecemeal holes through the  Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. This isn't about the ability of Tribes  using land that is part of their long-established heritage for casino  development, but, instead, it is about whether Congress should place  gambling institutions on unrelated land based upon proximity to urban  areas.   ``If Senator Warren and her benefactors wish to change the Indian  gaming laws, they should introduce wholesale reforms rather than  turning the existing law into Swiss cheese for nothing more than  investor pecuniary interests.   ``Rick Manning, President, Americans for Limited Government.''   We actually have our opposition to 312:         I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on 312, the Mashpee       Wampanoag Tribe Reservation Reaffirmation Act, when it comes       before the House today.        H.R. 312 is contrary to the view of the Department of the       Interior, contradicts a Supreme Court decision, and aims to       reverse Federal court decisions on this matter in order to       build a massive, 400,000-square-foot, off-reservation gaming       complex for the benefit of Genting, a foreign Malaysian       gaming company.        The bill forever strips the Federal Government of its       jurisdictions over this Tribal casino and overturns a well-      reasoned decision from a Federal judge.        H.R. 312 also provides a massive tax shelter for Genting by       shielding the land--and the casino on it--from taxation and       State regulation.        The bill creates two reservations for the Mashpee Tribe of       Massachusetts, one reservation which we have no problem with,       in the town of Mashpee, the Tribe's historic reservation       lands. No casino will be allowed within the geographical       boundaries of the town of Mashpee.        The other reservation will be 50 miles away from Mashpee in       the city of Taunton. This site is not part of the Tribe's       historic reservation and was selected by the Tribe and       Genting for a billion-dollar casino project because of its       proximity to the Providence, Rhode Island, casino market, 20       miles away.        In 1988, Congress enacted the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act       with the intent to restrict casinos to Tribes' original       reservations.        By placing land in trust for gaming in Taunton, H.R. 312       creates an off-reservation casino, which is inconsistent with       congressional intent. This is often called ``reservation       shopping,'' and it is an abuse of the Indian Gaming       Regulatory Act.        The Tribe's lawyers knew that reservation shopping was a       political headache, so they went to the previous       administration to obtain the two reservations through       administrative action.        Once again, the Federal judge, however, ruled that what the       previous administration did was unlawful, so now they need       legislation to authorize this off-reservation casino.        The bill was opposed by 10 of the 13 voting Republicans in       the committee markup. Ranking Member Rob Bishop was one of       those. These Members are joined by Americans for Limited       Government, the American Principles Project, the Coalition       for American Values, Eagle Forum, the Governor of Rhode       Island, Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head, Congressman David       Cicilline, Congressman James Langevin, and President Donald       Trump in opposing this bill.        President Trump tweeted that he opposed the bill and urged       Members of Congress to do the same last week. House Minority       Whip Steve Scalise also sent an email recommending Members       vote ``no'' on H.R. 312.        The bill is also strenuously opposed by the only other       Federally-recognized Tribe in Massachusetts.        All of this opposition was enough to have the bill pulled       from consideration by the House of Representatives under the       suspension of the rules procedures one week after it was       considered in committee with no bill report or score--      actually, there was a bill report but no score from the       Congressional Budgetary Office.        Now, the Democrat leadership is using a closed rule and not       allowing any amendments to get this controversial bill out of       the House of Representatives. Given that H.R. 312 authorizes       an off-reservation casino, bails out a foreign corporation       from major financial problems of its own making, and       reverses the judgment of a Federal court and contradicts       Interior and Supreme Court decisions, it is no wonder that       the majority had to resort to these drastic measures.        I urge everyone to vote ``no'' and to oppose this bill that       sets a dangerous precedent that will open the floodgates to       off-reservation Tribal casinos all over the United States if       enacted into law.    Once again, I want to reiterate, if you have a problem with the  Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, let's do the wholesale changes on a  massive scale, not do it one piece at a time, one Tribe at a time, not  allowing lawful actions to occur.   So, I ask all my colleagues to vote ``no'' against this bill. Send a  clear message that we have got to follow the law or change it wholesale  for everybody.   Mr. Speaker, I ask a ``no'' vote from my colleagues, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
