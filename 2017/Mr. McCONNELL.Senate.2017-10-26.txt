 Mr. President, the Senate is continuing to move  forward on President Trump's outstanding judicial nominations. Many of  the well-qualified men and women the President has nominated enjoy  substantial bipartisan support.   Unfortunately, Senate Democrats have decided to continue wasting the  Senate's time with the pointless obstruction of these nominees. Time  and again, they have erected partisan procedural hurdles that are  designed not to change the outcome--they don't change the outcome--but  simply to waste the Senate's time. Often, Democrats do not even oppose  the nominee in question.   Let's compare the number of times this days-long delay has been  invoked for nominees of the last two Presidents during the first years  of their Presidencies--during the first year of the Obama Presidency  and the first year of the Trump Presidency. Republicans required  cloture on one of President Obama's judicial nominees during his first  year--cloture one time on a judicial nominee for President Obama in his  first year. Democrats have invoked this delay for every single one of  President Trump's judicial nominees, so far, except one. This week,  they are at it again.   Today, we will have a cloture vote on the nomination of Trevor  McFadden to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Not a  single Democrat on the Judiciary Committee registered an objection to  the nomination; yet we still have to waste time in overcoming a  procedural hurdle from our Democratic colleagues before the Senate can  take up the nomination and consider it. It came out of committee with  no opposition.   We are not going to let these mindless attempts to slow progress stop  us from confirming the President's nominees to the judiciary. If that  means more cloture votes and more time focused on this task, that is  what we will do, but we will confirm these nominees. You can count on  it.                            ____________________     Mr. President, on another matter, for families in  Kentucky and across the Nation, the devastation of opioid abuse can be  a constant and painful reality. Communities are forced to endure grief,  worry, and loss. A recent report showed that my home State suffered  more than 1,400 fatalities as a result of drug overdoses last year  alone.   Despite the troubling statistics, however, there are glimmers of  hope. The Republican-led Senate has worked hard to pass important  legislation like Jessie's Law, the 21st Century Cures Act, and the  Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. These measures are important  steps that should lead to real progress. There are many other important  efforts across the country as well. From coast to coast, we hear  stories of men and women in recovery who are managing their addictions.  We are heartened by these testimonies that  [[Page S6826]]  proper treatment offers real hope. They help remind everyone as to why  we must continue to press forward. The task that remains is staggering,  but we are committed.   Later today, President Trump will help our country take another step  forward. We expect that he will formally recognize the opioid epidemic  for the public health emergency that it is. This announcement builds  upon years of progress that Congress has made in responding to  addiction with comprehensive action, including prevention, enforcement,  and treatment.   I commend the President for his continued commitment to this cause.  When he visited us in the Senate earlier this week, he discussed the  national epidemic and his administration's efforts to fight back. Along  with my colleagues, I stand ready to work with him on future proposals  to provide the necessary tools to protect our communities from this  scourge.   A single bill or program is never going to solve this crisis on its  own. Only a sustained, committed effort can do that. I am proud of our  efforts to combat opioid addiction already. I also know that we will  continue to push forward with continued collaboration with many groups  both in Washington and in States and communities all across our country  so that, one day, we can finally say that our country has beaten this  crisis once and for all.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  notwithstanding rule XXII, that at 5:30 p.m., Monday, October 30, all  postcloture time on the McFadden nomination be considered expired and  the Senate vote on confirmation of the nomination with no intervening  action or debate; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table and the President be  immediately notified of the Senate's action; further, that it be in  order to proceed to the following nominations during today's session of  the Senate: Calendar Nos. 368, 369, 432, and 433.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive  session to consider Calendar No. 368, Amy Barrett.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive  session to consider Calendar No. 369, Joan Larsen.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive  session to consider Calendar No. 432, Allison Eid.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive  session to consider Calendar No. 433, Stephanos Bibas.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum  calls for the cloture motions be waived.    I ask unanimous consent that notwithstanding rule  XXII, the pending cloture motions ripen following the disposition of  the McFadden nomination.    Madam President, in my opening remarks today, I  commended President Trump once again for the outstanding judicial  nominations he has made, and I reiterated the Senate's determination  once more to continue confirming them regardless of the often mindless  partisan obstruction we have been seeing across the aisle.   This pointless obstruction is designed simply to waste time, not to  change an outcome, and it will not. It didn't stop the Senate from  confirming Scott Palk, it will not stop the Senate from confirming  Trevor McFadden, and it will not stop the Senate from confirming even  more outstanding nominees next week. You can count on it.   I have filed cloture on four more well-qualified nominees for our  Nation's circuit courts: Notre Dame law professor Amy Barrett, a  nominee for the Seventh Circuit; Michigan Supreme Court Justice Joan  Larsen, a nominee for the Sixth Circuit; Colorado Supreme Court Justice  Allison Eid, a nominee for the Tenth Circuit; and University of  Pennsylvania law professor Stephanos Bibas, a nominee for the Third  Circuit.   By confirming these nominees, we can take a big step toward restoring  our Nation's courts to their proper role, interpreting and applying the  law based upon what it actually says, not what a judge might wish it to  say. It is quite a departure from the last administration's philosophy  when it came to selecting judicial nominees.   For the last 8 years, we had a President who said a criterion for  lifetime positions was the ability to empathize with certain groups  over others. It came to be known as the ``empathy standard.'' That is a  great standard if you are the party in the case for whom the judge has  empathy, not so great if you are the other person. It also is not in  keeping with the longstanding American legal traditions of applying the  law equally to all, giving every litigant a fair shake, and ruling  based on the actual meaning of our Constitution and laws, not what a  judge or some preferred political constituency might wish they meant.  That, I believe, is the view of the American people.   President Trump has done a terrific job of nominating judges who are  already helping to restore the courts to their intended function in our  system of government. The nominees we will consider next week are sure  to do the same.   We will continue our efforts with consideration of the Barrett  nomination on Monday. Amy Barrett is a professor of law at one of our  Nation's premier law schools. Notre Dame happens to be a Catholic  University. Amy Barrett happens to be a nominee who is a Catholic and  who speaks freely and openly about her faith and its importance to her.  For some on the left, that seems to be a disqualifying factor for her  nomination.   I would remind colleagues that we do not have religious tests for  office in this country. There is no religious test for office in the  United States of America.   Amy Barrett's nomination has received outstanding reviews. She is  clearly well qualified for the office to which she has been nominated.  As the president of Notre Dame recently wrote, ``Her experience as a  clerk for Judge Laurence Silberman of the U.S. Court of Appeals and  Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is of the highest order. So, too,  is her scholarship in the areas of federal courts, constitutional law,  and statutory interpretation.''   Amy Barrett is going to make an outstanding Federal Circuit Court  judge. So, too, will Ms. Larsen, Ms. Eid, and Mr. Bibas. I look forward  to the Senate confirming all of them next week.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Senate proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.
