 Mr. Speaker, when the FCC reclassified the  internet as a common carrier, utility-style service and adopted their  rules regulating the use of consumer data by internet service  providers, it represented a monumental shift in the way we view  privacy.   Instead of a uniform, technology-neutral standard that balanced data  protection with consumer choice, internet users were stuck with a two- sided approach that causes confusion and dampens competition. There is  one set of rules for service providers, and one set for the rest of the  internet ecosystem. But how often do consumers really recognize the  difference between where their data is accessed and where it is stored?   Ultimately, consumers are actually harmed by the artificial sense of  protection created by these rules. It is essential that we take steps  to restore the time-tested framework embraced by the Federal Trade  Commission.   We have talked a lot about protecting consumer privacy and data, but  I haven't heard a lot about allowing the consumer to decide how their  information is used. Consumers deserve to have the autonomy to control  their information and their internet experience.   As Acting Chairman of the FTC Maureen Ohlhausen pointed out:         The FTC approach reflects the fact that consumer privacy       preferences differ greatly depending on the type of data and       its use.    There is widespread agreement that sensitive data, like financial or  health information, should be strongly protected and opt-in  appropriate. But what about other types of nonsensitive data? Let's not  forget the ways that consumers benefit from allowing ISPs access to  that kind of information.    Consumers should retain the ability to make the decisions that make  sense for them when it comes to how their nonsensitive data is used and  obtain the discounts or lower prices that can result. This vote isn't  about reducing the level of privacy protection for consumers; it is  about an FCC decision that ignored the preferences of consumers in  favor of a regulatory power grab.    The FCC's privacy rules are an overreaching  regulatory mess that create confusion and inconsistency for consumers,  harm competition, and upend internet privacy as we know it.
