 Madam Speaker, why are we here on the floor of the House  of Representatives listening to the Democrats and socialists and their  Republican puppets reviewing Steve Bannon's podcast?   I can't imagine that that would be the case if they actually had a  bill, a reconciliation deal, legislation to help the American people.  We are not here because of democracy. Save me the alligator tears on  that. These are the folks who assaulted our democracy for 2 years under  the specter of the Russia hoax. It is sure not about violence, because  they didn't seem to give a damn  [[Page H5764]]  when our country was being engulfed in flames during the riots of the  summer of 2020.   It is not about Congressional process. If it was about Congressional  process, Democrats would be doing what they have done in other cases;  they would go to court. But the reason they haven't gone to court, like  they did for Trump's taxes, in the Deutsche Bank subpoenas, in the  Mazars matter, or in the Don McGahn matter, is because in each of those  circumstances, they did not prevail in court. The courts realized that  their subpoenas were overly broad.   So instead of using the real process, here we are just enduring this  politics. And because they can't build back better, they have just  decided to build back meaner.
