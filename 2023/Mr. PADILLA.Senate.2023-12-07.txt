 Madam President, I rise to introduce the bipartisan  Local 9-8-8 Response Act. This legislation would boost our continued  efforts to improve access to and accuracy of mental health crisis  response through the 9-8-8 Suicide Crisis Lifeline.   In an effort to ensure a quick response by a mental health  professional for those in crisis, this legislation requires calls and  messages to the lifeline to be routed by the call center geographically  nearest to the caller rather than by area code. This eliminates an  unnecessary handoff, while still protecting user privacy, so users can  receive the care they need as quickly and safely as possible.   This bill also requires carriers to allow calls and texts to the 9-8- 8 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline even if the plan is inactive or the  carrier is experiencing service interruptions or failures, just as is  done currently with 9-1-1 calls. Further, this bill requires multiline  systems like hotel and office phones to support the direct dialing of  9-8-8 rather than requiring a caller to dial 9 or another number before  dialing 9-8-8.   Significant progress has been made in increasing access to quality  mental health care in America. The 9-8-8 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline has  been critical for supporting Americans in crisis. However, the current  system routes you to a call center based on your area code rather than  where you are actually calling from. This is a huge problem if a call  center needs to send a mental health response team to help a caller  that might be thousands of miles away in another city.   I would like to thank Senator Tillis for introducing this important  legislation with me. I would also like to thank Congressman Cardenas  for leading this legislation in the House of Representatives, and I  look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the Local 9-8-8  Response Act as soon as possible.                            ____________________     Madam President, I rise to introduce the bipartisan  Local 9-8-8 Response Act.
