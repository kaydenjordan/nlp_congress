 Mr. Speaker, I am proud to introduce the Veterans Back to  Work Act of 2019.   It is not hard to see that our economy is booming. We have the lowest  unemployment rate in 50 years, and hourly wages continue to rise.   Despite the record-breaking economic numbers we continue to see every  month, 326,000 veterans remain unemployed around the country. We should  be doing everything we can to facilitate veterans' transitions back  into the civilian workforce to help fill the over 7 million open jobs  we have here in the United States.   The Veterans Back to Work Act would make the work opportunity tax  credit, which is set to expire at the end of the year, permanent. This  tax credit is issued to businesses and nonprofits that hire individuals  who consistently face significant barriers that prevent them from  obtaining employment.   Making the work opportunity tax credit permanent is a great way to  ensure our veterans are set up for success. There is no reason not to  incentivize businesses to fill jobs with the men and women who have  served and sacrificed so much for our Nation.   I urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to come together  and support this critical legislation.                           Recognizing Bill Zedler     Mr. Speaker, a lion of the Legislature in Texas is  serving his last term in office.   Since 2003, State Representative Bill Zedler has been a champion of  liberty, a champion of free enterprise, a champion of religious  freedom, a champion for life. He has been a champion like few others in  the Texas Legislature.   Whether the issue was taxes, education, healthcare, veterans  benefits, whatever it was, his was a voice to which others listened  because that voice has always been a voice of truth and wisdom. That  voice will be greatly missed.   All of us in public office at the end of our time of service have to  answer the question, did we leave things better than we found them? For  my friend Bill Zedler, that answer is a resounding yes because Texas  today is better because State Representative Bill Zedler served in the  Texas Legislature.   At the end of the movie ``Troy,'' Odysseus is commenting about how  history will be written. He says that he lived among giants, that he  wanted it to be said that he lived in the time of Hector, that he lived  in the time of Achilles. Well, members of the Texas Legislature can be  proud that they served in the time of Bill Zedler.   I thank Bill for all of his magnificent service to the Texas  Legislature.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I thank Ms. Foxx for yielding.   Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 3.   This Congress, we have seen on multiple occasions that Democrats and  Republicans are able to agree on and move powerful and beneficial  legislation when we put aside politics in favor of bipartisan  pragmatism.   Members on both sides of the aisle agree that rising drug prices are  a major concern for all Americans, and you would think we would be able  to deliver for the American people on this issue.   Unlike the radical bill before us, H.R. 19, the Lower Costs, More  Cures Act, contains bipartisan solutions and has a real chance of being  signed into law. Sadly, we are wasting the taxpayers' time debating a  hapless Federal takeover of America's innovative biotech industry that  will result in more harm than good.   H.R. 3 represents the first step of a government takeover, all under  the guise of helping. But threatening companies is not helping;  restricting future cures is not helping; threatening the jobs of 89,000  Texans employed by the biotech industry is not helping.   This bill would slap manufacturers with a 95 percent excise tax for  not negotiating its prices with the Federal Government. That is not  negotiating; that is dictating.   Speaker Pelosi's price-setting legislation gives manufacturers a  stark choice: comply or exit the U.S. market entirely.   Doctors take the Hippocratic Oath to do no harm. Public officials  should do the same.   If one thing is clear to me, it is that H.R. 3 will absolutely do  harm. This bill has one assured outcome: the stifling of medical  innovation here in the United States.   Experts from the Congressional Budget Office, the Council of Economic  Advisers, and the California Life Sciences Association have all warned  of the disastrous impact H.R. 3 will have on future cures.  Specifically, they warned that up to a third of new cures could be lost  over the next 10 years.   Fortunately, we don't have to rely solely on expert estimates about  the impact of government price setting. We can look at the real-time  results in other countries.   Between 2011 and 2018, 89 percent of new treatments introduced were  available to Americans, compared to 62 percent in Germany and 60  percent in the United Kingdom.   We have seen, to the United States' benefit, the migration of R&D  activity from Europe in the aftermath of their price controls.   Now is not the time to slow down medical innovations in the United  States. We must stop this radical government overreach.
