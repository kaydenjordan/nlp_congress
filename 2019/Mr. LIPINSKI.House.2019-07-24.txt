 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the  Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions Act, also known as the Butch  Lewis Act.   Without this bill, millions of retired workers, including truck  drivers, electricians, steelworkers, locomotive engineers,  boilermakers, machinists, and others will lose their earned pension  benefits. We should all agree that these pensions should not be cut.   This is about basic fairness. These are hardworking people who agreed  to exchange some of their pay during their working years for the  promise of a secure retirement. This bill will provide loans to pension  plans in need of help to pay these benefits. These are loans.   Many of us remember the dark days of the financial crisis. During  this crisis, pension plans took a big hit. Back then, Congress bailed  out Wall Street. Although I did not support that bill, I think we  should all agree now that we should help support pensions for retirees.  Let's do right by the everyday families who count on these plans. Let's  pass this rule and pass the Rehabilitation for Multiemployer Pensions  Act. It is the right thing to do.                                time  1315
