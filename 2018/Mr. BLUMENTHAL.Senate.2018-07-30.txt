 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, there are few responsibilities--I  would say none--more important than our duties in connection with the  appointment of a Supreme Court Justice. Much is at stake in the  nomination that is before the Senate now to appoint Judge Brett  Kavanaugh as the Justice who will replace Justice Kennedy. So much is  at stake--the future of Roe v. Wade, affordable healthcare,  particularly, preexisting conditions and the protections of them for  millions of Americans.   But I am not here to talk about Judge Kavanaugh as a nominee. I am  here to talk about how we reach a conclusion as to how my colleagues  and I vote and how we seek and pursue the truth about Judge Kavanaugh,  his qualifications, his temperament, his integrity and intellect, who  he is, and what kind of Justice he will be.   The best way to do it is to know what he has written and said--all of  his writings and opinions and the articles he has written. These points  are pretty basic.   I am struck by our colleagues' objection to our seeking documents  they have sought in connection with past nominees when they were made  by Presidents of our party. When President Obama nominated Justice  Kagan, Republicans asked for documents from her years in the Clinton  administration, her tenure as dean of the Harvard Law School, and even  her clerkship for Justice Thurgood Marshall. Senator Grassley, now the  chairman of the Judiciary Committee said at the time: ``For the Senate  to fulfill its constitutional responsibility of advice and consent, we  must get all of her documents . . . and have enough time to analyze  them so we can determine whether she should be a Justice.''   I agree. Now, unfortunately, Republicans want to apply a completely  different standard to Judge Kavanaugh. They want his documents kept  sealed and stored so that he can waltz onto the Court without having to  answer tough questions about what he has written, said, and done. They  maintain that there is nothing in the documents that would be relevant  or revelatory. Well, we can't know this supposed irrelevance, and  neither can they until we all see those documents.   For some reason, the Republicans seem worried. They seem concerned.  They seem apprehensive. The American people and we have a right to ask:  What are they concealing and why are they scared of it? What is Judge  Kavanaugh hiding and why is he afraid of it? That is a question he  should answer and which they have a responsibility to address before we  begin the hearings. Our questions require those documents.   There is, in fact, a lot of good reason to think that those documents  will be relevant and revelatory, particularly the documents from his  time in the White House. My Republican colleagues are now downplaying  the role Judge Kavanaugh had while working for President Bush.  Republican whip and Judiciary Committee member John Cornyn, our friend  and colleague from Texas, said that Judge Kavanaugh was ``more or less  a traffic cop,'' but that contention contradicts what our colleagues  said at the time when Judge Kavanaugh was a nominee to the DC Circuit  Court of Appeals. Senator Cornyn himself said then of Kavanaugh: ``He .  . . is currently Staff Secretary to President Bush, a job whose title  belies the very serious and important responsibilities that individual  performs.''   Senator Hatch, also a colleague and a very distinguished member of  the Judiciary Committee, said of Judge Kavanaugh: ``His background as  Staff Secretary may prove to be particularly good judicial training.''   But for me the best indication of how important his role as Staff  Secretary to President Bush was--not just as counsel, but as Staff  Secretary--comes from Judge Kavanaugh himself. He said:         When people ask me which of my prior experiences has been       most useful to me as a judge, I tell them that all of them       have been useful, and I certainly draw on all of them. But I       also do not hesitate to say that my five and a half years in       the White House--and especially my three years as Staff       Secretary for President Bush--were the most interesting and       in many ways the most instructive.   I would read that sentence again, but I am not sure I need to. It  will be in the Record, and it is well-known to many of my colleagues.   Judge Kavanaugh went on:         As Staff Secretary, I sat in meetings where he talked with       President Hu and then-President Musharraf and President       Karzai and Prime Minister Blair and Pope John Paul. I was at       the G-8 in Scotland when the London subway bombing occurred.       I saw and participated in the process of putting legislation       together, whether it was terrorism insurance or Medicare       prescription drug coverage or attempts at immigration reform.       I worked on drafting and revising executive orders. I       remember times on the Hill in negotiating last-minute changes       in legislation. I saw regulatory agencies screw up. I saw how       they might try to avoid congressional mandates. I saw the       relationship between independent agencies and executive       agencies and the President and White House and OMB. I saw       FOIA requests.    That is from Judge Kavanaugh.   If there is any indication as to why we need those documents from the  time he was Staff Secretary to President Bush, it is from Judge  Kavanaugh's own words. If we want to know what kind of Justice he will  be, we need to understand the decisions he has made and the lessons he  has learned in that most informative job. If we refuse to even try, we  have abdicated our constitutional responsibility. We have a duty.   I submit, with great respect, that the request made by the chairman  of the Judiciary Committee involves all of us abdicating that  responsibility unless we protest and raise a hue and cry and force the  production of additional documents. This goes beyond any sort of  partisan divide, and it goes beyond the question of whether any of my  colleagues are voting for or against Judge Kavanaugh. It is about our  constitutional responsibility.   These documents, as Judge Kavanaugh himself has said, would, in  effect, reveal much about Judge Kavanaugh, for he worked on just about  every major issue as counselor to President Bush and as Staff Secretary  to him.   In a recent interview, Karl Rove noted: ``Literally every document  that goes to the president on a policy issue has to pass through the  hands of the staff secretary.''   As he himself has said, Judge Kavanaugh was at the President's side  at many pivotal moments of the Bush Presidency--from the passage of the  partial-birth abortion ban to debates over same-sex marriage and well  beyond. We should know just what Judge Kavanaugh said as Staff  Secretary to President Bush during those and other critical moments of  the Bush Presidency. His advice to President Bush  [[Page S5445]]  and his role in those decisions are relevant. I think that word  understates its importance. It is critical to our judgments about his  qualifications.   Perhaps--maybe just by chance--there is nothing in those documents.  When Judge Kavanaugh was in the White House, maybe he was just a  traffic cop, as Senator Cornyn has claimed, or was an honest broker, as  the judge described himself at his confirmation hearing. Yet, if that  were true, what are they hiding? Why do they need to conceal it? We  should have the opportunity to determine whether Judge Kavanaugh had  truly been an honest broker, just a traffic cop, or had just passed  documents through his hands without his having had any input. The best  way to determine this is by reviewing those documents.   Judge Kavanaugh made this very point when he was an appellate court  nominee. At his confirmation hearing, he was asked how Senators should  assess his record. He answered: ``I think that's done through an  assessment of going back, in my case, 16 years of my career and looking  at the kinds of things I've done in the staff secretary's office.''   We should heed those words. They are the words of Judge Kavanaugh. We  should examine all of the documents. It may take some additional time  to review all of those documents but maybe not if there is nothing in  there that relates to his view and his opinion and his role. If he were  just a traffic cop or an honest broker, we can get through them very,  very quickly. Regardless of the time involved, there is no more  important task that we will undertake as U.S. Senators than to decide  on his qualifications for being a Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.  Anything less would be a dereliction of our duty.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the 60th  anniversary of the historic ship USS Nautilus, SSN-571, and her  historic submerged transit of the North Pole on August 3, 1958.   The USS Nautilus was the first commissioned nuclear-powered ship in  the U.S. Navy. President Harry S. Truman laid the keel for the future  ship on June 14, 1952, at the Electric Boat Shipyard in Groton, CT. Two  years later, First Lady Mamie Eisenhower launched the history-making  nuclear submarine when she broke the traditional bottle of champagne  across the bow of the USS Nautilus.   On the morning of January 17, 1955, at 11:00 a.m. EST, the Nautilus's  first Commanding Officer, Commander Eugene P. Wilkinson, ordered all  lines cast off and signaled the memorable message, ``Underway On  Nuclear Power.''   During its shakedown on May 10, 1956, the USS Nautilus cruised from  Groton, CT, to San Juan, PR, in fewer than 90 hours, fully submerged  for the entire journey. The underwater distance--1,381 miles--was ten  times farther than any submerged submarine had previously sailed.  Following this journey, the Nautilus would shatter all submerged speed  and distance records over the remainder of the decade.   In response to the nuclear intercontinental ballistic missile threat  posed by the Soviet Union following the launch of the first satellite  Sputnik, President Dwight D. Eisenhower ordered the U.S. Navy to  attempt a submarine transit to the North Pole to gain credibility for  the soon-to-come submarine-launched ballistic missile weapons system  still in research and development.   On July 23, 1958, the USS Nautilus departed Pearl Harbor, Hi, under  top secret orders to conduct Operation Sunshine, the first crossing of  the North Pole by a ship.   Eleven days later, Commander William R. Anderson announced to the 116  men aboard, ``For the world, our country, and the Navy: THE NORTH  POLE.'' Thus, on August 3, 1958, the USS Nautilus became the first  watercraft to reach the geographic North Pole, 90 degrees north, known  also as the geographic ``top of the world.''   Following this momentous voyage, the USS Nautilus and her crew earned  the Presidential Unit Citation, the first ever awarded in peacetime.   After Operation Sunshine, the USS Nautilus enjoyed many more  successes in her long and illustrious career of duty in the U.S. Navy,  such as in October 1962, when she participated in the naval quarantine  of Cuba during the Cuban Missile Crisis.   Over the years, the USS Nautilus played an integral part in numerous  North Atlantic Treaty Organization--NATO--exercises and a variety of  developmental test programs. On September 14, 1966, the USS Nautilus  celebrated 300,000 nautical miles of ocean faring.   Having pioneered the use of nuclear power at sea, the USS Nautilus  continued to serve alongside many of the more modern nuclear-powered  submarines. In April 1975, the USS Nautilus participated in Exercise  Agate Punch. She was cited by the Commander Cruiser-Destroyer Group 12  as ``Not Getting Older--Getting Better.''   In the spring of 1977, the USS Nautilus deployed for the last time to  the Mediterranean Sea, and on April 9, 1979, the Nautilus set out from  Groton, CT, on her final voyage to Mare Island Naval Shipyard in  Vallejo, CA. On May 25, 1979, the USS Nautilus shut down her reactor  for the final time, and she reached Mare Island 4 days later.   Following a career spanning 25 years and over half a million miles  steamed, she decommissioned on March 3, 1980.   On May 14, 1980, President Jimmy Carter authorized Groton, CT, as the  permanent home for the USS Nautilus, and on May 20, 1982, the USS  Nautilus was designated a National Historic Landmark by the Secretary  of the Interior. Following an extensive historic ship conversion at  Mare Island Naval Shipyard, the Nautilus was towed to Groton, CT, for  the final time, arriving on July 6, 1985, in preparation for display to  the public as a museum.   On April 11, 1986, 86 years to the day after the birth of the  submarine force, the historic ship Nautilus, joined by the Submarine  Force Museum, opened to the public as the first and finest exhibit of  its kind in the world, providing an educational and visible link to  yesterday's nuclear-powered submarine.   I am delighted to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the North Pole  transit by USS Nautilus, SSN-571, and her accomplishments over the last  64 years. The historic ship Nautilus is a testament to American  ingenuity, courage, and technical prowess. She deserves the greatest  reverence and continues to serve as a reminder to future generations of  Americans as she rests alongside modern day nuclear submarines at the  Naval Submarine Base New London.                            ____________________
