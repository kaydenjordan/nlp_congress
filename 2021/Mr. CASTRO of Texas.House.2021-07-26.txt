Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all  Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks and include extraneous material on S. 1828.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 1828, the HAVANA Act of  2021, and I urge my colleagues to support its passage.   America's diplomats and intelligence professionals are the best in  the world, dedicating their lives to public service to protect the  American people and promote the interests of the United States.   As citizens, we are in their debt. As lawmakers, we also have a  responsibility to protect their health and safety, making sure that  they have the resources they need to do their jobs effectively and  providing them with the necessary support if they are harmed in the  line of duty.   That is why the HAVANA Act is such a critical piece of legislation.  The incidents behind the so-called Havana syndrome are still under  investigation and have affected American personnel at U.S. missions  around the world, from Cuba, where the incidents first surfaced, and  then reportedly to China, Europe, Central Asia, and even potentially  here in Washington, D.C. It is imperative that the State Department,  working in conjunction with the intelligence community, the Department  of Defense, and other interagency partners and allies, get to the  bottom of what caused these events, how best to deter them from  happening in the future, and how best to protect our people.   While I am confident that the Biden administration is working hard to  advance these investigations, Congress must also do its part,  especially when it comes to helping those who have been directly  impacted.   The HAVANA Act ensures that the United States' diplomats and  intelligence professionals are appropriately taken care of and  compensated for injuries they incurred in connection with these events,  fixing an important gap in existing law. I am very glad this important  legislation will provide necessary supplemental funds to those who have  been affected while in no way touching on any other benefits that come  with Federal employment. This is a good, bipartisan measure, and I  commend our Senate colleagues, especially Senators Collins and Mark  Warner, for sending it over to us in the House today.   The HAVANA Act, which the Senate unanimously passed, is the companion  to legislation that Chairman Adam Schiff introduced alongside Chairman    Gregory Meeks. As the only Democratic Member who serves on both the  [[Page H3856]]  Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the Committee on Foreign  Affairs, I deeply appreciate the contributions and sacrifices of our  diplomats and intelligence professionals who are working hard to defend  our national security.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the HAVANA Act, and I  reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1430     Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman  from California (Mr. Schiff), the chairman of the House Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence.   (Mr. SCHIFF asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests at this  time, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I  may consume for the purpose of closing.   Mr. Speaker, I believe it is imperative that we, as the elected  representatives of the American people, working with the executive  branch, get to the bottom of exactly who is behind these events, why  they are occurring, and how to stop them.   But we must also make sure to do our part to take care of the public  servants who put themselves on the line every day for our own  interests.   I want to say thank you to the President, to the Secretary of State,  and to the State Department for taking these cases seriously, for  listening to the families and all the trauma that they have gone  through, and for showing them nothing but the utmost respect.   This bill is an excellent contribution to this effort, and I look  forward to working on a bipartisan basis on this critical issue going  forward.   I thank Chairman Schiff for his hard work, and I ask all of my  colleagues to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
