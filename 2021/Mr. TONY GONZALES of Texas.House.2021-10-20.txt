 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight  October as Domestic Violence Awareness Month.   There is a lot going on in the world right now, and it is very easy  to forget that we have millions of Americans who are living in a very  abusive environment.   Many people walk around with scars that everyone can see. But also,  many of us walk around with scars that nobody can see. In particular, I  would like to highlight the women who are in this very difficult  situation.   When I was 5 years old, I recall when my mother woke me up in the  middle of the night to sneak us out of our very abusive home, and I  remember spending time in a battered women's shelter. That moment will  never leave me.   Looking back at it now, my mother was the bravest woman that I knew  then and the bravest woman that I know now.  [[Page H5682]]    And it doesn't have to be this way. People don't have to be in an  environment that is constantly under abuse. You can leave, whether that  is today, whether that is tomorrow, whether that is decades from now.   Today, I am very proud. Years ago, my mother left that abusive  environment. Just last year, she was able to get her bachelor's degree  from the University of Texas at El Paso, UTEP. It was amazing for her  to go back and get her education.   Today, she lives with me. She, along with my wife, Angel, helps raise  our children. And today, she is in an environment where she is loved.   This month, Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we can't lose sight of  that. If you are in a violent situation, you, too, can get out. You,  too, can change the direction of your life, and your children can go  off and be very successful because we live in the greatest country on  Earth. Whether it is today, tomorrow, or a decade from now, please  leave your abusive environment and get back to a place of happiness and  love.                            ____________________
