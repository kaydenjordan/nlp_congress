 I thank the ranking member, Mr. Chairman, for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, this bill targets the leadership of Iran, and, frankly,  that is probably a worthy goal in some regards. I think it eventually  envisions publicizing negative information about them, and that might  be an effective tool as well. We all know that. We have been through  campaigns. We know negative advertising works.   That said, I oppose this legislation, and I do so for two reasons.  The first is resources are finite. They are not unlimited; they are  finite. Tracking down all the assets of these named Iranian leaders  takes significant time, effort, and personnel.   Where are those resources supposed to come from?   All around this city, everybody is agitating for deeper cuts to  nondefense discretionary accounts. If we are going to make cuts, we are  going to have to make some tough choices.   The personnel responsible for implementing this bill would be  diverted from terrorist financing and money laundering. Let me say that  again. The people, the personnel responsible for implementing this bill  would be diverted from terrorist financing and money laundering.   Propaganda about corruption of Iranian leadership--which I stipulate  to here up front--could be valuable, but it can't be more valuable than  stopping actual terrorist financing. Terrorist financing should be our  target. Money laundering should be our target, not garden-variety  corruption.   We had a lengthy discussion in committee just yesterday about using  money laundering authorities to fight human trafficking. For God's  sake, that has to seem more valuable than propaganda. It has to.   So until we solve these tight budget constraints, I think we need to  make the hard choice about what our priorities are and how to  prioritize resources for stopping, again, money laundering and  terrorism financing. Leave this effort for a world where the sequester  has been lifted.   The second reason why I oppose this legislation, I can't help  wondering: Shouldn't we apply this principle more broadly?   The idea here is that we should investigate and publicize it when a  country's leadership has undisclosed assets, especially if those are  overseas. That is the point of this legislation. We should investigate  and publicize it when a country's leadership is using government  resources to enrich itself. But why--why--just apply that principle to  Iran?   I am informed in my point of view here by wisdom I found in this  black, leather-bound book that I gratefully received when I was sworn  into office 5 years ago. In fact, the passage that I will cite you  actually occurs in two places. Let me share it with you now:   ``How can you say to your brother, `Brother, let me take the speck  out of your eye,' when you, yourself, fail to see the plank in your own  eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then  you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye.''   So I wonder: When is this Congress going to turn its attention to the  plank in our eye?    Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I want to start with a question.   Why is this bill so long?   Last year, we had a bill, H.R. 5729, to block the sale of Boeing  aircraft to Iran. It was short and clear. It was only 2 pages long. I  didn't like it and I didn't support it; but the truth is, I always  respect people putting forth their honest beliefs.   H.R. 5729, last year, blocked the licenses to sell U.S. planes-- straightforward. Torpedoing the plane sales endangered the JCPOA  because, as we have indicated, it is an affirmative requirement and an  obligation on the U.S. to approve plane sales if a sales agreement is  reached. That was part of the deal: You won't build or continue to  develop nuclear weapons, we will do certain things, including sell you  planes.   Everyone knew what the bill would do and they could decide if they  thought that was a good idea or a bad idea. It was very  straightforward. It was effectively a proxy on the JCPOA.   This year, we have another bill to block the sale of aircraft to  Iran. It is neither short nor clear. In fact, it is six times as long  as last year's bill.                                time  1800    It subjects the licenses to an ongoing and complex certification  requirement. It literally names and shames U.S. banks providing  financing. And, again, it does this purposefully so that it might deter  the sale of airplanes so that it might undermine the JCPOA.   Frankly, what I interpret, what I have heard this evening, is  tantamount to that. This is, yet again, a proxy on the JCPOA. If you  are against the JCPOA, vote ``yes.'' If you are for it, vote ``no.''   This bill, however, obscures its end purpose, that objective of  undermining the JCPOA behind process and ambiguity. Why?   If you oppose the sale of aircraft, oppose it. Have the courage of  your convictions. Don't just engage in this fearmongering. No matter  how many times you say that people in Iran chant ``Death to Israel,  Death to America,'' and whatever other form of fearmongering you engage  in, at least have the courage of your own convictions. You did last  year.   Stand up for what you believe in. If you want Iran to buy Airbus  aircraft instead of Boeing aircraft, then say that. Stand up for  yourself. Stand up for what you believe.   But let's be clear. That is what this bill will do. Don't dance  around.   For my part, I think blocking the sale of American planes is a big  mistake on so many levels. Let's be clear. It doesn't deny Iran the use  of aircraft; it just will deny them American-made aircraft. It will  deny American machinists jobs to work on them.   And need I remind anybody here what it means to be an engineer or a  machinist at an aircraft company in this country? It means the kind of  jobs that we all aspire to for our constituents. You know the kind; the  kind that pay enough that you can buy a home, have decent healthcare,  save enough money to send your kid to college if you want to, have  regular vacations, and have a secure retirement. Those are the kinds of  jobs we are taking away if we pass this bill.   It doesn't just prevent Iran from misusing aircraft, as has been  suggested. It just prevents Americans from having maintenance and  service agreements that keep eyes on the aircraft because, you see, if  Airbus sells them these planes, we have no idea. If they are American- made planes, they come with after-sale maintenance and service  agreements. We will have eyes on the planes.   It doesn't force Iran back to the bargaining table. It just  jeopardizes and cuts the legs out from under the gains we have made in  the JCPOA that I thought my colleague and friend from Connecticut spoke  about so eloquently. We don't go to sleep at night worried that Iran is  getting closer to a bomb, as we would have, as North Korea has.   So my friends, in summary, passage of this legislation will do three  things:   Number one, it will cost America jobs, and good-paying jobs;   Number two, it will make us less safe because it will undermine the  JCPOA and, in so doing, not allow us to ensure that these planes are  not being used for a nefarious purpose;   And number three, it will actually make us less safe as well, in the  sense that if it does, in fact, defeat the purpose of JCPOA-- The  SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Walberg). The time of the gentleman has  expired.   Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield an additional 1 minute to  the gentleman from Washington.    If it does cut the legs out from JCPOA, as is its purpose,  as is clear, then, of course, we are back on the track of Iran  developing nuclear weapons as North Korea has. Fewer jobs and less  safe; not sure what it is about that proposition that would be  appealing to anyone.   So, my friends, I urge you, in the strongest terms possible, be for  American jobs. Be for America being safer. Be for us living up to our  commitments, and vote ``no'' on this legislation.
