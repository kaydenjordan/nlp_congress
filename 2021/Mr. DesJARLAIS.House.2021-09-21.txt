 Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my support for  the National Defense Authorization Act. The bill before us today  represents a much-improved effort over the Biden-Harris  administration's proposed budget.   There is no more important job than providing for the defense of our  Nation. The specter of threats from an aggressive China, a revitalized  Russia, and radical Islamic terrorist states demand that we maintain a  strong national defense readiness and posture.   This NDAA will give a much-deserved and needed pay raise and expanded  benefits to members of our armed services. We are making investments to  ensure our military is the best equipped and trained in the world, with  a focus on American jobs and our domestic manufacturing base.   We are also investing in important new technologies like quantum  computing, hypersonic weapons, and autonomous systems.   I am proud to say that Arnold Air Force Base, the University of  Tennessee Space Institute, Vanderbilt University, Fort Campbell Army  Base, Oak  [[Page H4805]]  Ridge National Laboratory, and other Tennessee stakeholders will  receive the funds that they need to carry out vital operations for our  United States military.   That said, the bill is not perfect. I am disappointed in House  Democrats for preventing my ``no first use'' amendment from coming to  the floor for a vote. In hearings before our committee, our military  leadership emphasized that a ``no first use'' policy is a limiting  strategic mistake, and a number of our allies have expressed these  concerns directly to me as well. We should never tip our strategic  plans to our adversaries.   It is also disappointing that those on the other side of the aisle  have taken a bill intended to improve our military and muddled it with  attempts to score political points.                                time  2200    While I don't support these poison pills, I am hopeful that my  colleagues will remove them during conference before its final passage.   That said, we must move forward with this legislation. I support  making it stronger, avoiding nongermane political issues, and getting  it signed into law for our brave men and women in uniform.
