 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and  for his hard work on this; the chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Doyle;  the ranking member; and the staff members. Great bill here.   I rise in support of H.R. 3375, the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act.   Today, Californians and Americans across the country are receiving  more unwanted robocalls than ever before. This is something I often  hear about from my constituents.   Nearly 48 billion robocalls were made in 2018, an increase of 17  billion calls in just 1 year. More than 40 percent of these calls are  illegal scams. They are defrauding consumers; they are disruptive; and  they are costing victims an average of $430 per scam.   I am worried that the real risk here is that we are making our phone  system obsolete, because people just don't want to pick up their phones  anymore.   Part of the problem is that our current legal framework doesn't go  far enough in deterring these harmful practices. That is why I am  pleased that H.R. 3375 includes an amendment that I offered with my  colleague Mr. Flores, during, our full committee markup.   Our provision will create disincentives for the most egregious  violators of the law. Specifically, our provision will empower the  Federal Communications Commission to assess an additional $10,000  penalty for robocall violations where the offender acted with intent to  cause the violation.    Creating these disincentives is critical for protecting consumers and  putting abusive practices to an end. I am proud to cosponsor this  bipartisan, commonsense legislation, and I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes.''
