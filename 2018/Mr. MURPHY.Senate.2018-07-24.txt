 Mr. President, we are on the verge of the 1-year mark  since the U.S. Senate attempted to take away healthcare from 30 million  Americans and was told no by the American public.   For virtually the entire time, since the passage of the Affordable  Care Act, Republicans in the House and in the Senate engaged in an  exercise that was futile while President Obama was in office but then  was made possible by the election of Donald Trump--that was the repeal  of the Affordable Care Act, which extended care to 20 million Americans  who weren't guaranteed that health insurance would actually cover the  things they needed and protected people who were sick or people with  preexisting conditions from discrimination.   When Republicans finally took over, they realized they had spent a  whole lot of time criticizing the Affordable Care Act but not a lot of  time figuring out what would come next, and most of 2017 was spent in  an embarrassing series of proposals that, according to the  Congressional Budget Office, would uninsure somewhere in the  neighborhood of 20 to 30 million people.   Finally, when a vote was called on the floor of the Senate, just  enough Republican Senators chose to side with the American people, who  want to maintain the protections of the Affordable Care Act and work to  perfect it, that the bill failed by one vote. That 1-year mark will  occur this weekend on Saturday.   So a few of us wanted to come to the floor today to talk about what  has happened since that fateful vote a year ago that was, frankly,  celebrated all across this country, as folks who were deeply fearful  that their healthcare was going to be ripped away from them by the  Congress realized they might be able to rely on it for at least another  year.   Let me set the stage, first by reminding people of the promises that  were made. This is President Trump shortly after his election and just  before his swearing in. He said:         We're going to have insurance for everybody. People covered       under the law can expect to have great healthcare . . . much       less expensive and much better.    That is a clear promise that the President made: Everybody is going  to have insurance. It is going to be less expensive, and it is going to  be better--more insurance, less expensive, better quality.   The vote that took place a year ago this Saturday would have done  exactly the opposite. It would have kicked 30 million people off of  insurance. It would have driven up costs for millions of Americans-- especially those people with preexisting conditions. Coverage would  have been much worse, not much better, in part because people with  preexisting conditions wouldn't be able to access care.   So this promise never came true because of the vote that we took a  year ago this Saturday.   But, occasionally, the President does say something that is true.  This is a picture of the celebration that the House of Representatives  had at the White House the day they voted on the proposal that would  rip away healthcare from 30 million Americans, before the vote that  took place here in the Senate. There are a lot of smiling faces of  Members of Congress who were so excited that people who had cancer or  people who had diabetes would be unable to get healthcare insurance.   This quote is not actually from this press conference. It is from a  rally that the President held just a few weeks ago. He was talking  about the fact that John McCain and some others voted against that  proposal on the Senate floor, which caused it to fail. He said--these  are the President's words: ``It's all right, because we have  essentially gutted it''--the Affordable Care Act--``anyway.'' ``It's  all right, because we have essentially gutted it anyway.''   So that summarizes what has happened since the failed vote on the  floor of the Senate a year ago. President Trump and his Republican  friends in Congress, all smiling behind him, have gutted the Affordable  Care Act, not because they want better healthcare for people but  because they are just angry that they couldn't get the votes to do it  here in Congress. So they are doing it by other means.   So a few of us are going to be on the floor to talk about what has  happened in the last year.  [[Page S5252]]    I actually think that most of my colleagues do want better healthcare  for their constituents, but I don't understand how any of what has  happened, either through legislative act or through administrative  action, gets us there--gets us to that promise that President Trump  made in January of 2017.   Here is what is going on. First, the President signed an Executive  order saying that all of his agencies should start to take their own  actions to unwind the protections of the Affordable Care Act. Then he  stopped the marketing for the Affordable Care Act so that less people  would know about the options that were available to them. Then the  President came to Congress and worked with Republicans to take away one  of the most important pillars of the Affordable Care Act--the  requirement that healthy people buy insurance. That action alone will  result in 13 million people losing insurance and rates going up for 10  million Americans.   Most recently the President authorized the sale of junk insurance  plans all across this country--plans that don't have to cover mental  health or prescription drugs or maternity care.   He then cut funding even deeper for the personnel that help you find  what insurance is right for you, and he instructed the people that  remain to push Americans onto the junk plans.   Then the President sent his lawyers to court to argue that Congress  actually can't protect people with preexisting conditions because it is  unconstitutional, which would wipe out all of the protections that  people enjoy today.   So it is really no mystery as to why, as the 2019 premium increases  are coming out, they are catastrophic. They are catastrophic. Fourteen  States have insurance companies that have requested premium increases  of 10 to 20 percent. Connecticut is one of those. Five States have  insurance companies that requested premium increases of 30 percent or  more. Think about that for a second: 30 percent or more. Who can afford  a 30-percent or a 40-percent increase in premiums? One insurance  company requested a 94-percent increase in rates.   In 21 of the States that have rates filed already, the insurers said  the reason they are doing this--the reason they are passing along  enormous premium increases--is because of the sabotage campaign that is  being run by the President and by this Congress, all or most of it  occurring since the failure of the repeal vote a year ago.   It is all right, says the President. We didn't need to repeal the  Affordable Care Act. That vote that we are marking the 1-year  anniversary of doesn't really matter because we have essentially gutted  it--the Affordable Care Act, the American healthcare system--anyway.   So, finally, before I turn this over to the ranking member on the  HELP Committee, I just want to talk about the next phase of the  sabotage campaign.   If Republicans in Congress can't get the American people to support a  legislative act to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the next hope is for  the courts to do it. That is why the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh is  so critical to this continued campaign of trying to undermine the  Affordable Care Act, because you probably can't get the majority of  Members of Congress to wipe away protections for people with  preexisting conditions, but maybe you can get the Supreme Court to do  it.   There is a case that I just referenced that the Trump administration  is supporting, moving its way through the courts, that would  invalidate--constitutionally invalidate--Congress's protections for  people with preexisting conditions. These are people with cancer,  diabetes, heart disease, mental illness, cerebral palsy, Crohn's  Disease, ALS, addiction, Lupus, epilepsy, Parkinson's, and the list  goes on.   President Trump made clear during the campaign that he wasn't going  to pick a judge in the mold of John Roberts, who would uphold the  Affordable Care Act. He was going to pick judges that would rule with  him to strike down the Affordable Care Act. That is also probably why  he outsourced the decision on whom to pick for this vacant slot to  political groups like the Heritage Foundation.   So the expectation is that Brett Kavanaugh will deliver one of those  five needed votes to strike down the laws on the books, which Congress  can't find the votes to override, protecting people with preexisting  conditions. The Supreme Court could take away your healthcare if you  have a history of any of these diseases, and, if that happens, the  results are lethal. If you have metastatic cancer and you don't have  the protection in the law that says insurance companies can't charge  you more because you are sick, a recent study shows that you will be  charged a rate of $142,000 higher than what you pay today. If you are  an individual with diabetes, your increase could be 137 percent on top  of what you are paying now.   So these are the stakes. These are the stakes as we prepare to vote  on Judge Kavanaugh's nomination, and it is all in service of this very  intentional, very deliberate, very planful campaign of sabotage.   A year ago this Saturday the American people got their way, and this  body decided not to repeal the Affordable Care Act because people like  the fact that 20 million people have insurance. People like the fact  that people with preexisting conditions are protected. That night, the  American people got their way, but since then, the President and this  Congress have been working to undermine it, and the next step in that  plan is the elevation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. It is  important for us to come to the floor and explain what the stakes are.   I yield is floor.
