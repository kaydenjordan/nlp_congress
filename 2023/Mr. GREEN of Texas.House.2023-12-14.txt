 Still I rise, Mr. Speaker, always proud to have  this preeminent privilege of standing here in the House of  Representatives, honored to have the opportunity to serve the people of  the Ninth Congressional District who elected me, but also the people of  this country, this entire country, because when they elected me, they  elected me to become a United States Representative. As such, when I  vote, I am voting for them, but I am also voting for the country.   Today I rise to be grateful and to express my gratitude and my  appreciation to the people of the Ninth Congressional District for  allowing me this opportunity, this singular opportunity of serving in  the Congress of the United States of America. I have been blessed.   I thank the people who happen to live in Brazoria County for allowing  me to serve them. It has been an honor, and it continues to be my  honor. I, in no way, am indicating that I am about to leave the  Congress. I think that this is an opportunity to express my gratitude.  I plan to be here next year and until the people of the Ninth  Congressional District decide otherwise.   I thank the people who live in Brazoria County. I thank the people  who live in Fort Bend County--these counties adjoin each other--and  Harris County.   I didn't get here because I was so smart. I am here because there  were people who thought that I might make a difference in their lives,  and I have tried my best to do so, so I thank them for affording me  this opportunity.   I thank my staff. Members of Congress get things done only when they  have a good staff. I have an excellent staff, and I thank them for what  they do to make it possible for me to do things that I ordinarily would  not be able to do.   I had a friend, Mickey Leland, who served in this Congress, and he  reminded me on many occasions that a great person will always rise to  the occasion, but the greater people make the occasion, so I thank  these occasion makers, the people who make it possible for me to come  here and stand and speak in the House of Representatives in this  Capitol Building.   I thank my chief of staff here in Washington, D.C., who does an  outstanding job. I won't go through his credentials in the entirety,  but he is a lawyer, Scott Bell. I thank Scott for the fine job he has  done to lead the D.C. team.   That team consists of Aaron, who is my legislative director; Raphael,  who is a senior in the office; Jalaina, who is a legislative assistant  in the office; Madison, who is my office administrator; and then there  are other persons who are coming on board. I believe that Izzah will be  on board with me. I have extended an offer to her. We will see if she  accepts.   My D.C. team has done an outstanding job. I am very proud of the job  that all of the members of this team have afforded the people of the  Ninth Congressional District of Texas.   However, I do want to mention one standout, and that is Claudia.  Claudia and I happened to bump into each other when she was working in  another capacity here on the Hill. I take great pride in selecting  people who don't apply for the job, people that I just happen to bump  into along life's way. Such was the case with Claudia. I just bumped  into her. We had some casual conversation, and something said to me,  this is the person who can represent you when people first enter your  office. I thank Claudia very much for the job that she does.   Jalaina and I met when I was at a speaking engagement. She didn't  apply for the job. I spoke to her for some small length of time, found  out that she was looking for a job on the Hill. She applied, and  Jalaina now works in the office. I mentioned her earlier. She is a  legislative assistant in the office.   I am proud of this D.C. team, but in Houston I have a team that has  been with me for a very long time, and I am proud of them, as well. I  am proud of Rachael Rodriguez, who came to me from labor. She is a  labor-oriented person, as am I. I am a dues-checkoff member of a local  labor union, 1550 AFSCME. As such, I am proud to say that Rachael  Rodriguez has done an outstanding job leading the Houston team. She is  more than capable, competent, and qualified. She has a great  personality. She is the kind of person who respects others with her  smiles. Rachael Rodriguez.   Then, of course, there is Crystal Webster. Crystal is the deputy  district director, and she does a little bit of everything. In that  office we all take pride in getting the job done. Everybody will pitch  in to do whatever has to be done. Crystal Webster has done an  outstanding job. I am grateful that she has been with me for many  years.   The persons that I have just spoken of, Crystal and Rachael, have  both been with me for more than a decade.   Of course, I am honored to have in that office Clarence Holliday. We  call him Doc. He has done outstanding work in the outreach area, also  as a caseworker. He is just a fine man, former NAACP president out in  Fort Bend County. He does outstanding work. I am proud to have him.   I am also proud to have Catherine. Catherine is polyglot. She speaks  four different languages; quite well, I might add. She connects me to  communities that but for her I wouldn't connect with. These people are  making a difference in the lives of the people in the Ninth  Congressional District.   I also am honored to have with me Sam, Sam Merchant. Sam Merchant is  a person of Indian heritage; not Native American, Indian heritage. He  has been with me for a number of years as an outreach person. I regret  to say to you that Sam will be leaving the office. He has served us  well. He is moving on to a sunset of retirement. I greatly appreciate  the work that Sam has done for the people of the Ninth Congressional  District.   Of course, we have Robertine, Robertine Jefferson. Her father was my  pastor. He passed away some time ago. I never intended to hire  Robertine. I just happened to be at an event and found out that she was  interested in work, and she came on board with me. She helps us with  our events. She is an event coordinator; par excellence, I might add.  She does an outstanding job. I could not but for her do the many  different things that we do in the district.    Of course, there is Teque'lia. Teque'lia is the coms director in the  office. She came on board not so very long ago and has been very  talented. She picks up on things very quickly, and she produces a great  work product, so I am proud to claim Teque'lia as a member of the team  in Houston, Texas.   There are other persons who are not on the team by virtue of working  in the office. I want to make sure that I acknowledge them as well  because they  [[Page H6973]]  are in and out of the office, so thank you. Of course, there is Colbe  who works in the office, Colbe is a receptionist out front. She drives  when necessary, does a little bit of everything, as well. I am proud to  have this team of workers in the Houston office, all of whom serve us  well.   Today, I will do two additional things, and I will depart. The first  thing I would like to do is to thank the people that I work with here,  people that I disagree with, people that I agree with. I think this is  a time to put aside differences, as I heard Mr. Hoyer so eloquently  express earlier in a presentation; put aside differences and just be  grateful, just be grateful that you have the opportunity to serve and  be grateful for the people that you serve with regardless of their  political persuasions. Just be grateful. So I am grateful to all of the  people that I serve with here, and I thank them for the work that we do  together.   In closing with this work, I am going to say a prayer for all of us,  if I may, after which I will present someone else who will take the  microphone and continue for the rest of the time that remains.   Today, this is my prayer that I have written. I say this prayer  before I consume any food. It is accidental if I consume food and I  don't say this prayer because I am grateful to have the gift of life.   I tell people that I am better than I deserve because I have been  blessed to have the most unique gift in all of the universe, the gift  of life. I don't know why I have it. I didn't earn it, so I have to be  grateful for it. I try to use it in the most efficacious and the most  beneficial way possible. I make mistakes. I am not a perfect person. I  am a sinner, but I do try my best to treat people right. I ask for  forgiveness; and I do ask for forgiveness more often than I probably  should, but I do ask.   This is my prayer, and I don't ask anybody to join me in my prayer,  you do whatever you would ordinarily do. This is my prayer for my  country and for the people that I serve with:   Most gracious Creator, we know You by many names, but we also know  that by any name, You are the Creator of all that was, is, and ever  shall be; and I, as one of Your creations, want to take the time to now  thank You, and I do so on behalf of the many others who may believe as  I do.   I thank You for Your love, Your grace, and the gift of life. I thank  You for Your mercy and Your forgiveness throughout life. I thank You  for Your angels to protect life. I thank You for Your creation to  sustain life: Your air, the breath of life; Your water, the elixir of  life; Your star that we know as Sun, the light and warmth of life; Your  terra firma that we call Earth, the foundation and home of life.   I today ask that You would recognize our weaknesses, our strengths,  and give us the opportunity to serve You and Your creation so that it  may continue as You would will it.   I ask all of these things in the name of the Creator of all of  creation, and I thank You.                                time  1230    At this time, I am honored to introduce someone I have the utmost  respect for. Elected from Maryland's Fifth Congressional District, he  is one of Maryland's finest and a Georgetown University lawyer. He  served as majority leader twice, from 2007 to 2011 and then again from  2019 to 2023. He is a person who has made a difference in my life and,  in so doing, has made a difference in the lives of the people of the  Ninth Congressional District, which I represent.   I am so honored to have this opportunity to yield to the honorable  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), a lawyer, a former State senator,  and still a Member of Congress. I respect and love my dear brother.   God bless you. Merry Christmas and happy holidays.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the former majority leader  for the outstanding presentation. I think it is an appropriate way to  bring this to closure today. May God continue to bless him and keep  him.   Mr. Speaker, as I shake Mr. Hoyer's hand as he passes me by, I am  blessed to know that sometimes fortuitous circumstances can benefit  you.   Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss not to mention the newest staff member  on my team, Eric Goodwine.   Eric does an outstanding job for us in Houston. He not only assists  me in the office, but he also is the principal person that gets me from  point A to point B. Eric does an outstanding job of ensuring that  things are arranged when I arrive at various venues, and I am proud to  have him on the team.   Eric, thank you again. Please forgive me for not mentioning you  initially. All of this was from memory so charge it to being 25 three  times and now working on my fourth 25th birthday, but there is a God  that rules above and a fortuitous circumstance has made a difference.   Mr. Speaker, may God bless this House, and may God bless the United  States of America.  [[Page H6975]]    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
