 Mr. Speaker, I offer a motion to instruct.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on this  motion to instruct.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today because this House has a choice. We can  either stand up for the rights of servicemembers and military families  or we can allow the Republican-led House, and specifically the extreme  faction of the Republican Conference, to continue their assault on  reproductive freedoms.   For my Democratic colleagues and I, this choice is clear. We will  fight. We will fight for the freedom of servicewomen and for their  families, and I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to  please do the same.   Many of our servicemembers joined the Armed Forces prior to the  overturning of Roe v. Wade last June, and they did so with the  understanding that they and their families would be treated with  dignity and would receive comprehensive and high-quality healthcare  services, regardless of where they were stationed--and, yes, that also  includes access to abortion care.   Since Roe was overturned, servicemembers and their families have had  access to travel and to leave if they need to seek reproductive  healthcare, but unfortunately, that freedom is now being threatened  today.   Mr. Speaker, today, for the very first time since 1973, 14 States  have passed outright abortion bans. Seven more have passed partial  bans, and six more have tried but have been stopped by the courts.   Nearly 120,000 servicemembers are currently stationed in Texas. This  is a State that has implemented a draconian anti-choice law and now has  among the worst maternal health outcomes for women in the entire  Nation. Our servicewomen deserve better.   This issue has been politicized, and it has been distorted. Outright  lies have been spread by elected officials and by anti-abortion  activists alike.   I will set the record straight. Here are the facts: Women in States  with abortion bans are nearly three times more likely to die during  pregnancy, during childbirth, or soon after giving birth. Let that sink  in. We are stationing our women in uniform and their families in States  where they are three times more likely to die during pregnancy.   No servicemember should have to accept a reality where they could  literally die as a result of the anti-choice State law where they are  stationed.   These are the conditions that our servicewomen and their military  families have to consider when they decide to serve. Nearly half of  servicemembers no longer have access to abortion care, and that is not  counting even the members of their families, as well.   Our servicemembers signed up to serve our country with the  understanding that one day they may have to make the ultimate  sacrifice, the sacrifice of their life.   Let me remind the Chamber and those who are watching that we have an  all-volunteer force. Again, I will repeat: We have an all-volunteer  force.   As we look to recruit and retain the best fighters and the greatest  minds that this Nation has to offer, we really cannot restrict the very  freedoms that we ask women and men in uniform to potentially die for.   It is also important, as we talk, to go beyond the facts and figures  and to share the personal and human impact of these anti-abortion laws  and the choices we are facing here this week in this body.   In Texas, the second-largest State for Active-Duty servicemembers in  our country, Amanda Zurawski was 18 weeks pregnant when her water  broke, putting her at a high risk for developing a life-threatening  infection. Doctors told Amanda that her life was in danger and that the  fetus was going to die, but doctors could not provide the medical care  that she needed because their hands were tied by Texas law.   Amanda eventually did develop sepsis and did eventually nearly die.  Heartbreakingly, her ability to be and get pregnant in the future might  be damaged, as well.   Amanda survived, and she survived to share this story about her  harrowing experience to hopefully prevent others from having this  experience, as well.   This story and the data that we have talked about today is why I am  working with my colleagues, led by my dear  [[Page H4420]]  friend and fellow veteran, Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill, to try to  codify this basic travel policy.   This body decided that women cannot be trusted to make their own  reproductive healthcare choices, and instead, the majority in this  House has decided to make it harder for servicewomen and their families  to access care; to make it harder for them to make their own healthcare  choices; to make it harder for servicewomen and military families to  decide on their own if, when, and how to start their own families.   Also, a single United States Senator is holding up more than 300  military promotions and counting, hollowing out the military leadership  and hurting our military readiness in the process. He is doing this all  because he is that adamant that women in uniform cannot be trusted.   As a veteran myself, let me say out loud and clear that his actions  are a disgrace, and Americans agree.   Again, more data: 70 percent of our constituents believe that women  should have access to abortion care.   Mr. Speaker, the grave concerns I have outlined don't even begin to  scratch the surface of all the harmful amendments that are also tacked  on to this bill. Quite frankly, it is an embarrassment to this  institution that our governance is just so fractured, so unable  to agree on something so simple as letting a woman in uniform make the  best care decisions for her family, her career, and herself.    Sadly, this is indicative of where we are today. I grew up in a  military family, and I myself served. My parents didn't always agree on  politics, but they shared a common love for the promises that this  Nation offered my father, a refugee and Holocaust survivor who became a  Navy aviator.   I have colleagues on the other side of this aisle with whom I work  and respect, which is why I am deeply saddened to see a bipartisan bill  that has endured for 60 years fall victim to this kind of partisan  politics because the bipartisan bill that we passed originally out of  committee by 58-1 is literally no longer recognizable.   Today, Mr. Speaker, is about choice, choice in more ways than one. We  can either let this far-right minority continue to hold our national  security hostage to their radical agenda, or we can refuse to allow  them to play politics with our national security and with the health  and well-being of our servicemembers.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Just before I introduce our next person, I want to emphasize that  this is not a new policy. The DOD is not simply creating a new policy  out of thin air. The DOD is, in fact, using precedent from the  nonavailability of care and simply allowing women with reproductive  health service needs to be able to have effective travel and  reimbursement for said travel. Again, this is not a new policy, and it  simply updates a policy that allows for travel reimbursement to ensure  that we have equal access to healthcare.   Thankfully, we have a President in Joe Biden who is responsive to the  needs of our military servicemembers and who supports this effort.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms.  McCollum).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Here are the facts: Not a single dollar is going toward paying for an  abortion under the current DOD travel policy, which only provides for  leave and travel reimbursements for servicewomen who are forced to  travel for their healthcare due to restrictive laws of the State that  they are stationed in, in line with a very longstanding DOD policy that  has always provided for travel and leave where specialized healthcare  is not provided or allowed for.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms.  Slotkin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   We don't get to choose what our facts are. The chilling effect that  is happening right now on recruiting is caused by a variety of things,  but the number one reason, the number one contributing factor to a  servicemember's decision to enlist or reenlist, is the support of their  spouse.   If we are showing the entire country that we don't trust women and  families to be in control of their own healthcare decisions, why would  they encourage anyone in their family to reenlist or to enlist in the  service at all.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr.  Crow).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Colorado.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Pelosi), former Speaker of the House.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentlewoman from California.    Mr. Speaker, just a reminder that President Biden knows  personally what it means to support those in uniform and to keep the  administration's promise to make sure that our servicemen and -women  are protected as they serve us all.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr.  Smith), the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Washington.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Garamendi).    Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would like very much, Mr. Speaker, if I could ask you to ask my  colleagues to not presume to judge who I am.   I stand here as a woman who has worn the uniform, who has given birth  while wearing the uniform. To have assumptions about who I am or what I  am and to judge me or any of my other colleagues who have worn the  uniform is an offense to me, and I would ask that you advise them not  to presume anything about me.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, a far-right minority in Congress has spent the last 9  months holding this process, this NDAA, hostage--again, a reminder that  this passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. They are currently  struggling to even pass a rule for Defense appropriations, let alone to  pass the budget itself.   They have gone through attacks on servicewomen, on LGBTQ  servicemembers, on immigrant servicemembers, and so much more. Their  allies in the Senate are risking our military readiness with asinine  confirmation holds and ignoring the repeated requests of our most  senior military members to stop.   Time and time again, they have used must-pass, historically  bipartisan legislation such as the NDAA to force an extreme agenda on  our servicemembers and many others in our country.   As an Air Force veteran and as a proud military child who lived and  served across this great country and in many other places outside of  this country, I did so with the full protections of Roe v. Wade.   It not only saddens me but also pains me to think that we would give  servicewomen orders without the full reproductive freedoms and  protections that I had when I was able to serve.                                time  1315    Today, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to choose to be on the side  of our servicemembers, military families, and all Americans who love  and support them by supporting this motion to instruct.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
