The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton) and the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, my bill, the Fowler and Boskoff Peaks Designation Act,  would designate two unnamed peaks in the Uncompahgre National Forest in  Colorado as Fowler Peak and Boskoff Peak.   Charlie Fowler and his partner, Christine ``Chris'' Boskoff, were  longtime residents of San Miguel County, Colorado, and were avid  alpinists.   Charlie Fowler was one of North America's most experienced mountain  climbers. He was also an author, a guide, a filmmaker, a photographer,  and an advocate for the outdoors. Beginning in the mid-1980s, Charlie  worked full time as a mountain guide, leading mountaineering  expeditions in the United States and abroad.   His photographs and articles were published in a variety of books and  magazines, and he was the author of multiple mountaineering guidebooks.  In 2004, Charlie was awarded the Robert and Miriam Underhill Award by  the American Alpine Society, an honor given annually to an individual  who has demonstrated the highest level of skill in the mountaineering  arts and who, through the application of this skill, courage, and  perseverance, has achieved outstanding success in the various fields of  mountaineering endeavor.   Christine Boskoff began her climbing career in 1993 and quickly rose  to become a leader in the sport of mountaineering. Christine summited  Mount Everest and five of the globe's more than 26,000-foot mountains.  One of the world's leading female alpinists, a professional  mountaineering guide and an adventure entrepreneur, Christine  participated in numerous expeditions in the United States and on five  continents.   Charlie and Christine were also known for their philanthropic work.  Charlie worked to promote his sport by installing climbing walls in  schools across southwest Colorado. Christine was active in nonprofit  organizations that supported the rights of porters and Sherpas, women's  education, global literacy, and gender equality.   Sadly, Charlie and Christine were killed in an avalanche in 2006  while exploring a series of unclimbed summits in China's Sichuan  province.   The naming of these peaks is a fitting tribute to Charlie and  Christine,  [[Page H9442]]  who were outstanding mountaineers and advocates for our Nation's  treasured open spaces.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Reed). The question is on the motion  offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton) that the House  suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 2768.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further  proceedings on this motion will be postponed.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 2615) to authorize the exchange of certain land located in  Gulf Islands National Seashore, Jackson County, Mississippi, between  the National Park Service and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and for  other purposes.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton) and the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1491, which would reaffirm the  Bureau of Indian Affairs' action placing approximately 1,400 acres of  land known as Camp 4 into a trust for the benefit of the Santa Ynez  Band of Chumash Mission Indians in Santa Barbara County, California.   The Chumash Tribe has about 140 enrolled members with a 138-acre  reservation in Santa Ynez, California. The Tribe constructed a casino  and hotel resort on its reservation pursuant to the Indian Gaming  Regulatory Act, which has lifted the Tribe from historic poverty to  economic success.   With other private investments in the region, the Tribe has become  one of the largest employers in Santa Barbara County.   In 2010, the Tribe purchased a 1,400-acre tract of land known as Camp  4, located about 2 miles from the reservation in an unincorporated area  of Santa Barbara County, from the Fess Parker estate. The Tribe has  testified that it intends to use Camp 4 for suitable Tribal housing for  its current and future members. At present, the landscape of Camp 4 is  mainly agricultural.   In 2014, the Bureau of Indian Affairs approved an application filed  by the Tribe to place Camp 4 in trust under the agency's regulatory  procedures. However, the title had not been transferred to the United  States pending the resolution of an administrative appeal filed by  Santa Barbara County and private citizens.   On January 17, 2017, the Department of the Interior dismissed pending  appeals of the application and affirmed the 2014 decision.   Despite the dismissal of the appeals, the Tribe and the County of  Santa Barbara continued work to address concerns with the trust  acquisition. On November 1, 2017, the Tribe and county entered into a  long-term memorandum of agreement to protect the mutual interests of  both the Tribe and the county. The bill, as amended, includes a  reference to this agreement and support of the County of Santa Barbara.   I would like to thank the sponsor of this bill, the chairman of the  Subcommittee on Indian, Insular and Alaska Native Affairs, Mr. LaMalfa,  for his hard work on this legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this measure.   I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. LaMalfa).   Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I am very pleased to speak on  this bill here tonight. I am so proud of the effort to work in a  bipartisan nature with my colleague and friend, the ranking member,  Mrs. Torres, as well as all the members of the committee. We have had  such overwhelming support to move this bill along.   Mr. Speaker, indeed, this is a culmination of a lot of strong,  bipartisan effort here in the committee as well as the community  itself, which sought consensus during the several years that I have  been involved with this legislation and now as chairman of the  Subcommittee on Indian, Insular, and Alaska Native Affairs. We have  seen the local consensus that has been built with the local government,  the Tribe, and my colleagues on the committee.   With the inclusion of language referencing the local agreement, the  bill is supported by the Santa Ynez Band of Chumash Indians; the County  of Santa Barbara; and the region's representative, my colleague,  Representative Salud Carbajal, and was reported out of the House  Natural Resources Committee by unanimous consent on September 17, 2017.   Located in Santa Barbara County for thousands of years, as was  pointed out by my colleagues, the recorded history of the Chumash  reaches back to the earliest arrival of Europeans in California, when  Spanish explorer Cabrillo recorded his encounters with the Chumash in  1542. They had a long and unbroken connection to the Camp 4 parcel,  which is located very close to their current reservation.   In the early 1800s, the Chumash became wards of the Spanish mission  in Santa Ynez, which included Camp 4, and later, the Mexican Governor  granted lands to Chumash members, which also included Camp 4. The  commission created by the Mission Relief Act of 1891 recognized that  the Tribe continued to reside in the Santa Ynez and Camp 4 area, though  only 99 acres were ultimately taken into trust for the Chumash at the  time, which is a fairly common problem for many Tribes.   With the various things that have happened to them, such as  derecognition and decertification over the years, tribes end up on very  small, narrow parcels of land that make it very difficult for them to  grow and prosper. So today, partly because of that, the Chumash face a  significant housing crisis, as was pointed out, and fewer than 17  percent of their members and descendants are able to reside on  [[Page H9445]]  the Tribe's existing reservation, which consists largely of hillsides,  wetlands, and streambeds unsuitable for housing.   To address the housing shortage, the Chumash used their own resources  to purchase the Camp 4 parcel, with the intent of constructing homes  for their members. They applied to take Camp 4 into trust  administratively, and after conducting a thorough public process, the  Bureau of Indian Affairs issued a decision in December of 2014.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from California an  additional 2 minutes.   Mr. LaMALFA. The Department of the Interior then completed the fee- to-trust process in January of 2017. Indeed, this is ongoing.   On October 31, the county ratified an agreement with the Chumash,  ensuring that any impacts of Camp 4 housing on local infrastructure and  other resources would be addressed, and the Department of the Interior  approved this agreement on the same day.   In order to enable the Chumash to address their housing crisis and  ensure any impacts to local governments are addressed, H.R. 1491 takes  the following actions:   It affirms and ratifies the action of the Department of the Interior  to take the Camp 4 parcel into trust on January 19, 2017.   It codifies references to the Chumash-county agreement ratified by  Santa Barbara County on October 31, 2017, addressing impacts to local  infrastructure and services.   By request of the Chumash, it prohibits the operation of gaming  facilities on the Camp 4 parcel.   It protects and respects rights-of-way also held by local  stakeholders.   Mr. Speaker, this bill represents, again, the culmination of years of  effort on the part of the Chumash, the county, the committee, and  Congress to ensure that the concerns of all stakeholders were addressed  fairly through a local process and reaching a consensus with the Tribe  and the county that we sought from the beginning. Indeed, as chairman  of the Subcommittee on Indian, Insular, and Alaska Native Affairs, I  believe this agreement is the outcome of good faith negotiations by all  parties and should be considered a model for maintaining positive  working relationships between tribal and local governments.   I urge all Members to support this bipartisan, noncontroversial  measure.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 3115) to provide for a land exchange involving Federal land  in the Superior National Forest in Minnesota acquired by the Secretary  of Agriculture through the Weeks Law, and for other purposes, as  amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 3115         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.         (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Superior       National Forest Land Exchange Act of 2017''.        (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act       is as follows:  Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents. Sec. 2. Purpose and need for NorthMet Land Exchange. Sec. 3. Definitions. Sec. 4. NorthMet Land Exchange. Sec. 5. Valuation of NorthMet Land Exchange. Sec. 6. Maps and legal descriptions. Sec. 7. Post-exchange land management. Sec. 8. Miscellaneous provisions.       SEC. 2. PURPOSE AND NEED FOR NORTHMET LAND EXCHANGE.         (a) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to further the       public interest by consummating the NorthMet Land Exchange as       specifically set forth in this Act.        (b) Need.--According to the Final Record of Decision, the       NorthMet Land Exchange is advisable and needed because the       NorthMet Land Exchange will--        (1) result in a 40-acre net gain in National Forest System       lands;        (2) improve the spatial arrangement of National Forest       System lands by reducing the amount of ownership boundaries       to be managed by 33 miles;        (3) improve management effectiveness by exchanging isolated       Federal lands with no public overland access for non-Federal       lands that will have public overland access and be accessible       and open to public use and enjoyment;        (4) result in Federal cost savings by eliminating certain       easements and their associated administration costs;        (5) meet several of the priorities identified in the land       and resource management plan for Superior National Forest to       protect and manage administratively or congressionally       designated, unique, proposed, or recommended areas, including       acquisition of 307 acres of land to the administratively       proposed candidate Research Natural Areas, which are managed       by preserving and maintaining areas for ecological research,       observation, genetic conservation, monitoring, and       educational activities;        (6) promote more effective land management that would meet       specific National Forest needs for management, including       acquisition of over 6,500 acres of land for new public       access, watershed protection, ecologically rare habitats,       wetlands, water frontage, and improved ownership patterns;        (7) convey Federal land generally not needed for other       Forest resource management objectives, because such land is       adjacent to intensively developed private land including       ferrous mining areas, where abundant mining infrastructure       and transportation are already in place, including--        (A) a large, intensively developed open pit mine lying       directly to the north of the Federal land;        (B) a private mine railroad, powerlines, and roads lying       directly to the south of the Federal land; and        (C) already existing ore processing, milling, and tailings       facilities located approximately 5 miles to the west of the       Federal land; and        (8) provide a practical resolution to complex issues       pertaining to the development of private mineral rights       underlying the Federal land surface, and thereby avoid       potential litigation which could adversely impact the status       and management of the Federal land and other National Forest       System land acquired under the authority of section 6 of the       Act of March 1, 1911 (commonly known as the Weeks Law; 16       U.S.C. 515).

SEC. 5. VALUATION OF NORTHMET LAND EXCHANGE.         (a) Appraisals.--The Congress makes the following new       findings:        (1) Appraisals of the Federal and non-Federal lands to be       exchanged in the NorthMet Land Exchange were formally       prepared in accordance with the Uniform Appraisal Standards       for Federal Land Acquisitions, and were approved by the       Secretary in conjunction with preparation of the November       2015 Draft Record of Decision on the NorthMet Land Exchange.        (2) The appraisals referred to in paragraph (1) determined       that the value of the non-Federal lands exceeded the value of       the Federal land parcel by approximately $425,000.        (3) Based on the appraisals referred to in paragraph (1),       the United States would ordinarily be required to make a       $425,000 cash equalization payment to Poly Met to equalize       exchange values under the Federal Land Policy and Management       Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), unless such an       equalization payment is waived by Poly Met.        (b) Values for Consummation of Land Exchange.--The       appraised values of the Federal and non-Federal land       determined and approved by the Secretary in November 2015,       and referenced in subsection (a)--        (1) shall be the values utilized to consummate the NorthMet       Land Exchange; and        (2) shall not be subject to reappraisal.        (c) Waiver of Equalization Payment.--        (1) Condition on land exchange.--Notwithstanding section       206(b) of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (43       U.S.C. 1716(b)), and as part of its offer to exchange the       non-Federal lands as provided in section 4(a)(1) of this Act,       Poly Met shall waive any payment to it of any monies owed by       the United States to equalize land values.        (2) Treatment of waiver.--A waiver of the equalization       payment under paragraph (1) shall be considered as a       voluntary donation to the United States by Poly Met for all       purposes of law.       SEC. 6. MAPS AND LEGAL DESCRIPTIONS.         (a) Minor Adjustments.--By mutual agreement, the Secretary       and Poly Met may correct minor or typographical errors in any       map, acreage estimate, or description of the Federal land       parcel or non-Federal land to be exchanged in the NorthMet       Land Exchange.        (b) Conflict.--If there is a conflict between a map, an       acreage estimate, or a description of land under this Act,       the map shall control unless the Secretary and Poly Met       mutually agree otherwise.        (c) Exchange Maps.--The maps referred to in section 3       depicting the Federal and non-Federal lands to be exchanged       in the NorthMet Land Exchange, and dated June 2017, depict       the identical lands identified in the Final Record of       Decision, which are on file in the Office of the Supervisor,       Superior National Forest.       SEC. 7. POST-EXCHANGE LAND MANAGEMENT.         (a) Non-federal Land.--Upon conveyance of the non-Federal       land to the United States in the NorthMet Land Exchange, the       non-Federal land shall become part of the Superior National       Forest and be managed in accordance with--        (1) the Act of March 1, 1911 (commonly known as the Weeks       Law; 16 U.S.C. 500 et seq.); and        (2) the laws and regulations applicable to the Superior       National Forest and the National Forest System.        (b) Planning.--Upon acquisition by the United States in the       NorthMet Land Exchange, the non-Federal lands shall be       managed in a manner consistent with the land and resource       management plan applicable to adjacent federally owned lands       in the Superior National Forest. An amendment or supplement       to the land and resource management plan shall not be       required solely because of the acquisition of the non-Federal       lands.        (c) Federal Land.--Upon conveyance of the Federal land       parcel to Poly Met in the NorthMet Land Exchange, the Federal       land parcel shall become private land and available for any       lawful use in accordance with applicable Federal, State, and       local laws and regulations pertaining to mining and other       uses of land in private ownership.       SEC. 8. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.         (a) Withdrawal of Acquired Non-Federal Land.--The non-      Federal lands acquired by the United States in the NorthMet       Land Exchange shall be withdrawn, without further action by       the Secretary, from appropriation and disposal under public       land laws and under laws relating to mineral and geothermal       leasing.        (b) Withdrawal Revocation.--Any public land order that       withdraws the Federal land parcel from appropriation or       disposal under a public land law shall be revoked without       further action by the Secretary to the extent necessary to       permit conveyance of the Federal land parcel to Poly Met.        (c) Withdrawal of Federal Land Pending Conveyance.--The       Federal land parcel to be conveyed to Poly Met in the       NorthMet Land Exchange, if not already withdrawn or       segregated from appropriation or disposal under the mineral       leasing and geothermal or other public land laws upon       enactment of this Act, is hereby so withdrawn, subject to       valid existing rights, until the date of conveyance of the       Federal land parcel to Poly Met.        (d) Act Controls.--In the event any provision of the Record       of Decision conflicts with a provision of this Act, the       provision of this Act shall control.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton) and the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3115, authored by Congressman Richard Nolan, is a  bipartisan bill that implements a land exchange to facilitate the  exercise of certain mineral rights in the Superior National Forest in  Minnesota to create economic growth for the area.   Congressman Nolan will certainly provide the history of this  exchange,  [[Page H9447]]  but I do want to take note that this bill has greater impacts than just  a single forest in Minnesota.   Across the United States, people hold mineral estates underlying  lands that were acquired by the National Forest under the Weeks Act.  Without an agreement such as the one authorized by this bill, their  ability to exercise those valid preexisting rights is in jeopardy.   I note that the land exchange authorized in this bill has undergone  extensive environmental review under the National Environmental Policy  Act of 1969 and was supported by the Obama administration.   This is an equal-value land exchange, but the holder of the mineral  estate forgoes any equalization under the bill if the private land  being swapped for the Federal land is worth more.   Finally, the bill provides a net increase in the size of the Superior  National Forest of 40 acres. It is no wonder that this bill was  supported by the ranking members of the Subcommittee on Federal Lands  and the Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources when it was  considered by the Natural Resources Committee in July.   I commend Congressman Nolan, Congressman Collin Peterson, Congressman  Tom Emmer, and Congressman Jason Lewis for working together to craft  this commonsense solution bill to help Minnesota.   Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the measure, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Collins of New York). The question is on  the motion offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton) that the  House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3115, as amended.   The question was taken.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds  being in the affirmative, the ayes have it.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 995) to direct the Secretary of Agriculture and the  Secretary of the Interior to amend regulations for racial  appropriateness, as amended.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   H.R. 995         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``21st Century Respect Act''.       SEC. 2. AMENDMENTS TO REGULATIONS REQUIRED.         (a) Secretary of Agriculture.--The Secretary of Agriculture       shall amend section 1901.202 of title 7, Code of Federal       Regulations, for purposes of--        (1) replacing the reference to the term ``Negro or Black''       with ``Black or African American'';        (2) replacing the reference to the term ``Spanish Surname''       with ``Hispanic''; and        (3) replacing the reference to the term ``Oriental'' with       ``Asian American or Pacific Islander''.        (b) Secretary of the Interior.--The Secretary of the       Interior shall amend section 906.2 of title 36, Code of       Federal Regulations, for purposes of--        (1) replacing the references to the term ``Negro'' with       ``Black or African American'';        (2) replacing the definition of ``Negro'' with the       definition of ``Black or African American'' as ``a person       having origins in any of the Black racial groups of Africa'';        (3) replacing the references to the term ``Oriental'' with       ``Asian American or Pacific Islander''; and        (4) replacing the references to the terms ``Eskimo'' and       ``Aleut'' with ``Alaska Native''.       SEC. 3. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.         Nothing in this Act, or the amendments required by this       Act, shall be construed to affect Federal law, except with       respect to the use of terms by the Secretary of Agriculture       and the Secretary of the Interior, respectively, to the       regulations affected by this Act.    The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Tipton) and the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Torres)  each will control 20 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the bill under consideration.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Colorado?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, the United States is 241 years old. In that time, the  country has seen an immense amount of change and growth. Over the  course of history, laws and policies have been updated to be able to  reflect this growth. However, some decades-old statutes and regulations  still contain antiquated terms.   Enacted in 2016, Public Law 114-157 modernized antiquated ethnic  terms related to minorities found in the Office of Minority Economic  Impact of the Department of Energy and section 106 of the Local Public  Works Capital Development and Investment Act of 1976 for racial  appropriateness.   H.R. 995 would make similar changes to terms found in certain  regulations of the Department of Agriculture and the Department of the  Interior.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the sponsor of this bill, Mr. Jeffries, and I  urge adoption of the measure.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                  Committee on Natural Resources,                                  Washington, DC, November 20, 2017.      Hon. K. Michael Conaway,      Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,      Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: We thank you for agreeing to discharge       the Committee on Agriculture from further consideration of       H.R. 995, the 21st Century Respect Act, that the Committee on       Natural Resources ordered favorably reported, as amended, on       November 8, 2017.        This concession in no way affects your jurisdiction over       the subject matter of the bill, and it will not serve as       precedent for future referrals. In addition, should a       conference on the bill be necessary, I would support your       request to have the Committee on Agriculture represented on       the conference committee. Finally, I would be pleased to       include this letter and your response in the bill report and       in the Congressional Record.        Thank you for your consideration of my request and for the       extraordinary cooperation shown by you and your staff over       matters of shared jurisdiction. I look forward to further       opportunities to work with you this Congress.            Sincerely,                                                     Rob Bishop,                                                           Chairman,      Committee on Natural Resources.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                        Committee on Agriculture,                                  Washington, DC, November 20, 2017.      Hon. Rob Bishop,      Chariman, Committee on Natural Resources, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for the opportunity to review       H.R. 995, 21st Century Respect Act. As you are aware, the       bill was primarily referred to the Committee on Natural       Resources, while the Agriculture Committee received an       additional referral.        I recognize and appreciate your desire to bring this       legislation before the House in an expeditious manner and,       accordingly, I agree to discharge H.R. 995 from further       consideration by the Committee on Agriculture. I do so with       the understanding that by discharging the bill, the Committee       on Agriculture does not waive any future jurisdictional claim       on this or similar matters. Further, the Committee on       Agriculture reserves the right to seek the appointment of       conferees, if it should become necessary.        I ask that you insert a copy of our exchange of letters       into the Congressional Record during consideration of this       measure on the House floor.        Thank you for your courtesy in this matter and I look       forward to continued cooperation between our respective       committees.            Sincerely,                                                K. Michael Conaway,                                                          Chairman.     Mr. Speaker, I think the legislation that we are seeing  on this floor today demonstrates addressing a variety of issues, be it  on our public lands, needing that to be able to be updated, private  property rights to be able to update it, but probably nothing is more  personal than the legislation that we are addressing at this particular  moment, to be able to be respectful of individuals and have that there  to actually be able to be addressed.                                time  1715    This legislation is a long time coming--much like Mr. Jeffries,  coming to the floor--to be able to address this important piece of  legislation, for the House to be able to consider, as we move forward  with our business.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 995, as amended.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.   The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to direct  the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to  modernize terms in certain regulations.''.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
