 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn  the U.N. resolution which hinders the path to peace and aims to  undermine Israel, one of our country's top allies.   Our policy has long been that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict should  be resolved by direct, bilateral talks between the two parties. This  U.N. resolution contradicts our longstanding policy, first, by  legitimatizing Palestinian Authority efforts to utilize international  organizations to carry out its own solution; and second, by not  providing for the Palestinian Authority to uphold their own  responsibility as it relates to the peace negotiations.   The U.N. resolution disregards that Hamas, a terrorist organization,  presently controls a portion of what would be the Palestinian state.  That is an outrage, Mr. Speaker.   We must not sit on the sidelines or be silenced when anti-Israel  resolutions are presented at international organizations. That is why I  support H. Res. 11 today.
