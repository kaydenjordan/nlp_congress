 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, it is a fact that Russia, a foreign  adversary, interfered in our election and even breached the voter  database for the State of Illinois, my home State.   For the sake of our national security, this is an issue that must be  addressed by the United States Congress because this isn't a Republican  issue and it is not a Democratic issue. It is our duty as Americans and  elected officials to protect our democracy.   That is why, this week, we will pass the Securing America's Federal  Elections Act. Our bill would require voting machines to be  manufactured in the United States of America. It would also make  investments to secure our elections and prevent interference from  foreign enemies in the future.   As Members of Congress, we take an oath to protect our Constitution  and our democracy. I hope both Republicans and Democrats will come  together to support this bill and secure our elections.                            ____________________
