 Mr. Speaker, when it comes to sports, many  athletes will tell you that they play better when they play at home. It  is referred to as the home-field advantage. Having that home advantage  is just as important to kids as it is to athletes.   Kids do better and are more likely to succeed and thrive with family  at home. Every child deserves a safe and loving home where they are  supported and encouraged. Sadly, not all do. That is where the  Children's Home Society of Florida comes in.   Today, I rise to honor the Children's Home Society of Florida, a  champion in childcare that for 120 years has served as a place of  refuge, providing abandoned and homeless children with safe homes and  loving care.   Since 1902, this society has exemplified what it means to truly look  after a community. Starting with a team of just two and caring for 24  children, the Children's Home Society of Florida now boasts over 1,000  team members empowering more than 80,000 children and family members.   Their services include mental health care, trauma-informed care,  early childhood services, job training, and so much more. These  wonderful people's work spans every aspect of the development of  tomorrow's leaders, ensuring that Florida will still be the best State  in the U.S. for decades to come.   These accomplishments and more are why I am proud, by the power  vested in me, to announce that November 17, 2023, is now recognized as  Children's Home Society of Florida Day.   Mr. Speaker, I am honored to ask you and my colleagues to join me in  [[Page H5942]]  celebrating this significant milestone. I wish the Children's Home  Society of Florida to continue to score touchdowns and home runs for  kids in the years ahead because every child is worth fighting for.                          Recognizing Mayor Ron Sapp     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mayor Ron  Sapp for his decades of dedication and service to Fernandina Beach.   During Mayor Sapp's 24 years of civic service as mayor, vice mayor,  and commissioner--spanning four decades--he has displayed an unwavering  commitment to bettering our hometown of Fernandina Beach, Florida.  I was proud to serve alongside him and the commission, as did my  father.    Fernandina is proud of Ron Sapp not only because of his dedication to  his community but also for his military service as an Air Force  veteran. However, no true biography of Ron would be complete without a  chapter on Mr. Sapp, the teacher.   Mr. Sapp didn't just teach students what to think. He taught them how  to think, and that is something special. Generations of Pirates  developed an interest in and love for public service, and for that  inspiration, we are grateful.   Mayor Sapp sought to preserve the spirit of Fernandina Beach as a  small island town. It is a better place because of his accomplishments.  Ron has done all these things with his wife, Kasey, by his side, the  support of his daughters, Sherri and Lori, and the love of his  grandchildren.   On November 14, one of Mayor Sapp's greatest achievements is being  named after him, the Ron Sapp Egans Creek Greenway. Mayor Sapp's  introduction of the open space bond issue secured the funding for this  greenway, which will leave this land untouched by development to be  enjoyed by all for generations to come.   I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Mayor Ron Sapp for his  significant role in shaping Fernandina Beach into the beautiful town it  is today.                            ____________________
