 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mrs.  Clermont Huger Lee for being one of the 2020 honorees at the Savannah  College of Art and Design's Women of Vision recognition ceremony.   During the middle 1900s, Mrs. Lee was a true trailblazer in our  community for her groundbreaking work as a landscape architect. In  Savannah, she became the first female landscape architect with her own  practice. Additionally, she was considered the foremost expert in re- creating the historic landscapes that are so critical to Savannah's  downtown.   Although she passed away in 2006 at the age of 92, her work is still  extensively studied at SCAD and can be seen across Savannah in gardens  at the Davenport House, the Juliette Gordon Low Birthplace, the Owens- Thomas House, and more.   Now, in the 21st century, female landscape architects are leading a  number of important projects across the country.   Mr. Speaker, I thank everyone involved with the Savannah Women of  Vision recognition ceremony for honoring such an important woman.                          Recognizing Freddie Smith     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr.  Freddie Smith, who retired this past year as pastor of the Sweat  Memorial Baptist Church in Waycross, Georgia, after leading the church  for the last 25 years.   Leading people to the Word of God has been Mr. Smith's passion since  he was 13 years old. At the time, he was headed with his family to a  revival in Ocala, Florida, when he asked his father to pull over the  car so that he could walk to the church with the day's guest preacher.  The preacher told him: Don't be afraid to walk toward the Lord. Pastor  Smith started preaching only a few years later.   During his time at Sweat Memorial in the First Congressional District  of Georgia, the services he led were known by everyone in the area for  being beautifully orchestrated and welcoming, reflecting the  personality of Pastor Smith.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Pastor Smith for his work in Waycross over the  last 25 years. Even in his retirement, I know he will continue working  in the community to make it a better place to live.   Congratulations.                          Recognizing Suzanne Shank     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Ms.  Suzanne Shank, who is one of the 2020 honorees at the Savannah College  of Art and Design's Women of Vision recognition ceremony.   A native of Savannah, Ms. Shank is the president, CEO, and cofounder  of Siebert Williams Shank & Company. Under her watch, the company has  grown from a startup investment banking firm to now being involved in  over $2 trillion in municipal and corporate bonds.   In 2010, the company became the first female- and minority-owned firm  in Wall Street history to be ranked in the top 10 municipal bond  underwriters. Additionally, U.S. Banker Magazine ranked Ms. Shank as  one of the most powerful women in finance.   But her work transcends finance through her commitment to mentor  inner city youth, her service on industry associations, and her work  with the Spelman College Board of Trustees.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Ms. Shank on her honor as a 2020 Savannah  Woman of Vision.   Keep up the great work.   Mr. Speaker, I thank SCAD for honoring this Savannahian, who is a  true trailblazer.                   Recognizing the Savannah Art Association     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  Savannah Art Association, which will be 100 years old this February.   The oldest art association in Georgia, it was founded in February of  1920 in the basement of Mills B. Lane's home. From there, the Savannah  Art Association moved to the Telfair Museum and, now, has two galleries  at Chippewa Square and the Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport.  It has come a long way over the 100 years since those members meeting  in the Lanes' home.   Today, the Savannah Art Association has over 150 members from all  artistic levels, beginner to professional, who are constantly helping  each other and improving their techniques. They work diligently to make  our community a better place to live through their exhibits,  demonstrations, workshops, education programs, and partnerships with  local businesses to showcase their artwork.   Mr. Speaker, I thank everyone involved with the Savannah Art  Association for their work in our area.   Congratulations on your 100-year anniversary.                            ____________________
