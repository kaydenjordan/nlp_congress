The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the  first time.   The gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith) and the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis) each will control 30 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nebraska.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 2824, the Increasing  Opportunity and Success for Children and Parents Through Evidence-Based  Home Visiting Act. This bill would reauthorize the Maternal, Infant,  and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, known as MIECHV, for 5 years  and make sure the program continues to focus on results.   I would like to note, this bill represents the first full  reauthorization proposal Congress has considered for this program.   The Ways and Means Human Resources Subcommittee, which I chair, held  a hearing on the program earlier this year. We solicited feedback from  stakeholders, marked up a bill in committee, and today we are debating  this bill on the floor. This is how Congress is supposed to work, and  this bill is an example of Congress getting its work done.   The MIECHV Program helps support State and local efforts to provide  voluntary, evidence-based home visiting services to parents and  children living in communities that put them at risk of poor social and  health outcomes, including in rural areas like those I represent.   Unlike many other programs that focus on money spent or people  served, this program focuses on achieving real results for families.  Specifically, this program promotes school readiness of young children,  increases economic self-sufficiency of families, improves prenatal  health and birth outcomes, and prevents childhood abuse and neglect.   Madam Chair, I have had the opportunity to see firsthand what home  visiting looks like. In March, I spent time in Nebraska with the  Panhandle Public Health District's Healthy Families America program in  western Nebraska. The program focuses on improving the economic success  and school readiness of vulnerable children and families in three  Nebraska counties: Scotts Bluff, Morrill, and Box Butte.   During my visit, I met with Dawn, one of the program participants,  who told me what it was like for her to work with a home visitor. Her  home visitor helped her find a stable home and a steady income to  provide for her growing family. These are the types of outcomes we  should be expecting when we have programs to help those who are  struggling to get ahead.   MIECHV works because funding is tied to evidence. Unfortunately,  MIECHV is the exception, as few Federal social programs have been  evaluated at all, and almost none condition funding on evidence of  whether the program actually works.   In the Better Way agenda put forward by House Republicans last year,  we proposed doing more of what MIECHV does: measuring how well programs  are working to focus funding on those which produce real results. When  we spend limited taxpayer dollars to help those in need, we must make  sure we are spending money on effective programs. To do otherwise is a  disservice to both taxpayers as well as those we are seeking to help.   On March 15 of this year, the Human Resources Subcommittee held a  hearing on MIECHV. In the hearing, we heard from those with firsthand  experience with home visiting programs, and their input was invaluable  as we developed this proposal.    Both before and after the hearing, we sought input from States and  others about how the program was working and how it could be improved  and strengthened. These conversations also informed the bill before us  today.   I should also note, there is broad bipartisan support for MIECHV,  including from dozens of national organizations and hundreds of State  and local organizations, including business leaders, law enforcement  officers, faith-based groups, healthcare providers, child welfare  advocacy organizations, and early education providers.   While I understand some of my colleagues would like to continue this  program or even increase its funding without an offset, under the rules  that govern this Chamber and our current deficits, it would be  irresponsible and against the rules of this Chamber to fund this  program without finding ways to reduce spending elsewhere. That is why  we are considering this as part of a package of two bills today: this  bill and the Control Unlawful Fugitive Felons Act of 2017, which will  be considered later this week during its own debate.   Instead of increasing our Nation's debt, we should be doing more of  what we are doing here today: prioritizing Federal spending and  focusing on what works by improving the integrity of one program to  provide funding for another.   Madam Chair, I am grateful for the time we are spending here today to  consider the reauthorization of this important program, and I  appreciate the opportunity to stand in support of this bill today.   I reserve the balance of my time.                                           House of Representatives,                                Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                 Washington, DC, September 18, 2017.      Hon. Kevin Brady,      Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Brady: I write concerning H.R. 2824,       Increasing Opportunity through  [[Page H7507]]       Evidence-Based Home Visiting Act, which was additionally       referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce.        I wanted to notify you that the Committee will forgo action       on H.R. 2824 so that it may proceed expeditiously to the       House floor for consideration. This is done with the       understanding that the Committee's jurisdictional interests       over this and similar legislation are in no way diminished or       altered. In addition, the Committee reserves the right to       seek conferees on H.R. 2824 and requests your support when       such a request is made.        I would appreciate your response confirming this       understanding with respect to H.R. 2824 and ask that a copy       of our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the       Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the       House floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Greg Walden,      Chairman.                                   ____                                           House of Representatives,                                     Committee on Ways and Means,                                 Washington, DC, September 18, 2017.      Hon. Greg Walden,      Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Walden: Thank you for your letter concerning       H.R. 2824, the ``Increasing Opportunity through Evidence-      Based Home Visiting Act,'' on which the Energy and Commerce       Committee was granted an additional referral.        I am most appreciative of your decision to waive formal       consideration of H.R. 2824 so that it may proceed       expeditiously to the House floor. I acknowledge that although       you waived formal consideration of the bill, the Energy and       Commerce Committee is in no way waiving its jurisdiction over       the subject matter contained in those provisions of the bill       that fall within your Rule X jurisdiction. I would support       your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate number of       conferees on any House-Senate conference involving this       legislation.        I will include a copy of our letters in our committee       report and in the Congressional Record during consideration       of this legislation on the House floor.            Sincerely,                                                       Kevin Brady,                                                          Chairman.    Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time  as I may consume.   Madam Chair, following the wisdom of Frederick Douglass, who said it  is easier to build strong families, strong children, than to repair  broken men, I introduced my first bipartisan home visiting bill over a  decade ago, in 2005. Since 2005, home visiting has been uniquely  bipartisan--until today.   Research is clear. Home visiting makes kids and families stronger,  healthier, and safer. In my home State of Illinois, MIECHV improved  program coordination, reinforced the emphasis on proven models, and  expanded availability of services. Unfortunately, the majority's  approach has rejected bipartisanship and made timely reauthorization of  home visiting less likely.   H.R. 2824 presents substantial cuts to home visiting and threatens  the effectiveness of services for vulnerable children and families.  Equally bad, the rule under which we are considering this bill  conditions home visiting help to vulnerable families on harming seniors  and persons with disabilities. Although we are not voting on that  provision today, the rule we are considering this bill under makes it  an inescapable part of it.   I join with over 110 civil rights, disability, and aging agencies to  strongly oppose the Republican effort to pay for home visiting services  that strengthen vulnerable children by stripping certain low-income  seniors and those with severe disabilities of basic income they need to  survive.   H.R. 2824 also is inconsistent with bipartisan Senate legislation  introduced last week, which rejected the most controversial and  problematic changes in H.R. 2824 in order to keep what works.   So what should the House have done instead of H.R. 2824?   826 organizations urged the House and Senate leaders to ``reauthorize  this important program for 5 years, with a doubling of funding from  $400 million, annually, to $800 million, annually, to allow States,  territories, and Tribes to expand these services to more children and  families.'' Yet H.R. 2824 fails to increase funding by even one penny.   Currently, MIECHV dollars serve only about 6 percent of eligible  families and less than 50 percent of eligible Tribes. I tried to offer  a fully paid-for alternative to double funding for home visiting over 5  years without harmful policy changes but was not allowed a vote in  committee or on the floor.   One of the most harmful policy changes is a new ``State match''  requirement, which would be in addition to the ``maintenance of  effort'' requirement already in law. Just as with their failed  healthcare bill, this Republican bill pushes their fight to make States  pay more for services, while harming vulnerable children and families  as collateral damage. There is no doubt that the State match in this  bill will reduce home visiting in many States and Tribes, cut services,  and harm families.   The Republican bill further undermines successful home visiting by  changing it from a program to improve child development and parent- child relationships to a failed jobs program. Defining a core outcome  of MIECHV as increased employment and earnings will gut Federal home  visiting. Not one--not one--of the evidence-based models is a job  training program. Not one.   This bill says, if any program wants to improve economic self- sufficiency, it shall include employment and earnings. Further, the  bill applies stringent, unrealistic outcome standards.   H.R. 2824 is failure by design for home visiting. Later today, I urge  my colleagues to support Congressman Pascrell's amendment to strike  this change.   After a decade of bipartisan efforts to increase Federal funds for  home visiting, I am deeply saddened that H.R. 2824 now is the House  Republican priority list for cutting funding, reducing services, and  undermining the infrastructure that so many have worked to build. I  unequivocally oppose this harmful bill and its discriminatory pay-for,  joining the good company of the NAACP, the American Academy of  Pediatrics, Justice in Aging, National Women's Law Center, and the Arc  of the United States, to name just a few.   I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 2824 so that we can move quickly  on to a bipartisan approach which builds on home visiting's  considerable strength.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1400     Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan).

Madam Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski).    Madam Chair, I just want to add for the Record  that the State of Florida matches their funds more than 2 to 1 already,  so I am anxious to present the data here as it becomes necessary and is  helpful to the exchange here.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Madam Chair, I yield myself the  balance of my time to close.   Madam Chair, we know that home visiting works. There is no doubt  about it. It is evidence based. Nobody has spoken anything that one  would say it was not needed. It works for families and children in  communities across our country. We agree about that on a bipartisan  basis.   So we should not be here today debating a partisan bill, a bill that  home visiting experts say poses a risk to the program's survival. We  should be moving forward on a bipartisan bill without policy changes  that might shut down home visiting in some communities or set it up for  failure.   I hope that my colleagues will vote for the amendments being offered  today that will improve the bill, but I also have some concerns about  the State match.   No matter what we say, think of States and territories that have just  been devastated by the floods and hurricanes. It is going to be very  difficult for them to come up with the match money to keep some  programs alive.   So I hope that my colleagues will vote for the amendments being  offered today that will improve the bill. I regret that there will not  be enough of them to make this the bill that we had hoped it would be.   Madam Chairwoman, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Again, I would like to take this time to thank my colleagues for  taking the time to consider the reauthorization of this important  program.   The MIECHV Program has bipartisan support due to its focus on  achieving real results for families. This program works because its  funding is tied to real evidence. It is imperative that we continue  this program in a responsible way, partnering with States to increase  the program's success.   I might repeat that for emphasis. It is imperative that we continue  this program in a responsible way--a reasonable way, I will add--as we  partner with States to increase the program's success. This bill shows  how we can prioritize our Federal spending, focusing on programs with  evidence that shows they actually work.   I look forward to moving this bill forward to reauthorize the MIECHV  Program so more Americans can get the help they need to get ahead.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.   Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment  under the 5-minute rule.

Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Smith of Nebraska    The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in  House Report 115-331.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 5, beginning on line 17, strike ``of the service       delivery model or models that the eligible entity may need to       develop for the model to operate'' and inserting ``to operate       at least 1 approved model of home visiting''.    The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 533, the gentleman from  Nebraska (Mr. Smith) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nebraska.    Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Madam Chair, this amendment seeks to establish a careful balance  between two competing views in regards to where and how home visiting  programs  [[Page H7512]]  should be operated. The law requires States to operate home visiting  programs in areas of highest need. However, some States expressed  concern that they have been required to operate home visiting programs  in areas where they were likely to fail, as they were not permitted to  take into account staff and community resources and other requirements  of a home visiting model when choosing where to operate.   In the bill I introduced with my colleagues, we allowed States to  take these considerations into account, and States were generally  pleased with this change. However, since the introduction of the bill,  we have received additional feedback that some changes might be needed  to make sure States could take into account these factors but not  simply avoid serving actual areas with the highest need, including  rural areas and remote areas that I represent, as well as others.   During the Ways and Means markup of this bill, Representative Sewell  offered an amendment to address this problem. Although we did not  include her actual amendment in the reported bill, as we did not have  enough time to review it and consider any unintended consequences,  Representative Sewell and I have been able to review her proposal since  the markup and discuss its implications. I am pleased today to offer  this bipartisan amendment to address the concerns she and others have  raised.   Specifically, this amendment, combined with the language in the  underlying bill, allows States to take into account staffing, community  resources, and other requirements when determining how to operate their  home visiting programs, while requiring that they operate at least one  home visiting model in those communities with a high need for services.  This ensures States do not shy away from some of the most difficult  areas, which are often those that need home visiting services the most.   I am glad we have been able to work together on this bipartisan  amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support the amendment as well as  the underlying bill.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, again, I am grateful that Ms.  Sewell and I could work together to come up with this amendment. I  certainly urge its adoption as we do move forward with the bill.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith).   The amendment was agreed to.                   Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Pascrell    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2  printed in House Report 115-331.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.    Mr. Chairman, since the creation of the MIECHV  Program, States have been required to demonstrate their home visiting  programs result in measurable improvements in six benchmark areas  specified in the law.   One of the benchmark areas States can choose to focus on is  ``improvements in family economic self-sufficiency.'' Yet, as the  result of changes made last year under the prior Presidential  administration, ``economic self-sufficiency'' no longer means what you  think it means--increasing work and earnings. Instead, it was defined  as whether you have health insurance or are in school.   Clearly, this is not what Congress meant when the program was created  and included the concept of economic self-sufficiency. So this bill  would make sure that States, if they choose to focus on family economic  self-sufficiency as one of the four benchmarks of the six, would  measure employment and earnings as a part of that metric.   Again, States can choose among six different benchmarks when they  decide which home visiting programs to operate and what goals they  would like to achieve within those previously established by Congress.  They don't have to choose this metric, as I mentioned earlier. However,  when they do explicitly set out to increase economic self-sufficiency-- emphasis on the economic--information on work and earnings must be part  of what is measured to determine whether they have achieved their goal.  I believe it is absolutely critical that this intent be restored in the  law.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment and  support the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, again, I urge my colleagues to  oppose the amendment as well as support the underlying bill, and I  yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition  to the amendment, even though I am not opposed to it.   The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for  5 minutes.   There was no objection.    Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment, the  Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, that is  designed to serve families with young children living in communities at  risk of a range of negative outcomes.   Today, HHS allocates money for MIECHV based on the share of children  under age 5 in families at or below 100 percent of the Federal poverty  line living in each State and territory.   It is imperative that the distribution of funds is done using the  most accurate and up-to-date information so we can use our limited  resources to target those most in need.   I thank the sponsors of this amendment, Representatives Murphy,  Gonzalez-Colon, and Velazquez, for bringing this issue to our attention  and for offering this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I urge support of this amendment  and the underlying bill so that we can help children.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Murphy).   The amendment was agreed to.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now  rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Rice of South Carolina) having assumed the chair, Mr. Simpson, Acting  Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union,  reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill  (H.R. 2824) to amend title V of the Social Security Act to extend the  Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, had come  to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to  the motion to recommit the pending bill.
