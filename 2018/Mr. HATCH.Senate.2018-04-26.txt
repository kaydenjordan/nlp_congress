 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted  to complete my remarks on the floor.    Mr. President, there is no excuse for the delays in the  confirmation process except sheer partisanship. It amounts to an  ongoing partial government shutdown, and it definitely hurts the  American people. Such obstruction is not worthy of the Senate, and the  resulting judicial vacancies do great harm to the judicial system.   These are not my words but the words of the Senator from Vermont, Mr.  Leahy, when he chaired the Judiciary Committee in 2014. Judicial  vacancies today are 60 percent higher than when he expressed those  concerns back then. Vacancies are 52 percent higher than what he said  was a ``disaster for our Nation's overburdened courts.''   The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts labels some judicial  vacancies as judicial emergencies because of their duration and impact  on caseloads. On March 12, 2012, the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin,  said that 35 judicial emergency vacancies would cause the  administration of justice to suffer at every level. Today, there are 72  judicial emergency vacancies, more than twice as many as Senator Durbin  warned about.   To be fair, I have to say that the leftwing groups that are such  faithful allies of Senate Democrats are no better. In July 2012, for  example, the Alliance for Justice proclaimed that 76 vacancies  demonstrated ``an overall and ongoing vacancy crisis in the federal  courts.'' Today, vacancies are 88 percent higher than the crisis level,  and all we hear from the Alliance for Justice are calls to oppose and  obstruct even more. Judicial vacancies today are 74 percent higher than  when the Brennan Center for Justice said the Senate was not meeting its  obligation to the American people.    If high judicial vacancies harm the judicial system and prevent  Americans from seeking justice, why aren't Democrats and their leftwing  allies leading the effort to confirm judicial nominees today? If  Democrats once said that 79 vacancies constitutes a crisis, why are  they silent about 143 vacancies today?   Today we face the highest judicial vacancy total since June of 1991,  after Congress had created dozens of new judgeships. It is crystal  clear why this dire situation confronts us today. The process for  appointing Federal judges, after all, has only three steps: nomination  by the President, consideration by the Senate Judiciary Committee, and  a decision by the full Senate.   The first step in the judicial appointment process is Presidential  nominations. President Trump has made more judicial nominations than  his predecessors of both parties at this point, so he is not the  problem--as you can see from that chart.   The second step is consideration by the Judiciary Committee. Chairman  Chuck Grassley has held a hearing on 75 of those nominations--more than  under previous Presidents, so the Judiciary Committee is not the  problem.   That leaves the third step right here on the Senate floor. Even  though President Trump is ahead of the nomination  [[Page S2449]]  pace, and the Judiciary Committee is ahead of the hearing pace, the  Senate's confirmation pace is half what it was at this point for the  past five Presidents.   March 20, I spoke here about some of the below-the-radar obstruction  tactics Democrats are using to make this part of the process as time- consuming and cumbersome as possible. Let me offer a brief review.  Democrats once complained about U.S. district court nominees being  reported from the Judiciary Committee on a party-line vote. That is  happening at a rate of more than four times as great today.   Democrats once criticized the failure to cooperate in scheduling  floor votes for judicial nominees. So far, Democrats have forced the  Senate to take separate votes to end debate, called a cloture vote, on  96 percent--96 percent--of President Trump's judicial nominees. The  Senate has been forced to take 16 times as many cloture votes on  President Trump's judicial nominees as under the last 12 Presidents  combined at this point. You heard me right. The Senate has been forced  to take 16 times as many cloture votes on judicial nominees as under  the last 12 Presidents combined at this point. That is every President  since the cloture rule was first applied to nominations in 1949.   In 2014, with a Democratic President, Democrats said that every time  the minority refuses to cooperate in scheduling confirmation votes,  every time the majority leader is forced to initiate the cloture  process, the Senate is forced to take up scarce floor time, when we  know these nominees will be confirmed. Today, Democrats are using that  and other tactics on a scale this body has never seen before.   Democrats once objected to voting against confirming U.S. district  court nominees who were supported by their own two Senators. At this  point, President Obama's confirmed district court nominees had received  a total of zero negative votes--zero. President Trump's district court  nominees have received 73 negative votes--73. Think about that. Think  about the unfairness of it.   Each of these, and more besides, is a tactic that Democrats once  condemned but are today pushing to record levels of obstruction. Even  more important than seeing where we are and how we got here is  understanding why the Democrats and their leftwing allies are working  so hard to prevent President Trump from appointing judges.   I have served in this body and on the Judiciary Committee for nearly  42 years. I have participated in the confirmation of half of all  article III judges who have ever served in this country, from the  beginning. In all that time, the conflict over judicial appointments  has never been over judicial nominees; it has always been over judicial  power. The vacancy crisis we face today is a consequence of the  broader, ongoing conflict over the kind of judge America needs on the  bench.   America's Founders gave us a system of government that includes a  judiciary with a role defined by three important principles. First, as  Founder James Wilson put it, the people are masters of the government.  Second, the Constitution is the primary way that the people set rules  for government. Third, among those rules is the separation of powers  into three coequal but different branches.   Judges acting consistent with these principles, what I have called  impartial judges, fit the design of our system of government and the  liberty it makes possible. Judges who depart from those principles,  what I have called political judges, are at odds with that design and  undermine our liberty. President Trump is committed to appointing  impartial judges, while those working so hard to obstruct his his  nominees favor political judges.   President Obama led the way in the quest for a political judiciary.  First, as a Senator evaluating judicial nominees and then as a  President choosing them, he said judges decide cases based on their  empathy, their vision of how the world works, their core concerns, and  their deeply held beliefs. If judges make decisions on their personal  views, then it is no wonder the Democrats want so badly to know a  judicial nominee's personal views.   I will never forget the confirmation hearing for Chief Justice John  Roberts in 2005. Democrats pressed him to commit, in advance and under  oath, to particular results in different categories of cases. They  asked repeatedly: Whose side will you be on? Political judges take  sides, even before cases come before them, because their main objective  is to ensure that the favored side wins and that the preferred  political interest is served.   We see this in plain view today. Democrats observe a judicial  nominee's personal views, or his legal views on behalf of a client, and  insist that those views will dictate his judicial views. This is why  many Democrats will oppose any nominee who has conservative personal  beliefs or who has advocated for conservative clients. To them, there  is no difference between politics and law.   Democrats oppose judicial nominees because of their personal views,  even when the American Bar Association--which has never been accused of  being conservative--gives those nominees its highest rating. The  appeals court nominee confirmed this week, for example, received that  rating only after the ABA considered, in its words, his ``compassion,  decisiveness, open-mindedness, courtesy, patience, freedom from bias,  and commitment to equal justice under the law.''   In their heart of hearts, those who favor political judges have no  problem with judicial minds being closed or biased so long as that  leads to results they like. They seek politically correct results by  any judicial means.   That judiciary is very different from the one contemplated by the  Founders of this great country. That judiciary is very different from  the one described by the oath of judicial office, by which a judge  commits to do justice without respect to identities or interests. That  judiciary is very different from the one that makes our liberty  possible.   The liberty we enjoy is by design, not by accident. That design  requires judges with a limited and defined role. Impartial judges  support the liberty our system of government was designed to provide  while political judges undermine it. Impartial judges take the law as  it is and apply it fairly to decide cases, leaving decisions about what  the law should be to the American people and their elected  representatives. Political judges take decisions about what the law  should be away from the American people, manipulating the meaning of  statutes and the Constitution to follow their own views and their own  agenda.   The conflict over judicial appointments is, and will remain, a  conflict over judicial power and, therefore, a conflict over the system  of government crafted by America's Founders. Remember the three  principles I mentioned earlier. Impartial judges allow the American  people to remain the masters of government; political judges become the  masters of the people. Impartial judges follow the rules the American  people put in the Constitution; political judges change the meaning of  those rules to suit their own ends. Impartial judges respect the  separation of powers while political judges breach it.   The unprecedented obstruction of judicial nominees today is a tool in  the campaign for an increasingly politicized judiciary. The rhetoric of  that campaign is all about desirable objectives, all about good  intentions. I close with the words of Daniel Webster, who represented  two different States in the House and represented Massachusetts in the  Senate before serving as Secretary of State under three different  precedents. He said:         Good intentions will always be pleaded for every assumption       of authority. It is hardly too strong to say that the       Constitution was made to guard the people against the dangers       of good intentions. There are men in all ages who mean to       govern well, but they mean to govern. They promise to be good       masters, but they mean to be masters.    That is Daniel Webster. Let me repeat that again because Webster is  one of the greatest people who ever served in this government.         Good intentions will always be pleaded for every assumption       of authority. It is hardly too strong to say that the       Constitution was made to guard the people against the dangers       of good intentions. There are men in all ages who mean to       govern well, but they mean to govern. They promise to be good       masters, but they mean to be masters.    America needs impartial judges so that the American people can be the  masters of government and so that liberty can thrive.   Let me go over that quote again from Daniel Webster. I will end with  this.  [[Page S2450]]    Daniel Webster said:         Good intentions will always be pleaded for every assumption       of authority. It is hardly too strong to say that the       Constitution was made to guard the people against the dangers       of good intentions. There are men in all ages who mean to       govern well, but they mean to govern. They promise to be good       masters, but they mean to be masters.    Some of those Founding Fathers really knew what they were talking  about, and Webster was certainly one of them in many respects.   All I can say is that we have a chance to work together to do what is  right and in the best interest of the American people. I intend to see  that we do that, and I hope we can because this country is worth it.  Our system of government is the best this world has ever seen, and I  want to see it continue to be.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, the  legislation in question makes a significant change to the pension  funding rule, but it is narrowly written to only address issues  concerning a single retirement plan. There are a number of companies  that have similar funding issues which are not addressed by my  colleague's proposal.   I appreciate the work that my colleague Senator Murray has done on  this issue, and I appreciate that there is ongoing bipartisan work on  issues that her legislation addresses as well as on other issues  surrounding retirement plans.   The committees with jurisdiction over these issues, including the  Finance Committee, continue to work on bipartisan solutions that have  not fully vetted the matter that my friend Senator Murray is putting  forth today. Until they do so, it is not appropriate to move this  measure forward. Therefore, I respectfully object to this unanimous  consent request.    Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
