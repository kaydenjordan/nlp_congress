 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Boy Scout Troop 221  of Apopka, Florida. They truly exemplify of the Scout values of duty,  service, character, leadership, and self-reliance.   Last year, they led the Central Florida Council in community service.  Together, they volunteered over 4,000 hours of their time. One project  was a memorial to the victims of the September 11th attacks created by  Eagle Scout Christian Lamphere in honor of the first responders who  died in the attacks.   Christian wanted his community to know the risks that our first  responders take every day. For that project, Christian won the Central  Florida Eagle Scout Project of the Year.   This week, I had the honor to meet with Troop 221 here in Washington.  I am proud of all of our Scouts, thankful for all they do for the  community, and I can't wait to see what they do next.                            ____________________
