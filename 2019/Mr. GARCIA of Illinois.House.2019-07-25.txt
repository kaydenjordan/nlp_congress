 Madam Speaker, to begin Special Orders, I ask  for unanimous consent that Members may have 5 legislative days to  revise and extend their remarks.    Madam Speaker, I would like to thank  Representatives Pocan, Porter, Tlaib, and Jayapal. We are here today to  call for justice for immigrants. We are here to put a spotlight on  President Trump's harmful attacks on immigrants and asylum seekers.   Since President Trump took office, he has implemented some of the  harshest and most racist immigration policies in our country's history.  Trump is also repeating one of the worst themes in our history, that of  relentless attacks designed to divide our country. Trump wants people  to think that brown and black immigrants are not worthy of compassion,  legal due process, or human rights.   Despite organizing in our communities, the Trump White House has  continued to push forward its anti-immigrant agenda. As an immigrant  myself, the stories break my heart and make me really angry.   A year ago, the separation of families and the caging of children  shocked the conscience of Americans. A year later, we all mourned the  deaths of Oscar Martinez Ramirez and his daughter Angie Valeria, who  were found on the edge of a river embankment, both drowned in an effort  to reach the promise of America.   We used to think that sharing vulnerable images of the deceased  children would elicit our deepest emotions and that would be enough for  change, but even after the deaths of Oscar and his daughter, children  continued dying at the hands of this administration, and nothing has  changed.   It is tempting to become desensitized. It is easy to believe that  this is the new normal. This is anything but  [[Page H7447]]  normal. This is unprecedented. Whenever a scandal comes out or the  President feels threatened, he comes after immigrants and those who do  not look like him.   It is unconscionable that the President has put lives, families,  children, and communities in danger in a blatant effort to distract the  media and our country.   Today is an opportunity for my colleagues and me to, one, put a face  on the people being impacted by these policies--people are real lives-- frame this as the agenda of a President and a party who seek to hold  power by dividing Americans, and to remind our country that every  attack is connected. This is all part of a broader agenda of hate.   I now yield to the gentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky).    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from  Vermont (Mr. Welch).    Madam Speaker, I thank Congressman Welch,  Congresswoman Schakowsky of Illinois, and the Congressional Progressive  Caucus for allowing me to lead this conversation.   The remarks of the previous speaker are a good segue to some  background information from a historical context that I will share in  the rest of the proceeding.   Migrants are escaping some of the harshest regimes in Central  America, where political and economic turmoil have generated abject  poverty, abuse, and violent crime.   Unlike many previous waves of immigrants, Central Americans are not  arriving for purely economic reasons or to pursue the American Dream.  Instead, they are coming to seek safety and the chance to live without  fear of death, rape, or abuse.   Those coming to our border now are families, newborns, children, and  pregnant women escaping life-or-death situations as well as poverty.  These deeply rooted causes and push factors help explain why so many  Salvadorans, Guatemalans, and Hondurans are fleeing their countries and  heading toward the U.S.   El Salvador. El Salvador has been trapped in a cycle of violence that  can be traced back to its civil war, in which the U.S. was complicit.   The MS-13 gang, which many politicians like to talk about, and  frequently referred to by the President in justification of his  hardline immigration policies, was actually formed in L.A., in Los  Angeles, California, and introduced into El Salvador when its members  were deported, often to a country they barely knew.   Guatemala also comes out of a great conflict in that country. Jakelin  Caal Maquin, the 7-year-old Guatemalan girl who died in El Paso in  December from cardiac arrest caused by severe dehydration and shock,  was forced to leave her home due to severe poverty. Her relatives  explained that her father did all he could to stay in the land, but  necessity made him try to get to the U.S.   Honduras. Gender-based violence is the second leading cause of death  for women in Honduras. In a country where emergency contraception and  abortion are banned even for rape victims, survivors of sexual violence  have few options if they become pregnant. They can seek to terminate  the pregnancy and risk prison time, or they can go through with it and  face one of the highest maternal mortality rates in all of Latin  America.   As a parent, I understand and empathize with parents who will do  whatever it takes to give their children a better life. When you have a  gun to your head, people threatening to rape your child, extort your  business, or force your son to work for the cartels, what would you do?   Aid to the Northern Triangle region of Central America is a long- standing pillar of American foreign policy supported by most Democrats  and Republicans in Congress. Providing humanitarian aid to countries in  the Northern Triangle will help stabilize those economies and lift  millions out of poverty in the process.   Establishing economic stability in those nations is at the root of an  effective strategy to reduce the current surge in migrants seeking  asylum and, ultimately, an effort to solve the root causes of the  humanitarian crisis at the border.   Despite this understanding from the State Department, the Trump  administration is reducing aid. Annual assistance to Central America  has declined by nearly 30 percent since fiscal year 2016. Funding is  crucial to programs that focus on good governance, economic growth, and  social welfare in the Northern Triangle.   This is an issue of national security in our country and basic human  needs and dignity abroad.   Instead of receiving children and families with open arms, President  Trump is cutting foreign aid for countries in the Northern Triangle,  further exacerbating conditions there and ultimately feeding into his  manufactured crisis at the border. Potentially hundreds of thousands  more will be forced to make the difficult decision and head toward the  U.S., and the administration knows this.   Aid is not an immediate fix or the ultimate solution. An investment  in the region can, however, help mitigate violence, corruption, and  poverty, which can help over the long term.   The State Department's recent announcement to put $180 million on  hold, to divert further funds, will impact political stability and  economic opportunities in those countries and, therefore, the push  factors affecting migration.   President Trump was right when he declared a crisis at the border.  What he failed to explain is the role this administration has played in  aggravating the situation.   There is real suffering. Every day, refugees arriving at the southern  border are being detained and held in inhumane conditions, children  locked in cages and infants dying in our care.   The bottom line is very simple. The President has made the crisis at  the border significantly worse, and it will only intensify with cuts in  foreign assistance to the Northern Triangle.   President Trump is waging an assault on all fronts against immigrants  and asylum seekers and a full assault against the very morals and  founding principles of our country, principles of acceptance,  inclusiveness, and refuge for those who seek its shelter.   In the interior, for Americans living away from the border, it can  often seem like the President's assault on immigrants and asylum  seekers is a distant issue we see on the news, but the truth is that  the President's terrorizing of communities extends to our backyards,  our schools, our neighborhoods, and our church congregations throughout  the country.   I want to take a moment to share a story and give a face to the  problem. Without understanding our own personal stake in the well-being  of our friends, coworkers, and neighbors, we cannot fully grasp the  extent of the President's assault. Nothing we do in these Halls is  worth debating if we are not willing to understand how our decisions  ultimately affect people's lives.    ICE raids are happening not only at the border. These government  actions that separate families and tear children from their mothers are  happening in well-established immigrant communities around the country,  including many in my district in Chicago.   Francisca Lino, a mother and grandmother from Chicago, is living this  reality as we speak. She is married to a U.S. citizen. She has three  U.S.-citizen children and other grandchildren.   A law-abiding, hardworking woman who had never received even a  parking ticket in her life received an order of deportation under the  Trump administration. As a result, she was forced to seek sanctuary in  a church, where she has been living for the past 2 years. During this  time, besides being away from her children and husband, she also missed  the birth of her grandson Diego.   Confined to a space that welcomed her but is not by any means  suitable for someone to live without the possibility of ever going out,  Francisca and her family are asking for our help.   If she ever tried to step out for a moment, she can be sure that she  would be caught by ICE officials, who are constantly surveilling the  church.   Her decision to fight back against Trump's cruel immigration policies  have taken a toll on her family. Her daughters have suffered emotional  trauma, but that is not all. As a provider for her family, the void she  left when she took sanctuary has been felt economically as well.   In my district and around the country, there are many people like  Francisca who have been nothing but law-abiding, hardworking neighbors,  contributing to our economy by paying taxes and supporting the  community they live in.  [[Page H7449]]    In return, however, many of our neighbors, who are no different than  ourselves, save for the lack of certain papers, have been met with  oppression from an administration that is hellbent on using immigrants  as scapegoats to explain the deep-rooted problems in our country.   It is up to Congress to point out the real problems and stop Trump's  xenophobic and irrational policies.   ICE raids throughout the country continue to terrorize families and  communities, hurt our local economies and small businesses, and rip  U.S.-citizen children from their parents.   The President's assault on immigrants goes well beyond the border. It  is terrorizing those all around us for nothing other than political  gain.   Blatant suppression of votes and intimidation of communities across  the land: Recent news that the Census will be printed without the  citizenship question is a victory for everyone in this country. This is  especially important for historically undercounted groups, including  communities of color, people living in large housing units, and  immigrants.   Every single person in our democracy counts and must be counted in  the Census to distribute Federal funding and resources accurately. The  Constitution is clear on this topic. The final Census count determines  so much of our daily lives: new hospitals and schools, representation  in government, funding programs like Medicaid. Ensuring everyone counts  ensures funding for the programs our constituents need and for healthy  neighborhoods.   Recently released documents have proven what we already suspected,  that the Trump administration announced the addition of a citizenship  question in yet another attempt to disenfranchise and intimidate the  immigrant community. It was a cheap political move to undermine the  integrity of the Census.   Is this person a citizen of the United States? A seemingly small  question, but one with so many implications. This is especially true  for children, including U.S.-citizen children living in mixed-status  families, families that might avoid the Census for fear of their  information being shared.   Our fight to count every single person is not over. We still have a  lot of work ahead of us.   The back-and-forth of the citizenship question left many of my  constituents scared and confused. This remains the administration's  goal.   While President Trump has backed down from his attempt to add a  citizenship question to the Census, he is directing U.S. agencies to  provide all information they have on U.S. citizenship. In other words,  he continues to use any means of intimidation to threaten immigrants.  When one method is blocked, he tries another.   Ensuring a complete count on the 2020 Census is a fight we can win. I  started working on it as a Cook County commissioner and will continue  working to ensure that every single person is counted. Our  representation, schools, hospitals, and healthcare depend on it.   The President continues to weaponize his office in every possible  way. We must fight back until we have justice for all and justice for  immigrants.   Madam Speaker, today, we have heard powerful stories and comments  from my colleagues from all around the country about the countless ways  that President Trump is driving an anti-immigrant agenda and  terrorizing communities all around the country, whether it is the  detention of American citizens, Trump ending asylum protections and  eligibility, changes to the citizenship test, placing children in cages  to send a message, or leaving women and children in inhumane conditions  at detention camps.   We must remember that this administration is not only hurting  immigrants, but it is hurting citizens, mixed-status families, and  entire communities, Black, White, Asian, and Latino.   These harmful tactics may be aimed at a few, but they are harming us  all.                                time  1900    Trump's assault on immigrants and asylum seekers is an assault on all  Americans, an assault on our values of inclusivity, an assault on our  history of welcoming the world's tired and weary. He is leading a full- court press on the very soul of who we are as Americans.   Deeply disturbing is the fact that we know that Trump's ongoing  attacks on immigrants are deeply rooted in racism. We see it in the  Muslim ban, we see it in the 2020 census citizenship question, and the  public charge rule. Trump says that criminals, drug dealers, and  rapists are invading our country casting a generalization over  communities all over the land. That is false. It is the reason he wants  fewer immigrants from s-hole countries and more from northern European  countries like Norway, or so he has said.   When a crowd chanted recently ``Send her back'' in response to  Trump's attacks against my colleagues, we knew it was never about legal  immigration. As an immigrant, I take this personally.   When the President announced ICE raids, we know his intent was to  deliberately terrorize Black, Brown, and immigrant communities.   Livelihoods and families are at stake and many in the communities,  like the ones I represent, were thrown into fear and trauma when the  President threatened raids over Twitter.   Parents today are forced to have tough conversations with their  children to set up emergency plans in the event they would not return  home from work. This is sad and tragic.   While the President continues to attack immigrants and asylum  seekers, I remind my constituents that this is not the time to be  fearful or timid, this is the time to keep fighting, to act like  courageous Americans, and those who aspire to be Americans, as well.   We are a nation of many peoples and certainly of immigrants. America  is and has been great, precisely because we have long welcomed  immigrants with open arms and will continue doing so. To be American is  to be of immigrant heritage, with the exception of our Native American  sisters and brothers, all of whom have also suffered because of tactics  to divide us by race, by creed, or by country of origin.   Together, we are stronger than this President. And no matter how long  this assault on immigrants and asylum seekers goes on, it is in our  blood, as Americans, to never lose faith in the fight for equal human  dignity and opportunity for all. We must fight until there is justice  for all and justice for immigrants in America.   If we are talking about Trump's assault on immigrants, we cannot  leave out what the President has done to Dreamers. At the beginning of  his administration, the President rescinded DACA under the authority of  then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. That action was the opening salvo  in President Trump's assault on immigrants using the power of the Oval  Office.   The decision to end DACA and the DACA program was a direct attack on  young men and women, all of whom were brought into this country through  no decision of their own. Many came as babies.   Many DACA recipients or Dreamers call no other country but America  their home. Unfortunately, they have to work harder than anyone else to  have access to the same opportunities afforded to their friends and  classmates in the same country that we all love.   That is the case of Elizeth Arguelles, a 23-year-old Dreamer from my  district. She is also from my neighborhood of Little Village in  Chicago. Elizeth is paying her way through college by making and  selling tamales.   At age 9, she learned to make tamales and started helping her mother  sell them in the streets of Chicago. Since elementary school, she has  been waking up at 3:30 in the morning to make the tamales before going  out to sell them at 7:30.   Elizeth will graduate from college next year, and we could say her  story is a hallmark of success and American perseverance. Saying so,  however, ignores the dark reality of her situation. Her story is, by  all means, a picture-perfect example of America's spirit and hard work  and perseverance. She deserves that credit.   Her story, however, is far from a feel-good story. Rather, it is yet  another example of how our political system has failed hardworking  people in our country.   Elizeth's success is hers alone. Our government has and continues to  fail her by maintaining an anti-immigrant policy that fails to account  for children  [[Page H7450]]  brought here against their own conscious will.   It is a reminder that the Dream and Promise Act passed in the House  of Representatives must be passed in the Senate immediately. Up to 2.5  million immigrants across the country, people like Elizeth, would be  eligible for protection under H. Res. 6, including 37,000 immigrants in  Chicago alone.   Through the Dream and Promise Act, Elizeth and her family and over  85,000 people in my city who live in mixed-status families would have  legal certainty.   I applaud Elizeth's perseverance and determination to fulfill her  dream of graduating from a 4-year university. But I also hope that the  Members of the Senate are hearing the cries of aspiring young Americans  who want to continue to contribute to our country, to lead our country,  and to be exemplary citizens by giving them a path to legalization and  citizenship.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson  Lee).    Madam Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Jackson  Lee for her words.   To close this evening, I want to call our attention again to what we  are seeking to do in this Special Order hour, which is to again  highlight and shed a spotlight on the administration's assault on  immigration and asylum seekers that is taking place.   I do it seeking to express the sentiment, the concerns, and the  aspirations of, especially, immigrant groups in my district whom I  represent.   And who are they? They are people who have come from Asia, who have  come from Germany, who have come from Ireland, who have come from  Eastern Europe, who have come from Africa and the Caribbean, as well as  Latin America, and even other countries.   It is my hope that, as the House of Representatives begins its summer  recess, this Congress and the White House will reflect on the Nation's  great history of welcoming people who are fleeing oppression and, as  Congresswoman Jackson Lee noted, that we allow our better angels to  impact, to inspire, and to move us.   As we continue our path, striving to become a more perfect Union,  there isn't a better way forward than by embracing those who are  fleeing persecution, those who are fleeing violence, and those who are  fleeing terrible conditions in the countries that they were born in.   I want to thank the Congressional Progressive Caucus for its  assistance in arranging for this Special Order hour. I want to thank  those who have joined me tonight to share their stories.   Madam Speaker, we can and we must do better.    Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.                            ____________________
