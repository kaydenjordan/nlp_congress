 Mr. Speaker, I rise as the co-chair of the Law  Enforcement Caucus in the Congress of the United States. This bill is  terrible. The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act should not be voted on.   As a may-issue State, New Jersey allows local law enforcement the  discretion on issuing concealed carry permits. In order to receive a  permit, applicants must demonstrate an urgent need to carry a concealed  weapon and pass a safety course on par with firearms training required  of police officers.   H.R. 38 would undermine the good regulations New Jersey has in place  by forcing New Jersey and other States to recognize the concealed carry  standards from every other State, even if their regulations are weak or  nonexistent.   Allowing States with the weakest concealed carry requirements to set  the national standard creates a race to the bottom. Aside from the  outrageous fact that House Republicans are pushing a bill to weaken  States' rights, this bill makes it harder for local law enforcement to  do their jobs.   This bill does not establish a process for officers to easily verify  that someone is carrying lawfully, because officers would be  essentially required to know the permitting standards of every State, a  heavy and unnecessary burden, Mr. Speaker.
