 With your permission, through the Chair, far be it from  me to delay the passage of this law, which I know has been worked on by  Native people and staffers for many, many years, but I just wanted to  make my private commitment to the Senator from Alaska, the vice chair  of the Indian Affairs Committee, public.   We are absolutely committed, one way or another, to passing the Don  Young lands act, and I just wanted to make that clear on the Senate  floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I have five requests for committees to  meet during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of  the Majority and Minority Leaders.
