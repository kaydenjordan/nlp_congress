 MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support  of the CHIPS and Science Act, a historic bill that should have strong  bipartisan support because it will lower costs for American families  and restore American leadership in industries that are critical to our  economic and national security.   This bill is a strong response to countries like China that aim to  threaten our industrial base, supply chains, intellectual property, and  technology security.   This bill will help ensure that America cannot be threatened and will  no longer accept the outsourcing of critical industries.   We took an important step to address this in the President's  infrastructure act, which included an important measure I championed to  ensure personal protective equipment is made in America. Never again  will New York health workers be forced to wear trash bags to protect  themselves from a deadly pandemic because China was blocking shipments  of personal protective equipment.   The CHIPS and Science Act ensures we are making it in America,  creating 100,000 good-paying jobs to manufacture critical semiconductor  components right here in the U.S. employing Americans.   It also turbocharges our research and development investment and  workforce to ensure America is leading in next-generation innovations.   I am so proud of the work of the Oversight and Reform Committee to  support this legislation and proud to cast my vote for it today.
