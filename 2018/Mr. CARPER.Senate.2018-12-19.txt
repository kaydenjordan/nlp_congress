 Mr. President, I rise today with two of our colleagues,  Senator Ed Markey and Senator Jeff Merkley, to reflect on the 24th  session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change  that concluded just this last weekend in the country of Poland.   This important conference, which is better known as COP24, refers to  Conference of Parties 24. I think they have been meeting for 24 years.  They met there for 2 weeks as leaders from nearly 200 nations, working  to reach an agreement on how our world will actually implement the  Paris climate agreement.   The stakes could not be higher. I am not one, as my colleagues know,  given to hyperbole, but the future of our planet and the future of our  children and grandchildren may well hang in the balance.   Was it a positive step forward that the international community could  come together and agree to meaningful action to combat climate change  on a global scale by finally getting to implement the Paris Agreement?  Yes, it was.   Having said that, this agreement is not perfect, they know it, and we  know it. No one is pretending that it is. It falls well short of the  steps that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC,  determined just 1 month ago are needed to avoid the most catastrophic  effects of climate change over the next decade.   The entire world needs to do even more to address this problem. That  includes setting much more aggressive emissions reduction targets going  forward to address the challenges of climate change in the years ahead.  While we certainly can and should be doing more, though, this agreement  is cause for hope that bolder future agreements are achievable, but  reaching bolder future agreements is going to require real leadership  from leaders and from nations across the world. After all, leadership  is the biggest key to success for almost any organization or endeavor,  and that includes saving this planet.   Unfortunately, our President, along with many in his administration,  continue to reject climate science and deny the reality and the  magnitude of the challenges we are facing. Well, here is the reality.   According to NOAA, the United States experienced 16 extreme weather- related disasters in 2017 that exceeded $1 billion apiece. In the past  year alone, Americans paid $306 billion in damages due to storm surges,  flooding, wildfires, crop freezes, and droughts--a new record.   Thirteen of our Nation's leading scientific Federal agencies recently  reported to us in a National Climate Assessment that if we do nothing  to address our climate emissions, today's extreme weather-related  events will pale in comparison to what lies ahead.   Here is a sampling of what we can look forward to if we do nothing-- if we don't do enough. In the future, we can continue to expect  rainfall or precipitation as measured by the foot, not by  [[Page S7868]]  the inch. We can continue to expect more wildfires in places out West,  burning areas larger than my home State of Delaware. We can continue to  expect extreme flooding to devastate communities like Ellicott City,  MD, not too far from here, which has been hit by not one but two 1,000- year floods in the past 2 years alone. Think about that.   Somebody asked me the other day: What is a 1,000-year flood? It is  something that is supposed to happen only once in 1,000 years. They  have seen two of them in Ellicott City in the past 2 years.   One of the most memorable lyrics from my youth and maybe for some of  the others in this Chamber comes from a guy named Stephen Stills. I  would describe him as a California-based climatologist. He is not. He  is a singer-songwriter from Buffalo Springfield fame and Crosby,  Stills, Nash, and Young. He once wrote a lyric that goes like this:         Something's happening here. Just what it is ain't exactly       clear.    Think about that.         Something's happening here. Just what it is ain't exactly       clear.    Well, make no mistake, something is happening here, and what is  happening here is exactly clear. What is also clear is, there is still  time to do something about it while actually fostering economic growth  in the United States and beyond our borders. Let me say that again.  Here is the good news: What is also clear is that there is still time  to do something about it while actually fostering economic growth in  the United States and beyond our borders. Climate scientists aren't  part of some grand hoax. It isn't some alarmist prediction. It doesn't  come from some left-leaning organization. It doesn't come from talk  radio. The truth is that it comes directly from our Nation's leading  scientists and leading scientists around the world.    We also remind our colleagues that the National Climate Assessment is  not developed at the direction or whim of any one person or any one  administration; it was Congress that passed a law mandating that the  National Climate Assessment be presented every 4 years. We did it.  Congress did it. That law was called the Global Change Research Act of  1990. It passed this Senate in 1990 unanimously, and it was signed into  law by the late President George Herbert Walker Bush, a Republican.   Our Nation's leading scientists warned us yet again less than a month  ago that if we failed to start seriously reducing carbon emissions now,  by the end of this century, we may well be witnessing the following  tale of horribles.   Here is a chart. First, it deals with sea levels rising 6 feet. That  is a lot. Since 1993, it has risen 3 inches. Compared to what we have  experienced in the last 25 years, that is a heck of a lot. We would  expect that if sea level rise does go to 6 feet, it would result in  some $3.6 trillion in cumulative damages to the U.S. coastal properties  and infrastructure. Most of our east coast would be underwater,  including maybe parts of the lowest lying State in America, which is  Delaware.   Our next chart talks about annual economic losses of up to $500  billion by 2090--not cumulative but every year.   We have another chart here that speaks to gross domestic product. You  may recall that when we fell into the great recession around 10 years  ago--the worst recession since the Great Depression--we saw GDP losses  of just over 4 percent. It was horrible. Banks stopped lending money.  The unemployment rate was 10 percent or more. People couldn't get loans  for anything. That is where we were.   If these estimates from some of the best, smartest scientists in the  world are correct, it is not going to be losses at 4 percent; we will  be looking at 10 percent by 2100. No Member of this Senate is going to  be around then, but these pages sitting down here will be. Our  grandsons and granddaughters may well be around too.   As the world works to develop meaningful solutions to mitigate these  effects of climate change, the Trump administration chooses to  exacerbate the problem by doubling down on dirty and outdated energy  policies. This administration is also attempting to discredit the  recent science reports by pushing talking points from well-known  climate deniers.   Americans are not falling for these tricks anymore. Americans are  witnessing firsthand the effects of climate change in their communities  every day. They want action, and they want us to be part of that  action. So does the business community. While this administration sits  on its hands, American businesses are actually stepping up in a big way  to combat the effects of climate change. Many businesses stand ready to  do even more. They are looking to us here in our Nation's Capital to  provide some leadership.   To our international friends around the world who are wondering where  our Nation is on climate change, I want to say to those folks that,  speaking on behalf of the majority of not just Delawareans but  Americans, we are with you. We support the Paris climate agreement. We  want to reduce carbon emissions because we are convinced that doing so  will enable us to save our planet and create jobs.   This is not a Democratic or Republican issue. This is not a blue  State or red State issue. It affects us all. If you think climate  change hasn't reached your State yet, the science is clear that  eventually it will.   Luckily for us, young people are leading the call for action. Climate  change and environmental issues are often mistakenly forgotten when we  discuss domestic issues. In today's news cycle, especially under this  administration, they doesn't always make headlines. It has oftentimes  been said that climate change is not an issue that drives Americans to  the polls. I think that is changing.   Young people led the way to changing our country before. I remember  when I was your age, I say to our pages. In the 1950s, we led the  decades-long civil rights movement for equal rights for every American  under the law. Young activists made clear their opposition to the  Vietnam war. Back in the 1970s, when I was actually serving during the  Vietnam war as a naval flight officer, young people pushed hard for  strong environmental standards. The Cuyahoga River in Cleveland, OH-- north of Ohio State where I went to school--was on fire. At the  same time, we had shores of our country littered with garbage.    Our country is back at another one of those make-or-break moments in  our history. We need the energy of Americans of all ages, young and  old, to make sure we don't blow it. We need to listen to them all,  especially to our younger Americans. After all, when you think about  it, they should be energized by this. It is their planet, and it is  their future.   When it comes to global challenges, such as terrorism and cyber  attacks, the United States doesn't sit back and wait for someone else  to lead the way; we step up and we lead. We have many dogs in this  fight--some big ones and some not-so-big ones. We have a lot at stake.   Fortunately, acting sooner rather than later on climate change brings  with it a number of positives. We can put our country on course to  reduce emissions while growing our economy. I keep coming back to this  theme, and it is an important theme. We can put our country on a course  to reduce emissions and grow our economy. The two are not mutually  exclusive--I don't care what some people say and would have us believe.  In fact, it is quite the opposite. They are not mutually exclusive.   What we can and should be doing is using our energy and resources to  foster new economic opportunities for communities that may be dependent  today on the old world order.   In 2017, nearly 3.2 million Americans were working in wind, solar,  energy efficiency, and other clean energy jobs. A year or two ago, one  of them was one of our sons. Our oldest son worked for 6 years or so  helping develop ways for large buildings all over the Northeast to  conserve energy. That was one of the jobs.   There are 3.2 million jobs. More jobs will follow, and it is  incumbent on us to ensure that some of those new jobs go to people  whose jobs are going away as we seek to reduce carbon emissions in this  country and on our planet. How would we feel if we lost our jobs and at  the same time, 3 million people gained jobs? How about me? I was born  in West Virginia. Dad was a coal miner for a while earlier in his life.  How  [[Page S7869]]  about those people? We need to make sure that when we make progress  reducing carbon emissions, we don't forget folks who lose their jobs  because of the reduction of those carbon emissions. We have to reach  back and help them too.   We don't have the luxury of waiting around. We need to crank it up,  and we need to get going. That is why, as the senior Democrat and  ranking member of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, which  I serve on with Senators Markey, Merkley, and others, I am anxious to  join them to help lead the fight for policies that take this country  into a brighter climate future. If we are honest with our children and  grandchildren, we don't have any other choice.   It was my hope that on the world stage this week, America's  representative at COP24 would make clear that our country is ready to  lead by example. Unfortunately, they apparently did not. That is no  reason to despair. We have the facts, and I think we have the energy  and the commitment on our side.   Today, I want to leave our colleagues with this message: Climate  action should not be an issue that divides us; it should be an issue  that unites us. It should unite not just this country but the entire  global community. Our world could definitely use more unification these  days, and so could our country.   Years from now, when our sons' children are dealing with the  inevitable consequences of our failure to address climate change--if we  do fail--there will be a day when they might come to me or, frankly,  any of us and say: Well, you were a Senator, weren't you, Grandpa? What  did you do when you had the chance to do something about this impending  disaster when there was still time? What did you do about it?   We should all want to be able to say the same thing: I worked  tirelessly reminding, warning my colleagues, pushing my colleagues. We  moved Heaven and Earth to make sure that future generations could  inherit a safe, healthy planet, one where their dreams and aspirations  could be realized and not destroyed.   My colleagues and I--especially Senator Markey and Senator Merkley-- are on the floor to make it clear that the overwhelming majority of  Americans stand with every other nation in the world on this issue. We  need to act. We need to act now. Time is not on our side. Let's seize  the day. Carpe diem.   I am happy to yield the floor.   It is like preaching to the choir. Nobody has done more in this body  and the Congress in the last 15 years than this man here--Senator Ed  Markey from Massachusetts--to try to make sure that we realize this is  a problem, that we do something about it, and that we do something  about it soon and in a way that creates economic opportunity.   I thank you. It is a pleasure to stand in front of you and serve  beside you.    Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague, the  Senator from Wyoming, chairman of the Environment and Public Works  Committee. The Coastal Barrier Resources  [[Page S7914]]  Act is an important, free-market conservation tool that does not  regulate how people develop their land, but transfers the full cost of  developing in risky, environmentally sensitive areas from taxpayers to  the individual choosing to develop. The Coastal Barrier Resources  System also provides much-needed habitat for our Nation's treasured  wildlife, including federally threatened Red Knot birds in Delaware.   H.R. 5787 adds approximately 18,000 acres along the Delaware, North  Carolina, South Carolina, and Florida coasts to the Coastal Barrier  Resources System, protecting these barrier islands, beaches, wetlands,  and aquatic habitat from federally funded development.   H.R. 5787 also corrects an error that placed part of Bethany Beach,  in my great State of Delaware, within the Coastal Barrier Resources  System. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service discovered this error during  a Coastal Barrier Resources System digital mapping pilot project, which  Congress directed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to undertake in  2000.   Digital mapping has enabled the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to  greatly improve mapping accuracy as the Service updates outdated maps  and makes determinations about whether properties fall inside or  outside the Coastal Barrier Resources System. However, as our  colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives drafted H.R. 5787,  concerns arose regarding the security and permanency of digital maps.   To address these concerns, the U.S. House of Representatives included  section 3 in H.R. 5787. However, this legislation is not intended to  prevent the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from using various digital  tools, digital data, and digital maps to help implement the Coastal  Barrier Resources Act.   I would ask if my distinguished colleague, the Senator from Wyoming,  chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, could confirm  my understanding about the use of digital maps under H.R. 5787?    Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his confirmation  of my understanding. In conclusion, I also want to thank my colleague  for working with me and all of our colleagues to enact this bipartisan  legislation into law. During a time of frequent partisan gridlock, I am  proud of the work of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and  Public Works for shepherding agreement on many important issues,  including this one.   Thank you.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to talk about the Wood Heater  Emissions Reduction Act, or WHERA, which I am introducing today with my  good friend (Ms. Murkowski), the senior Senator from Alaska.   In 2005, my dear friend, former Senator Voinovich, came to me with a  great idea--the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act, or DERA. DERA didn't  roll back emissions standards for diesel engines, but instead created  an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) grant program to incentivize  the use of newer diesel technology. Together, and joined by many of my  colleagues that are still serving in the Senate today, we established  one of the most successful clean air programs on the books. This  program is one that is loved by retailers, manufactures, States and  health groups alike.   As many of my colleagues know, I'm someone that is always trying to  find out what works and do more of it. When my staff explained to me  the public health challenges that residential wood heaters present to  communities, especially rural communities across this country; I knew  the challenges were very similar to the ones we faced with diesel  engines in 2005. I knew if DERA could be a successful program to  retrofit or replace old diesel engines, we could use the program as a  framework to replace residential wood heaters.   Like the eleven million old diesel engines that were on the road a  decade ago, there are over eleven million homes that use wood as a  primary or secondary heat source, and a majority of those homes are  located in rural  [[Page S7928]]  areas. These residential wood heaters, such as woodstoves, pellet  stoves and wood furnaces, often have a long life-span, some lasting  more than fifty years. Due to this long lifespan, industry estimates  that six million residential wood heaters in operation today do not  meet 1988 EPA Clean Air Act emission standards, much less the current  emissions standards implemented in 2015.   Collectively, older residential wood heaters are a major source of  air pollution in the United States, especially in rural areas.  According to EPA, older, inefficient residential wood heaters can  produce a deadly mix of particulate matter (or PM), carbon monoxide,  volatile organic compounds (which contribute to ozone), black carbon  (which contributes to climate change) and air toxics (such as benzene  and formaldehyde). This pollution builds up inside and outside the home  and contaminates the air we breathe. This pollution can trigger asthma  attacks and cause lung damage, cancer, and other significant health  problems, including death.   As other industries clean up their air emissions, older, inefficient  residential wood heaters stand out among the largest sources of PM  pollution. EPA data indicate that nation-wide, inefficient residential  wood heaters emit five times more PM pollution than the U.S. petroleum  refineries, cement manufacturers, and pulp and paper plants combined.  In Delaware alone, older wood heaters are the second largest source of  PM pollution in the state, contributing more than highway vehicles,  electric utilities and the petroleum industries combined. In Alaska,  inefficient woodstoves and wood heaters play a significant role in the  classification of Fairbanks as a nonattainment area for fine  particulate air pollution.   Fortunately, technology made and sold in the U.S. can dramatically  reduce the pollution that is emitted from residential wood heaters and  the amount of wood needed to heat a home. Wood heaters being made today  that meet EPA's strictest emission standards emit at least 70% less PM  and save consumers twenty to forty percent in heating costs from gained  efficiencies. If we could encourage all homeowners to use the latest  residential wood heater technology, it could have a massive beneficial  effect on public health. EPA has determined that replacing just one  old, inefficient wood heater is equivalent to taking five dirty diesel  engines off the road and the monetized public health benefits from  replacing the Nation's old, inefficient residential wood heaters would  be up to $126 billion per year. Baser on all that we know, it is clear  that replacing older stoves for newer, cleaner burning stoves will  result in cleaner air, lower healthcare bills and lower costs for  consumers.   Unfortunately, as with old diesel engine owners, most homeowners are  not aware of the health problems associated with their old wood heaters  or cannot afford to buy a new wood heater on their own. This means that  newer, cleaner heaters are not getting into homes fast enough. The  Carper-Murkowski Wood Heater Emissions Reduction Act attempts to solve  this problem.   WHERA authorizes a five-year grant program at EPA to incentivize the  removal and replacement of old, inefficient residential wood heaters  for more efficient, clean-burning heaters. Specifically, WHERA funding  targets incentives to: (1) scrap or recycle old wood heaters; and (2)  replace them with new, efficient, clean burning and properly installed  heaters that at least meet EPA's most stringent wood heater emission  standards. Using the successful Diesel Emissions Reduction Act as a  model, WHERA allows States, Indian tribes, territories, and local air  quality agencies to compete for Federal dollars to fund wood heater  change-out programs that work for their communities.   WHERA also supports retailers and manufacturers with the transition  to cleaner, more efficient residential wood heaters. WHERA incentivizes  homeowners to buy the best available residential wood heater products-- when they might not otherwise do so--giving financial incentives for  retailers and manufacturers to sell and make the best products.  Overall, the residential wood heater industry has been supportive of  such wood heater change-out programs at the State and local level.   Because rural areas and tribal areas have a disproportionate need,  WHERA also requires that Indian tribal and rural communities are fairly  represented in funding allocations and that Indian tribal governments  receive at least 4% of total funding under the program.   My friend from Alaska and I feel that we've put together a program  that will be as, or more, successful than the DERA program. Replacing  outdated wood heaters with new clean-burning heaters that meet EPA  emission standards will reduce toxic air pollution and particulate  matter, protect public health, and support American jobs. This  legislation is a true win-win-win, and one that I commend to my  colleagues for their serious consideration.                                  ______                                         By Mr. DURBIN:   S. 3784. A bill to address the needs of workers in industries likely  to be impacted by rapidly evolving technologies; to the Committee on  Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
