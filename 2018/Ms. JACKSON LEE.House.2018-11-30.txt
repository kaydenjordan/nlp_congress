 Mr. Speaker, it is important for this body to adhere  to the rule of law. There are several points that I want to make this  morning that define adhering to the rule of law.   First of all, we know that Mr. Cohen pled guilty yesterday on  questions of truth or falsity to the United States Congress. With all  due respect, we must investigate the rule of law.   In addition, it is important that we put forward a bill that  addresses the question of the killing in Yemen and our continued  support for the bloodshed created by the war between Saudi Arabia and  Yemen. The rule of law, peace or war, determination by this Congress.   Finally, I encourage my colleagues to seek and look into their  districts because of the increasing number of gangs--not MS-13, but  gangs in our high schools and middle schools. We must begin to address  directly more resources to intervene in children's lives to steer them  away from the violence of gangs. Rule of law, doing our job.   I hope that we start doing it, and doing it soon. I know we will do  it in the 116th Congress.                            ____________________
