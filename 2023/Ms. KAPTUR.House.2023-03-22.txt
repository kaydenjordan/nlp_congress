 Mr. Speaker, during rollcall vote No. 144 on H.R. 1093, I  mistakenly recorded my vote as ``no'' when I should have voted ``yes''.    Madam Speaker, domestic manufacturing has always been a  foundation stone of American prosperity and innovation. That remains  true today.   I hail from America's industrial heartland, the Great Lakes and  Midwest. Our people know firsthand how essential manufacturing is for  the long-term health and growth of our country.   What America makes and grows, makes and grows America.   When manufacturing is at the forefront, working-class families and  communities succeed. Together, invention and production lift up  economic growth and build a middle class. That is why I am proud to  reintroduce the Bipartisan Office of Manufacturing and Industrial  Innovation Policy Act of 2023.   This legislation will create an Office of Manufacturing and  Industrial Innovation to elevate at the highest levels manufacturing  policy.   This office will ensure that voices from the manufacturing sector,  small business, and labor unions are heard.   It is time for the Federal Government to put American manufacturing  and workers first.   This bipartisan legislation does exactly that.                            ____________________
