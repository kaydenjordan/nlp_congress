 Mr. Speaker, I rise to discuss the pension crisis  facing American workers and businesses across the country and the  urgent need for Congress to act.   Men and women in my home State of Michigan and across the country  worked a lifetime to retire with the dignity and security promised by  their pensions. They earned their retirement with blood, sweat, tears,  and many sacrifices along the way. They played by the rules, they put  money into their pension, and now they are scared to death about how  and what they will live on. They are worried about whether they will  have a safe and secure retirement.   A few months ago, we created the Joint Select Committee on the  Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans with the goal of coming up with  a bipartisan solution to the pension crisis by year's end. This is an  urgent task because, if we do not act this year, the major  multiemployer plans will start going under, and it could drag the  entire economy down with it. Not only would we face staggering benefit  cuts for retirees, but it will mean less money flowing in local  economies and more people relying on the social safety net for support.  It could be the perfect storm.                            ____________________     Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 3053, the  Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act.   Finding a way forward on the future of our Nation's nuclear waste  storage is no easy task. But I believe we have arrived at a bipartisan  agreement on nuclear waste storage that we need to advance today to  address this issue.   I would first like to thank Chairman Walden and Ranking Member  Pallone, and Chairman Shimkus and Ranking Member Tonko for their  outstanding leadership, and thank all of my colleagues who worked on  this in committee because it wasn't easy, but we worked together in a  bipartisan way.   This bill will authorize the Department of Energy to establish and  maintain interim storage facilities to hold nuclear waste until there  is a clear decision on the national repository.   Also, included in this bill is an amendment I offered at the full  committee with my good friend, Fred Upton. This important amendment  expresses the sense of the Congress that the governments of the United  States and Canada should not allow permanent or long-term storage of  spent nuclear fuel or other radioactive waste near the Great Lakes.   Mr. Upton and I were proud to get this amendment included on behalf  of every Member of the Great Lakes region.   The Great Lakes account for 20 percent of the world's fresh water  supply, and it is absolutely critical for millions of Americans who  rely on them for drinking water, jobs, and their way of life.   Nearly 1/10th of the U.S. population lives in the Great Lakes Basin,  and more than 35 million people, with approximately 24 million of them  being Americans, rely on the Great Lakes.   This provision reinforces the importance of the healthy Great Lakes  Basin, free of nuclear storage.   Mr. Chairman, I commend all of my colleagues one more time for their  good work in crafting a bipartisan agreement that will ensure nuclear  waste is stored at secure storage facilities.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
