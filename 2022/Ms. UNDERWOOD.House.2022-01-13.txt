 Madam Speaker, every American deserves the  opportunities that a good-paying job makes possible.   Working with the Biden-Harris administration, Democrats in Congress  have expanded those opportunities. Thanks to investments like the  American Rescue Plan and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, job  creation is at record levels. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will  create millions more good-paying, union jobs.   Not only will it rebuild our roads and bridges, but it also invests  in infrastructure that will spur economic development in our  communities.   Removing lead pipes and guaranteeing clean drinking water for 10  million more Americans will improve community health and help attract  new companies that will bring jobs and investments. So will expanding  reliable broadband and modernizing regional airports like the DeKalb  Taylor Municipal Airport in my district.   Finally, expanding our electric vehicle charging network will give  Americans more options when choosing a new car, while accelerating  climate action.   I am so proud to work with the Biden-Harris administration to rebuild  infrastructure for Illinois families, and we are just getting started.                            ____________________
