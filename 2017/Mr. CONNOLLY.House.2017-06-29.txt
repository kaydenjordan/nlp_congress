 Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the distinguished  ranking member, for yielding.   I don't know what our friend from Tennessee was talking about. I am  not here as a liberal legislator. I am here as a local government  person. I spent 14 years in local government.   We are not sanctuary cities. We are trying to solve crimes by seeking  cooperation from the immigrant community. This bill will make it  harder. Most of our local police chiefs would tell you that--if you  would listen to them.   Oddly enough, the Members supporting this bill are the same Members  who sanctimoniously decry Federal mandates and overreach--except when  they want one. Here we are, dictating how local governments should  implement Federal immigration laws.   At the local level, we know effective, community-based policing  relies on trust between the police and communities. This bill would  erode that collaboration and that trust.   How can we expect our Nation's immigrants to turn to the police if  they witness or fall victim to a crime if they are afraid of being  deported or separated from their families?   The bill will punish local police departments and those  relationships. It should be defeated. This local government guy will  oppose this bad policy bill.
