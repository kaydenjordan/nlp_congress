 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of Leveling the  Playing Field Act 2.0, legislation recently introduced by my colleague  Congresswoman Sewell.   As vice chairman of the Congressional Steel Caucus, I was proud to  join her and other colleagues in a Steel Caucus hearing recently with  representatives from the domestic steel industry and the United  Steelworkers. These representatives of the industry were united in  their support for this critical legislation that will update U.S. trade  remedy laws and combat unfair trade practices.   Every effort must be taken to ensure that American workers can  compete on a level playing field and thrive in our global economy.   Mr. Speaker, I look forward to continuing to work with all of my  colleagues to advance this critical legislation to support the ability  of all American workers to grow our economy and provide for our  national security.                            ____________________
