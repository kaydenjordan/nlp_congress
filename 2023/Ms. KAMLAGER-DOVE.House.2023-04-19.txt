 Mr. Chair, I rise today to strongly oppose this  attack on trans women and girls, known as the Republicans' politics  over participation act.   Americans are concerned about gun violence, paying rent, climate  change, and reproductive rights, but Republicans are once again stoking  culture fires, putting lives at risk, ignoring everyday kitchen-table  issues, and searching for votes rather than solutions.   This legislation would make it a violation of Title IX for federally  funded institutions to allow trans women and girls to play sports,  potentially setting gender equity back decades and undermining the true  purpose of Title IX.   This bill is so vaguely written that it would subject every single  girl to undergo a medical evaluation to prove their femaleness. Did I  wake up? Are we in Iran? Is this what we want to subject our girls to?   This bill is assaultive, dehumanizing, and tantamount to rape. To its  core, this bill is issue-deflecting and cloaked in misogyny, and it is  a true disgrace because I don't think you would do this to a man to  prove their maleness. This is sick.   Vote ``no'' on this legislation.
