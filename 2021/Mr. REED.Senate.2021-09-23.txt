 Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Mr. Inhofe, as the  chair and ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the  cochairs of the Senate Army Caucus, it is our honor to pay tribute to a  great leader and exceptional advocate for the U.S. Army, GEN Carter F.  Ham, U.S. Army, Retired, as he retires from his current position as the  president and chief executive officer of the Association of the United  States Army, AUSA. General Ham exemplifies a lifetime of service.   Carter enlisted as a private and ultimately joined only a small group  of soldiers in the history of the Army by earning the rank of Four-Star  general, leading at every level in the Army, from platoon to geographic  combatant command, along the way. His Army career began as an enlisted  infantry soldier in the 82nd Airborne Division and culminated as the  Commander of United States Africa Command. His service took him to  Italy, Germany, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Macedonia, Qatar, Iraq, and over  40 African countries, and his commands included the 1st Infantry  Division, the legendary ``Big Red One,'' and U.S. Army Europe. As the  second commander of United States Africa Command, he led all U.S.  military activities on the African continent ranging from combat  operations in Libya to hostage rescue operations in Somalia, as well as  training and security assistance activities across 54 complex and  diverse African nations. His leadership was compassionate and inclusive  and left the Army better from his service.   General Ham retired from the Army in June of 2013 after nearly 38  years, but his service continued. In the years after retirement from  Active Duty, he served as the chairman of the National Commission on  the Future of the Army, an eight-member panel tasked by Congress with  making recommendations on the size, force structure, and capabilities  of the Total Army. Since 2016, he has served admirably as the president  and CEO of AUSA, carrying out its mission to support soldiers, their  families, and Army civilians; provide a voice for the Army; and honor  those who have served.   Established to educate, inform, and connect, General Ham guided AUSA  through a period of unprecedented growth of membership, creating an  environment for industry and international partners to build their  relationships with the U.S. Army. With ingenuity and perseverance while  navigating through the COVID-19 pandemic, he kept the professional and  education-centered association operating smoothly without decreasing  any staffing, all while finding new opportunities and formats to  support the Army. General Ham provided steady leadership in his  advocacy with Congress supporting the Army--Regular, Guard, and  Reserve--as well as Army families, civilians, retirees, and veterans.  He embraced the Army's ``People First'' mission while advocating for  readiness and modernization with a balanced perspective; he ardently  supported the Army while respecting and working with the other military  services. Through his vision for the future and commitment to honor all  who served in the past, General Ham and AUSA enabled the Army, its  soldiers and veterans, and the American people, to realize a National  Museum of the U.S. Army. He has served the United States, the Army, and  the Association of the United States Army with great distinction and  exceptional leadership, wisdom, and humility.   On behalf of Congress and the United States of America, we thank  General Ham, his wife Christi, and their entire family for their  commitment, sacrifice, and contributions to this great Nation. We join  our colleagues in wishing him the long and joyful retirement he so  richly deserves.                            ____________________
