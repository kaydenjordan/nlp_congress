 Madam Speaker, I applaud the United States Senate  for unanimously passing legislation to nationally recognize Juneteenth  as a federal holiday.   Juneteenth marks the anniversary of General Gordon Granger arriving  in Galveston, Texas, and delivering the news of emancipation to  enslaved Texans on June 19, 1865.   More than two years after President Lincoln's January 1, 1863  Emancipation Proclamation and more than two months after the end of the  civil war, the enslaved in Texas finally received word of their freedom  from General Granger, who was backed by 2,000 Union soldiers.   These newly freed persons--the last to receive the news of their  emancipation in the Confederate states--started a grassroots  celebration in Texas known as `Jubilee Day' to commemorate the life- altering event. Jubilee celebrations spread throughout the South and  eventually to the rest of the country and taking on the moniker  `Juneteenth,' a portmanteau meaning June 19th.   Although official recognition of this day has been slow to come, work  by individuals such as the late Al Edwards--former state representative  and the father of the Juneteenth holiday in Texas--has led to all but  three states recognizing Juneteenth with annual celebratory events.   Now, what began as a grassroots movement to commemorate Texas history  is set to become our nation's next federal holiday.  [[Page H2872]]    In honor of the Honorable Al Edwards and every person ever enslaved,  I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to vote for this legislation on  the House floor, and I thank Senator Edward Markey as well as my  colleague and friend Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee for introducing  this legislation to ensure Juneteenth is nationally recognized.
