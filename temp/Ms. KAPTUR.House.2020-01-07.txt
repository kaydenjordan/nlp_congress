 Mr. Speaker, this week, President Trump will travel to  the great and compassionate city of Toledo, Ohio, my lifelong home.  Like all people, the President is welcome in Toledo.   Toledo is a city of industry, where the mighty Jeep has rolled off  the assembly line every year since 1941. We are also the city that  embraces the future and launched America's leading solar energy  company, First Solar. Our diverse city and people truly make America  great.   I urge the President to bring a message of unity to our city, not one  of division.   I also urge President Trump to keep his promises to our people: Make  medicine and healthcare more affordable; save our Great Lakes;  negotiate enforceable trade agreements that actually stop job  outsourcing. Protect, don't gut, Social Security, Medicare, and  Medicaid. Get Mitch McConnell to pass the Butch Lewis Act to save the  pensions of 60,000 Ohioans, and select our 180th Fighter Wing for the  F-35 tranche planes that they have so duly earned.   Let us work on a bipartisan basis to improve the lives of all people.  And, in furtherance of that, this Thursday, I urge all Toledo area  religious leaders to offer prayers for nonviolence and peace, and I  urge all of our citizens to light a candle in their home and put on a  porch light to shine a ray of hope skyward for a new year of peace and  prosperity for all.   May God bless our troops.                            ____________________
