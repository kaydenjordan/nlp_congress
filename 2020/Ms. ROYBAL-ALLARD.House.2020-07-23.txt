 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 7608, and I  commend and thank the chairman and chairwomen who worked very hard to  produce funding bills that reflect our ``For the People'' vision for  America.   This mini-bus composed of the State and Foreign Operations, the  Agriculture, Interior and the Military Construction and Veterans  Affairs appropriations bills provides critical resources for a wide  range of our important domestic and international priorities.   While there is much to be thankful for in this mini-bus, I would like  to highlight a few of the many critical protections I requested for  vulnerable animals which these subcommittee chairs graciously included  in their bills.   This bill defunds dog testing at the Veterans Administration and  prohibits notorious Class B dealers from selling illegally acquired  pets into research. It also provides emergency shelter options for  domestic violence survivors with companion animals.   It prevents horses from being slaughtered in America for human  consumption and cracks down on the painful practice of horse soring.   It pushes FDA to reduce primate testing and to retiree these animals  to sanctuary.   Finally, the mini-bus combats wildlife poaching and trafficking  around the world and provides recovery funding for endangered species  like the California Condor.   Madam Speaker, Mahatma Gandhi once said the greatness of a nation can  be judged by the way its animals are treated. I thank Chairman Bishop  and Chairwomen Lowey, McCollum and Wasserman Schultz for demonstrating  what that greatness looks like.   I urge my colleagues to support animal welfare and our many ``For the  People'' priorities and vote YES on H.R. 7608.
