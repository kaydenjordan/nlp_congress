 Madam Speaker, today, the House will vote on the  Families First Coronavirus Response Act.   This critical legislation provides much-needed support for working  people across America.   It includes funding for free coronavirus tests for everyone who needs  it; 14 days of paid sick leave and up to 3 months of paid family and  medical leave; enhanced unemployment insurance that will protect  furloughed workers; food security through SNAP, student meals, senior  nutrition, and food banks; and increased Federal funds for Medicaid.   We are facing an enormous crisis in our country right now.   Once we pass this bill, the Senate and the President need to act  swiftly so these resources are made available to the American people.   Madam Speaker, I thank Speaker Nancy Pelosi and all of our colleagues  who worked so hard on this over the last several days. Nothing is more  important than protecting the health and well-being of the American  people.   There is more work to be done, and we will do whatever it takes, bear  any burden, confront any obstacle in order to minimize the damage that  this pandemic will do to our country, and we will do all that we can to  keep our country and our constituents safe.                            ____________________
