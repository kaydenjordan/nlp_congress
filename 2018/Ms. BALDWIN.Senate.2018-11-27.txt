 Mr. President, today I wish to honor Shel Gross,  director of Public Policy for Mental Health America of Wisconsin, MHA,  on his retirement. Throughout his career, Shel has helped everyday  Wisconsinites in their battle with mental health issues and has been a  powerful advocate, peer, mentor, and leader in elevating the voices of  those struggling with mental illness.   Shel has been the director of Public for MHA of Wisconsin since April  2000. During his tenure, he has significantly expanded the array of  community-based mental health services that support recovery and  independence. Wisconsin owes Shel a debt of gratitude for raising  awareness of both the tragedy and treatability of many serious mental  health afflictions.   Shel's greatest accomplishment is his tremendous work in reducing the  prevalence of suicide in Wisconsin. As project manager for MHA's  statewide prevention/early intervention initiative in mental health, he  focused on improving the quality of behavioral healthcare to help lower  Wisconsin's suicide rate. According to the Wisconsin Department of  Health Services, over 700 Wisconsin residents die each year by suicide.  Another 5,500 Wisconsin residents are hospitalized due to intentional,  self-inflicted injury. As project manager of a suicide prevention  grant, Shel made it his life's work to reduce the number of people  affected by suicide or suicide attempts, work that deserves the utmost  praise and appreciation.   The Milwaukee Mental Health Task Force, MHTF, awarded Shel the Karen  Avery Award in 2017, which honors those who have shown tremendous  advocacy and leadership in advancing the rights of people with  disabilities. Working hand-in-hand with the award's namesake, Shel  helped establish the Grassroots Empowerment Project, GEP, to create  opportunities for people seeking mental health recovery and wellness to  exercise power in their lives. Shel has been a prominent voice for  recognizing and tapping the power of community to help heal the  isolation of depression.   Shel will be deeply missed by his colleagues and all those who  consider him a loyal friend and passionate advocate. I know Shel will  continue to be a valuable voice on these important issues after  retirement, but I congratulate him on this milestone and wish him the  very best in this new chapter.                            ____________________
