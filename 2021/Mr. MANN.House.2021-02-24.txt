 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to thank the farmers and ranchers  whose work does not stop.   Even in the face of extreme freezing temperatures this month, the  likes of which we have not seen in decades, Kansas stood strong and got  the job done.   The big First District of Kansas is one of the most productive  agricultural areas in the country. The district is home to more than  60,000 farms and is made up of farmers, ranchers, feedlot managers,  nutritionists, ethanol producers, ag lenders, and agribusiness owners  who feed, fuel, and clothe the world.   I grew up in Quinter, and I spent thousands of hours on a tractor in  fields and on horseback, doctoring cattle in our family's feed yard. I  know well agriculture's working conditions are demanding on a good day,  but especially so when our business partner, Mother Nature, is as  unforgiving as she has been lately.   In the past month, Kansas spent 13 consecutive days with temperatures  below freezing. This is a stretch of freezing temperatures we have not  seen in our State for nearly 40 years.   But those who stand with snow up to their knees in the depths of  winter or haul water in the drought of summer know agriculture does not  take days off. No matter the temperature, our ag producers head to work  long before most of us are awake and stay out until many of us have  already laid our heads down at night.   They are people like Cody and Ashley Bornholdt of Inman, who bust ice  by hand at all hours so their cattle have access to water and are still  able to joke that after several days of negative  [[Page H596]]  temperatures, zero degrees feels like a heat wave.   They are people like Gary Capoun of Alma, who delivers baby calves  and hauls them on the floorboard of his pickup to someplace warmer  where they can be bottle-fed to ensure that they get the nutrients  needed to grow and survive in the wind chills.   They are the men and women staying up through the night so a baby  animal gets a shot at life, a piece of equipment is ready to go early  the next morning, the neighboring producer has the help they need to  milk their herd, and so people like you and I have a safe and secure  food supply.   As many across the country learned this last spring, our food does  not come from a grocery store shelf. The importance of the agriculture  and food supply chain cannot be overstated. This supply chain  represents millions of people working every day in the U.S. It begins  with farmers, ranchers, and growers, and it includes food processors  and manufacturers, shippers, transportation workers, and, finally,  those working in the grocery stores and restaurants. Each of these  people is vital in ensuring we have food on our plates.   While most of us in the ``Big First'' of Kansas know how important  agriculture is, I know that message can sometimes be lost on the way to  the grocery store. So on behalf of Kansans and all Americans, I share a  sincere thank-you to the farmers, ranchers, and producers who supply  our food, fuel, and fiber.   Thank you. Thank you for pulling the baby calf out of the snowbank  and nursing it back to life. Thank you for busting ice early and  feeding hay late. Thank you for putting the needs of your livestock  before yourselves. Thank you for your never-ending, backbreaking days.  Thank you for, especially on cold days, working so hard for the extra  hours and extra strength. Your efforts feed us and keep us warm, too.   It is an honor to represent you in the U.S. House of Representatives  and on the House Agriculture Committee. May God bless you.                        Celebrating National FFA Week     Mr. Speaker, I also rise today to celebrate National FFA  Week.   The national FFA organization was founded by a group of young farmers  in 1928 as the Future Farmers of America. Their mission was to prepare  future generations for the challenges of feeding the world.   Today, more than 760,000 blue corduroy jacket-wearing FFA members in  more than 8,700 chapters across the country, and more than 9,600  members in 220 chapters in Kansas alone, are still working hard to  advance our Nation's most critical industry, food and agriculture.                                time  1045    These members are our future farmers, ranchers, engineers, doctors,  lawyers, teachers, scientists, communicators, and businesspeople. They  are the next generation of leaders.   This week, they will celebrate National FFA Week as a long-held  tradition during George Washington's birthday to respect agriculture's  heritage and recognize its future.   As a past chapter FFA president from Quinter, Kansas, and a proud FFA  alumnus, I am honored to join nearly 80 of my colleagues to introduce  H. Res. 150, expressing support for the designation of February 20 to  February 27, 2021, as National FFA Week, recognizing the important role  of the National FFA Organization in providing the next generation of  leaders who will change the world, and celebrating 50 years of National  FFA Alumni and Supporters.   Kansas FFA and the National FFA Organization have had a profound  impact on me. FFA taught me belonging when I put on my FFA jacket the  first time, responsibility when caring for my family's livestock in the  bitter winters and drought-ridden summers, and pride in sharing about  the organization I love on the House floor today.   Because of FFA and the next generation of agriculture, I know our  brightest days are ahead.   Happy National FFA Week.                            ____________________
