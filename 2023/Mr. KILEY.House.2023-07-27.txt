 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Jake's Journey  Home, a local nonprofit in my district.   In September 2019, Jake Shuman, a Seabee veteran and small business  owner, passed away unexpectedly. He left behind not just his loving  friends and family but also a legacy of empathy, generosity, and  humility.   In an effort to continue Jake's powerful legacy, his mother, Jean  Shuman, founded Jake's Journey Home. This nonprofit has taken up the  mission of assisting unhoused veterans and community members  experiencing a life path change.   Jake's Journey Home provides the necessary wraparound support  services and resources to those in need to fight against the growing  problem of poverty and to help someone's tomorrow be better than today.   With the strong support of the community, the organization obtained a  mobile day center last year to help connect people with VA benefits,  mental health aid, drug and alcohol abuse support, job skills, medical  assistance, and life coaching. Their mission is ongoing, with goals to  expand their services into a permanent building.   Jake's Journey Home is a pillar in our community, and it is a true  honor to represent in Congress exceptional organizations such as this  one.   On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I am honored  to recognize Jake's Journey Home for outstanding service and  contributions to the Folsom community and greater Sacramento region.                           Recognizing Judd Symons     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 2023 EMS  Provider of the Year for Inyo County, Judd Symons, for his remarkable  accomplishments and contributions in the southern portions of the Third  Congressional District.   Mr. Symons' career in the Bishop area began when he was only in high  school, during which he became certified as an emergency medical  technician. For 3 years of his high school career, and a few summers  following, he also served on the local search and rescue team.   He went on to earn his certification as a paramedic from the  Stanford-Foothill Paramedic Program. Shortly thereafter, in 1989, at  just 21 years old, he and his father began their local family business,  an ambulance service named Symons Emergency Services.    With over three decades of offering superior emergency medical  services, this establishment has become a leading provider in our  region. Relied upon by many, his ambulance service provides care to  those across many different types of geographic landscapes, from urban  cities to the rural High Sierras to the remote wilderness.   Even in the face of obstacles, Mr. Symons' continued dedication to  his community and commitment to the well-being of Inyo County residents  and the surrounding area is inspiring.   As a longtime owner and operator of this service, Mr. Symons is  regarded by others as an individual with professionalism, care, hands- on involvement, and a unique ability to remain calm under pressure.   On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I am honored  to join the Inyo County community in thanking Judd Symons for his many  years of distinguished service and leadership in both emergency medical  services and search and rescue operations.                            Recognizing Helen Chu     Mr. Speaker, in the spirit of National Zookeeper  Appreciation Week, I wish to take a moment to recognize an outstanding  zookeeper in my district, Helen Chu.   Ms. Chu serves locally at the Folsom City Zoo Sanctuary. The zoo is  home to many rescued wild and domestic animals, including bears, wolf  hybrids, monkeys, birds, cougars, insects, and more.   Ms. Chu has worked for the Folsom Zoo since 2019, but her service to  wildlife has been lifelong. She graduated from the University of  California Davis with a degree in wildlife, fish, and conservation  biology and also earned a degree in exotic animal training and  management from Moorpark College.   Prior to bringing this knowledge to the Folsom City Zoo Sanctuary,  Ms. Chu worked with animals as a zookeeper for the Fresno Chaffee Zoo  and the Sacramento Zoo.   In Folsom, Ms. Chu has contributed significantly to the zoo's  positive reinforcement animal training and behavioral enrichment  programs, improving the quality of life of the animals.   Her diligent efforts and unique ability to problem solve have helped  animals with health challenges participate in veterinary care without  undue stress or danger to the animals and staff.   Throughout her tenure, she has exhibited the core values of a  zookeeper through teamwork, excellence, and patience.   Her leadership and dedication to the care and well-being of the  animals and the experience of Folsom residents is truly admirable.   On behalf of the United States House of Representatives, I am honored  to recognize Helen Chu and thank her for her service to the Folsom  community.        Recognizing California's Third Congressional District Interns     Mr. Speaker, I will take a moment in the spirit of  National Intern Day to recognize several truly exemplary individuals  currently interning in my Washington, D.C., and district offices.   Over the course of their internships, these students and recent  graduates have embodied the essence of public service.   They have made the government accessible to their neighbors by  leading guided tours of the Capitol, ensured that people's voices are  heard by taking down their concerns and sharing  [[Page H4132]]  them with me, and even helping people renew their passports and access  the services and benefits they are entitled to from the Federal  Government.   In my D.C. office, I am proud to have Alex McDonald, Khori Cranford,  and Giavanna Chopra.   Alex grew up in Willows, California, just outside our congressional  district. He has long had a passion for politics and public service. He  even remembers watching the Obama-Romney debates from over a decade  ago. Impressively, he is going into his sophomore year at Yale  University, studying political science.   Khori graduated this past May from CSU Fresno with a degree in  political science. She has also embraced her Armenian heritage and was  selected to participate in the highly competitive Armenian Assembly of  America as part of the Terjenian-Thomas internship this summer. After  her summer here, she will work toward earning a master's degree in  communications at San Diego State University.   Giavanna has been incredibly active in public service since a young  age. She previously served as an intern in my State assembly office and  as a deputy campaign manager on my race last year. During the same time  period, she also won a national debate title and created a program to  mentor young debaters. She will be entering college this fall at  Northwestern University and, not surprisingly, was recruited to join  Northwestern's debate team.   In my district office in Rocklin, I am proud to have Jaime Robles,  Emma Worden, and Raghava Kodavatikanti, who are serving there as  interns.   Jaime recently graduated from Sierra College in Rocklin and will be  attending UC Berkeley in the spring to major in economics. He served as  vice president and student senator of the Sierra College Student  Senate, vice president of student engagement for the social science  club, and is a Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society member. Jaime is also  bilingual, and I have recently been impressed with his ability to  utilize that skill to serve our Spanish-speaking residents.   Emma is originally from the district, graduating recently from  Whitney High School, and is pursuing a degree in economics and  politics. Our Rocklin team and I have especially appreciated her  leadership, teamwork, and collaborative approach in our office.   Raghava recently graduated from the rigorous IB program at Mira Loma  High School and will be attending UCLA this fall, majoring in political  science. Similar to Giavanna, he also had an early interest in public  service. Raghava previously interned in my State assembly office, as  well as for the California State treasurer and Sacramento district  attorney's offices. He also serves as a youth advisory executive board  member and moderator for the California Coalition for Youth.    Mr. Speaker, every single one of these six individuals has been a  tremendous help to me and our team in serving the people of the Third  Congressional District of California, and I am incredibly grateful that  they have chosen to invest their time and talents with us.   On behalf of the U.S. House of Representatives, I thank them for  their commitment to public service.                            Recognizing Tyler Tate     Mr. Speaker, I will also say a few words about someone who  is a model for all of these interns working at our offices here in D.C.  and back home in Rocklin, someone who is a former intern himself and a  constituent, having grown up in our district and graduated from high  school at Woodcreek in Roseville. He has been the communications  director for my office, a role that he will continue up until tomorrow,  when he is starting his first year at Harvard Law School. That is Tyler  Tate.   I first met Tyler in my 2016 campaign for the State assembly. I think  I actually met him in 2015 because we got started pretty early. That  was a true underdog campaign. There were 11 candidates, and Tyler was  really one of the very first people to join and help lead what was  truly a grassroots undertaking.   He went on to go to Georgetown for college and actually interned in  my State assembly office and quickly gained a reputation as everyone's  favorite intern. That is why I say he is a model on National Intern  Day.   After college, Tyler got some experience in D.C. He did a stint at  the White House. When I was running for Congress last year, I was in  need of a campaign manager, and I couldn't think of anyone better for  the job.   I was continually impressed by his mastery of the nuts and bolts of  running a campaign, such as delivering the yard signs or designing  precinct blocks, but also more intangible qualities of leadership, like  his ability to inspire a very dedicated team of volunteers.                                time  1800    Just as one indication of the caliber of people he got involved, two  of the interns he attracted to join the campaign will actually be  joining him at Harvard next year where they will be starting  themselves, respectively at the college and the law school.   After I was elected and took office, Tyler became our communications  director. I would wager there is not a better or more dedicated  communications director on Capitol Hill.   Shortly after I was sworn in, my district was hit by a series of  truly devastating storms that wreaked havoc on many communities, and  without having had more than perhaps a week or so in the office, Tyler  threw himself into the very complicated but vitally important task of  getting important information to all of our constituents on how they  could deal with the storm and the resources that were available.   That quality of service has continued throughout his time with us. He  does everything from dealing with the media and setting up press  appearances to writing and editing our weekly newsletter and other  releases that go out, and advising me on important matters of policy.   Through it all, he has truly demonstrated a remarkable ability to  understand the nuances of politics and policy in a way that is really  hard to believe knowing he is only a few years out of college. You  would think he was a seasoned veteran of Capitol Hill.   When I wrote a letter of recommendation for him for law school, I was  halfway tempted to sabotage the whole thing so that I could selfishly  keep him with our office. I was not surprised at all when he got  accepted. I know he is going to excel in law school. He will be a great  lawyer, but I think there are also great things ahead of him in public  service, as well.   For those who are watching at home, I would advise them to remember  the name Tyler Tate. I thank Tyler for everything he has done to help  me serve the people of the Third District.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
