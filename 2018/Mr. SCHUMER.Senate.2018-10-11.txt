 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, let me say to the people of Florida,  Georgia, and everyone else affected by Hurricane Michael that our  thoughts and hearts are with you. Having worked and lived through the  recovery of Hurricane Sandy in my home State of New York, I remember  vividly the anguish of families who lost their homes and businesses the  day or two after and then realizing it took years for areas of New York  and Long Island to recover. We are still in the process of recovering.  I know, A, your pain and suffering and, B, the challenges that await  you.   So we hope everyone stays safe as the storm passes through the  country. We know that Americans and the Senate will pull together, as  they always do, to help one another build and recover.                            ____________________     Madam President, this year has seen a huge number of  powerful storms and hurricanes both on the Atlantic seaboard and in the  gulf. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, Florence, and now Michael have  wrought severe damages. According to  [[Page S6779]]  NOAA, 2017 was the most expensive year on record for disasters in the  United States. At some point, we have to acknowledge that the intensity  of these storms is much greater than in past years and is a symptom of  changing climate.   Climate change is real. It is being driven by human activity. It is  happening right now. These are facts. They are not in dispute. Our  scientists know it, our businesses know it, the world knows it, and the  American people know it. But too many Senators on the other side of the  aisle just put their heads in the sand. It costs us more and more and  more. We are not going to leave these people high and dry, but if we  would do more on climate change, we would have fewer of these  hurricanes and other types of storms.   Everyone knows that, except a few. Why? Why don't they admit the  truth? Maybe there are two words that explain it: oil industry.   Just this week the U.N. released a report on climate change, saying  that the world has only a short time--maybe a little more than a  decade--to get a handle on carbon emissions. So far, the current  administration has done nothing but move the issue backward. It is  amazing that we, the leading country that is supposed to be the moral  force--the economic, political, and military leader--are the ones who  pull out of the Paris climate accords, and then the administration has  been repealing environmental protection after protection.   So while we are thinking about the people of Florida, Georgia, South  Carolina, and North Carolina and everyone in Hurricane Michael's path,  let's remember we are running out of time to do something about climate  change. The kinds of storms we are seeing now will only increase if  this body continues to keep its head in the sand ostrichlike and ignore  the scientific realities.                            ____________________     Now, on another matter--healthcare--yesterday, 50 of my  Republican colleagues voted against ensuring protections for people  with preexisting conditions--people with asthma and cancer, people with  diabetes and all kinds of gynecological problems. Republican Senators  sided with the Trump administration to expand the ability of insurance  companies to sell cutrate, junk insurance to Americans--to dupe  Americans. These plans will destabilize the healthcare market and raise  the cost of insurance for people with preexisting conditions who may  end up being priced out of insurance altogether.   Let me say that again. Republicans yesterday voted to let insurance  companies offer junk insurance plans that don't cover essential health  benefits, allowing them to nickel-and-dime patients out of the medical  care they deserve.   Our constituents--Democrats, Republicans, north, west, east, and  south--say they want better healthcare at a lower cost, and what do  Republicans do? They offer worse healthcare coverage at a higher cost,  ultimately, to people, because the plans don't cover anything and then  you have to pay out of your pocket.   What did they do it in the name of? Freedom. Freedom. This is like  the 1890s. Who is going to have freedom? The insurance companies, the  big shots. Who is going to have no freedom from illness and disease?  Average folks. It is terrible thinking, once again siding with big,  powerful special interests, not the average person.   The only people who want these junk insurance plans are two groups-- the insurance companies and the rightwing ideologues who believe the  government shouldn't be in healthcare at all. They want to cut  Medicare. They want to cut Medicaid. They want to cut Social Security.  That is who it is.   So let us remember that the junk insurance plans are hardly worth the  paper they are printed on. They lure consumers in with low premiums,  but the deductibles are so high, the copays are so high, and the  coverage so skimpy that the plans hardly offer any benefit to the  consumer at all.   While every Republican save one voted to hand the keys to the  insurance companies, every single Democrat--every single Democrat-- stood up to the sabotage from the Trump administration and voted to not  allow the expansion of junk insurance across America.   I warn my colleagues that these are the kinds of issues that voters  remember come election time. Healthcare is the No. 1 issue in America  to the broad majority of voters. The American people will head to the  polls in November and ask themselves: Which party will defend the  people's right to quality healthcare? Which party will not?   The answer to that question could not be clearer. Democrats have  spent the past 2 years offering several plans to reduce the cost of  healthcare while maintaining or increasing the quality, while President  Trump and Republicans in Congress have done nothing but drive costs up  and quality down in obeisance to the big special interests--the  insurance industry.   They have tried to repeal the healthcare law. They have tried to gut  Medicaid, eliminate healthcare for millions of Americans, and put the  insurers back in charge. They have eliminated the program to help low-  and middle-income Americans afford insurance and, worst of all,  Republican attorneys general--including two running for the Senate, one  in Missouri and one in West Virginia--are suing, as we speak, to  eliminate protections for Americans with preexisting conditions.   These actions are undergirded by a belief on the other side of the  aisle that the American people just don't deserve help affording  adequate healthcare. Republicans have believed, continue to believe,  and have acted on, unfortunately, that insurance companies should rule  the roost, just as in the 1890s. The consequences are severe.   As a result of the Republican healthcare agenda, premiums are up by  double digits in several States and quality is down. As a result of the  Republican healthcare agenda, Americans are paying more and getting  less.   I say to the American people that in a few short weeks you will have  a choice. You can vote for 2 more years of healthcare sabotage from a  Republican Congress, more attempts at repealing the healthcare law,  more premium increases and uncertainty, more actions that undermine  protections for patients with preexisting conditions or the American  people can vote to flip the script and support Democratic candidates  who will not only protect the care that Americans have today but who  will work every single day to make it better.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
