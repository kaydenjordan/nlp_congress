 Madam Speaker, the announcement of  Mike Garcia's  election makes it official: The American people have entrusted  Republicans with the House majority.   They do so at a time of unprecedented fiscal peril for our country:  40-year high inflation, economic recession, and an approaching debt  crisis, all driven by the most reckless spending in our Nation's  history. History is screaming this warning at us: nations that bankrupt  themselves aren't around very long.   Republicans must reclaim the mantle of fiscal integrity and fiscal  responsibility, and we should start by renouncing the tawdry, corrupt,  and irresponsible practice of congressional earmarks, in which  individual Congressmen direct spending to pet projects in their  districts or grants to favored supporters, bypassing merit-driven  competition.   I have proposed to the House Republican Conference a rule forbidding  congressional earmarks and expect a vote on it when we return after  Thanksgiving.   Earmark supporters argue that the power of the purse rests with  Congress; therefore, its elected Members, and not unelected  bureaucrats, should make these decisions.   Well, no, not exactly. Representatives are supposed to be biased  toward their districts; that is why Congress is designed to act  collectively. Ever since Magna Carta, it has been a settled principle  of good governance that the power to appropriate funds should be  separated from the power to spend them.   This is at the heart of the constitutional separation of powers:  Congress appropriates funds but cannot spend them; and the President  spends funds but cannot appropriate them. This is the single most  important protection we have against political corruption and pork  barrel spending. Earmarks undermine this principle, and it is no  coincidence that most of the congressional scandals over the years have  involved earmarks.   A local company produces a product the Pentagon neither needs nor  wants. So what to do? Well, it simply ingratiates itself with the local  Congressman and has him tell the Pentagon what it needs and who will  provide it. Then it rewards him lavishly at election time and repeats.   Worthy projects, in open competitive bidding, do not need earmarks;  they rise or fall on their merits. And if there is such a thing as a  ``good'' earmark, the price to be paid is all the bad ones. That is a  high price indeed.   Just the last omnibus spending bill in March included nearly 5,000  congressional earmarks totaling $9 billion for some of the most  egregious examples of waste in the Federal budget: feral swine  management in Arkansas, a national atomic testing museum in Las Vegas,  a sheep experiment station in Idaho.   Now, Members can and should advocate for their districts, and make  the case for projects they deem worthy of the money that Congress has  appropriated. The problem with earmarks is blurring these two rules and  having Members both advocate and decide.   Now, many say they don't trust this President and his deputies to  administer these funds appropriately and evenhandedly, and I agree. But  if you don't trust the President to administer the funds that we  appropriate, then don't give him the money, period.   We hear that earmarks simply assure that local governments get a fair  break. No, what they actually do is turn the Federal budget into a grab  bag for local pork spending by the most powerful Members in Congress;  and they undermine the central tenet of federalism: that local projects  should be financed by local communities and Federal spending reserved  for the Nation's general welfare.   When a local government proposes an earmark, what is it saying? It is  saying the project is so low on its priority list it doesn't dare spend  its own taxpayers' money. But it is perfectly happy to have taxpayers  in other communities foot the bill.   The result is a long list of dubious projects that rob St. Petersburg  to pay  [[Page H8546]]  St. Paul for projects that St. Petersburg doesn't benefit from, and St.  Paul doesn't deem worthy enough to spend its own money on.   Finally, it is said that earmarks can ``grease'' legislation by  buying off the votes of individual Members. Add a few local projects  for that Member, and suddenly a bill he would never vote for on its  merits becomes a local imperative overriding his sound judgment. But  explain to me, how is that a good thing?   Our new majority needs to make a dramatic, concrete, and credible  statement that business as usual in Washington is over. Is there a more  powerful statement we can make than to swear off this wasteful and  corrupting practice of congressional earmarking?                            ____________________
