 Madam President, I rise to honor the life and legacy of  Ruth Bader Ginsburg.   The Nation mourns the loss of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader  Ginsburg, who died Friday night. She died on the eve of the Jewish new  year, Rosh Hashanah. She was the first Jewish woman on the U.S. Supreme  Court.   Rabbis tell us a very interesting thing about individuals who die  right before the new year. They say and they suggest that these are  very righteous people who die at the very end of the year because they  were needed until the very end. Under Jewish tradition, those who die  on the new year holiday are considered tzadik, a title given to the  righteous and saintly. Certainly Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was  entitled to this honor, being righteous and saintly.   At her confirmation hearing, Justice Ginsburg talked about her  immigrant experience. You see, her father was a Jewish immigrant, and  her mother was barely a second-generation American. So she talked about  American values, and then she said: ``What has become of me could only  happen in America.''   Then she spent her entire career protecting those values that make  America the great Nation it is and the reason why people come here in  order to reach their full potential. It guided her well in her public  service.   Justice Ginsburg was both an inspiration and a trailblazer in every  sense of the word. After breaking through the countless barriers thrown  in her path, she redefined what is meant to be both a thoughtful jurist  and a dedicated public servant.   Let me just briefly go over some of her incredible accomplishments:  first in her undergraduate class at Cornell University, first female  member of the Harvard Law Journal, graduating first in her class at  Columbia Law School, first female professor at Columbia University to  earn tenure.   Justice Ginsburg directed the ACLU Women's Rights Project and argued  six landmark cases before the Supreme Court, winning five of those  cases. These cases protected not only the rights of women but those of  many men who faced discrimination as well.   As the National Women's Law Center wrote about Justice Ginsburg's  death, they said:         [Her passing] is cause for us to pause and honor the       unparalleled mark she has left on this country. From co-      founding the ACLU's Women's Rights Project, to bringing the       first case striking down a law that discriminated against       women, to building the case that defined the standard for sex       discrimination cases, Ginsburg was a visionary who       revolutionized the gender equality movement--and the law--      long before becoming a Supreme Court Justice.        For our country, Ginsburg's ethos was greater than just the       law. She was an icon and a living symbol of a north star, so       we must unite and do for her what she did for us--fight for       what is right.    As a litigator, Judge Ginsburg helped to shape the law, convincing  the Supreme Court that ``equal protection of the law'' under the 14th  Amendment applied not only to racial discrimination but to gender  discrimination as well.  [[Page S5752]]    Justice Ginsburg herself knew discrimination firsthand, as she  struggled to find a job after graduating law school--notwithstanding  her sterling qualifications. She had that difficulty, as we all know,  solely because of her gender. She experienced gender discrimination  firsthand, and she did something about it not only for herself but for  future generations.   After serving on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of  Columbia for 13 years, she began a 27-year career on the U.S. Supreme  Court.   There are so many of her decisions that were so consequential, so  visionary, expressing the right value, and her ability to express her  views was unquestioned. She did that in writing majority opinions, and  she is well known for doing that in writing dissenting opinions. So  many of her dissenting opinions led the way for change. She was right,  and she motivated change.   In 1996, Justice Ginsburg wrote the majority opinion of the Court in  the finding that the all-male admissions policy at the State-supported  Virginia Military Institute was unconstitutional. She said in that  opinion: ``Generalizations about `the way women are,' estimates of what  is appropriate for most women, no longer justify denying opportunity to  women whose talent and capacity place them outside the average  description.'' Any differential treatment, she concluded, must not  ``create or perpetuate the legal, social, and economic inferiority of  women.''   What a difference she made in that decision.   I will always remember her dissenting opinion in the Lilly Ledbetter  case because it led directly to change. Justice Ginsburg wrote in that  fiery dissent: ``Our precedent suggests, and lower courts have  overwhelmingly held, that the unlawful practice is the current payment  of salaries infected by gender-based (or race-based) discrimination--a  practice that occurs whenever a paycheck delivers less to a woman than  to a similarly situated man.''   I heard one of my colleagues talk about precedent, but here we see  the Court reversing precedent in order to advance discrimination  against women. Her dissent led to congressional action, becoming the  first piece of legislation signed by President Barack Obama. The text  of this bill hung on her office wall for good reason, as it embodied  her spirit.   She issued a fiery dissent again in the Shelby County v. Holder case  in 2013, a case decided by a 5-to-4 vote of the Supreme Court of the  United States, which gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965.   Here is what she said in that opinion:         What has become of the court's usual restraint?    Justice Ginsburg wrote in her dissenting opinion:         The great man who led the march from Selma to Montgomery       and there called for the passage of the Voting Rights Act       foresaw progress, even in Alabama. ``The arc of the moral       universe is long,'' he said, but ``it bends toward       justice,'' if there is a steadfast commitment to see the       task through to completion. That commitment has been       disserved by today's decision. . . . Throwing out       preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work       to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your       umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.    I mentioned these cases to underscore the importance of the Supreme  Court Justice in the lives of all Americans. So much is at stake in the  filling of Justice Ginsburg's vacancy. It will have real consequences  on all of our constituents.   Let me just give you a few examples of what is likely to be taken up  by the Supreme Court that could affect my constituents in Maryland and  the constituents around the Nation.   Your healthcare is, literally, on the line. The Affordable Care Act  that President Trump has tried to repeal and the Republicans have tried  to repeal in this body but have failed, they are now going to take to  the Supreme Court. A hearing is scheduled this November.   This is a real risk for tens of millions of Americans who depend on  the law for their health coverage and other benefits. Twenty million  Americans could lose their healthcare, and people with preexisting  conditions could lose those protections--that is 133 million  Americans--during the coronavirus pandemic.   That is what is at risk. We are talking about pregnancy, cancer,  diabetes, high blood pressure, behavioral health disorders, high  cholesterol, asthma, chronic lung disease, heart conditions, and  numerous others that have been held to be preexisting conditions. That  protection is in the Affordable Care Act. That is on the line before  the Supreme Court this November.   That is why Americans are concerned that we follow the right process  in selecting the next individual to serve on the Supreme Court of the  United States. If the Affordable Care Act is struck down, insurers  could bring back annual and lifetime limits on coverage; adults covered  by Medicaid expansion would lose vital health services; young people  would be kicked off of their parents' insurance; and insurers could  sell skimpy plans that don't even cover essential health benefits like  prescription drugs, emergency room visits, mental health and substance  use, and maternity care.   The Affordable Care Act increased access to care for millions who  were previously uninsured or underinsured. Through Medicaid expansion,  13 million low-income Americans now have dependable, comprehensive  health.   In Maryland alone, over 1.3 low-income individuals depend on  Medicaid, including 512,000 low-income children, 107,000 seniors, and  152,000 individuals with disabilities. That is in Maryland.   We must protect the Medicaid expansion population and other uninsured  and underinsured populations from the Trump administration's effort to  eliminate their access to affordable care. It is at risk.   This vacancy is critically important to protecting healthcare, and  there are so many other issues. Women's reproductive rights--clearly at  risk. Roe v. Wade--I understand it is established precedent, but look  at what the Supreme Court has been willing to do in reversing  precedent.   We know Roe v. Wade is in the crosshairs for change by the Supreme  Court, and one more Justice appointed to support that position and a  woman's right of choice could very well be in jeopardy.   Our most vulnerable individuals are at risk as well. Let me talk  about one specific group of people--some of our immigrants. On June 18,  2020, in a 5-to-4 decision written by Justice Roberts and joined by  Justice Ginsburg, the Supreme Court held that the Department of  Homeland Security violated the law when it rescinded the Deferred  Action for Childhood Arrival, DACA, Program.   There are approximately 643,000 DACA recipients in the United States,  and approximately 29,000 are healthcare workers, essential workers,  whose service during the COVID-19 pandemic has saved lives and eased  suffering. But for that 5-to-4 decision, those individuals' lives could  have been totally disrupted had they been ordered to leave our country.   These are individuals who know no other home but the United States of  America. They are our neighbors and friends--and yet a 5-to-4 decision  of the Supreme Court. Justice Ginsburg will no longer be there. This  next Justice could very well determine the fate of the Dreamers.   LGBTQ community: In the Obergefell v. Hodges case, the Supreme Court,  by a 5-to-4 decision, held the Constitution guarantees same-sex couples  the right to marry. That is a 5-to-4 decision.   I always expected that, in America, we would move forward in  protecting individual rights under our Constitution; that, in each  Congress and each session, the Supreme Court would advance those rights  for individuals' protection under the Constitution of the United  States. The filling of this Supreme Court vacancy could very well  reverse a trend of protecting rights and deny many in our community  their rights.   I could cite many, many other examples of what is at risk by the  Supreme Court appointment. There are many reasons why we believe that  we should follow the proper process in selecting the next Supreme Court  Justice, so let's talk a little bit about what process we should  follow. Let's talk a little bit about fairness. Let's talk about the  integrity of the Senate. Let's talk about living up to our own words.  Let's talk about using the same rules for Democrats that you use for  Republicans. Let's talk about the fairness of the process.  [[Page S5753]]    Now, I could spend a lot of time on the floor quoting the comments of  so many of my colleagues who spoke on the floor of the U.S. Senate 4  years ago on the Merrick Garland nomination by President Obama and how  they spoke about the importance of listening to the voters of our  Nation, how they said we didn't have the time--and, remember, Merrick  Garland was in February of an election year--to do this; that we needed  to withhold taking up the nomination; that it was up to the voters to  act first; and that this had nothing to do with the fact that it was a  Democrat in the White House.   So many of our colleagues said: If there is a Republican elected in  2016 and the Senate is controlled by the Republicans, we would say the  same thing. Hold off. Let the voters have a chance.   Let me quote from one of our colleagues.         In 2016, Senate Republicans refused to consider the       nomination of Judge Merrick Garland, President Obama's       nominee for a Supreme Court vacancy. They would not meet with       Judge Garland, hold a hearing on his nomination, or allow a       vote for 293 days. Antonin Scalia died in February 2016.       President Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a respected D.C.       Circuit Judge with bipartisan support, in March 2016. In the       case of Justice Ginsburg's vacancy in 2020, we are about 40       days away from a general election, and early and absentee       voting has already begun in several states. By contrast, in       2016, the formal presidential primary elections had just       begun to occur when Justice Scalia died.    Our colleagues spoke up then and said: Look, 4 years ago, our  Republican colleagues said not enough time, leave it up to the voters;  we would do this whether it is a Democrat or Republican.   Let me quote from one of our colleagues, the Republican leader, Mitch  McConnell. This is his quote on the floor of the Senate.         Mr. President, the next Justice could fundamentally alter       the direction of the Supreme Court and have a profound impact       on our country, so of course--of course the American people       should have a say in the Court's direction. . . . As Chairman       Grassley and I declared weeks ago and reiterated personally       to President Obama, the Senate will continue to observe the       Biden rule so that the American people have a voice in this       momentous decision. The American people may well elect a       President who decides to nominate Judge Garland for Senate       consideration. The next President may also nominate someone       very different. Either way, our view is this: Give the people       a voice in filling this vacancy. . . . As we continue working       on issues like these, the American people are perfectly       capable of having their say on this issue. So [let's give]       them a voice. Let's let the American people decide.    Senator Mitch McConnell.   We have the McConnell rule, established by the Republican leader.  Let's follow the McConnell rule and let the American people pick the  next President and Senate so they can weigh in on this decision just as  Senator McConnell argued in 2016 with President Obama's nominee,  Merrick Garland, for Justice Scalia's seat.   Let the Senate honor Justice Ginsburg's legacy by continuing to fight  for the rights she fought for in her entire career, both as a litigator  and circuit judge and, finally, as a Supreme Court Justice.   Let us honor Justice Ginsburg's dying wish: ``My most fervent wish is  that I will not be replaced until a new President is installed.''   I yield the floor.
