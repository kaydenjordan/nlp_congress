 Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today  to honor the life, service, and sacrifice of a hero from the Third  District of the great State of Arkansas, Fayetteville Police Officer  Stephen Carr.   On Saturday, December 7, Officer Carr was preparing to begin another  shift of keeping his community safe when he was cowardly ambushed and  executed, most likely because of the uniform he wore.   We have lost one of our finest law enforcement officers, someone who  dedicated his life to serving Arkansas and defending others. Officer  Carr made it his mission to make our State a safer place for everyone.   Officer Carr served as a protector, promoted peace and justice, and  demonstrated the valor and integrity that the uniform embodies.   Our hearts are broken as we grieve this unthinkable loss. Today, we  vow never to forget his memory and pledge to honor his life of service  forever. I join all of Arkansas this morning in the mourning of the  loss of Officer Stephen Carr. Our prayers are with his family, his  loved ones, and the Fayetteville Police Department.   I also recognize Corporal Seay Floyd and Officer Natalie Eucce, who  immediately engaged and eliminated the suspect.   Our police deserve our deepest respect and gratitude. While they know  the risks they face are greater than ever, they refuse to shy away from  their mission to protect and serve.   Stephen Carr was a native of The Woodlands, Texas. Mr. Speaker, my  friend and colleague Representative Kevin Brady would have been on this  floor this morning to offer his condolences to the family, a family  that he knew personally, but because of a markup in the Ways and Means  Committee, he is unable to be on the floor with me this morning.   Mr. Speaker, if it please the House, I would like to ask for a moment  of silence for Officer Carr, who will be laid to rest tomorrow, and, in  fact, for all of our heroes who have faced the end of watch.                            ____________________
