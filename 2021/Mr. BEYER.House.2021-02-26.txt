 Madam Speaker, we have a choice tonight. Our American  children are hungry, the recovery is stalling, and a million new people  file for unemployment every week.   We can do our jobs, pass a national vaccination plan, safely reopen  our schools, send relief checks to those in need, support the  unemployed, and protect American jobs. Or we can let them fend for  themselves and slowly scratch their way back to health at great human  cost.   I choose relief, recovery, and progress.   Madam Speaker, my first job: In 1966, $1.25 an hour, minimum wage.   Sixteen times this Congress has chosen to increase the minimum wage,  and every time there was a CBO score or a chamber of commerce or a  conservative economist who talked about the shrinkage of low-wage jobs.  But if we were persuaded by this job-loss mirage, we would never raise  the minimum wage. And I refuse to believe that this is American  exceptionalism.                                time  2130
