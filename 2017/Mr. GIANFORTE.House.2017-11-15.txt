 Mr. Speaker, for 110 years, the Lower Yellowstone  Intake Project has provided a dependable supply of water to over 58,000  acres of family farms in Montana and North Dakota. It has created over  10,000 acres of wildlife habitat.   To protect the endangered pallid sturgeon, Congress funded a bypass  channel and weir improvement so that the fish could circumvent the  diversion that had been there for 110 years. The proposed construction  would also protect regional groundwater, the environment, and  agricultural communities.   Unfortunately, a U.S. district judge blocked the project this summer  because, as he claims, it does nothing for the sturgeon. His ruling to  halt construction does nothing to help the sturgeon. His ruling does  nothing to help the communities that rely on the project's irrigation  water.   I urge the Army Corps of Engineers to move forward with the work on  the Lower Yellowstone Intake Project. The completion of this project is  urgent to protect species' habitats and agricultural activities in  Montana.                            ____________________
