 Mr. Speaker, today is Take Your Son or  Daughter to Work Day. While my three sons are grown, I have the  privilege of having a friend of mine, Seth Parish, with me today.   Seth is 12 years old and hails from Maryland. He is actively involved  in baseball, playing center outfield, ice hockey, and has recently  joined the Civil Air Patrol where he learns about aerospace and  survival skills.   Our schedule is busy today as the House Agriculture Committee held a  2022 farm bill review hearing. Seth joined me for that, and he is also  joining me for this speech today.   In 2009, Seth's dad was serving in the Army and lost his life a month  before Seth was born. This is the fourth year Seth has joined me  through a program called Tuesday's Children. Tuesday's Children uses  its experience and expertise to help our military families work through  their own losses.   Mr. Speaker, I hope Seth is enjoying being my shadow again this year,  and I can't wait to see all that he can accomplish.                            ____________________
