 Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Disabled  American Veterans--DAV--organization for its commitment to serving  wartime-disabled veterans since its formation 100 years ago. As a  member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am grateful for  the positive impact of the DAV on disabled veterans in South Dakota and  across the Nation.   Founded on September 25, 1920, the DAV has grown to become the  largest wartime veterans service organization in the United States,  with more than 1 million members in 1,344 chapters around the country.   The DAV helps disabled veterans and their families work through the  bureaucracy of the Federal and local governments to make sure they  receive the benefits they deserve. Additionally, the organization  operates a nationwide transportation network, providing free  transportation for disabled veterans to Department of Veterans Affairs  hospitals and clinics.   We are truly blessed to have the DAV organization in South Dakota and  in the United States. They give their time, talent, knowledge, and  friendship to disabled veterans who need it most. We are thankful for  their 100 years of service to the veteran community.   May God continue to bless the DAV and everyone they serve.   Thank you.                            ____________________
