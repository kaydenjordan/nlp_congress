 Mr. Speaker, since President Biden has  taken office, he has tried to increase taxes on everyone. His Build  Back Better Act--or as I like to call it, build back broke--is the  latest example of his radical tax and spend agenda.   This bill includes $4.5 trillion in new spending, $1.5 trillion in  new taxes, and will cause $3 trillion in new debt.   I introduced two amendments in this legislation, one that would  ensure Americans still have access to lifesaving cures and one that  would ensure Members of Congress do not benefit from Democrats' SALT  deduction. Democrats rejected both.   If passed, this reconciliation package will negatively affect all  facets of our day-to-day lives. It will make energy more expensive, tax  small family businesses, ship American jobs overseas, and make the  inflation crisis worse.
