 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the Virgin  Islands for her leadership on this issue and for making it a priority  and giving it the urgency that those under TPS status deserve.   Mr. Speaker, first of all, of course, I want to extend my condolences  to the families whose loved ones were murdered in Sutherland Springs,  Texas, while attending worship service.   I also extend my condolences to my colleague from Texas, Eddie  Bernice Johnson, who is mourning the death of her sister.   Mr. Speaker, after college--it was a lot of years ago, but I remember  it like it was yesterday--I worked as a social worker, working with  families in need of emergency services, in need of shelter, in need of  food, and in need of medical care. I also worked with foster care  children.   Mr. Speaker, you may know that I also spent over 20 years as a law  enforcement officer. As such, the preservation of human life was my  number one priority. Saving lives was first. But then we also wanted to  improve the quality of life for persons living and working in our  community.   Mr. Speaker, the quality of life matters also. That is what we are  here to talk about tonight as Members of Congress: improving the  quality of life for families who desperately need our help.   Approximately 50,000 Haitians hold TPS status, and 32,500 of them  live in Florida. 18,800 U.S.-born children in Florida have Haitian  parents who are TPS holders.   How did we get here, Mr. Speaker?   As you know, an earthquake--not planned, not expected--left thousands  dead and resulted in the total collapse of Port-au-Prince's  infrastructure. A few years before the earthquake, I participated in a  mission trip to Port-au-Prince, Haiti. We worked with children and  families from a local church in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. That church was  totally destroyed by the earthquake.   The earthquake displaced 1.5 million Haitians within their own  country, destroyed more than 100,000 homes, and damaged nearly 200,000  more. The number of schools that were destroyed in Port-au-Prince alone  is unbelievable. Over 55,000 Haitians who lost their homes in the  earthquake are still living in 31 camps for internally displaced  persons, unable to leave.   We are here tonight to talk about improving the quality of life for  persons, for families, who desperately need our help.                                time  2015    This crisis is not over. In April of this year, heavy rains caused  flooding and landslides. According to the Haitian officials, an  estimated 80 percent of spring harvest may have been destroyed.   This crisis is not over. Since September of 2016, damage from  Hurricane Matthew and recent rains have compounded food insecurity  experienced by an estimated 3.2 million people in Haiti, not to mention  the devastation caused by Irma and Hurricane Maria. Hurricane Matthew  also exacerbated the food insecurity crisis that already existed,  placing 2.4 million Haitians, 32 percent of the population, in the  grips of an acute food insecurity crisis.   Mr. Speaker, forcing the return of 50,000 people to Haiti would  disrupt any meaningful effort to recover. As you know, in May, the  Department of Homeland Security redesignated Haiti for 6 months of  temporary protective status rather than the full 18 months requested by  the Government of Haiti. DHS' decision, obviously, did not reflect the  reality on the ground.   Regardless of how you might feel about the policy, TPS holders are  perhaps the most vetted, legally present, and work-authorized community  in our country. They have submitted to numerous criminal background  checks every 18 months. Americans with temporary protective status are  hardworking individuals who are contributing to our economy, our  communities, and our industries. Just check the numbers.   Mr. Speaker, the only strategic and humane decision is to fully  extend Haiti's TPS designation for 18 months by the November 23  deadline. Working to improve the quality of life for families who  desperately need our help, that is the promise of America, and I pray  that America keeps its promise.
