 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, this amendment eliminates the funding for the  Delaware River Basin Commission, the funding that is from the Federal  Government.   Unfortunately, this bill provides nearly three quarters of a million  dollars to the Delaware River Basin Commission, meaning that since  1998, the Federal Government has provided funding of some sort to this  commission full of unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats that have  unilaterally, in this case, instituted a hydraulic fracturing ban for a  portion of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, literally stripping away  the property and mineral rights from Pennsylvanians in direct  contravention of the will of the legislature.   These people aren't elected by anybody. They are not accountable to  anybody. Most people have no idea who the people on this commission  even are.   The result is a prohibition on the development of critical shale  plays in eastern Pennsylvania that can bring desperately needed natural  gas to the market and the unconstitutional taking of mineral rights of  the people of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Americans are having  unelected bureaucrats take their rights away.   It is an attack on Pennsylvania energy and American energy. At a time  when residential natural gas prices are near record highs, it creates  significant inflation, cost-of-living increases for our constituents,  and empowers our enemies abroad.   Now, instead of taking action to stop this unconstitutional seizure  of State authority, as my other amendment that was not made in order  would have done, or better yet, dissolving the compact altogether, this  bill, as it currently exists, rewards the radical commissioners with  money from the very taxpayers the Delaware River Basin Commission is  attacking.   Providing funds to such an out-of-control, radical commission is a  step in the wrong direction that incentivizes others like it to follow.   This amendment that I am offering would rescind this money and move  it to the spending reduction account, ensuring that we do not further  incentivize this commission to attack American energy and the rights of  Pennsylvania while trying to pay off some of our $33 trillion of debt.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and send a  message to these unelected bureaucrats by supporting this amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, my colleague says that it costs mere  pennies. These mere pennies add up to mere dollars. These mere dollars  add up to thousands, eventually millions and eventually billions, which  is where we are right now.   It talks about return on investments. It talks about it but it  doesn't say what the return on investment is, because there isn't any  return on investment.   It provides immense value, it is claimed. Yet, the value cannot be  described. It cannot be quantified. No one knows what the value is.   Will the Delaware River Basin go away if the Commission were not  there? Are you saying without the Commission there would be no safe  drinking water?   The actions that this commission has taken are unfounded,  unjustified, and are happening nowhere else. Yet, there is clean  drinking water across the rest of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania  without this commission banning public and private activity.   My colleague says it is necessary funding. Necessary for what? What  are we getting for this? Somebody is getting something, but the people  of Pennsylvania, they are getting the shaft.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I would say I dispute the claim that they  work in collaboration.   The Delaware River Basin Commission itself, in contravention of the  Pennsylvania legislature, has banned the practice all over northern  Pennsylvania. Hydraulic fracturing; banned it in contravention of the  will and the wishes of the elected members of the Pennsylvania  legislature.   I would say this as well: The Corps of Engineers can do this work  whether there is a commission or not, or whether this money is here or  not. The Corps of Engineers has wide latitude to do that work all  across the country. They don't need our involvement.   Finally, the individual States involved in this compact, that is why  they got into the compact. They charge people in the individual States  all kinds of permit fees and regulatory fees to pay for this  Commission. Yet, somehow the Commission can't survive without more  money from the Federal Government. It is ridiculous, it is duplicative,  it is costly, it is unaffordable, it is unnecessary, and it needs to  end.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment strikes $35 million in  funding for the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations.   For those unfamiliar with this office, according to its website, it  accelerates the market adoption of clean energy technologies and fills  a critical innovation gap on the path to 100 percent clean energy by  2035 and net zero emissions by 2050.   I am going to characterize it a different way. Since the real market,  the private market won't do it, you are going to pay for it under force  by your taxes so that you can have less reliable energy as soon as  possible, and we can be less energy independent. That is what it does,  courtesy of your Federal Government.   It funds projects like long-duration energy storage and distributed  energy systems to support the electric grid for electric vehicles,  which are also being subsidized by your Federal Government under force  of penalty of you not paying your taxes. It is astounding.   The Democrats continue to push this technology when the drawbacks of  this so-called clean energy technology are clear.   The actual grid is being powered by solar and wind energy sources  that are inherently unreliable and don't work when the Sun is not  shining and the wind is not blowing.   Battery technology storage is not there, and of course, all that  stuff that I just talked about comes from China, and oh, by the way,  built with slave labor, whether that is in Turkistan or whether that is  in the Congo.   Your tax dollars are supporting it under penalty of law. Try not  paying your taxes and see what happens then.   Vehicles powered by this grid are built largely using slave labor  like I just talked about and our reliance on the Communist Party of  China since they control all the necessary components in the mineral  supply chains.   Not that we don't have them in America. They say they are rare earth  minerals. Mr. Chairman, they are not rare.   We just can't mine them in America because the left doesn't allow  that, so now we have got to buy them from China. That is another story.   Vehicles powered by this grid are built largely, like I said, using  slave labor and the supply chains that go with them.   These vehicles have limited range. Their lithium batteries often  catch fire. Those fires are more difficult to extinguish than  traditional fires.   This office that I am talking about is also managing $2.5 billion for  carbon capture facilities and greenhouse gas monitoring technology.   Mr. Chair, if these technologies were so great, why isn't the market  already adopting and innovating without taxpayer-funded handouts?   My friends on the other side of the aisle will tell you these are  critical investments, and they are not going to happen if the Federal  Government doesn't do them. If we don't take your tax dollars and spend  it on this, it ain't going to happen.   My goodness. Thank goodness that this country didn't become the  greatest country on the planet without the Federal Government  subsidizing all this stuff.   I don't know how Thomas Edison would have made it. I don't know how  Ford Motor Company would have made it without the Federal Government.  Somehow they did it, Mr. Chair.   I appreciate that the chairman did not approve additional funds for  these clean demonstration projects, but my amendment strikes all the  funds for this office.   Mr. Chairman, I urge support of my amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I certainly respect the good gentleman from  Tennessee, and I thank him for the time.   I don't know. It seems like a lot of money still remaining for  project management oversight. That doesn't seem to be billions of  dollars' worth of spending to me; maybe millions, but not billions.    As far as advanced reactor research, I am proud to say that in the  district that I represent, some of the fusion reactor research that is  being done in France is being produced in the district I represent,  which is awesome, but we don't need to be paying for it. France is  paying for it, and we are providing some expertise and some material.   Oh, by the way, the good gentleman from Tennessee, much of the home  of nuclear fission and nuclear energy is in the United States of  America. God bless America. I think it is awesome. When have we built a  nuclear reactor in the United States of America? I know the district  that I represent just shut one down.   We are paying for all this research. Tell me where it is. What does  it provide? What does it produce? It doesn't produce anything.   If it was building nuclear reactors, maybe I could see it, but it  seems to me we are paying for it and putting the research on the shelf,  or worse yet, giving it to France.   Mr. Chairman, I don't care what it costs. It ought to end. I urge  adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment cuts $35 million from this  bill for the Appalachian Regional Commission, lowering the funding  level in this bill to $165 million.   The IIJA provided the Appalachian Regional Commission with an  advanced appropriation of $200 million a year--the entirety of its  authorization level for fiscal year 2022 through 2026, meaning every  dollar provided under this bill is more than the authorization level.  We authorize things here and then we pay for them. It is authorized at  a lower level, and we are paying much more.   In other words, under this amendment the ARC would receive $365  million for the fiscal year rather than $400 million provided by this  underlying bill. Even with this minimal cut under this amendment, the  program funding is still extremely bloated, and its effectiveness  remains unclear, as do all the regional commissions.   Moreover, this Commission's programs are duplicative of other Federal  economic development programs and better addressed by State and local  levels. In fact, the fiscal year 2018 budget justification identified  that the Appalachian Regional Commission failed to show a strong link  between grants and a positive impact on the communities they serve.   Worse, this year, the Commission's inspector general identified the  massive increase in the Commission's funding over recent years as a  threat to its variability to evaluate grant proposals, measure program  performance, and conduct appropriate oversight.   When we were talking about the last one, we needed the money for  oversight. This one, we have got so much money that they can't oversee  it. This is your Federal Government at work here. The spike in funding  threatens to worsen an already tenuous link between funding and  success.   We simply must bring the funding level for the ARC, the Appalachian  Regional Commission, down to ensure that it has the capacity to ensure  it meets its mission.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, it just so happens that I had a hearing  about a week ago on the Appalachian Regional Commission and all the  other commissions. It is interesting that this has been around since  the 1960s. There was a map of the Appalachian region, of which the home  that I reside in looks on the south mountain of the Appalachian  mountain range. I live right in the center of this thing.   What was interesting to me of the map that I looked at provided by  the Commission since the 1960s, showed counties that had reached  attainment. Well, none of them had reached attainment. It has been  around since the 1960s. All the ones that hadn't reached attainment in  the 1960s still haven't reached attainment in 2023. We are spending all  this money, and we are not getting anything for it. Well, we are  getting some things for it. You might be able to get a theater in your  community, reconstructed with the help of the Federal Government, or a  trail, which is awesome. These are great programs, and I am not here to  argue that they are not.   What I am arguing is two things. It is not the job of the Federal  Government, number one. These are things done by local communities and  States.                                time  1945    Two, this is above the authorization. This commission was authorized  funding. I don't dispute that. However, we are spending money above the  authorization, and I do dispute that because we are $30-some trillion  in debt with nothing in sight except more debt.   People say that we can't cut anything, that there is nowhere to cut.  Well, we authorized this. This body authorized this at a lower level,  and then we appropriated at a higher level.   When you don't have any more money, when you are borrowing money to  pay your bills, it seems to me that it would be easy to say that we  will just pull back a little here, just a little, and we will go to  what is authorized, which is still a lot, hundreds of millions of  dollars. I guess that is going to be a problem here, though.   This has no Federal nexus whatsoever. I will tell you, there are nice  people working here. They want to do great things for their community.  However, this is a boondoggle. This is spending money where other money  can be spent and is being spent. This is a duplication of services.  [[Page H5093]]    Sooner or later, this town is going to have to realize the taxpayer  doesn't have any more money to be bled out of their pockets to spend on  things that are spent elsewhere for the same projects, local, State, et  cetera.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment cuts the funding to the Delta  Regional Authority by $6.1 million, back to the FY19 level.   In FY17, the Obama administration sought to cut funding for the Delta  Regional Authority by $3 million. The FY18, FY19, FY20, and FY21  budgets all sought to eliminate funding for the Delta Regional  Authority, identifying it as duplicative of other Federal economic  development programs.   Mr. Chair, just like I said before on the last one, it is the same  thing here. I just had a hearing on it. These folks sat in front of me  and made the same arguments.   The FY21 budget pointed out that the Delta Regional Authority, like  others, is set aside for special geographic designations rather than  applied across the country based on objective criteria indicating local  areas and levels of distress that, again, don't seem to ever be  addressed even though we spend millions of dollars.   We are $33 trillion in the hole. I don't know if you looked at the  economics and the financials of just the last couple of months, how  much more we have gone into debt in just the last couple of months.  Something has to shock the conscience of this Congress because it is  shocking the conscience of the American people who can't afford  groceries, gasoline, car payments, or credit card payments. Heaven  forbid you have to buy a new car. Heaven forbid you try to buy a new  home.   We simply can't continue to allow for the rapid growth of parochial  commissions that duplicate, literally just duplicate, other Federal  programs undeterred. Regardless of the duplication of the Federal  programs, most of the stuff looks like it is local programs or State  programs--again, worthy things. The question is, is there a Federal  nexus here? There is not in many cases. There is poor oversight, and we  don't have the money to do it.   Finally, this is not a partisan issue. Democratic Presidents and  Republican Presidents have all called for either the abolishment or the  reduction of these commissions. Both have done it. It is not a partisan  issue. It is a fiscal issue. It is a responsibility issue.   These things need to be dealt with. State and locals should do it if  that is what they are. We don't have the money at the Federal level  anymore for that.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, in closing, certainly, I congratulate the  gentlewoman and her great State for the success of all the House of  Representatives today and their contribution.   On this occasion, though, I must disagree. As I said, I just had a  hearing with the Delta Regional Authority present, and she is right, it  targets hundreds of communities, as do all of these commissions. They  target hundreds of communities.   One of the things that was fascinating to me was I asked for the  metrics by which anything is measured. What measure of success does  anyone have? Is there some standard? Is there some way to know whether  all of these millions of dollars that are being spent actually get us  anywhere, actually fix anything, actually do anything other than: We  made sure the grants all got out, and we helped with the grant writing.  We fixed up the sidewalk. We fixed up the theater. We provided some  healthcare.   Those are all awesome things that are all being provided by someone  else, by the way.   What was the metric by which they measured their success? Close your  eyes. What do you see? That is what I got back. Nothing. There is no  measure of success here.   Mr. Chair, this is well intended. It is well meaning. However, it is  unaffordable and unnecessary.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment reduces funding for the  Denali Commission by $2 million to the FY19 level.   The Denali Commission's mission for providing job training and other  economic development services in rural Alaska can be better served by  the 29 other Federal programs in which it duplicates the very same  efforts.   The Obama administration sought to eliminate funding for the  commission in FY12 because it was duplicative back then and did not  select projects based on competition or merit. Say it ain't so, but it  is so.   In 2013, the inspector general for the Denali Commission called for  the elimination of the program. Some people say: Perry, you are just  mean. You just don't understand. You just don't want to help poor  people or rural people.   I came from a house with no running water, no electricity, and no  plumbing. We had an outhouse out back. There was no insulation. There  was no heat in it. The roads weren't paved. Somehow, I made it to  Congress. It wasn't the Federal Government's job to fix my mom's house  or get me to work.   In 2013, the inspector general for the commission called for the  elimination of the program, like I said, stating that he recommended  that Congress put its money elsewhere. I am happy to take his  recommendation.   The Trump administration, likewise, sought to eliminate the  commission in FY18, FY19, FY20, and FY21. It seems imprudent to  continually fund yet another parochial commission in the face of two  administrations--one Democratic, one Republican--and the inspector  general's recommendation that we cease funding.   At a bare minimum, we should pass this amendment to keep the Denali  Commission's funding flat at its pre-COVID-19 level and not allow for  its continued growth. I am not asking to eliminate it. I am saying, oh  my goodness, two administrations said it ought to be eliminated. The  inspector general said it should be gone. I am not even taking their  advice on that. I am just saying, let's save a little money here  because we have this debt we can't afford.   Mr. Chairman, I have been to places where the country could no longer  afford the debt that it had. You walk through shells of buildings just  abandoned, walked away from by the workers who were there, that were  once funded by their government. I have watched that in this town,  right across the river at St. Elizabeth's, where they just shut the  doors, couldn't afford it anymore, and walked away.   It is a tragic sight, but if we are going to keep going, it is not  going to be just this place that does it. It is going to be all across  the country. If we are going to be able to afford the things that we  want, we are going to have to make some difficult choices.   We are taking in $5 trillion this year. We are spending $7.2  trillion. I am not a mathematician, but somehow that is not adding up  to me.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I will close quickly here. I sure appreciate  the good gentleman from Tennessee. He has a lot to work with, and he  has a lot of competing interests here. It is not easy. We certainly can  appreciate that.   I want to point out that this is a regional commission, a regional  commission like the other ones, like the Appalachian Regional  Commission, like the Delta Regional Authority. Only this one exists in  only one place, in Alaska. It is a wonderful place. Alaska is a great  place, part of the United States of America, but tax dollars from  across the country, including Pennsylvania, Tennessee, or Ohio,  shouldn't go to pay for local projects that can be handled by State and  local governments, especially when you are borrowing money to do it. We  are out of money. We are out.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                                time  2000     Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, as the designee of Mr. Norman, I have an  amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, apparently, I was the reasonable one in the  room because this amendment offered by Mr. Norman would eliminate  funding for the Denali Commission, and I can support that as well.   The Denali Commission is one of seven regional commissions that help  direct Federal funds to State and local projects. However, unlike other  commissions, the Denali Commission serves only one State--Alaska.   This has led some, including the Office of the Inspector General for  the Denali Commission, to question the need for the commission since  the Federal funds handled by the commission could easily be distributed  to the State of Alaska and other local entities without going through  the step of yet one more bureaucracy.   After all, State and local governments are more knowledgeable and  better equipped than the Federal Government to address the needs of  local communities. I think we all would recognize that.   Both the Government Accountability Office and Congressional Budget  Office have raised concerns about the need for the Denali Commission,  as have I.   Eliminating funding for the Denali Commission was also suggested, as  you know, by the Obama administration and the Trump administration. At  a time when our growing national debt has surpassed $33 trillion, we  cannot continue to use taxpayer dollars to fund wasteful, unnecessary,  and duplicative programs. With the Denali Commission's own OIG, Office  of Inspector General, highlighting how wasteful the agency is, why  don't we just listen and eliminate this unnecessary Federal agency.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.  [[Page H5095]]         Mr. Chair, I thank the kind gentleman from Tennessee for  averring or implying that I am the reasonable one in the debate here,  and I would, on behalf of the gentleman from South Carolina, urge  adoption.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise to offer this amendment to reduce  funding for the Northern Border Regional Commission, or the NBRC, to  fiscal year 2019 levels.   Like other regional commissions, the NBRC provides economic  development assistance to projects in various States, in this case,  Maine, New Hampshire, New York, and Vermont.   These commissions simply serve as a slush fund, though, for parochial  and regional projects with little to no national nexus as described in  the other ones.   Let's take a look at some of the funded programs taken from the 2022  annual report, which is the latest report available: 304,000 to  purchase the sound system for an auditorium in New Hampshire; over  350,000 to expand rail yard capacity in upstate New York; and another  $350,000 for a sailing center on Lake Champlain.   I am sure they are awesome projects. I am sure their communities love  them. I just don't understand why people in Ohio, Tennessee,  Pennsylvania, Texas, California, Georgia--you name it--are paying for  this, especially when they can't afford the bills they already have as  evidenced by a $33 trillion debt and a $2.2 trillion deficit this year.   Furthermore, the Biden administration's aim to inject their misguided  diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility, and climate-related  goals into these projects are not only unaffordable, they are just  completely unnecessary.   Instead of pandering to special interest groups, we must pare back  these wasteful programs that only serve as a boondoggle for a limited  slice of America. This amendment does not zero out the commission's  funding; it simply reduces the funding to pre-COVID, pre-Biden spending  levels, which everybody on this side of the aisle voted against last  December.   If you were against them last December, we are getting pretty close  to this December, but I don't think a whole lot has changed. If you  were against them then, you should be against them now.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I agree with my good friend from Tennessee. I  agree with the gentlewoman, my friend from Ohio. It does seek to create  jobs. That is awesome.   It is not the role of the Federal Government, number one. Number two,  it is unaffordable. Number three, we have no way to measure the  success.   Do you know how I know? Because I asked the folks that run these  things. I asked them. What metric do you use to measure the success by  which you use this money and what do we get out of it?   I received blank stares, unfortunately.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I rise to offer this amendment to reduce  funding for the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission, the SCRC, to  fiscal year 2019.   I don't want to leave anybody out here. I listened to them all. Yet  again, this commission serves as a duplicative slush fund for parochial  interests for projects in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North  Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia.   Literally, by the way, in counties bordering Washington, D.C. We are  talking about distressed counties, right? Some of the richest counties  in the country right here are included in this regional commission.   From FY 2010 to FY 2020, the SCRC received $250,000 annually, all  without having an appointed Federal co-chair. Did anybody get that?   Nobody was in charge but to get money. It is awesome. I guess that  only happens in the Federal Government.   Now, after a co-chair was appointed in December 2021--unfortunately,  whether you like it or not, just conveniently related to an influential  politician in this body--that number is now a whopping $20 million in  this bill.   Now, I am sure there is no coincidence. I just want to rely on  everybody's integrity here, but there is absolutely no reason for the  dramatic increase in funding, especially when these projects fund both  projects with no national nexus like electric vehicle charging  stations.   If you want to have them in your community, God bless you. That is  awesome. Go pay for them. It is not the Federal Government's job to pay  for that any more than it is the Federal Government's job to pay for  your local gas station.  [[Page H5096]]    How about stormwater management? It is an important issue. I come  from Pennsylvania, we have got a lot of stormwater. I am not asking the  Federal Government to deal with it. We should deal with that at home,  as well as green infrastructure, according to the SCRC's 2023 through  2027 strategic plan.   Our constituents do not have money for these projects that have no  impact on their lives and, in many cases, drive up inflationary  spending.   Oh, sure, they have an impact where you live if you live in one of  these places, but if you don't, you get to pay anyhow. This is why we  have State governments. This is why we have local governments.   The Federal Government is supposed to be there, obviously, but it is  not the job of the Federal Government. Again, I ask my colleagues to  consider reducing, not ending, the funding for this regional  commission.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I, again, say this commission includes Alabama,  Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and  Virginia. I have been to every one of them. Many of the residents of  Pennsylvania are moving to those States because they are doing pretty  well.   We lose population compared to these States every 10 years, which is  why we lose a seat in Congress every 10 years. We are spending money in  Pennsylvania on these States. We are not spending in Pennsylvania; we  are spending in these States, so our residents then move to these  States for all the great things.   When I asked the regional commissioner how much money has been spent  in the counties surrounding Washington, D.C.--because, as you recall,  Virginia is included--how much money is spent on the counties right  around Washington, D.C., some of the most wealthy counties in the  country? I couldn't get the answer to that either. I don't know if they  don't have the answer or they don't want to give me the answer, but  that is unacceptable. That is unacceptable. The counties around  Washington, D.C., can afford the amenities they have and they don't  have to ask all these other States to pay for them.    Mr. Chair, I urge adoption, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  2015     Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I don't want to leave anybody out. We are  getting to the end here. This amendment would be to have the funding  for the Southwest Border Regional Commission.   Now, this Commission, which only had its first chairman confirmed in  2022 and only was funded starting in fiscal year 2021, funds projects  in the southern border regions of Arizona, California, New Mexico, and  Texas.   Incidentally, the first chairman was previously the Director of  Economic Development and Special Initiatives for Senator Martin  Heinrich, who continues a theme of politically connected chairman of  these regional commissions, just to let you know.   I know that folks on both sides of the aisle care about the border. I  believe that. However, the answer to solving border problems is to  actually enforce our Nation's immigration laws, not to give $5 million  to a commission that has not published a strategic plan and does not  even appear to have a website.   I would think they could afford to have a website with $5 million.   The Commission received $250,000 in FY21 but is now being funded at  $5 million in this bill for FY24 for literally no results.   Now $250,000 is a lot of money where I come from, and $5 million is  even more. I can see inflation; I could see the cost of living going  up. The people that I represent, their grocery costs are 20 percent up;  fuel costs, electricity costs, everything they pay for is up, but not  $250,000 to $5 million. That is a little bit more of a jump than  everybody is used to.   Again, this amendment simply strikes this figure in half to a still  exorbitant $2.5 million.   Mr. Chair, I urge support of this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I certainly appreciate my good friend from  Arizona. We are sure happy to have him here, as well as the gentleman  from Tennessee, and the work that they have done in collaboration with  my friends across the aisle. None of this is easy, but only in  Washington can you go from $250,000 to $2.5 million and still call it a  cut because you didn't go to $5 million, which is what we are talking  about.   I am not saying $250,000 is too much, but I am saying $5 million is  too much, and saying we should spend $2.5 million, which quite honestly  for me is too much, but I get it.   To the gentleman from Arizona's point, he is absolutely right, their  States are being ravaged and destroyed by the Federal Government's  refusal and obstinance to follow the law and allowing people to flow  across the border illegally into their communities and destroy their  communities.   This cannot be afforded. It can't be afforded by them and it can't be  afforded by anybody else. The solution is not to spend more money  there, to provide more services and encourage more people to come in  illegally while this administration refuses to enforce the law.    I think the gentleman would probably agree with at least that  sentiment at some point. I understand he is trying to do right by his  citizens, and he should. The best way to do right by his citizens, and  he has no control of this, neither does anybody in this body at this  moment, is to actually enforce the law. The President can do that and  clear up this whole disagreement on this side of the aisle and on that  side of the aisle, but that is not going to happen any time soon.   You know what else is not going to happen any time soon, Mr.  Chairman? We are not going to quit putting our country in debt and  bankrupting it. We are taking in $5 trillion in revenue this year but  we are going to spend $7.2.   While my good friend says this will have no impact on the overall  cost of the bill, where I come from, $250,000 is a lot of money, $2.5  million is a huge amount of money, and $5 million is an obscene amount  of money that most people don't have. While it might have a little  impact in this town, it has a huge impact in my town.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I don't want to leave anybody out here on  the abuse and the waste, and I know I am going to sound like a broken  record so I will try and keep it short.   First, the Great Lakes Authority has only been authorized since 2022.  It still does not have a Federal co-chair, it has no website, it has no  programs funded. Yet strangely, it is still receiving Federal dollars  to the tune of $5 million for projects supposedly in the watershed  regions of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio,  Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Yes, I said Pennsylvania, and I am from  Pennsylvania, but when you can't afford things and you are wasting  money, I don't care where you are from, you have to say something about  it.   Mr. Chair, we have seen how the other commissions have gone.  President Trump urged the elimination of three of them, and President  Obama recommended cuts and elimination for the Denali Commission. With  that level of bipartisan criticism of the existing commissions, I don't  see why we need to dig ourselves even deeper with yet another one. I  mean, there is not a lot we agree on in this town, but apparently there  is some agreement on this. We ought to try and forge ahead with that  agreement.   I know people in this building will scoff at the difference between  $2.5 million and $5 million, but like I said, where I come from, $2.5  million or $5 million is a lot of money. It might not be to the  President who buys beach homes with cash and all that stuff, but where  I come from, that is a lot of money. That $2.5 million should not be  going toward a commission that cannot even begin operations without a  Senate-confirmed Federal co-chair. It shouldn't be going for that.  There is nobody there to administer it.   Furthermore, all of us here know it is not going to stop at $5  million. This is just the beginning, Mr. Chairman. This Commission,  like the rest, will balloon up to tens of millions of dollars if  Congress, using the power of its purse, does not put its foot down.  This won't be the only commission. I have been through them all  tonight. Every other State and region is going to say, well, shoot,  they have one. They have one over there. They have one down there. Why  don't we have one? It is going to go.   Again, I would just remind everybody that we are just a little bit in  debt--just a little bit--$2.2 trillion this year, $33 trillion overall.   Mr. Chair, somebody has to say no. Somebody has to say no.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I understand and recognize the good,  intended efforts, the heartfelt efforts of the committee members and on  both sides of the aisle, certainly the Members representing the States  involved. I understand and I recognize that, and I think they mean to  do well.  [[Page H5098]]    There is nobody there to administer this. There is nobody present,  but we are going to give them the money anyhow. We don't have any money  to give, Mr. Chairman. We are borrowing money to give to a program with  nobody there to administer it on projects that we haven't even seen  yet. I don't know about you, but that seems like, to borrow an old  phrase, putting the cart before the horse, or something like that.   People are going to say, well, we have to have the money so we can  set it up. Okay, fair enough. The problem is we don't have the money.   Again, I don't mean to be a broken record here--I know I sound like  one--we don't have any money, number one.   Number two, these are State and local projects. If you are showing me  one that crosses State lines, and building a highway between  Pennsylvania and Ohio or something like that, then we have a  conversation going.   Now, there are already agencies and administrations to do that--we  talked about that before--multiple agencies doing the same things, not  just a couple, a couple dozen, but if that is not enough for you, just  go with the fact that your constituents, your bosses, my bosses, can't  afford this.   Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
