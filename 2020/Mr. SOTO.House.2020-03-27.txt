 Mr. Speaker, as I rise here today, the United States has  more coronavirus cases than any nation on the planet. This is an  unprecedented crisis that requires an unprecedented response.   This bipartisan bill is a promise that help is on the way, that help  is on the way for families with $1,200 checks and $2,400 for married  families for food assistance. For the unemployed, help is on the way  with $600 in unemployment benefits on top of State benefits.   Help is on the way for our seniors and our veterans of financial  assistance. Help is on the way for small businesses through payroll  grants and other costs.   For first responders and hospitals, help is on the way to confront  this crisis. To our farmers and to our students, help is on the way.   It is time to pass this bipartisan bill and send a message to central  Florida and every American across every corner of this Nation that  there is help because help and hope are on the way.
