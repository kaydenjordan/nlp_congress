 Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for President  Biden's nomination of the uniquely qualified General Lloyd J. Austin  III (U.S. Army, Ret.) to serve as Secretary of Defense. Today, we are  debating whether in the case of Gen. Austin's confirmation there should  be a waiver of the requirement that former military officers be  separated from active service for seven years before serving as Defense  Secretary. Civilian control of the military is foundational to our  democratic republic, and any action that could be perceived as  affecting that principle must be carefully considered.   I do have reservations. If such an exception becomes a pattern, it  may become a routine practice. Yet we find ourselves in times that  [[Page H219]]  are anything but routine, and I am convinced that current circumstances  warrant this waiver.   On January 6, 2021, violent insurrectionists stormed and attacked the  U.S. Capitol attempting to overturn the will of the voters and impede  the peaceful transfer of power to a new, democratically-elected  administration. The current state of heightened security risks, the  lack of cooperation by former President Trump for a successful  transition, the emboldening of white supremacists and serious threat of  domestic terrorism, and numerous other unprecedented challenges make it  imperative that President Biden's national security team be in place as  expeditiously as possible. This certainly includes a Secretary of  Defense, a role that is also critical to vaccine distribution and other  elements of our response to the coronavirus pandemic.   President Biden has been elected by the people to serve as our  Commander in Chief, and I respect his decision to nominate General  Austin, a well-respected, experienced, and barrier-breaking nominee, to  meet the many challenges our nation faces.
