 Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 953, Reducing the  Regulatory Burdens Act. As I have noted before on similar bills in the  past, I remain concerned that this bill would mean that no Clean Water  Act protections would be required for pesticide application to water  bodies that are already impaired by pesticides.   The Clean Water Act in no way hinders, delays, or prevents the use of  approved pesticides for pest control operations. In fact, the Clean  Water Act permit provides a specific emergency provision to prevent  outbreaks of diseases such as Zika virus.   Under the terms of the permit, pesticide applicators are covered  automatically under the permit and any spraying may be performed  immediately for any declared pest emergency situations. In most  instances, sprayers are only required to notify EPA of their spraying  operations 30 days after the beginning of a spraying operation.   Most pesticide applications in the United States are done in  accordance with FIFRA, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and  Rodenticide Act which only requires proper labeling on pesticide  products regarding usage.   However, FIFRA labeling is no substitute for ensuring that we  understand the volumes of pesticide we seem to apply to our rivers, our  lakes, our streams on an annual basis.                                time  1515    According to a 2006 USGS report on pesticides, commonly used  pesticides frequently are present in streams and groundwater at levels  that exceed human health benchmarks and occur in many streams at levels  that may affect aquatic or fish-eating wildlife and also human life.   In the data that the States provide the EPA, more than 16,000 miles  of rivers and streams, 1,380 of bays and estuaries, and 370,000 acres  of lakes in the United States are currently impaired or threatened by  pesticides.   The EPA suggests that these estimates may be low because many of  these States do not test for or monitor all the different pesticides  that are currently being used. I am very concerned of the effect these  pesticides have on the health of our rivers, our streams, and  especially the drinking water supplies for all our citizens, especially  the most vulnerable, the young, the elderly, and the poor and  disenfranchised people who have no representation. We have much cancer  appearing, and we have no idea what it is. Adding pesticides is not  helping.   Mr. Chair, I include in the Record a Federal report on how pesticides  in California are the leading cause of impairments to water quality.           U.S. EPA Report on California Water Quality Assessment           California Causes of Impairment for reporting year 2012         Pesticides are the Cause of water impairment in California       for 4,534 miles of rivers and streams, 235,765 acres of       lakes, ponds, and reservoirs, 829 square miles of bays and       estuaries, 35 miles of coastal shoreline, 42 square miles of       ocean and near coastal waters, and 43 acres of wetlands.     Currently in California there are over 4,500 miles  of rivers and streams, 235,000 acres of lakes and reservoirs, and 829  square  [[Page H4540]]  miles of bays and estuaries in my State that are impaired by  pesticides. This is a significant concern in my home State, where every  drop of water has to be cleaned and needs to be conserved, reused, and  cherished.   We hear that pesticide application is already regulated under FIFRA  and that the Clean Water Act review is not needed. I understand the  concerns about the duplication of effort and the need to minimize the  impacts that regulations have on small business or business at large.  All the supporters are mostly farmers and other business entities.   However, I am still very concerned that these pesticides are having a  very significant impact on water quality and that, with this bill, we  are creating the exemption from water quality protection requirements  without considering the impacts to the waters that are already impacted  by pesticides, as they are in California.   This, in turn, costs our water users, our ratepayers hundreds of  millions of dollars to filter these pollutants out of water before it  is potable. This is something I deal with on an ongoing basis as the  ranking member of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment.  We currently have aquifers that are contaminated by the continued use  of pesticides and fertilizers. Millions of dollars have been spent on  the 20-plus-year-long cleanup effort of a Superfund site in my area  that has pesticides as one of the contaminants.   We cannot, and should not, take away one of the only tools available  to monitor for adverse impacts of pesticides in our rivers, our  streams, and our reservoirs. Over the past 6 years, this tool has been  reasonable, has been workable to pest control operators and  agricultural interests alike, and needs to be retained. I urge my  colleagues on both sides to vote ``no'' on this bill.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.   Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as  I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today also in support of H.R. 953, the Reducing  Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017. The House Committee on Agriculture,  which I serve on, as does Chairman Gibbs, passed this bill out of  committee every Congress since the 112th Congress. The bill language  was likewise included in the 2012 farm bill, reported out of the  committee, as well as in the 2013 farm bill the House sent to  conference. It was also included in the committee-reported text of the  FY 2012 Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies  appropriations bill. But it has never reached the President's desk.   For more than 100 years, the Federal Government has administered its  responsibilities under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and  Rodenticide Act, FIFRA, to review and register pesticides in a  responsible way that protects human health and the environment.   Under the Clean Water Act, the EPA or a State authority issues a  National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit, NPDES permit,  and that regulates the discharge of pollutants. NPDES permits specify  limits on what pollutants may be discharged from point sources and in  what amounts. Since the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972, the EPA  has interpreted its responsibilities related to pesticide use such that  compliance with FIFRA would mitigate the need for duplicative  permitting under the Clean Water Act.   As litigation in the early part of this decade began to challenge  this interpretation, the EPA ultimately responded with the promulgation  of a regulation on November 27, 2006, to clarify how these two laws  operated. Under the EPA's final rule, the Agency codified its earlier  interpretation that permits for pesticide application under the Clean  Water Act were unnecessary where pesticides were used in accordance  with their regulation under FIFRA.   Following the finalization of this regulation, the rule was  challenged in numerous jurisdictions. The case was ultimately heard in  the Sixth Circuit wherein the government's interpretation of the  interaction of these two laws was not given the deference we would  normally expect. The final court order nullified the EPA's regulation  and imposed what is viewed as a burdensome, costly, and duplicative  permitting process under the Clean Water Act for literally millions of  pesticide applications.   This order has imposed a burden on the EPA, State regulatory  agencies, and pesticide applicators, costing our economy in terms of  jobs as well as severely threatening the already critical budgetary  situation facing governments at all levels. It is particularly  unfortunate that this court order imposed a new requirement that has  imperiled our water resource boards, our mosquito control boards, and  our forestry and agricultural sectors, yet has provided no additional  environmental or public health protection. On the contrary, by imposing  this costly burden on public health pesticide users, it has jeopardized  public health as it relates to protection against insect-borne diseases  such as the Zika virus, West Nile virus, various forms of encephalitis,  and Lyme disease.   I recently heard from the Macon County Mosquito Abatement District in  my district based in and around Decatur, Illinois. They can attest that  the price of complying with NPDES permitting is very high. Though they  had in place a reliable system of tracking chemical usage and treatment  areas for years, the added burden of the NPDES requirements have caused  them to spend a large portion of the district's annual budget on  software strictly just for compliance and reporting processes. The  recurring yearly fees associated with the software are a never-ending  burden needlessly placed on abatement districts. The fear of litigation  dictates the detailed tracking of EPA-approved products and diverts  those funds from their actual purpose of controlling mosquitoes.   The EPA has provided technical assistance to draft this very narrow  legislation. The goal of this legislation has been to address only  those problems created by the decision of the Sixth Circuit and to be  entirely consistent with the policy of the EPA, as stated in their  November 27, 2006, final rule governing application of pesticides to  waters of the United States in compliance with FIFRA.    I urge all Members to vote for this legislation.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Costa).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Costa).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Costa).

Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Minnesota (Mr. Peterson).    Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to  the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).   Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Chairman, this is the fifth time the United States House of  Representatives has considered this bill.   Now, we have heard a lot of alternative facts today. Let's have some  real facts.   Killing trees, well, first off, here is the extensive application. It  is slightly over three pages long and it can be filed electronically,  so we don't need to kill any trees.   Allegations that somehow this slows down control of mosquito  abatement or Zika virus are absolutely false. Anybody can apply a  pesticide in a public health situation. They have 30 days to file the  paperwork online afterwards. It takes about 5 minutes. It has such  technical things as your name and address, your pesticide applicator  license verified with a certain State, where you are going to use the  pesticide or herbicide.   Now, why would we want to know that? Or maybe, why wouldn't we want  not to know that? Because that is what they are saying on that side of  the aisle.   There is nothing registered with the Department of Agriculture. Yes,  we have FIFRA. These pesticides and herbicides have been registered.  They have labels--it can't be applied over water; it can't be applied  here; it can't be applied there--and we trust the applicators to follow  those rules. But when they actually use the herbicides and pesticides  absent this form, this burdensome 3\1/2\-page form, we won't know.   Now, why would we care? Well, this is essentially the 20th  anniversary of a massive fish kill in Jackson County, Oregon. In that  incident, an operator applied an aquatic herbicide in an irrigation  canal that, when it leaked into the nearby creek, killed 92,000  steelhead. Now, we kind of care about our steelhead in the Northwest,  so that was a problem.   So then the Federal agency said, Well, this is kind of a problem when  someone does that, 92,000 steelhead. Plus, anybody who drank the water  was poisoned, et cetera, et cetera. But we don't want to know about  that on that side of the aisle because Dow Chemical doesn't like it  because maybe it inhibits sales of some of these chemicals that cause  these sorts of problems.   Now, we have data now because of these forms, and we know about areas  [[Page H4542]]  that are impaired. In my State, which is like the clean, green State,  825 miles of rivers and streams and 10,000 acres of lakes and ponds in  the State of Oregon are impaired by pesticide contamination. That is  something we should do something about. People are drinking that water;  they are swimming in that water; their kids are bathing in that water.  I think that is a problem.   But we don't want to know about that. This is just a horrible  restraint on pesticide applications.   Now, we heard a lot of other hooey here. It is like: This is so  difficult; it is so difficult to do. I was talking to the ranking  member of the Agriculture Committee. He said, well, farmers don't want  to file those forms. If they hired a pesticide applicator, that person  could file the form for them.   Or, yeah, maybe they are going to have to file the 3-page form if it  involves the waters of the United States of America. If it doesn't  involve the waters, you don't have to file it. So this is really an  incredible thing.   Now, we have taken this up numerous times. It was the Pest Management  and Fire Suppression Flexibility Act in the 109th Congress--the same  bill, exactly the same bill.    Then in the 112th and the 113th Congresses, it was the Reducing  Regulatory Burdens Act. It still didn't work. It didn't become law  then.   Well, wait a minute. Let's pass it on to public fears. Last Congress,  it was called the Zika Vector Control Act in the 114th Congress. We  just heard a lot of hooey about how this will inhibit killing  mosquitoes, which, of course, is absolutely not true.   But now we are back to here. So the Zika Control Act and the Pest  Management and Fire Suppression Flexibility Act are now back to the  Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act.   Now, in the past 6 years, since this paperwork was required, or  electronic work, do you know how many pesticide applicators have faced  significant impacts because of these protections? None. Zero.   Do you know how many applicators have raised problems with the Clean  Water Act pesticide general permit to EPA? None. Zero.   In fact, I specifically asked this question of the EPA's head of  water at a Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee hearing. No  specific instances where the clean water permit was causing problems or  impacts on pesticide application. Yet here we are again, one more time,  under the guise of reducing this horrible regulatory burden: name,  address, phone number, what did you apply? Where are you registered to  apply these sorts of permits? That is useful information.   I had a couple more instances in Oregon.   Tiller, Oregon, again, right in the same area where the steelhead  were killed. That same creek was contaminated with atrazine in 2014.  Local residents who drank the water complained, and they also  complained of the overspray. Then, in 2013, a helicopter in Curry  County, Oregon, oversprayed residents.   Now, if they didn't have to file these forms, we wouldn't know who  did it, when they did it, and what the chemical was. I guess that is  kind of what the Republicans want. If someone oversprays your property  and sprays stuff on you: ``Geez, I don't know. That was one of those  black helicopters. We don't know where it came from, or who that was.  We don't know what they dumped on you. Sorry.'' That is burdensome  paperwork. We wouldn't want to require that kind of burdensome  paperwork.   So that is why we are here again today for the fifth time with the  fifth remaining rationale for what we are doing here today, and it  still fails the smell test.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record the following letters to be  made part of today's record: A letter from 46 national and State  conservation and public health interest groups opposed to H.R. 953,  and, secondly, a list of over 150 different organizations who oppose  efforts to undermine the Clean Water Act protections for direct  pesticide applications, including the Alabama Rivers, San Francisco,  and the list goes on.   And the organizations: Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments;  from Alaska, the Alaska Community Action on Toxics; From Arkansas, the  Earth Cause Organization; from California, Audubon and many others;  from Alabama, Alabama Rivers; from Colorado, Colorado Riverkeeper; from  the District of Columbia, Potomac Riverkeeper; from Florida, Emerald  Coastkeeper; from Georgia, Altamaha Riverkeeper and Altamaha  Coastkeeper; from Idaho, the Idaho Conservation League; from Illinois,  the Illinois Council of Trout Unlimited; and from Iowa, Quad Cities  Riverkeeper. And the list goes on, Mr. Chairman.                                                       May 22, 2017.      Re Oppose H.R. 953 (Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017).         Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members       and supporters nationwide, we urge you to oppose H.R. 953       (``Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act of 2017''). A  [[Page H4543]]       more apt title for this damaging legislation is the ``Poison       Our Waters Act'' because it would eliminate Clean Water Act       safeguards that protect our waterways and communities from       excessive pesticide pollution. The Pesticide General Permit       targeted in this legislation has been in place for nearly six       years now and alarmist predictions by pesticide manufacturers       and others about the impacts of this permit have failed to       bear any fruit.        This bill is the same legislation that pesticide       manufacturers and other special interests have been pushing       for years. It has been opposed not only by the Obama       Administration. but also more than 150 public health,       fishing, and conservation organizations (see attached list).       Contrary to earlier claims made by its proponents, this bill       will not improve nor impact spraying to combat Zika virus and       other human health threats. The Pesticide General Permit at       issue already allows for spraying to combat vector-borne       diseases such as Zika and the West Nile virus. According to       the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the permit       ``provides that pesticide applications are covered       automatically under the permit and may be performed       immediately for any declared emergency pest situations''       (emphasis added).        Further, the Clean Water Act has no significant effect on       farming practices. The Pesticide General Permit in no way       affects land applications of pesticides for the purpose of       controlling pests (that is, spraying that doesn't discharge       into water bodies). Irrigation return flows and agricultural       stormwater runoff do not require permits, even when they       contain pesticides. Existing agricultural exemptions in the       Clean Water Act remain.        Repealing the Pesticide General Permit--as this damaging       legislation seeks to do--would allow pesticides to be       discharged into water bodies without any meaningful oversight       since the federal pesticide registration law (the Federal       Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)) does not       require tracking of such applications.        Now that the Pesticide General Permit is in place, the       public is finally getting information that they couldn't       obtain before about the types of pesticides being sprayed or       discharged into local bodies of water. All across the       country, pesticide applicators are complying with the       Pesticide General Permit to protect water quality without       issue,        The Pesticide General Permit simply lays out commonsense       practices for applying pesticides directly to waters that       currently fall under the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act.       Efforts to block this permit are highly controversial, as       evidenced by the attached list of groups opposed.

Mr. Chairman, there is one other thing that I want  to bring to the attention of this committee. One of the potential human  health applications related to unregulated discharges to water is  drinking water.   In May of 2017, the Natural Resources Defense Council released a  report entitled, ``Threats on Tap,'' that documented potentially  harmful contaminants in tap water in every State of the Union. This  report, based on information obtained from State and local public  drinking water utilities, documented tens of thousands of drinking  water violations related to chemicals and other contaminants currently  found in our domestic water supply.   The report included a focus on synthetic organic compounds commonly  found in a wide variety of products, from household cleaners to  industrial, commercial, and agricultural products, including pesticides  and herbicides regulated under FIFRA.                                time  1545    According to this report, human exposure to these contaminants can  lead to cancers--I repeat, lead to cancers--developmental effects,  central nervous system, and reproductive difficulties, endocrine  issues, or liver and kidney problems.   According to an appendix of this report, which I include in today's  Record, in 2015, there were 6,864 drinking water violations associated  with synthetic organic compounds, potentially affecting as many as 2.6  million drinking water users. Of these, a number were for direct,  health-related violations affecting more than 300,000 individuals. This  report documented ongoing drinking water violations for the worst of  the worst pesticides in terms of human health effects, including,  atrazine, chlordane, endrin, and glyphosate.   Mr. Chairman, thanks to this report, we have more information on  exactly where these drinking water violations are occurring and how  increased use of pesticides on or near water increases the risk that  humans will be exposed to these dangerous chemicals when they turn on  the tap; which begs the question: Why the proponents of this bill want  to reduce the public disclosure and monitoring requirements of the  Clean Water Act relating to pesticide applications?   Do these proponents want to let these pesticide applications and  chemical companies go back in the shadows where information on the  release of pesticides is no longer known?   I include in the Record a list of chemicals and their potential  health impact.

Mr. Chairman, I just implore all our colleagues to  take a good look at what this can have an effect on our general  populace, I mean, the human impact, and I trust that they will vote  ``no'' on this bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment  offered by the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty). The amendment  would help ensure the protection of public health from discharges of  toxic chemicals such as benzene, chlordane, and vinyl chloride.   In my view, the protection of our families and children from  seemingly limitless exposure to toxic chemicals in our air and our  water and our neighborhoods should be paramount, yet here we are today  considering legislation to waive the simple requirement that a chemical  pesticide sprayer fill out an application providing notice of where he  intends to spray known toxic chemicals, such as the ones I mentioned,  all known to have toxic effects on humans.   The amendment under consideration says that we should, at a minimum,  disclose and monitor the dangerous chemicals for potential toxic  effects. These are chemicals that Congress has already designated as  ``toxic,'' ``hazardous substances,'' or ``extreme hazardous  substances'' in Federal statute.   As Congress, we should want to make sure that these dangerous  chemicals do not wind up in our rivers and streams, potentially  contaminating our local drinking water sources and leading to greater  toxic exposure by our families and children.                                time  1600    The level of protection is worth 10 minutes of time by a commercial  pesticide applicator.   Mr. Chair, I approve Ms. Esty's amendment.    I totally support the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman). If this amendment is adopted,  it would maintain the existing Clean Water Act general permit  requirements to protect commercial, recreational, and subsistence  fisheries, and Tribal treaty obligations. I support the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman from California has  expired.    Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.   A recorded vote was ordered.
