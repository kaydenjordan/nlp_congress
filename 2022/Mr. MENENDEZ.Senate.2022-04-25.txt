POLICY JUSTIFICATION    Australia--Defense Articles Related to Multifunctional Information              Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio Systems         The Government of Australia has requested to buy one       hundred six (106) Multifunctional Information Distribution       System Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS JTRS) (5) terminals;       fifteen (15) MIDS JTRS (6) terminals; and seven (7)       Multifunctional Information Distribution System MIDS-Low       Volume Terminal (MIDS-LVT) (4) Block Upgrade Two (BU2)       retrofit kits. Also included are Low Volume Terminal (LVT)       Cryptographic Modules (LCM). The estimated total value is $42       million.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy and       national security objectives of the United States. Australia       is one of our most important allies in the Western Pacific.       The strategic location of this political and economic power       contributes significantly to ensuring peace and economic       stability in the region. It is vital to the U.S. national       interest to assist our ally in developing and maintaining a       strong and ready self-defense capability.        The proposed sale will improve Australia's capability to       interoperate with U.S. forces and exchange secure, jam-      resistant tactical data via Link 16. Australia will use the       enhanced capability as a deterrent to regional threats and       strengthen its homeland defense. Australia will have no       difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The principal contractors will be Viasat, Carlsbad, CA; and       Data Link Solutions, Cedar Rapids, IA. There are no known       offset agreements proposed in connection with this potential       sale.        Implementation of the proposed sale may require U.S.       Government and contractor personnel to visit Australia on a       temporary basis in conjunction with program technical       oversight and support requirements, including program and       technical reviews.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            Transmittal No. 22-23       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act                             Annex Item No. vii         (vii) Sensitivity of Technology:        1. The AN/USQ-140 Multifunctional Information Distribution       System-Low Volume Terminal (MIDS-LVT) is a secure, jam-      resistant communication and positioning system that employs a       defined waveform in the 960-1215 megahertz (MHz) Ultra High       Frequency (UHF) range for packet message communication and 16       Kilobit digital voice and packet message communication. MIDS       provides interoperability with NATO and coalition users,       significantly increasing force command and control (C2)       effectiveness. The Tactical Digital Information Link-J  [[Page S2126]]       (TADIL-J) series message standard is employed by the system       as defined in NATO Standardization Agreement (STANAG) 5516       and U.S. Military Standard (MIL-STD) 6016. The embedded       hardware features provide communications security. The AN/      USQ-190 Multifunctional Information Distribution System Joint       Tactical Radio System (MIDS JTRS) builds on MIDS-LVT's       capabilities with the addition of Concurrent Multi-Netting       (CMN) and Concurrent Contention Receive (CCR) functions. CMN       and CCR dramatically expand the number of platforms and       network-enabled systems that can be reliably included in a       Link 16 network. These enhancements allow a single MIDS JTRS       terminal to simultaneously receive messages on up to four       nets, compared with on a single net in terminals without CMN       and CCR, within a single Link 16 time slot, allowing a user       to ``hear'' messages from up to three additional sources at       once. Tactical Targeting Network Technology (TTNT) is built       into some MIDS JTRS terminals that adds an additional       advanced capability waveform.        2. The highest level of classification of defense articles,       components, and services included in this potential sale is       SECRET.        3. In a technologically advanced adversary were to obtain       knowledge of the specific hardware and software elements, the       information could be used to develop countermeasures that       might reduce weapon system effectiveness or be used in the       development of a system with similar or advanced       capabilities.        4. A determination has been made that Australia can provide       substantially the same degree of protection for the sensitive       technology being released as the U.S. Government. This sale       is necessary in furtherance of the U.S. foreign policy and       national security objectives outlined in the Policy       Justification.        5. All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Australia.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute.

All defense articles and services listed in this       transmittal have been authorized for release and export to       the Government of Nigeria.                            ____________________     Mr. President, section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control  Act requires that Congress receive prior notification of certain  proposed arms sales as defined by that statute. Upon such notification,  the Congress has 30 calendar days during which the sale may be  reviewed. The provision stipulates that, in the Senate, the  notification of proposed sales shall be sent to the chairman of the  Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   In keeping with the committee's intention to see that relevant  information is available to the full Senate, I ask unanimous consent to  have printed in the Record the notifications which have been received.  If the cover letter references a classified annex, then such annex is  available to all Senators in the office of the Foreign Relations  Committee, room SD-423.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    Defense Security                                              Cooperation Agency,                                                      Arlington, VA.      Hon. Robert Menendez,      Chairman, Committee on Foreign Relations,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: On April 23, 2022, the Secretary of       State, pursuant to section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control       Act, as amended, determined that an emergency exists which       requires the immediate sale of the defense articles and       defense services identified in the attached transmittal to       Ukraine through the Foreign Military Sales process. Ukraine's       military forces require urgent support to enable them to       resist the ongoing Russian invasion. Ukraine has identified a       number of urgent needs to support its effort to repel the       invasion, including ammunition. Immediate delivery of       ammunition will help Ukraine in its continuing battle against       Russian ground forces. It is in U.S. national security       interests to facilitate these transfers in support of       Ukraine's defense of its territory.        Please find attached (Tab 1) the Secretary of State       Determination and Justification waiving the Congressional       review requirements under Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export       Control Act, as amended, for the attached Transmittal of the       proposed Letter of Offer and Acceptance to the Ukraine for       defense articles and services pursuant to the notification       requirements of Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control       Act (AECA), as amended. The determination and detailed       justification are a part of the Transmittal. After this       letter is delivered to your office, we plan to issue a news       release to notify the public of the proposed sale.            Sincerely,                                                   James A. Hursch,                                                          Director.        Enclosures.    DETERMINATION UNDER SECTION 3 6(b)(1) OF THE ARMS EXPORT CONTROL ACT,                            22 U.S.C. 2776(b)(1)         Pursuant to section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control       Act, 22 U.S.C. 2776, I hereby determine that an emergency       exists which requires the immediate sale of the following       defense articles and services in the national security       interest of the United States:        Various rounds of non-standard ammunition to include, but       not limited to, the following:        152mm rounds for 2A36 Giatsint.        152mm rounds for D-20 cannons.        VOG-17 for automatic grenade launcher AGS-17.        120mm mortar rounds (non-NATO).        122mm rounds for 2S1 Gvozdika; BM-21 GRAD Rockets.        300mm rounds/rockets for MLRS ``Smerch''.        VOG-25 grenades for under barrel grenade launcher GP-25.        82mm mortar rounds.        125mm HE ammunition for T-72.        152mm rounds for 2A65 Msta.        Transportation.        Logistical and program support.         This determination, along with the accompanying Memorandum       of Justification, shall be transmitted to Congress with the       applicable notifications.   MEMORANDUM OF JUSTIFICATION FOR THE EMERGENCY AUTHORIZATION OF THE SALE    OF NON-STANDARD AMMUNITION TO UKRAINE UNDER SECTION 36(b)(1) OF THE                          ARMS EXPORT CONTROL ACT         The Secretary of State has executed his delegated authority       to determine that an emergency exists requiring the sale of       non-standard ammunition to the Government of Ukraine in the       national security interest of the United States and the       immediate issuance of the associated letter of offer.        In the early morning of February 24, Russia launched a       full-scale, premeditated attack against Ukraine. Russia's       massive military force buildup (with over 150,000 soldiers       and equipment along the Russia-Ukraine and Belarus-Ukraine       borders) enabled it to invade Ukraine with devastating       consequences. This incursion came after Russia's cyber       operations attacks against Ukrainian government       infrastructure, Russian President Putin's purported       recognition on February 21 of the so-called ``Luhansk       People's Republic'' and ``Donetsk People's Republic'' as       independent states, and the Kremlin's subsequent deployment       of Russian military forces into the Donbas. On February 24,       President Putin announced a ``special military operation'' in       Ukraine, and Russian forces launched premediated, unprovoked,       and unjustified attacks against locations throughout Ukraine,       including civilian infrastructure, in a full-scale invasion.        Over the last eight years, the U.S. government has provided       robust levels of defense support to Ukraine to help counter       Russia's aggressive and destabilizing activities. Ukraine       also has increasingly purchased U.S. military equipment using       national funds. Since the beginning of the conflict in 2014,       the United States has provided more than $6 billion in       security assistance to Ukraine, including through the       Department of Defense's (DoD) Ukraine Security Assistance       Initiative (USAI), DoD's security assistance authority under       10 U.S.C. 333, State's foreign military financing (FMF)       program, and presidential drawdowns. Through these programs,       which accelerated in the immediate lead-up to and following       the February 24 all-out Russian attack, the United States has       provided and is providing Ukraine with military equipment       such as anti-armor missile systems, man-portable air defense       systems, unmanned aerial systems, patrol boats, helicopters,       artillery, grenade launchers, counter-artillery and counter-      mortar radars, military medical equipment, electronic warfare       detection systems, tactical gear, ammunition, and support for       ongoing training programs.        Although U.S. security assistance has improved Ukraine's       overall defense posture and capabilities, Ukraine's military       forces require urgent additional support to enable them to       continue to defend against the ongoing Russian invasion.       There is an urgent and pressing need to provide nonstandard       ammunition to Ukraine's military forces, which is essential       to enable those forces to repel Russian advances into their       territory--particularly a renewed offensive in the east and       south. As Ukrainian forces expend ammunition to defend their       country, their daily replenishment requirements continue to       increase. With critically low stores of ammunition for their       fielded systems, we must act immediately to provide the       required ammunition to sustain Ukraine in this conflict. The       sale of this ammunition is expected to be funded from FMF for       Ukraine.        For the reasons discussed above, an emergency exists which       requires this sale under the Arms Export Control Act, in the       national security interest of the United States and the       immediate issuance of the associated letter of offer.                            Transmittal No. 22-30       Notice of Proposed Issuance of Letter of Offer Pursuant to           Section 36(b)(1) of the Arms Export Control Act, as           amended        (i) Prospective Purchaser: Government of Ukraine.

[[Page S2128]]         *As defined in Section 47(6) of the Arms Export       Control Act.                             POLICY JUSTIFICATION                      Ukraine--Non-Standard Ammunition         The Government of Ukraine has requested to buy various       rounds of non-standard ammunition to include, but not limited       to, the following: 152mm rounds for 2A36 Giatsint; 152mm       rounds for D-20 cannons; VOG-17 for automatic grenade       launcher AGS-17; 120mm mortar rounds (non-NATO); 122mm rounds       for 2Sl Gvozdika; BM-21 GRAD Rockets; 300mm rounds/rockets       for MLRS ``Smerch;'' VOG-25 grenades for under barrel grenade       launcher GP-25; 82mm mortar rounds; 125mm HE ammunition for       T-72; 152mm rounds for 2A65 Msta; transportation; and other       related elements of logistical and program support. The total       estimated program cost is $165 million.        The Secretary of State has determined and provided detailed       justification that an emergency exists that requires the       immediate sale to Ukraine of the above defense articles (and       defense services) in the national security interests of the       United States, thereby waiving the Congressional review       requirements under Section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control       Act, as amended.        This proposed sale will support the foreign policy goals       and national security objectives of the United States by       improving the security of a partner country that is a force       for political stability and economic progress in Europe.        The proposed sale will improve Ukraine's capability to meet       current and future threats by maintaining the operational       readiness of its forces. The provision of non-standard and       legacy Warsaw Pact ammunition will enable the Armed Forces       Ukraine to defend itself against ongoing threats and enhance       national defense. Ukraine already has these items, or       variants thereof, in its inventory and will have no       difficulty absorbing this equipment into its armed forces.        The proposed sale of this equipment and support will not       alter the basic military balance in the region.        The prime contractor(s) will be selected upon contract       award.        Implementation of this proposed sale will not require the       assignment of any additional U.S. Government or contractor       representatives to Ukraine.        There will be no adverse impact on U.S. defense readiness       as a result of this proposed sale.                            ____________________
