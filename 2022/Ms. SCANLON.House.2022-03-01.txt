 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of my young  constituents, Anthony Alexander, a student at Academy Park High School,  for his recent bravery in a moment of crisis.   Last week, on an unseasonably warm winter day, Anthony was riding his  bike with friends in Collingdale Park when he heard cries for help. A  frozen pond had given way and three younger children had fallen through  the ice.   As the children panicked, 16-year-old Anthony sprang into action. He  dialed 911 and then ran to the water's edge and used a stick to help  pull the children to safety. He then jumped into the freezing pond to  reach the third child.  [[Page H1186]]  Police Sergeant Pat Kilroy arrived on the scene and helped both of them  out.   So many of us wonder what we would do when faced with an emergency.  Anthony's quick thinking and selfless action at Collingdale Park  prevented a tragedy.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to join members of our community in  recognizing Anthony Alexander as a local hero.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of today's rule.   As we work with President Biden to build a better America, we must  honor our debt to our veterans for their service and sacrifice on  behalf of our country.   There are obvious risks and sacrifices in military service: the  physical and mental challenges, time away from loved ones, and the  possibility that one may be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice  for one's country. But there are hidden risks and sacrifices as well,  and our failure to address them means that, for too long, we have not  met the needs of veterans who have been exposed to toxic substances  during the course of their military service, as they have suffered from  chronic respiratory illness, cancer, and a variety of other maladies  later in life.   The most well-known example of this is Agent Orange. It took years of  veterans' advocacy for the government to acknowledge and provide  services and treatment for injuries caused by Agent Orange.   Even as the connections between illness and exposure to Agent Orange  [[Page H1189]]  have multiplied, new links have been established between exposure to  other toxic substances during military service and chronic and life- threatening diseases. The burn pits used at military installations  across the globe are a more recent example.   The Honoring our PACT bill enacts long-overdue support for over 3  million veterans suffering from illnesses due to exposure to toxins and  radiation during military service. This comprehensive bill will cut red  tape to getting veterans benefits, allowing veterans exposed to  chemical, airborne, and radioactive hazards to receive full health  benefits to treat illnesses related to that exposure.   We owe it to our vets to pass this bill and provide them with the  benefits they deserve.   Mr. Speaker, I also want to highlight my amendment to the Honoring  our PACT Act, which will provide additional funding to ensure that the  VA can implement the new benefits that this bill will authorize.   I strongly encourage all of my colleagues to support the rule, the  PACT Act, and my amendment when they are considered on the House floor.
