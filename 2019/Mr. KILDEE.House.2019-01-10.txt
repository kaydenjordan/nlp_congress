 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and for  his leadership in bringing this legislation, which I support, to the  floor, legislation that would fund the Department of Agriculture for  the rest of the year.   This bill would end part of the shutdown that this President has  orchestrated and fund the Department of Agriculture, which helps people  from going hungry and supports our farmers.                                time  1330    With the shutdown of the Department of Agriculture, we are not  implementing the farm bill that we passed here, which means we are not  helping increase access to fruits and vegetables through programs like  the Double Up Food Bucks program in Michigan. We are not helping  struggling farmers sign up for crop insurance, our best risk mitigation  tool. The agriculture industry is already being hurt by President  Trump's poor trade practices. This is just another attack on them.   Also, programs cannot proceed to address drinking water needs in our  rural communities. We have places like Oscoda in my home district  experiencing a drinking water emergency from PFAS. They have relied on  the Department of Agriculture for help. That help won't be available.   By passing this bill, we put thousands of Michigan workers back to  work. We ensure families who rely on food nutrition assistance will get  the help they need. Right now, they are only guaranteed that help  through the end of February.   Additionally, there are contractors who are essentially doing much of  the same work as government employees but are not getting paid and will  not see a paycheck when all of this is over.   During this Trump shutdown, these hardworking employees don't know  where their next paycheck is coming from. They can't turn to their  parents like some can when they run out of money to pay their bills.  They need help for healthcare. They need help to pay for childcare.  They need to be able to cover their housing costs. They need to be able  to buy food for their families. They can't plan for their own future  when they don't know what they are going to be able to do next week.   President Trump is using these families and farmers who work or  depend on the Department of Agriculture as pawns in a political game.  We may have disagreements, but we should never, ever shut the  government down in order to achieve something that the President and  his party are unwilling to submit to the legislative process.
