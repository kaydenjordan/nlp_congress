 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lieutenant  Jason Moloney and the Southlake Fire Department for their selfless acts  of service to protect our State during the recent wildland fire  deployments.   Over the holiday season, Southlake Fire Department personnel took  part in two different deployments as part of the Texas Intrastate Fire  Mutual Aid System to assist with wildland fires in the Texas panhandle.  The fire covered nearly 24,000 acres and stretched 23 miles long.   Southlake Fire Department Lieutenant Jason Moloney fearlessly served  as the Strike Team Leader of a specially trained team, which included  five wildland brush trucks and a command vehicle.   During the second deployment, the strike team was deployed on January  4 and was safely demobilized on January 9. While Lieutenant Moloney was  on the front line, his wife, Velvet, worked tirelessly treating COVID- 19 patients as a respiratory therapist and taking care of their two  young children. Both Jason and Velvet served to protect our State and  sacrifice time at home during the holidays as a family.   Madam Speaker, I thank Lieutenant Moloney and the entire Southlake  Fire Department for their dedication, bravery, and providing world  class service to our community.                            ____________________
