 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Hice)  for his great leadership on this issue.   At a time when Speaker Pelosi is keeping Congress largely on the  sidelines, it is unfortunate that we are spending precious work time  debating blatantly unconstitutional legislation.   Not only is this measure unconstitutional and dead on arrival in the  Senate, but it should not be a priority for this body right now. Our  Nation is facing a serious need for action. We need police reform that  focuses on transparency and accountability, we need to support American  workers as States safely reopen their communities and economies, and we  need to ensure that money we have spent to fight the coronavirus is  effectively guarded against waste, fraud, and abuse.   Passing this measure today would signal a stunning lack of respect  for the Constitution. Making Washington, D.C., a State would  specifically violate the intentions of our Founding Fathers, who wanted  the national seat of government to belong to no State.   In fact, the Constitution specifically calls for Congress, not any  State government, to have authority over the District serving as the  seat of Federal Government.   Granting statehood for Washington, D.C., requires a constitutional  amendment, just as granting the District three electoral college votes  required the ratification of the 23rd Amendment.   It is time for Congress to get back to full-time work and take up the  pressing issues facing our country, not playing unconstitutional games.
