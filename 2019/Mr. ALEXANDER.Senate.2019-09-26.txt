 I object.    Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Alabama  mentioned music, and I guess a lot of us have been watching Ken Burns'  ``Country Music'' film the last several days, which is terrific and  includes lots from Alabama and even more from Tennessee.   My experience with music and Nashville songwriters is, to get a  melody, you need some cooperation. You need cooperation. Usually, they  have three songwriters who will write a song. I am interested in  harmony, but I think we need some cooperation across the aisle as on  our committee--thanks to the distinguished Senator from Washington  State, Mrs. Murray, and Senator Jones--we often have. We had it on  fixing No Child Left Behind; we had it on the 21st Century Cures; we  had it on the Opioid Crisis Response Act; we had it on the Lowering  Healthcare Costs Act, which came out of our committee 20 to 3 just  recently; and we need to have it on higher education.   So I have a suggestion today. I want to speak about it for about 10  minutes. It would, I believe, give an opportunity to deal with the  historically Black colleges legislation and indeed an opportunity to do  more than that.   In the first place, the bill passed by the House is a short-term  bill, which is funded by a budget gimmick, which has no chance of  passing the Senate. I propose that we do permanent funding of  historically Black colleges. That is the way to provide certainty. I  propose that we include within it a package of seven or eight other  pieces of legislation on which there is bipartisan support--as many as  half the Members of the Senate, about half Republican and half  Democratic. All of these provisions--simplifying FAFSA, short-term Pell  grants, Pell grants for prisoners, increasing the amount of Pell--help  low-income Americans go to college and simplify the process for doing  that.   So if it is urgently important, as I believe it is, to properly fund  historically Black colleges, I am ready to do that, but I am also ready  to continue to work to pass a small package of bills that will help  many of the same people the historically Black colleges legislation  would help and then continue to work with Senator Murray and with other  members of the committee on a larger package of bills that would  include issues that could be part of a more comprehensive Higher  Education Reauthorization Act--issues such as accountability, Federal- State partnership, campus safety, and the like.   For the last 5 years, Senator Murray and I have been working on a  bipartisan reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. We have had  about 30 hearings on all manner of issues, from accountability, to  campus safety, to simplifying the student aid process. We have yet to  reach agreement on some of those issues, but on several important  issues, as I mentioned, we have bipartisan proposals by members of our  committee and Senators who are not on the committee that will make  college more affordable for low-income students and make college worth  students' time and money.   I am committed to working with the Senator from Washington State to  develop a larger, more comprehensive bill, but right now, why should we  pass up an opportunity to enact a package that includes several of the  bipartisan proposals that are the result of our 5 years of work,  including permanent funding for historically Black colleges and  universities?   At the end of the month, as the Senator from Alabama said, the law  providing for funding for historically Black colleges and universities  and other minority-serving institutions expires. Everyone wants to see  that continue.   The House of Representatives passed legislation, but instead of the  short-term patch that the House passed, we should pass a long-term  solution that gives certainty to college presidents and their students.  Congress has time to do this. It is true that the law expires at the  end of this month, but the money doesn't. The U.S. Department of  Education has sent a letter assuring Congress that there is enough  funding in the program to continue through the next fiscal year. So  there is a year for us to work on permanent funding and this small  package of other bills on which we have already spent 5 years. That  ought to be enough time even for U.S. Senators.   We should reach a long-term solution. That is why today I am  introducing a long-term solution to permanently provide funding for  minority-serving institutions, including the six historically Black  colleges and universities in Tennessee. The solution would be part of a  package of 8 bipartisan higher education bills drafted by 35 Senators-- 20 Democrats, 15 Republicans--that will help many of the same students  who are helped by the historically Black colleges act.   The package of bills will make it easier for millions of students to  receive a college education by simplifying the Federal application for  student aid, providing Pell grants to parole-eligible prisoners,  allowing Pell grants to be used for short-term programs, and increasing  the maximum Pell grant award.   Here are the eight provisions that I believe should be included in  the package.   First, permanent mandatory funding of $255 million each year for  historically Black colleges and universities and other minority-serving  institutions.   Second, FAFSA simplification reduces the number of questions on the  student application for Federal aid from 108 to between 17 and 30  questions that Senator Jones and I have proposed. This means that a  quarter of a million students will now be eligible for Pell grants. In  addition, 1.3 million students will be eligible for the maximum Pell  grant award.   There is no excuse for not passing the FAFSA Simplification Act.  Senator Bennet and I, as well as Senators Murray, Jones, and others,  have been working on this for years. Twenty million American families  have to fill out these 108 questions every year that are unnecessary  for them to fill out, and delay is unnecessary for us.   No. 3, Pell grants for prisoners allows incarcerated individuals who  are eligible for parole to use a Pell grant for prison education  programs. This is something a number of Senators want to do, including  Senators Schatz, Lee, and Durbin.   No. 4, the short-term Pell is a proposal that a large group of  Senators, including Senators Portman, Kaine, Cardin, Gillibrand,  Hassan, Klobuchar, Stabenow, Baldwin, Brown, Capito, Coons, Ernst,  Jones, Moran,  [[Page S5720]]  Shaheen, Sinema, Smith, Wicker, and Braun, support. This legislation  has been introduced to use Pell grants for high-quality, short-term  skills and job training programs that lead to credentialing and  employment in high-demand fields like healthcare and cyber security.   No. 5, a proposal to simplify aid letters. Sometimes students get a  letter that says they have received money, but some students don't  understand that some of it is a loan that has to be paid back and some  of it is a grant. Senators Grassley, Smith, Cassidy, Ernst, Hassan,  Jones, Klobuchar, Manchin, and Rubio have legislation that would  simplify and make that clear.   No. 6 in the package increases the maximum Pell grant award.   No. 7 is a bipartisan proposal that both President Obama and  President Trump have supported, which is to ensure that students who  opt to pay back their loans under the income-driven repayment plan pay  the full 10 percent of their discretionary income as the law intended.   Finally, No. 8 is a proposal by Senator Murray and me, along with  Senators Collins, Cornyn, Gardner, Hassan, King, Stabenow, Tillis, and  Whitehouse, to allow students to answer up to 22 questions on the  current FAFSA with one click by using the data the government already  has from the IRS.   I can't tell you how many times Tennessean parents have said to me:  Why do I have to give the government the same information twice in  order for my student to be able to go to college?   This would also reduce the burdensome verification process.   The Senate has already passed this legislation once. That provision  is within the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee and will be  included once the package is ready for consideration on the floor.   In addition, there are at least three other bipartisan provisions  that, with a little more discussion and work, I believe should be  included in this package. They have the support of 30 Senators from  both sides of the aisle.   The College Transparency Act is the first. It creates a student unit  record system to help students and families compare how students  perform in specific colleges and universities. Senators Warren,  Cassidy, Baldwin, Brown, Casey, Cornyn, Duckworth, Ernst, Gardner,  Graham, Grassley, Hassan, Hyde-Smith, Jones, Kaine, Klobuchar, Murphy,  Perdue, Roberts, Romney, Scott, Sinema, Smith, Sullivan, Tillis,  Toomey, Whitehouse, and Alexander all support this provision. There is  substantial bipartisan support in both the Senate and House for it. We  will work to include it as we move forward.   The Education of the Deaf Act simply reauthorizes Gallaudet  University in Washington, DC, and has a long history of bipartisan  support.   The Educational Opportunity and Success Act reauthorizes the TRIO  Program, which helps low-income, first-generation, and other  disadvantaged students enroll and succeed in a college or university  program and has the support of Senators Collins, Baldwin, Capito, and  Tester.   To continue funding for historically Black colleges and universities  and other minority-serving institutions, the House of Representatives  took a shortcut. They rushed a bill to the floor that has serious  problems.   First, it is not a bill that can pass the Senate. My objection is not  the only objection. Second, it only funds HBCUs and minority-serving  institutions for 2 years, setting up yet another artificial cliff.  Finally, it uses a budget gimmick to pay for it, which is one reason it  won't pass the Senate.   This presents Congress with an opportunity to do it right and to pass  other important legislation that we have already agreed to--at least  half of us. It presents Congress with an opportunity to give certainty  to HBCUs and minority-serving institutions and make it easier for  millions to receive a college education.   The package of eight bills I am proposing--the eight bills I am  introducing today and the three bills I hope to include later--has been  drafted by 48 Senators--25 Democrats and 23 Republicans. Working  together on a bipartisan bill that can pass the Senate now is the best  strategy to give permanent funding to HBCUs and other minority-serving  institutions, to simplify the Federal application for student aid, to  provide Pell grants to parole-eligible prisoners, to allow Pell grants  to be used for short-term programs, and to increase the maximum Pell  grant award.   Senator Murray and I have discussed as recently as yesterday her  desire and my agreement to try to work toward a comprehensive higher  education piece of legislation. We have been working on that for 5  years. We can continue to work on the issues that still divide us. In  the meantime, I agree, it is urgent to deal with historically Black  colleges. It is also urgent to deal with 20 million families who fill  out FAFSA every year and to work on the other issues I mentioned. We  have agreed on those. Let's put it in a package, turn it into law, and  keep working on the other issues.    I yield the floor.  [[Page S5721]]     I appreciate the comments by the Senator from New  Jersey.   To be clear, the House bill for historically Black minority-serving  institutions creates a new funding cliff. It is a short-term patch for  2 years that creates a cliff after 2 years. It is supported by a budget  gimmick that can't possibly pass the Senate.   What I have proposed is a permanent solution to get rid of the  cliff--a permanent solution that those institutions and those students  can depend on. The proposal is $255 million a year, fully paid for.  Second, the U.S. Department of Education has written a letter to  Congress and said that no one is going to lose their money at the end  of the month. The law expires, but the money doesn't. There is enough  money to continue the program for another year. It shouldn't take us  another year  [[Page S5722]]  to work this out. Third, it is urgent to deal with historically Black  colleges.   Let's look at the students, not the colleges. Who goes to  historically Black colleges? Low-income students often go there. And  every year, 20 million low-income Americans fill out this ridiculously  complicated FAFSA application for student aid that has 108 questions.  We agree on both sides of the aisle--and have for several years--that  it could be limited to 17 to 30 questions. The president of the  Southwest Tennessee Community College in Memphis, TN, which is almost  all African American in terms of its students, tells me he loses 1,500  students a year, almost all African American, who are intimidated by  this complicated FAFSA.   Let's do both of these things. Let's have a permanent solution for  historically Black colleges, and let's help the 20 million families who  fill out this ridiculously complicated form every year because we agree  on that. There is no need to wait on that. We have Republicans and  Democrats who agree on it. We could finish this in a matter of a few  weeks. No one is going to lose any money. There is enough money for  historically Black colleges for a year, and there is no excuse for  creating a new cliff to replace the one that will occur in a year.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Craig  Becker, who, after 42 years in the health care system, including 26  years leading the Tennessee Hospital Association, is retiring this  month. Considering how the health care system has changed in those four  decades, I can imagine Craig has many stories he could tell of what can  happen when people seek to help others as our healthcare professionals  do.        For those of us from Tennessee, we know Craig is an       advocate for hospitals, providing an articulate explanation       on issues ranging from Medicare hospital wage disparities to       leveling the playing field for Tennessee on Medicaid       disproportionate share hospital payment issues, to seeking       solutions for rural communities in maintaining a medical       presence.        Craig's dedication has never been about just his job or       solely about his service to those working in health care.       Several years ago, when was asked in an interview, ``what has       been your worst decision,'' he answered, ``dropping out of       the Boy Scouts before obtaining his Eagle rank.'' Craig has       more than made up for that--for 25 years, he has served as       the Assistant Scout Master of Troup 1 in Brentwood Tennessee.       Craig has spent dozens of weekends through those two and a       half decades hiking and camping with the Boy Scouts of       central Tennessee including camping in both Tennessee State       and our nation's National Parks. He has participated in       jamborees as far away as the World Jamboree in Chile several       years ago. Among his many awards, he is a 'Life Scout' which       is a badge given for those who can help point Scouts the       right way in life ``as truly as does a compass in the       field.''        I was a Boy Scout, and know the lessons one can learn about       the great American outdoors, serving your community, and       lifelong friendships. It makes sense to me that someone so       involved in scouting, has dedicated his professional life to       improving Tennessee and our nation's healthcare system.        While Craig may be retiring from his day job with THA, we       are thankful he plans to continue to serve the Boy Scouts and       his community.        I congratulate Craig on a lifetime of service, and wish all       the best in retirement to him, his wife Angie--a retired       nurse practitioner--and their two sons.                            ____________________
