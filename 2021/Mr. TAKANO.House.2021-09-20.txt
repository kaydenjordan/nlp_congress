 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 5293) to amend title 38, United States Code, to extend and  modify certain authorities and requirements relating to the Department  of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 5293         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Department of Veterans       Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY FOR DENTAL INSURANCE PLAN FOR                     VETERANS AND SURVIVORS AND DEPENDENTS OF                     VETERANS.         Section 1712C of title 38, United States Code, is amended       by striking subsection (j).       SEC. 3. EXTENSION OF TEMPORARY EXPANSION OF PAYMENTS AND                     ALLOWANCES FOR BENEFICIARY TRAVEL IN CONNECTION                     WITH VETERANS RECEIVING CARE FROM VET CENTERS.         Section 104(a) of the Honoring America's Veterans and       Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-      154; 126 Stat. 1169), as most recently amended by section       5109 of the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2021 and Other       Extensions Act (Public Law 116-159; 134 Stat. 749), is       further amended by striking ``September 30, 2021'' and       inserting ``September 30, 2022''.       SEC. 4. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY FOR PILOT PROGRAM ON                     ACCEPTANCE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS                     AFFAIRS OF DONATED FACILITIES AND RELATED                     IMPROVEMENTS.         Section 2(i) of the Communities Helping Invest through       Property and Improvements Needed for Veterans Act of 2016       (Public Law 114-294; 38 U.S.C. 8103 note) is amended by       striking ``the date that is 5 years after the date of the       enactment of this Act'' and inserting ``December 16, 2026''.       SEC. 5. DETERMINATION OF BUDGETARY EFFECTS.         The budgetary effects of this Act, for the purpose of       complying with the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, shall       be determined by reference to the latest statement titled       ``Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation'' for this Act,       submitted for printing in the Congressional Record by the       Chairman of the House Budget Committee, provided that such       statement has been submitted prior to the vote on passage.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 5293.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to  speak today in support of H.R. 5293, the Department of Veterans Affairs  Expiring Authorities Act of 2021, offered by the gentleman from Indiana  (Mr. Mrvan), the chairman of our Technology Modernization Subcommittee  and my good friend.   This package ensures continued operations of several programs that  are vital to addressing the needs of veterans we serve.   First, this bill removes the December 31, 2021, expiration date and  makes permanent VA's dental insurance program. This benefit allows  qualifying veterans, survivors, and dependents the opportunity to  purchase discounted dental insurance coverage that includes preventive,  diagnostic, endodontic, restorative, surgical, and emergency dental  services.   Each individual covered by the program pays the entire premium for  coverage in addition to the full cost of any copays. Enrollment is  voluntary and does not affect eligible individuals' entitlement to  existing VHA outpatient dental services and treatment.   Second, H.R. 5293 will extend VA's authority to provide travel  reimbursement for certain veterans living in highly rural areas to  receive care at vet centers. These centers serve as a lifeline for  veterans who may not feel comfortable seeking services at traditional  VA medical facilities. They offer individual and group therapy,  marriage and family counseling, and assist veterans in connecting to  other VA benefits.   H.R. 5293 extends VA's authority to reimburse mileage, tolls, and  other travel expenses veterans from highly rural areas may incur when  traveling to vet centers.   Finally, H.R. 5293 will extend for 5 years VA's authority to operate  the Communities Helping Invest through Property and Improvements Needed  for Veterans Act of 2016 or the CHIP IN Act.   This program allows VA to accept donations from non-Federal entities  of buildings and land that VA will use to address long-term  infrastructure needs, including the delivery of healthcare services.   Examples of non-Federal entities that can make donations under the  pilot include State and local authorities, a donor or donor group,  limited liability corporations, or tax-exempt organizations.   The CHIP IN Act allows VA to use funds that have already been  appropriated for a particular facility's construction project to assist  a donor of real property and improvements with financing, designing, or  constructing the facility to suit VA's needs.   Thus far, VA has accepted two donations: design and construction of a  facility on the grounds of the VA Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska;  and construction of an inpatient facility in Tulsa, Oklahoma. This bill  will extend VA's authority to accept similar donations in other  locations.   Once again, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5293, which will  authorize the continued operation of these important programs.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close. I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 5293, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (S. 189) to increase, effective as of December 1, 2021, the rates  of compensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities and  the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for the survivors of  certain disabled veterans, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                   S. 189         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans' Compensation Cost-      of-Living Adjustment Act of 2021''.       SEC. 2. INCREASE IN RATES OF DISABILITY COMPENSATION AND                     DEPENDENCY AND INDEMNITY COMPENSATION.         (a) Rate Adjustment.--Effective on December 1, 2021, the       Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall increase, in accordance       with subsection (c), the dollar amounts in effect on November       30, 2021, for the payment of disability compensation and       dependency and indemnity compensation under the provisions       specified in subsection (b).        (b) Amounts To Be Increased.--The dollar amounts to be       increased pursuant to subsection (a) are the following:        (1) Wartime disability compensation.--Each of the dollar       amounts under section 1114 of title 38, United States Code.        (2) Additional compensation for dependents.--Each of the       dollar amounts under section 1115(1) of such title.        (3) Clothing allowance.--The dollar amount under section       1162 of such title.        (4) Dependency and indemnity compensation to surviving       spouse.--Each of the dollar amounts under subsections (a)       through (d) of section 1311 of such title.        (5) Dependency and indemnity compensation to children.--      Each of the dollar amounts under sections 1313(a) and 1314 of       such title.        (c) Determination of Increase.--Each dollar amount       described in subsection (b) shall be increased by the same       percentage as the percentage by which benefit amounts payable       under title II of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et       seq.) are increased effective December 1, 2021, as a result       of a determination under section 215(i) of such Act (42       U.S.C. 415(i)).        (d) Special Rule.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs may       adjust administratively, consistent with the increases made       under subsection (a), the rates of disability compensation       payable to persons under section 10 of Public Law 85-857 (72       Stat. 1263) who have not received compensation under chapter       11 of title 38, United States Code.       SEC. 3. PUBLICATION OF ADJUSTED RATES.         The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall publish in the       Federal Register the amounts specified in section 2(b), as       increased under that section, not later than the date on       which the matters specified in section 215(i)(2)(D) of the       Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 415(i)(2)(D)) are required to       be published by reason of a determination made under section       215(i) of such Act during fiscal year 2022.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on S. 189.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, S. 189, the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living  Adjustment Act of 2021, would require the Secretary of Veterans'  Affairs to increase the rates of disability compensation for service- connected veterans and the rates of dependency and indemnity  compensation for survivors of veterans, effective December 1, 2021.   This bill would also increase these rates by the same percentage as  the percentage by which Social Security benefits are increased,  effective December 1, 2021, and require that the VA publish the  increased rates in the Federal Register.   To me, the actual cost-of-living adjustment to veterans' benefits,  otherwise known as COLA, is much more than a rate adjustment tied to  inflation. In reality, it is a quality-of-life guarantee in the  retirement years, especially for veterans suffering with service- connected disabilities and ailments.   It also comes with the assurance for veterans that their survivors  will not see a steady decline in benefits if the economy changes and  costs rise after they have passed. This guarantee is a great source of  comfort for veterans as they age. I know this because they tell me this  everywhere I go.   The yearly COLA increase demonstrates the appreciation from a  grateful nation in recognition of the service and sacrifice of those  who volunteer to wear the uniform of our country.   Participating in this gesture of gratitude is one of the most  rewarding responsibilities of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. As  chairman, I am honored to be leading this effort to say thank you.   I want to recognize the work of the Disability Assistance and  Memorial Affairs Subcommittee chair, Elaine Luria, and ranking member  Troy Nehls for sponsoring S. 189's House companion, H.R. 3909, and for  bringing this legislation to the floor with me today.   I am pleased that we are considering this bill early this year so  veterans will not be concerned about its passage by the December 1  deadline. This is especially important to so many feeling the economic  effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.   I wholeheartedly support S. 189, and I urge all my colleagues to do  so as well.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Mrs. Luria), my good friend and the chair of the Disability  Assistance and Memorial Affairs Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in  passing S. 189, The Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment  Act of 2021, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 4172) to name the Department of Veterans Affairs community- based outpatient clinic in Aurora, Colorado, as the ``Lieutenant  Colonel John W. Mosley VA Clinic.''   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 4172         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. NAME OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMUNITY-                    BASED OUTPATIENT CLINIC, AURORA, COLORADO.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:        (1) John Mosley was born on June 21, 1921, in Denver,       Colorado.        (2) In 1945, John Mosley married Edna Mosley.        (3) During World War II, he joined the famed Tuskegee       Airmen and trained as a bomber pilot, serving as one of the       first African Americans in that role. He earned the flight       qualification of Command Pilot during his service in the       United States Air Force. The brave service of the Tuskegee       Airmen helped pave the way for integration of the armed       services. Edna Mosley worked in the defense industry during       the war.        (4) Upon their return to Colorado, Edna Mosley joined John       as a tireless community activist and organizer. Among her       many achievements, Edna was elected to three terms as       Aurora's first African-American City Council Woman. While on       the Council, Mrs. Mosley also served on the Board of       Directors of the Fitzsimons Redevelopment Authority, the       entity which provided the vision for the development of the       University of Colorado Health Sciences Center.        (5) After a brief break from military service, John Mosley       served during the Korean and Vietnam wars. He was an       operations officer in Thailand during the Vietnam War.        (6) John Mosley retired in 1970 as a lieutenant colonel.        (7) In 2007, Lieutenant Colonel Mosley and the original       Tuskegee Airmen received the Congressional Gold Medal from       President George W. Bush.        (8) John and Edna Mosley continued to serve their community       long after their retirements, advocating for racial equality,       women's rights, veterans' affairs, housing, and education.        (b) Designation.--The Department of Veterans Affairs       community-based outpatient clinic to be located in Aurora,       Colorado, shall after the date of the enactment of this Act       be known and designated as the ``Lieutenant Colonel John W.       Mosley Clinic''.        (c) References.--Any reference to such clinic in any law,       regulation, map, document, record, or other paper of the       United States shall be considered to be a reference to the       Lieutenant Colonel John W. Mosley Clinic.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 4172.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember the life of John W. Mosley, a Denver  native who began his legendary service to our Nation in the United  States Army Air Corps as a World War II Tuskegee Airman, one of our  Nation's first Black military aviators.   This bill, H.R. 4172, will name the Department of Veterans Affairs  new community-based outpatient clinic in Aurora, Colorado, as the  Lieutenant Colonel John W. Mosley VA Clinic. I thank my colleague,  Representative Jason Crow, a former Army Ranger, for championing this  effort.   To say that Lieutenant Colonel Mosley led a remarkable life would be  an understatement. Growing up in a segregated neighborhood in Denver,  he became valedictorian of his high school class. In 1939, Lieutenant  Colonel Mosley became a National Merit Scholar and was one of the first  Black students to attend Colorado State College of Agriculture and  Mechanic Arts, which is now Colorado State University. Mosley was the  school's first Black varsity football player and served as vice  president of his college class as a junior and as a senior.   At the start of the Second World War, Mosley dreamed of serving his  country as a pilot. After being denied the opportunity to join the ROTC  program in college, Lieutenant Colonel Mosley paid for his own flight  physical and started taking flying lessons.   And even after the Army Air Corps established the Tuskegee Airmen  program in June 1941, Mosley was not initially drafted to join them.   Mosley was instead sent to an artillery unit at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.  Mosley protested, writing letters to Members of Congress and the  President until he was finally accepted into the Tuskegee unit.   Together, the Tuskegee Airmen flew more than 15,000 missions over  North Africa and Europe during World War II. Lieutenant Colonel Mosley  later served as a pilot in the Berlin Airlift, delivering loads of  supplies to the Soviet-blockaded sectors of the city.   Upon Lieutenant Colonel Mosley's death in 2015 at the age of 93, his  son, Eric, told the Denver Post that Lieutenant Colonel Mosley always  said that ``he had to fight in order to fight. . . . He had to struggle  to be able to fight for his country.''  [[Page H4538]]    Having paved the way as a Tuskegee Airman, Lieutenant Colonel Mosley  later worked with the Truman administration to draft policies that  would eventually fully integrate the United States Armed Forces.   Mosley went on to serve our Nation in the United States Air Force  during the Korean war and Vietnam war, retiring in 1970.   Mosley then joined the Federal civil service, becoming a special  assistant to the undersecretary in the U.S. Department of Health,  Education, and Welfare before finally returning home to Colorado where  he and his wife, Edna, continued their civil rights advocacy.   I should also mention that Edna Mosley was a trailblazer in her own  right, becoming Aurora, Colorado's, first African American city  councilwoman in 1992.   H.R. 4172 has letters of support from our Colorado delegation  colleagues, the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the  Disabled American Veterans.   Mr. Speaker, I include these letters in the Record.                                  Congress of the United States,                                                     Washington, DC.      Hon.

Hon. Jerry Moran,      Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Mike Bost,      Ranking Member, House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Tester, Chairman Takano, Ranking Member       Moran, Ranking Member Bost: We write to request your support       to name the new Aurora VA community-based outpatient clinic       (CBOC) after Lieutenant Colonel John Mosley. He was a Denver       native who lived in Aurora, was a Tuskegee Airman, civil       rights activist, and the first Black football player at       Colorado State University.        Lieutenant Colonel John Mosley was born the son of a slave.       He was the valedictorian of his graduating class at Manual       High School and attended a segregated Colorado A&M (now       Colorado State University) on an academic scholarship,       becoming his class Vice President and the first African       American to play on its football team.        During World War II, he joined the famed Tuskegee Airmen       and trained as a bomber pilot, serving as one of the first       African Americans in that role. He earned the flight       qualification of Command Pilot during his service in the       United States Air Force. He piloted bombing missions over       Europe and North Africa. The brave service of the Tuskegee       Airmen helped pave the way for integration of the armed       services.        Lieutenant Colonel John Mosley went on to fight in the       Korean and Vietnam Wars. He became special assistant to the       undersecretary in the Department of Health, Education, and       Welfare in Washington, D.C. before returning to Colorado.       After his retirement, Lieutenant Colonel John Mosley and his       wife Edna continued to serve Colorado--Edna as Aurora City       Council Woman--advocating for racial equality, women's       rights, veterans' affairs, housing, and education.        We would be grateful for your support in this effort and       hope the Senate and House Committees on Veterans Affairs will       give it their consideration.            Sincerely,          Jason Crow, Ken Buck, Joe Neguse, Doug Lamborn, Ed             Perlmutter, Diana DeGette, Lauren Boebert, Members of             Congress. John Hickenlooper, Michael F. Bennet, U.S.             Senators.                                   ____                                                     Chip Kossow,                                        Falcon, CO, August 10, 2021.      Chairman Mark Takano,      House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Mike Bost,      House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Bost: Please accept       this letter as a demonstration of the total support of the       American Legion Department of Colorado, in recognition of       naming the new Veterans Administration Clinic in Aurora,       Colorado as ``John W. Mosley Veterans Clinic''.        The Denver native was the first-ever black player on what       is now the Colorado State University football team, and he       was one of the first black men trained as a bomber pilot       during the Second World War, serving with the famed Tuskegee       Airmen before trading in his military service for a life of       community leadership in Aurora.        The Tuskegee Airmen flew 15,000 missions over North Africa       and Europe during the Second World War. John also would serve       as a pilot in the Berlin Airlift after the war, delivering       loads of supplies to the Soviet-blockaded sectors of the       city.        The American Legion Department of Colorado would like to       honor his amazing legacy of service to God, Country, his       fellow veterans, and his community of Aurora, CO with our       full support and we wholeheartedly support and encourage the       committee to sponsor and support legislation naming the new       Aurora Veterans Clinic after this distinguished WWII Veteran.        On behalf of the 21,000 members of The American Legion in       Colorado I am proud to fully endorse this effort.            Sincerely,                                                       Chip Kossow,      Department Commander.                                   ____                                         Disabled American Veterans,                                          Department of Colorado,                                                 Lakewood, Colorado.      Hon. Mark Takano,      Chairman, House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Mike Bost,      House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Bost: Please accept       this letter as demonstrating the total support of the       Department of Colorado Disabled American Veterans, in       recognition of the ongoing initiative to name the new Aurora       VA Community-Based Outpatient Clinic to the Lieutenant       Colonel John W. Mosley Community Based Outpatient Clinic, in       memory of United States Air Force Lieutenant Colonel       ``retired'' John W. Mosley.        Lieutenant Colonel Mosley served in the U.S. Army Air Corps       and then subsequently the U.S. Air Force from WWII, then       Korea, and Vietnam. He was also a Tuskegee Airman in WWII.       After WWII, he was called upon to work with the Truman       Administration to draft the policies that would fully       integrate the U.S. armed forces. In addition, Colonel Mosley       also served in a variety of federal positions.        Colonel Mosley was also a strong civil rights activist,       fighting for the right to attend CSU, becoming the first       black American to play football and wrestled at CSU, and       elected as his class Vice President in both his junior and       senior college years.        Lieutenant Colonel John W. Mosley embodied the Air Force       value of loyalty, duty, respect, and selfless service to his       fellow veterans and his country.        The Department of Colorado Disabled American Veterans would       like to honor his outstanding legacy with our full support,       endorsement, and we most strongly encourage this committee to       support legislation renaming the Aurora VA Community-Based       Outpatient Clinic after Lieutenant Colonel John W. Mosley.            Sincerely,                                                      John Carmona,              Commander, Department of Colorado, Disabled American       Veterans.                                   ____                                           Veterans of Foreign Wars,                                          Department of Colorado,                                                       Lakewood, CO.      Hon. Mark Takano,      Chairman, House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Mike Bost,      House Committee on Veterans' Affairs,      Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Boast: Please       accept this letter as a demonstration of total support of the       Veterans of Foreign Wars Department of Colorado, in       recognition of changing the name of the Veterans       Administration Clinic in Aurora, Colorado currently called       the Aurora Gateway CBOC Replacement (VHA19-554-2016-29466) to       ``Lieutenant Colonel John W. Mosley VA Clinic''.        Renaming the Aurora Gateway Veterans Affairs Medical Clinic       Replacement facility in respect to John W. Mosley is the       ideal honor to bestow upon a legendary U.S. Air Force       Tuskegee Airman who piloted bombing missions over Europe,       North Africa, Korea, and Vietnam. Lt. Col. Mosley's life of       service extended from his student days at Colorado State       University in the late 1930s where he broke color barriers       when he was elected class vice president in both of his       junior and senior years to after World War II where he worked       with the Truman administration to draft the policies that       would fully integrate the United States Armed Forces and       further in the Denver metro area late into his life.        Veterans of Foreign Wars, Colorado proudly supports       legislation to rename the new Veterans Affairs replacement       medical clinic in Aurora, CO as the John W. Mosley Aurora       Gateway CBOC. Lt. Col. Mosley distinguished himself       throughout his life with service to our country and community       service efforts that improved the lives of all those who call       Denver and Aurora home.        Lt. Col. Mosley was the embodiment of the U.S. Air Force       Tuskegee Airmen values, loyalty, duty, respect, and selfless       service to his fellow veterans and his country. The Veterans       of Foreign Wars Colorado would like to honor his amazing       legacy with our full support and encourage the committee to       support legislation renaming the Aurora Gateway CBOC       Replacement (VHA19-554-2016-29466) after this distinguished       member of our State.                                                     Barbara Green,      State Commander, Department of Colorado, Veterans of Foreign                                                    Wars of the U.S.     Once again, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4172 to  name the new VA community-based clinic in Aurora, Colorado, after  Lieutenant Colonel John W. Mosley, and by doing so, we will help ensure  that his legacy  [[Page H4539]]  lives on and continues to inspire future generations to break barriers  and fight for justice and equality.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Colorado (Mr. Crow), the author of this legislation and also a  subcommittee chairman of the Small Business Committee and a member of  the House Armed Services Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close, but before I do I will just let the gentleman from  Colorado know that I am honored to represent the University of  California Riverside, which is the repository of the Tuskegee Airmen  Collection, which is formerly known as the Tuskegee Airmen Archives.   We are proud to have the papers of many of the 992 pilots who  graduated from the Tuskegee Air Field courses who advanced race  relations in our country. I am certainly hopeful that we will have the  availability of the papers from Colonel Mosley that might, if it is not  already in our archives, to be added.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I ask all my colleagues to join me in  passing H.R. 4172 to name the VA clinic in Aurora, Colorado, as the  Lieutenant Colonel John W. Mosley VA clinic, and I yield back the  balance of my time.                                time  1700     Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 1281) to name the Department of Veterans Affairs community- based outpatient clinic in Gaylord, Michigan, as the ``Navy Corpsman  Steve Andrews Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Clinic''.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                 H.R. 1281       SECTION 1. NAME OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMUNITY-                    BASED OUTPATIENT CLINIC, GAYLORD, MICHIGAN.         The Department of Veterans Affairs community-based       outpatient clinic located at 2782 S. Otsego Avenue, Gaylord,       Michigan, shall after the date of the enactment of this Act       be known and designated as the ``Navy Corpsman Steve Andrews       Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Clinic''. Any       reference to such clinic in any law, regulation, map,       document, record, or other paper of the United States shall       be considered to be a reference to the Navy Corpsman Steve       Andrews Department of Veterans Affairs Health Care Clinic.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  to insert extraneous material on H.R. 1281.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to remember the life of Navy Corpsman Steve  Andrews, who passed away on January 28, 2017. I thank my colleague,  General Bergman from Michigan, for bringing this bill before us so we  all can pay tribute to a lifelong public servant.   Mr. Speaker, Steve Andrews grew up in Gaylord, Michigan, and  graduated from Gaylord High School. He joined the Navy during the  Vietnam war in 1967 and served as a hospital corpsman at the U.S. Naval  Hospital in Guam. He also served as a medic for the 1st Marine Division  and Marine 1st Reconnaissance Company in Vietnam.   Mr. Speaker, Corpsman Andrews is credited with saving the lives of  numerous marines during his time in Vietnam. In recognition of his  exceptional service in combat, he was awarded a Purple Heart and a Navy  Commendation Medal.   However, Steve Andrew's service to his community and country did not  end with military service. He was elected to the 106th District in the  Michigan  [[Page H4540]]  House of Representatives and held office from 1979 to 1982. Steve  Andrews remained an active public servant for Petoskey and Emmet  County, working as a friend of the court and a board member of the  Petoskey Regional Chamber of Commerce and North Central College. He  also coached multiple sports teams and was a constant presence in the  local community.   Steve was also a steward of the arts, helping found Petoskey Art in  the Park. He and his wife, Karen, owned and operated Sturgeon River  Pottery for 35 years.   Corpsman Andrews' dedication to serving his community will inspire  Gaylord VA Health Care Clinic staff to serve veterans, just as Steve  did.   We hope that naming the Gaylord, Michigan, VA Outpatient Clinic after  Corpsman Steve Andrews will honor the outstanding care that he provided  his fellow soldiers.   H.R. 1281 has letters of support from The American Legion, the  Veterans of Foreign Affairs, the Disabled American Veterans, and the  American Veterans organization.   Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record those letters and a resolution  in support.           Department of Michigan, Veterans of Foreign Wars of the             United States,                                   Lansing, Michigan, 14 June 2021.        To the Honorable Members of the House and Senate Veterans       Affairs Committees: The Veterans of Foreign Wars Department       of Michigan enthusiastically supports the naming of the       Gaylord Veteran Affairs Community Based Outpatient Clinic to       be ``Navy Corpsman Steve Andrews Department of Veterans       Affairs Health Care Clinic''.        Steve Andrews was a Navy Corpsman, whose heroic actions in       Vietnam are credited for saving countless Marine Corps lives       during combat. A Navy Commendation and Purple Heart       recipient, Andrews is originally from Gaylord and is a       graduate of Gaylord High School. Mr. Andrews was a citizen of       Gaylord, where he also served as a friend of the court,       coached multiple sports in the region, served as a board       member for the chamber of commerce, and was a State       Representative for the 106th District from 1979-1982.        The Veterans of Foreign Wars, the city of Gaylord, and this       great Nation are grateful for the selfless acts of this       individual. We hope that by naming this facility after a       Purple Heart recipient of the Vietnam War, we might begin to       show all Vietnam Veterans how much this country appreciates       their sacrifices for this Nation. No matter how long overdue.        We thank Congressman Bergman and all Members of Congress       who support this meaningful legislation.            Respectfully,      Kevin Conklin,        State Commander, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Department of       Michigan.      Derek Blumke,        State Adjutant/Quartermaster, Veterans of Foreign Wars,       Department of Michigan.                                   ____                                         Disabled American Veterans,                                           Department of Michigan                                                      June 27, 2021.        To the Honorable Members of the House and Senate Veteran's       Affairs Committees: The Disabled American Veterans,       Department of Michigan fully supports Congressman Bergman's       legislative initiative to name the Gaylord Veterans Affairs       Based Outpatient Clinic the ``Navy Corpsman Steve Andrews       Department of Veteran's Affairs Health Care Clinic.''        Navy Corpsman Andrews entered the Navy in 1967, and served       in the 1st Marine Division/1st Force Reconnaissance Company       in Vietnam. During his time in service to our nation, he was       credited with saving countless American lives. In recognition       for his selfless sacrifices, he was awarded the Navy       Commendation Medal and Purple Heart. Mr. Andrews continued       his service to our state and nation after his military       service by holding the position of State Representative for       the 106th District from 1979-1982.        The DAV Department of Michigan believes naming the Gaylord       Veterans Affairs Based Outpatient Clinic in honor of Mr.       Andrews will ensure that the dedication to duty displayed by       him and by so many of our Vietnam Era Veterans will be       remembered by all. Mr. Andrew's selfless sacrifice and       dedication to our nation is not only an inspiration to all of       us who have served, but also to generations of future       veterans that will answer our nations call.            Sincerely,      Albert Hughes,        State Commander.      Paul Kaiser,        State Adjutant.                                   ____                                                           AMVETS,                                                         Lanham, MD.

(5) He was decorated with the Legion of Merit with two Oak       Leaf Clusters, the Bronze Star Medal, and Vietnam Ribbon with       Four Battle Stars, and during his military career and because       of his expert legal acumen he was assigned to work on the       biggest cases of the time in which he served, but during this       he never lost sight of what he considered his primary role,       which was to take care of soldiers.        (6) Robert S. Poydasheff was appointed as legal counsel to       the Secretary of the Army and served the needs of all       soldiers by helping to shape Army policy.

Poydasheff found continued success as a practicing       lawyer helping countless citizens and soldiers living in the       city he once led as well as advocating for many soldiers in       the area.

Poydasheff Veterans Clinic.''        Robert Poydasheff served in the United States Army for       twenty-four years. He began his military service as an       Infantry Officer, where he served one combat tour in Vietnam,       before transferring to the Judge Advocate General Corps where       he worked in a number of positions for the Secretary of the       Army. After retiring from the Army at the rank of Colonel he       served as a City Counselor from 1994 to 2002 and Mayor of       Columbus Georgia from 2003 to 2007 all the while strongly       advocating on behalf of Veterans in the Columbus community       until his passing last September.        Colonel Poydasheff was the embodiment of Army values of       loyalty, duty, respect and selfless service to his fellow       Veterans and his Country. The Veterans of Foreign Wars of       Georgia would like to honor his amazing legacy with our full       support and encourage the committee to support legislation       renaming the Columbus Veterans Clinic after this       distinguished member of our State.

Willis, Jr.,                                     State Commander, VFW Department      of Georgia.                                   ____                                                     March 30, 2021.      Mark Takano,      Chairman, House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Mike Bost,      House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Takano and Ranking Member Bost: Please accept       this letter as demonstrating the total support of the Georgia       Department of the Disabled American Veterans, in recognition       of the ongoing initiative to rename the new Veterans'       Administration Clinic in Columbus, Georgia to the Robert S.       Poydasheff Veterans' Clinic, in memory of United States Army       colonel (retired) and mayor of Columbus, Robert S.       Poydasheff.        Mayor Poydasheff's model of selflessness in the areas of       military service and civic responsibility should be a shining       example for all Americans to follow.        Robert Poydasheff, who passed away last September, served       as Mayor of Columbus from 2003 to 2007. He had previously       been a City Counselor from 1994 to 2002. Throughout Mayor       Poydasheff's career, he strongly advocated on behalf of       veterans in the Columbus community because he was a veteran       himself, having served in the United States Army for twenty-      four years before retiring at the rank of colonel. He began       his military service as an Infantry Officer, where he served       one combat tour in Vietnam, before transferring to the Judge       Advocate General Corps where he worked in several positions       for the Secretary of the Army.        Mayor Poydasheff embodied the Army values of loyalty, duty,       respect and selfless service to his fellow veterans and his       country. We would like to honor his outstanding legacy. To       that end, we offer our support, and encourage the committee       to support legislation remaining the Columbus facility as the       Robert S. Poydasheff Veterans Clinic.            Sincerely,      Carolyn V. Small,        Commander, Disabled American Veterans, Department of       Georgia.     Mr. Speaker, I enthusiastically support the naming of the  Columbus, Georgia, VA Community Clinic in Robert S. Poydasheff's honor.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Georgia (Mr. Bishop), my good friend, the chairman of the Agriculture  Subcommittee of the House Committee on Appropriations, and also a  former member of the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs.    Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I am  prepared to close.   Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in passing H.R.  3475, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to  include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.    Madam Speaker, today's Special Order hour marks the 10- year anniversary of the enactment of the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal  Act of 2010. This legislation represented the end of an era, the close  of a dark chapter in our military history in which LGBTQ members of the  Armed Forces were forced to hide who they were under the threat of  investigation and discharge. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and  queer servicemembers of that era paid a heavy cost to serve their  country, one that required them to uphold an uncompromising oath of  integrity while at the same time publicly denying a fundamental aspect  of their lives. It is thanks to their resilience, their strength, and  their activism that repeal was ever achieved, and we honor those  veterans today.   I believe it is important to hear from the veterans themselves from  those who served and survived Don't Ask, Don't Tell. It is my pleasure  this evening to welcome a number of my colleagues to the floor to read  the testimony of five individuals who served under Don't Ask, Don't  Tell.   It is my distinct privilege to start with the testimony of Lindsay  Church, a Navy veteran who served from 2008 to 2012. Lindsay is a  third-generation sailor and the sixth in their family to serve in the  military. They are a cofounder and executive director of the veteran  serving organization Minority Veterans of America and have nearly a  decade of experience in veterans advocacy. And this is Lindsay's story:  [[Page H4552]]    ``In 2008, I joined the Navy where I would serve for 4 years before  being medically retired. I served all but 3 months of my time under the  military's discriminatory Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy. I could tell  you a lot of stories that range from bullying and reprimand for  my nonbinary appearance, failed relationships due to the fact that I  had to hide them at every turn, and exploitation by other  servicemembers threatening to tell my secret if I didn't continue to  date them. Even as I spent months recovering from life-changing  injuries as a result of my service, I was made to suffer alone because  my relationships were legally prohibited.    ``As I have unpacked my service as a veteran, I look back at the  intense scars that Don't Ask, Don't Tell inflicted on my life. In  conversations with other Don't Ask, Don't Tell survivors, I have come  to realize that serving under this policy has left a generation of  queer servicemembers with intense trauma and a fracture of our  identities. For veterans like myself, we were often faced with a choice  upon leaving the military and coming to the veteran community: Be a  veteran or be queer because you can't be both here.   ``It has taken me nearly a decade since leaving the service to find  healing and engage in healthy relationships. I couldn't speak out  against this policy when I was in uniform, so it is imperative for me  today to remind this body that policies like Don't Ask, Don't Tell  cause widespread trauma and harm to generations of servicemembers who  fought for our country but were forced to remain voiceless. Moral  injury will follow with each of us for the rest of our lives.   ``My story of service was tarnished by Don't Ask, Don't Tell. Every  day I carried a lie while attempting to live up to the Navy's core  values of honor, courage, and commitment. I am deeply proud of the  years of my life I gave to serving my country, and that will never  change. The scars I carry as a result of that service will also never  change. Though they may fade, they will never be forgotten.''   So I would like to extend my deep thanks to Lindsay, both for their  service and the courage to share their story.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr.  Cicilline), chair of the Congressional Equality Caucus.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Cicilline for that  testimony that he read on behalf of John Hegwood, former Army  servicemember.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr.  Pappas) to share the story of Air Force veteran Landon Marchant.    Madam Speaker, I thank Representative Pappas for sharing  the testimony of Landon Marchant.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr.  Moulton), a Congressman who himself is a Marine veteran, to share the  story of Air Force veteran Hanna Tripp.    Madam Chair, I express my gratitude to the gentleman from  Massachusetts for sharing Hanna Tripp's story. She truly is and was a  courageous member of our Armed Forces, and it was very moving  testimony. I read it in advance and nearly teared up.   I thank the Member for being here today to share with the rest of the  country who Hanna is. I thank all the Members for sharing the stories  of our LGBTQ members.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Ms.  Spanberger), my colleague, to share the story of Army veteran Stephanie  Merlo.    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Virginia for  sharing the very moving story of Stephanie Merlo, for expressing her  humanity on the floor today. The Representative exemplifies, to me, the  best of my Caucus, the Democratic Caucus, and the values we stand up  for, which is to include more people in ``we the people.''   Madam Speaker, this concludes our Special Order hour. I thank my  colleagues for their participation and each of the veterans who shared  their stories and, in particular, every veteran and servicemember who  gave their service to our country in the face of overwhelming  prejudice.   We recognize today as the 10th anniversary of an important first step  toward making the Armed Forces more inclusive and accepting, a  commitment that I and all my colleagues here today will continue to  carry forward.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
