 Madam Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise  today to mourn the passing of Norman Franck, a fire police officer and  member of the Willow Street Fire Company.   After responding to a crash this past weekend, Norman fell ill and  then passed away at Lancaster General Hospital. It was a tremendous  loss to our community and, certainly, even more so to his wife, Marian.   Today, we remember her in our thoughts and prayers and wish her  comfort and peace in this time of mourning.                                time  1030    Norman will be remembered as a giving man, described by Willow Street  Fire Company Chief Craig Rhineer as someone who would do anything for  you. Norman, by the way, was also considered an authority on the  history of the Willow Street Fire Company.   He lived a life in service to the community, as a member of the fire  service and ambulance company since the 1980s. When he moved to  Maryland, he served there at the St. Michael's Volunteer Fire Company.  Then, after returning to Lancaster County, he resumed his service once  again at the Willow Street Fire Company.   Even at age 81, Norman still selflessly served his community. His  spirit of volunteerism, his spirit of giving, should be an example for  us all.   We thank him for his years of service.   Madam Speaker, I ask everyone to join me in keeping his family and  the members of Willow Street Fire Company in our prayers.   Madam Speaker, members of our volunteer fire companies are true  heroes. Today, we honor Norman Franck, a hero who served in my  community.                            ____________________
