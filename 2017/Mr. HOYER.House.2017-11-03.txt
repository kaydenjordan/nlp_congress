 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr.  McCarthy), the majority leader, for the purpose of inquiring about the  schedule for the week to come.   (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for that information.   First, I want to start by saying that the majority leader and I and  four other Members of the House had an opportunity to visit both Puerto  Rico and the Virgin Islands last weekend since we had our last  colloquy.   First, I want to thank the majority leader for organizing that trip  and including me on it. It was an eye-opening trip. The majority leader  and I have done an op-ed, which will be appearing sometime in the near  term, on our observations.   One of the things, Mr. Speaker, that I know the majority leader and I  had the opportunity to see, we were in Marathon, where you had housing  that was built after Andrew and housing that was built before Andrew.   Now, the difference was, after Andrew, that extraordinary hurricane,  the building code was changed. We saw the stark difference between  housing that survived essentially Maria and Irma and housing that did  not, and the difference was, of course, that the housing that survived  was built to different standards after Andrew.   The majority leader and I discussed this matter, along with Mr.  Bishop, who chairs the committee that oversees both Puerto Rico and the  Virgin Islands, and I think all of us are convinced that it would be  penny-wise and pound-foolish not to build back, as Florida did, to  standards that can withstand storms of this type.   So I wanted to thank the majority leader for his leadership on this  issue.   The majority leader took the extraordinary effort to climb down a  river bank, go across the river--the river was very low at that point  in time--and then up a very long ladder, because people were stranded  on the other side. The majority leader went to see them and assure them  that we would not forget them.   We were the first codel to go to the interior of Puerto Rico, as  opposed to simply go to San Juan or another large city, so I thank the  majority leader for his leadership on that issue.   Mr. Leader, let me ask you about tax reform. That, of course, has  been the big issue for some period of time now, but now we have a bill  that is not on the floor yet, but was released yesterday.   It is clear this bill will cut taxes, in our view, for the wealthy. I  don't know the statistics yet, what the division is, whether it is 80/ 20, as the initial proposal was, or perhaps a little less than that  that goes to those over $900,000 in income. But, in any event, it also  eliminates tax preferences that the middle class families rely on, and,  obviously, we think it is going to face hurdles in Congress.   What I wanted to ask was: When does the gentleman expect the bill to  be marked up?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments. He  talks about IPAB. Of course, we add the $17.5 billion to the debt.   The gentleman did not mention the $1.5 trillion in additional debt  that the passage of the tax bill will result in, but he did talk about  some people who are going to be really advantaged.   So I would like to ask the majority leader: Will those people who  will be advantaged or, for that matter, disadvantaged have the  opportunity next week to testify in a hearing on the substance of this  bill?   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, he did not answer my question, however. Will  people have an opportunity to testify on this bill? The answer is no.  No American will have an opportunity to come to a hearing.   In 1968, the gentleman from California, the majority leader, was not  here. I was here. We had hearings over months, both sides of the aisle.  Over 450 witnesses testified not on tax bills that may have been  offered at some time in the future, including the Camp bill.   When the Camp bill, Mr. Speaker, was reported--actually, it wasn't  reported. When it was put on the table by Chairman Camp from Michigan,  who is now retired, the Speaker's response was, when asked by the  press, ``What are you going to do with that bill?'' he said, blah,  blah, blah, blah. In other words, what he was saying was all talk. We  are not going to do anything with that bill, and that bill never saw  the light of day.   It was paid for, Mr. Speaker. It was tough love. I didn't agree with  everything in the Camp bill, but I congratulate Congressman Camp for  having the courage to put a bill on the floor that was paid for, not  creating $1.5 trillion in additional debt that our children will have  to pay. They are not here to testify either.   I don't want to really get into a debate on the specifics. We are  going to have a lot of time to do that next week, and I intend to do it  next week, but he talked about small businesses being reduced to 25  percent. They will be if they make over $500,000.   That is why the NFIB is not for this bill, Mr. Speaker, talking about  small business. They are the spokespersons for small businesses, and  they are not for this bill.   We will talk about the substance, but the process mirrors the process  for the Affordable Care Act: no hearings, no witnesses, very, very  little time for the public or the Congress to digest the substance of  this bill dropped yesterday. It is going to be marked up on Monday.  That is 96 hours to consider a bill well over 500 pages.   Mr. Speaker, I asked about process. The reason I asked about process  and regular order is because regular order provides for input from the  people we serve, the public, about whether the bill is good, bad, or  indifferent and how it will impact them.   We are going to debate it here. We represent those people. But  regular order is hearing from them before we act, not after we act.   Yes, we are replicating the Affordable Care Act: put on the table,  quickly passed, jammed through, sent to the Senate. And it didn't work,  Mr. Speaker. I don't think this will work either.   I was here in 1986, Mr. Speaker, when Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan,  Bob Packwood, who was the Republican's chair of the Senate Finance  Committee, and Dan Rostenkowski from Illinois, the Democratic chairman  of the Ways and Means Committee, worked together with Jim Baker, the  former Secretary of State but then Secretary of the Treasury, worked  with us to  [[Page H8477]]  come up with a bill that could be passed. And it was passed, Mr.  Speaker, with overwhelming votes from both sides of the aisle. It was  the last time we passed tax reform. Since then, we have just passed tax  cuts.   Under Ronald Reagan, we passed a tax cut in 1981. The deficit  increased under Ronald Reagan 189 percent. Under George H.W. Bush, the  deficit increased 55 percent in 4 years, 189 percent in 8 years. Under  Bill Clinton, the debt increased 36 percent; George Bush, 87 percent  after the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, and we were promised that they were  going to energize the economy and dynamic scoring would come into  effect and the country would be rolling in clover. Seven years later,  we had the deepest recession anybody serving in this body has  experienced, Mr. Speaker, and the debt exploded.   Barack Obama, just by contrast, inherited the worst economy any of us  has seen--the worst economy--hemorrhaging 787,000 jobs per month in  January of 2009. We had to bring the economy out of that deep  recession, and we invested dollars. But even given all that necessity  and the $700 billion bill that we passed, that George Bush passed,  where two-thirds of Republicans were opposed and which kept us out of a  depression, Barack Obama increased the debt by 1 percentage point more  than George Bush.   I say to my friend, the reason for having hearings, the reason for  having economic experts like Mr. Bartlett, who worked for Ronald  Reagan, who said that tax cuts do not pay for themselves. They say $1.5  trillion. I guarantee you, Mr. Speaker--I may not be here when we can  find this out--this is going to be far above $1.5 trillion in  additional debt, and my children and my grandchildren and my great- grandchildren will be exposed to paying that bill.   It is a shame, Mr. Speaker, that we do not have extensive hearings on  this bill in the House and in the Senate. My judgment is the Senate  doesn't expect to have hearings on this either. They are just going to  try to jam it through, Mr. Speaker, and that is not good. That is not  good for this institution. Much, much more importantly, it is not good  for the present generation or generations to come.   We will debate, Mr. Leader. I know you are passionate about the  substance. You are very knowledgeable about the substance. We talked  about it in private, and I admire the passion that you have and the  information that you argue. I may differ with your information, but we  will have the opportunity to debate that, I think, next week and the  week after.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California.    Mr. Speaker, we are going to debate the substance of the  bill; we are going to debate it fully. We think it will not hold up  well under that debate. Therefore, we will have a significant  difference.   He is right. The best economy anybody in this House has experienced-- the best economy--was the last 4 years of the Clinton administration,  period. Guess what we had? We had a little bit of a tax increase. We  increased the gasoline tax, and we tried to pay to for infrastructure.  We haven't increased it since then.   The Republicans said: You do that, oh, the economy is going to go  down the drain. The best economy any Republican has experienced in  their lifetime is under Bill Clinton. We balanced the budget 4 years in  a row under Bill Clinton, the only President you can mention that  balanced.   It never balanced under Ronald Reagan. It never balanced under George  H.W. Bush. It never balanced under George Bush. As a matter of fact, as  soon as they took office, they made sure we wouldn't have further  balances because they cut taxes in 2001 and 2003, but they didn't cut  spending.   He talks about President Obama. I know the majority leader will be  interested in these statistics. I didn't count January of 2017 because,  after all, that was the Obama economy. Trump had not done anything on  the economy, but let's start with February 2017.   Under Donald Trump, 232,000 jobs were created. That is great. That is  good. I would say that the Obama economy is still working.   Same exact month a year earlier, not 232, but 237,000 jobs were  created under Barack Obama.   March 2017, 50,000 under Trump. March 2016, 225,000 jobs created  under Barack Obama.   April 2017, 207,000 jobs. Barack Obama was a little down that month,  153,000 jobs.   145,000 under Trump, 43,000.   Then June of 2017, 210,000 under Donald Trump, 297,000 jobs under  Barack Obama.   July of 2017, we are getting more recent. Under Trump--now he has  been in  [[Page H8478]]  office a little longer--138,000. What was it under Barack Obama?  291,000 jobs--double.   August of this year, just a few months ago, 169,000 under Donald  Trump; 176,000.   Last month we had hurricanes. I will give the majority leader that.  We lost 33,000 jobs. Under Barack Obama, same month a year ago, 249,000  jobs created.   As a matter of fact, under Barack Obama, we created 11,773,000 jobs.                                time  1145    Under George Bush, 2 million--excuse me--lost under George Bush,  private sector jobs, a loss, after the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, lost  1,159,000 jobs. The last 12 months of the George Bush administration,  2001 and 2003 tax cuts, we couldn't change economic policy. We were in  charge for the last 2 years, couldn't change it, lost 4,568,000 jobs.   Now, as a matter of fact, I have done a little thing for 68 years.  Over 68 years, we had 36 years of Republican Presidents and 32 years of  Democratic Presidents. Under Republican Presidents, from Truman to  Obama, there were 35,448,000 jobs created, Mr. Leader. Under Democrats,  in 32 years, 62,669,000 jobs.   Now, I would like to go on to another subject, as we could go on  debating this all day, but I will yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, you noticed that he didn't talk about any of  the statistics I mentioned about job creation under Barack Obama. He  didn't talk about the 62 million jobs that were created in 32 years, as  opposed to the 35 million jobs, just half of what we did in less than 4  years than they had as President of the United States.   And what he didn't talk about was--he said: You know, we Republicans  were in charge of the Congress the last 6 years of the Clinton  administration.   That is right.   And what Bill Clinton said: Let's save Social Security first. Let's  not cut out revenues that we need to invest in the education and the  growth of our economy.   They weren't for that, but they couldn't do anything about it.   Then, guess what happened. They took the Presidency. They had the  House and they had the Senate.   Why couldn't you do what was done under Bill Clinton then, when you  controlled everything, I ask my Republican friends, Mr. Speaker? Why  couldn't you, when you controlled every organ of government, do what  you say was done under the Clinton administration, because you were in  the minority, very frankly, or you were in the majority and controlled  things? Why couldn't you do it when you controlled everything? Why did  you leave us with 4.8 million hemorrhaging jobs as you came out of  office, and your economic program was still in place that you put in  place in 2001 and 2003, and the deepest recession you and I have  experienced in our life times?   And I am older than you are. You didn't answer that. You continue to  talk about what is going to happen.   I tell the story about the guy who comes in and he wants to be the  left fielder for the Nats, and he says: You know, I am going to hit 350  next year.   I said: But you hit 260 last year.   He says: Well, yeah, I know, but this year I am going to hit 350.   And the other guy comes in and says: I would like the same job. I hit  325 this year and I hit 324 last year. Who do you think you hire?   The whole point is, Mr. Leader--I say to the Speaker--is that  performance counts, not just talk, not just promises. Because I will  tell you, Mr. Leader, I have been here a long time and I heard the same  language in 1981 from David Stockman. He now says it was baloney. I  heard the same talk in 2001 and 2003. It didn't work out so well.    So, Mr. Speaker, I am going to go on to another subject because we  need to go to another subject, but we need to have this debate because  it is critical for my children, my grandchildren, and my great- grandchildren, and for generations to come as to whether this country  is, like we did it under Clinton, on a fiscally sustainable path where  we are balancing budgets, or whether we are going to go back to the  deep deficits.   He didn't respond, 189 percent increase in the debt under Ronald  Reagan. One person in America, Mr. Speaker, can stop spending: the  President. He can veto spending bills.   In my 37 years, we have never had a veto overridden of a President  who vetoed a bill because we spent too much money; not once in the 37  years I have been here, Mr. Speaker.   But I want to go on to another subject that ought to be less  controversial because I think the majority of Republicans and I think,  unanimously, the Democrats want to see us do what the President,  apparently, has asked us to do. And that is, protect the DACA students,  the DACA doctors, the DACA teachers.   We have a Dream Act that has been filed. Every Democrat supports it.  We want that to come to the floor in this transparent, open process,  and I have talked to the majority leader about it.   The President, contrary to Speaker Ryan's advice, rescinded the  protections for the childhood arrivals who arrived here through no  fault of their own. He said to the Congress, it needs to be done in  legislation. He didn't say it needs to be done in legislation with a  lot of other things. And the Speaker has said we are going to take one  issue at a time. I won't bring out that quote, but the majority leader  has heard me use it before.   So I urge the majority leader because I believe he does not want to  send these mostly young people who don't know any other country but  America, who see themselves as Americans, who have  [[Page H8479]]  been educated in our schools, serving in our communities, positive  participants in growing America like so many immigrants before them, a  nation of immigrants. Send me your tired, your poor, your huddled  masses.   We should have the DACA bill on the floor before we leave for this  Thanksgiving. Mr. Leader, I said this with respect to the Export-Import  Bank, that a majority of your party would vote for that if it came to  the floor. We got it to the floor and, as I predicted, a majority of  your Members voted for it.   I believe that very close to, if not all, a majority of your party  will vote for this, and the overwhelming numbers in this House will  vote for that bill.   I would urge my friend to bring it to the floor before we leave for  the Thanksgiving break on the 16th of November. I would urge that  because we are going to have some very messy 8 days after Thanksgiving,  with great workload on our desks; not the least of which is how to deal  with the sequester, how to deal with funding government for the balance  of the year, what to do with flood insurance, and so many other issues;  not to mention our supplemental that we need to do with respect to  Houston and Florida and Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands.   So I urge my friend to work with us to bring the Dream Act to the  floor, or bring your alternative to the floor. But let us not leave  these people, who the President says he loves, who are positive  Americans in everything but paper, who have been here almost all of  their lives. Some came at 2 or 3 years of age and know no other  country. Let's bring a bill to the floor that we can end before we go  on the Thanksgiving break, in a united way--we are going to be divided  on the tax bill. We understand that--but in a united way on this, where  even Rush Limbaugh says we are not going to send these kids home.   I would hope that you could do that, Mr. Leader. I believe you have  it in your heart to do it, and I would hope that we could do it.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.    Mr. Speaker, let me remind the leader that we passed the  Dream Act through the House of Representatives. We brought it to the  floor. We had a vote on it.   I know you and the Speaker said there was going to be a working task  force on this issue, and it has been, I think, going on for nigh on to  a month, but we haven't seen anything on the floor.   Mr. Leader, what I am saying is that I think we agree on this issue.  Let us not confuse it with things on which we do not agree. Don't hold  hostage these 800,000 young people who are positive--because if they  are not positive they couldn't get into the Dream Act--I mean, they  couldn't get into DACA. They had to have a sterling performance, be in  school, be working, be in the Armed Forces. This is not a free pass to  people.   We agree on this, I think. Maybe I am wrong on that, but it seems to  me that we agree. The President seems to agree.   Wouldn't it be--as we have done in the past some bipartisan things,  and we thought that was good for the institution and good for the  American people to see us work in a bipartisan fashion. I think we  agree on this issue.   Some of the things you want to attach to it, we are going to have  disagreements on. Why don't we enact what we agree upon?   By the way, this has been pending for a long period of time, as  opposed to your tax bill. I know you think we have had hearings on it,  but, very frankly, that bill changed from Tuesday to Thursday of last  week.                                time  1200    We think your bill is a pretty new bill and we would like to have  hearings on it. But nevertheless, on DACA, I think we have an  agreement. If you bring it to the floor, I think it will get a majority  of the votes, a significant majority. I think it will get close to 300,  if not over. So I would just urge my friend to see if he, as the  majority leader--I was the majority leader--as the gentleman knows, I  could bring a bill to the floor or I could keep it off the floor. This  is a bill that ought to come to the floor. We ought to give peace of  mind to these 800,000 of folks, and we ought to pass this bill and give  the House an opportunity to work its will.   Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman does not want to say anything further,  I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
