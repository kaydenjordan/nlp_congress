 Mr. Chairman, no one can deny we have a readiness  issue within our military due to funding shortfalls. This comes at a  time when we are facing unprecedented threats all over the globe. Our  Constitution makes it clear that our top priority and duty is to  provide for the common defense.   In World War II, Americans willingly rationed whatever was necessary  to support the war effort and our troops. It would have been  unthinkable--unimaginable--for someone to suggest that our military  could not have the resources necessary to defeat our enemies, unless we  had equal spending for everything else. Simply put, we would have lost  the war and our freedom.   We cannot lose sight or take for granted our Nation's safety and  security. Without it, the rest of the discretionary budget really  doesn't matter so much.   I fear America has lost its way if we live in a culture that would  suggest that we can't support our most vital obligation without equal  financial representation of our other government expenditures.   I urge my colleagues to give our full support to the men and women in  uniform, support the underlying bill, but oppose this amendment that  adds unnecessarily to our debt and further threatens our ability to  keep our Nation safe for the remaining threats we face.
