 Mr. Speaker, it is getting time for Halloween, so they have  put on the disguise on the other side. So what we are hearing today is,  from the last two Republican speakers: This is a bad budget. Let's vote  ``yes.''  [[Page H8250]]    The gentleman from Ohio said a while ago, this is all about the  middle class. The middle class does not pay an estate tax. The middle  class, because of our efforts--and, I think, mine in particular--no  longer pay the alternative minimum tax. And the people in the middle  class are not locked into the 39.6 top rate in the Tax Code. This is a  disguise.   They are adding $1.5 trillion to the debt and, actually, over 10  years, when you borrow the money, they are adding $2.3 trillion to the  debt, all for a tax cut for people at the very top.   Now, let me say this: I am happy to negotiate a tax reform package  that we can all live with. I am happy to sit down with the other side  and acknowledge some parts of the Code that clearly don't work any  longer for the American people.   This is being done by one party, exclusively. They have not  negotiated with us. They have not given us the opening. They have not  said to us: ``Where do you want to proceed on this?''   Instead, if you pass this budget today, they suggest you are going to  see their plan on November 1, and you are going to vote for it sometime  around November 6. That is not negotiation.   The Congress I signed up for actually negotiated these agreements,  and if you couldn't love the final passage, at least you could like it  because you had sufficient input. That is not what has happened, Mr.  Speaker, in this process.   This process is one-sided. It is one-dimensional. They  interchangeably use the words ``tax cut'' and ``tax reform.'' This is  about a tax cut.
