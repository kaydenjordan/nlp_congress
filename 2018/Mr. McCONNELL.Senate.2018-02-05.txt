 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the  order for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I wish to begin this afternoon by  offering condolences to the family and friends of Christopher Foley of  Louisa County, VA. Mr. Foley was killed last Wednesday when his truck  collided with an Amtrak train carrying many of my fellow lawmakers to a  conference in West Virginia. He was just 28 years old. He leaves behind  his fiancee Adriana and Rylan, their 1-year-old son.   Our thoughts are with them especially, along with Christopher's  family, his community, and his colleagues at Time Disposal. They and  all those who were injured in the accident are in our prayers.   Our heartfelt thanks are with the first responders who rushed to the  scene. It is too easy to take for granted  [[Page S601]]  that our brave law enforcement, firefighters, and emergency personnel  will be there for us on our worst days, forgetting that, for them,  heroism and service are everyday realities. I would like to recognize  some of our own colleagues who immediately sprang into action to assist  the wounded. Senator Cassidy and Congressmen Wenstrup, Burgess, Roe,  and Bucshon are all doctors by training, as are Senator Cassidy's wife  Laura and Congressman Bucshon's wife Kathryn. All of them sprang into  action and rushed to aid the victims, alongside our attending  physician, Dr. Brian Monahan. Senator Flake and several others also  hurried to help.   I thank all of them for their efforts when every moment counted, and  I am proud to call them colleagues and friends.                            ____________________     Madam President, on a related matter, in the few days  since last week's tragedy, yet another fatal train crash has already  taken place. Two lives were lost yesterday when a passenger train and a  freight train collided in South Carolina. Last December, three people  were killed and scores were injured near Seattle when a passenger train  jumped its tracks and crashed into a busy highway.   This worrying spate of accidents offers a sobering reminder that  partisan obstruction has kept the Federal Railroad Administration, the  top rail regulator, without an Administrator.   The President's nominee, Ronald Batory, has more than 40 years of  rail experience. I know of no questions about his qualifications. He  was reported out of committee by voice vote on August 2 of last year,  meaning that this important safety regulator has now been sitting on  the Senate calendar for 6 months--6 months. My Democratic colleagues  are holding his nomination over a parochial issue that is completely  unrelated to rail safety. This needs to come to an end.   The FRA Administrator is the Nation's top rail safety regulator.  There is an urgent need and a highly qualified candidate. I hope my  colleagues on the other side of the aisle will put a stop to their  partisan games on this front. We can and should confirm Mr. Batory  today--today.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, our deadline to  fund the Federal Government is this Thursday. Serious bipartisan  negotiations continue on long-term spending levels, along with other  important issues. I am optimistic that these talks will bear fruit.   In the meantime, as broader discussions continue, we have the  opportunity to remove the uncertainty facing our all-volunteer Armed  Forces.   Since the passage of the Budget Control Act, it has become  increasingly obvious that current funding levels are not sufficient for  our Armed Forces to accomplish each of the missions and tasks that our  Nation asks of them.   Secretary Mattis's new national defense strategy will require  considerable new investment, and he has repeatedly pointed out that  short-term continuing resolutions harm the readiness of our forces.   I am pleased that we are making real headway in our negotiations over  spending caps and other important issues, but there is no reason why  our warfighters need to continue to face uncertainty until all of the  other issues are resolved.   Last week, a bipartisan majority in the House passed a bill that  would fund our national defense through fiscal year 2018. Democrats and  Republicans came together, voting to secure adequate, predictable,  annual funding for our Armed Forces while we continue our productive  negotiations on all these other subjects. The Senate will soon take up  this House-passed bill.   I have recently heard many of my Democratic colleagues detail the  harmful effects of short-term funding measures on our servicemembers.  Soon, each one of us will have a chance to vote to give them the  certainty they deserve while our other work continues.                            ____________________     Madam President, on one final matter, in the State of  the Union Address last week, President Trump detailed signs that our  Nation's economy is thriving under the policies of his administration  and this Republican Congress. Evidence keeps piling up that good things  happen when the government takes its foot off the brake and gets out of  the way of American workers and job creators.   Last week, UPS, the largest private employer in my hometown of  Louisville, KY, announced that tax reform will enable them to invest  $12 billion in expanding their smart logistics network, funding  employee pensions, and other capital improvements.   Their chairman and CEO had this to say:         We applaud President Trump and Congress for their bold       action. . . . Tax reform is a tremendous catalyst.    On Thursday, another major American employer, Lowe's, announced that  it will give bonuses of up to $1,000 to more than a quarter of a  million hourly employees and expand family friendly employment  benefits, like adoption assistance and paid parental leave.   The very same day, the major pharmaceutical company Amgen, which  houses a distribution facility in Louisville, announced that tax reform  is causing them to shift more of their planned investments here to the  United States, including the construction of a new ``next-generation  manufacturing plant'' right here at home.   Already, our historic tax reform law is giving employers the  flexibility to invest more, expand more, hire more American workers,  and give bonuses, pay raises, and new benefits to their employees, and,  already, middle-class families across the country are seeing the  benefits.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate my friend  Dr. Jo Marshall, president and CEO of the Somerset Community College,  SCC, on her upcoming retirement. Taking over the helm of the school in  Somerset, KY, in 2000, Jo has led the school through its unprecedented  growth. When she leaves SCC at the end of June, she will leave behind a  legacy of innovation, achievement, and inspiration.   Originally from Alabama, Jo worked as the vice president and dean at  Chattahoochee Valley Community College before moving to Somerset with  her husband, Scott, to accept the position as president and CEO of SCC.  After he retired from the Alabama college system, Scott taught  economics at Eastern Kentucky University until he passed away in 2011.   The Kentucky Community and Technical College System, KCTCS, operates  16 colleges, including SCC, serving nearly 80,000 students throughout  Kentucky. Under Jo's leadership, SCC has become one of the preeminent  members of KCTCS and one of the fastest growing community colleges in  the Nation. Many of the students who graduate from SCC go on to make  important contributions to their community and the economy.   The school, founded in 1965, has grown exponentially during Jo's  presidency. She oversaw SCC's merger with the Somerset Technical  College and the Laurel Technical College in 2003, expanding the number  of programs offered to SCC's students. Under Jo's leadership, SCC also  saw its largest enrollment in the school's history. To facilitate this  growth, Jo oversaw the addition of seven new buildings to the  institution. Further, she helped launch a scholarship foundation to  help students of diverse economic backgrounds attend SCC to earn  degrees or credentials with the goal of preparing them for successful  careers. During a time of economic hardship for many Kentuckians, this  was an important accomplishment in the region. Today that scholarship  foundation is worth nearly $1 million. These are just a few examples of  what will make Jo's legacy at SCC a lasting one. By any measure, each  of these notable accomplishments under her leadership improved SCC, its  reputation, and its impact on students.   In addition to her commitment to growing SCC as an institution and  enhancing its impact on its students and the region, Jo has also worked  to support SCC students by providing them with the tools they need to  succeed upon graduation. For example, working with local business  leaders, she has established various programs to help students find  good-paying, high-demand jobs by offering short-term certificates and  diploma options. For SCC students wishing to continue their education,  Jo has also worked with 4-year colleges and universities throughout  Kentucky to help expand opportunities for students who wish to complete  a bachelor's degree.   Because of her leadership, and the efforts of everyone involved at  the school, SCC consistently has won a number of awards. SCC was named  a Military Friendly School, and the Chronicle of Higher Education named  it a Great College to Work For. In addition, SCC was called a Best  Place to Work in Kentucky by the Best Companies Group every year for a  decade. Finally, the Aspen Institute's College Excellence Program,  which ``aims to advance higher education practices, policies, and  leadership'' in an effort to help schools improve student outcomes, has  also named SCC a Top 120 Community College in the United States. These  national accolades for SCC under Jo's leadership showcase her passion  for SCC, its faculty and students, and the community.   It would also come as no surprise to those of us who know Jo and her  work that she has been the recipient of many well-earned awards as a  result of her time at SCC. In 2011, the Somerset-Pulaski County Chamber  of Commerce named her its Business Woman of the Year. She received the  Master Musician's Festival Lifetime Achievement Award in 2015, and the  Somerset Business and Professional Women's Club named Jo the Business  Woman of the Year in 2017.   In addition to her transformational work at SCC, Jo has also  dedicated her talents to the Southeastern Kentucky community in other  ways. She currently serves on the board of directors for the Center for  Rural Development and the Southern Kentucky Economic Development  Corporation. Jo is also a former member of the Lake Cumberland Regional  Hospital board of trustees.   Her community college peers have recognized her outstanding success  at SCC. Phi Theta Kappa, one of the largest and most prestigious honor  societies for community colleges, established the Marshall Leadership  Award in 2013. Named in Jo's honor, the international award is given to  Phi Theta Kappa advisors to boost their professional growth beyond the  completion of professional degrees.   On a more personal note, I have always enjoyed being in Somerset and  getting to visit with Jo in her position as president of SCC. In 2015,  I had the privilege of participating in the school's ``John Sherman  Cooper Lecture Series,'' an annual reflection on  [[Page S603]]  the accomplishments and character of my role model, Senator Cooper.  Like each of my meetings with Jo during her time leading SCC, I truly  enjoyed this experience.   In her retirement, I know that Jo looks forward to spending more time  with her children, Kristin and Scott, Jr., both accomplished in their  own right, and her five grandchildren. She has certainly earned it. I  would like to take this opportunity to thank my friend for her work to  help prepare the students of southeastern Kentucky to enter the  workforce and thrive. I am sure that SCC will miss her steady hand.  However, the wide breath of accomplishments she oversaw throughout the  last 18 years has set the school on a course of continued success. I  know her community is grateful for her work, and I urge my Senate  colleagues to join me in celebrating Jo's stellar career.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I understand that there are three bills  at the desk, and I ask for their first reading en bloc.    Mr. President, I now ask for a second reading, and I  object to my own request, all en bloc.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation be discharged from  further consideration of H.R. 582 and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be  read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Tuesday,  February 6; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day; further, that following leader remarks, the Senate be in a period  of morning business, with Senators permitted to speak therein until 12  noon, and that the time be equally divided between the two leaders or  their designees; finally, that the Senate recess from 12:30 p.m. until  2:15 p.m.    Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:34 p.m., adjourned until  Tuesday, February 6, 2018, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
