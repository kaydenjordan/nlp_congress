 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the passing of  the bipartisan Hamas International Financing Prevention Act in the  House of Representatives.   I helped introduce this bipartisan legislation with Representative  Brian Mast and helped lead it to overwhelmingly pass the House 363-46.   This legislation imposes sanctions on foreign persons, agencies, and  governments that assist terrorist organizations, including Iranian- backed Hamas,  [[Page H5382]]  Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and other affiliates.   On October 7, the world watched Hamas terrorists invade Israel and  brutally kidnap, behead, torture, rape, burn, and murder innocent  babies, children, women, and the elderly, including dozens of  Americans. This unprovoked war has underscored why I will always stand  with Israel and support our partner's right to defend herself from  those who seek her destruction.   This bipartisan legislation will ensure we isolate and punish these  radical terrorist groups by cutting off their financial resources at  the moment our ally in the Middle East needs it most.   We must do everything we can to get every hostage home, including all  Americans, help our ally Israel defend herself and crush the  terrorists, and provide much-needed humanitarian aid to innocent  Palestinian civilians being used by Hamas as human shields.   Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the Senate to immediately pass  the bipartisan Hamas International Financing Prevention Act.                            ____________________
