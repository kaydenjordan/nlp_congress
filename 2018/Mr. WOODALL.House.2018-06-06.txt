 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 918 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 918         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R.       3249) to authorize the Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant       Program, and for other purposes, with the Senate amendment       thereto, and to consider in the House, without intervention       of any point of order, a motion offered by the chair of the       Committee on the Judiciary or his designee that the House       concur in the Senate amendment. The Senate amendment and the       motion shall be considered as read. The motion shall be       debatable for one hour equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the       Judiciary. The previous question shall be considered as       ordered on the motion to adoption without intervening motion.        Sec. 2.  At any time after adoption of this resolution the       Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. 8)       to provide for improvements to the rivers and harbors of the       United States, to provide for the conservation and       development of water and related resources, and for other       purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed       with. All points of order against consideration of the bill       are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and       shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Transportation and Infrastructure. After general debate the       bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute       rule. In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute       recommended by the Committee on Transportation and       Infrastructure now printed in the bill, an amendment in the       nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules       Committee Print 115-72 shall be considered as adopted in the       House and in the Committee of the Whole. The bill, as       amended, shall be considered as the original bill for the       purpose of further amendment under the five-minute rule and       shall be considered as read. All points of order against       provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived. No further       amendment to the bill, as amended, shall be in order except       those printed in part A of the report of the Committee on       Rules accompanying this resolution. Each such further       amendment may be offered only in the order printed in the       report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the       report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for       the time specified in the report equally divided and       controlled by the proponent and an opponent, shall not be       subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand       for division of the question in the House or in the Committee       of the Whole. All points of order against such further       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report       the bill, as amended, to the House with such further       amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question       shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and       on any further amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or       without instructions.        Sec. 3.  At any time after adoption of this resolution the       Speaker may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare       the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on       the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R.       5895) making appropriations for energy and water development       and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30,       2019, and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill       shall be dispensed with. All points of order against       consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be       confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Appropriations. After general       debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the       five-minute rule. An amendment in the nature of a substitute       consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 115-71 shall       be considered as adopted in the House and in the Committee of       the Whole. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as the       original bill for the purpose of further amendment under the       five-minute rule and shall be considered as read. Points of       order against provisions in the bill, as amended, for failure       to comply with clause 2 of rule XXI are waived except as       follows: page 66, line 14, through page 66, line 20. No       further amendment to the bill, as amended, shall be in order       except those printed in part B of the report of the Committee       on Rules and pro forma amendments described in section 4 of       this resolution. Each further amendment printed in part B of       the report shall be considered only in the order printed in       the report, may be offered only by a Member designated in the       report, shall be considered as read, shall be debatable for       the time specified in the report equally divided and       controlled by the proponent and an opponent, may be withdrawn       by the proponent at any time before action thereon, shall not       be subject to amendment except as provided by section 4 of       this resolution, and shall not be subject to a demand for       division of the question in the House or in the Committee of       the Whole. All points of order against such further       amendments are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of       the bill for amendment pursuant to this resolution, the       Committee of the Whole shall rise without motion. No further       consideration of the bill shall be in order except pursuant       to a subsequent order of the House.        Sec. 4.  During consideration of H.R. 5895 for amendment,       the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Appropriations or their respective designees may offer up to       10 pro forma amendments each at any point for the purpose of       debate.        Sec. 5.  (a) During consideration of H.R. 5895, it shall       not be in order to consider an amendment proposing both a       decrease in an appropriation designated pursuant to section       251(b)(2)(A)(ii) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit       Control Act of 1985 and an increase in an appropriation not       so designated, or vice versa. (b) This paragraph shall not       apply to an amendment between the Houses.                                time  1230     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the ranking member of the Rules Committee, the  gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), pending which I yield  myself such time as I may consume. During consideration of this  resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I am excited to be down here with my friend  from Massachusetts today, Mr. Speaker. You heard the Reading Clerk work  her way through this rule. It is a big one today, and it is a big one  because we have got a lot to talk about today. I am going to try not to  go over. I appreciate the Speaker starting proceedings a little early  today so that we have time to get through all of the material that we  have to work through.   In this rule today, House Resolution 918, we are providing for three  separate appropriations bills to be considered as a single package in  addition to two other bills that are very important.   First of all, the rule today, Mr. Speaker, provides for concurrence  in the Senate amendment to the House-passed bill, H.R. 3249. It is the  Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization Act.   Mr. Speaker, our colleague from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock) has been  working so aggressively on this bill. You will remember the House  passed this bill by a voice vote back in March of this year. It went  over to the Senate. The Senate amended it. They, too,  [[Page H4786]]  passed it by unanimous consent. House Resolution 918 today provides for  the consideration to approve those Senate amendments, send this bill  directly to the President's desk, and let it begin to make a difference  in these communities right away.   The bill supports Federal, State, and local law enforcement efforts,  Mr. Speaker, to combat gang-related violence throughout our communities  and to get involved in other prevention techniques.   We have all seen street gang activities increasing in our  communities. If you are from a community that has not yet seen that  impact, consider yourself fortunate. According to the House Judiciary  Committee, Mr. Speaker, we have these crimes on the increase. We have  all been hearing about transnational gangs, such as MS-13, as they are  becoming increasingly organized and increasingly more violent.   Giving our Nation's law enforcement authorities the ability to keep  Americans safe and to have the tools they need to fight these gangs is  a priority of all of us in this institution, and approval of this rule  today will allow us to bring that bill to the floor and send it to the  President's desk for his signature.   House Resolution 918 also provides for a structured rule, Mr.  Speaker, for consideration of the first of our fiscal year 2019  appropriations bills. As I mentioned, there are three bills in this  package. H.R. 5895 combines the Energy and Water Development bill with  the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill and with the Military  Construction and Veterans Affairs bill. It puts them all under one  umbrella, maintaining our commitment to the Bipartisan Budget Act of  2018 spending caps.   The House Appropriations Committee, Mr. Speaker, has already passed 6  of the 12 annual appropriations bills. I will say that again. Six of  the 12 annual appropriations bills have already moved through the House  Appropriations Committee.   I look forward to the remainder of those bills being on this floor  very soon. In fact, the Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and  Related Agencies is marking up their bill today, and the Defense  Subcommittee is marking up their bill tomorrow.   So before the end of the week, I would expect we will have 7 of 12  appropriations bills ready for the floor, and we will be well on our  way to having an eighth ready for the floor soon. This is only the  first week of June, Mr. Speaker, and this is already the progress that  the House Appropriations Committee has achieved. I am very proud of  their success, and I want to talk a little bit about the bills they  have before us today.   You will remember, Mr. Speaker, the Legislative Branch Appropriations  bill was approved unanimously by the Appropriations Committee.  Republicans and Democrats came together to support that bill. You will  recall that we decided early on, Mr. Speaker, that thrift would begin  here in this House.   With this Legislative Branch Appropriations bill, not only are we  funding the shared priorities across the Capitol, we are also at a  funding level still below the level at which this House was funded the  year I was first elected to Congress, Mr. Speaker. Thrift does begin at  home. We have avoided being penny-wise and pound-foolish. We funded  important priorities and were again able to pass this out of committee  on a unanimous, bipartisan vote.   The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill also came out of  committee on a unanimous, bipartisan vote, 47-0 in both cases, Mr.  Speaker. And, clearly, this type of collaboration, this type of  bipartisan activity is something we would like to see more often in  this Chamber, but we have it in these two bills today.   The third appropriations bill that is bundled together here, Mr.  Speaker, is the Energy and Water bill, a bill that is tremendously  important to my part of the world there on the Georgia coast, involving  Georgia's water infrastructure. It passed the Appropriations Committee  on a slightly less powerful vote. It was 29-20, still a bipartisan  vote, but not as big a majority--in fact, not unanimous, as the others  were. But it is critically important to so many of our States, Mr.  Speaker, and I am confident we will be able to move it across the  floor.    I will just give a couple of examples. I know everybody has their own  story to tell about the importance in their State.   In my State, it provides $49 million as a Federal partnership to the  more than $300 million that the State of Georgia has already put into  deepening the Port of Savannah. The Savannah Harbor Expansion Project  is one of the largest economic development projects in the Southeastern  United States. It has a Corps of Engineers report authorizing this  construction. Georgia put all of its money in up front, and now the  Feds are coming through with $49 million of their own.   Mr. Speaker, the bill includes millions of dollars for operations and  maintenance of the Corps of Engineers. If you live in the Southeastern  United States, as I do, odds are, the Corps controls your water supply.  More than 80 percent of the people who live in the multimillion-person  metropolitan Atlanta area, Mr. Speaker, depend on Corps of Engineers  facilities for their drinking water. Eighty percent depend on Corps of  Engineers for their drinking water. It is tremendously important to  families across the district.   I am heartened that the Appropriations Committee, even though they  could not be unanimous, persisted in moving this bill through committee  in a bipartisan way, and I am optimistic of what it is going to do for  water and energy infrastructure for years to come.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, to a committee that is almost as near and dear  to my heart as the Rules Committee is, this bills brings to the floor a  bill from the Transportation Committee, H.R. 8, the Water Resources  Development Act of 2018.   Folks often think of the Veterans Affairs' Committee as being one of  the most bipartisan committees on Capitol Hill, and, candidly, I think  it makes us all proud to know that is true; but the House  Transportation Committee sits a very close second.   Infrastructure projects, whether it be safe drinking water, whether  it be roads and bridges, whether it be airport facilities, these are  issues that we all confront, and these are issues that bring us  together in an also unanimous fashion, Mr. Speaker. The House  Transportation Committee reported the Water Resources Development Act  of 2018, and we have that before us today.   If you haven't gotten to see a good committee chairman and ranking  member working in partnership, Mr. Speaker, I would recommend Chairman  Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania and Ranking Member Pete DeFazio of Oregon  to you any time. To suggest that these two men agree on everything  would be folly, but to suggest that they find a way to work through  everything would not be too much said. They never take no for an  answer. They always work hard together. In the case of the Water  Resources Development Act, Mr. Speaker, that doesn't just exist at the  committee chairman level; it exists at the subcommittee level.   On the Republican side of the aisle, we have Chairman Garret Graves  from Louisiana; and on the Democratic side of the aisle, we have  Ranking Member Grace Napolitano from California--again, two Members who  work incredibly closely together. They produce a superior work product  that you are going to be able to see in the line items in this  legislation.   We are talking about America's ports. We are talking about inland  waterways. We are talking about locks and dams. We are talking about  flood protection. We are talking about water infrastructure and  ecosystem protection. Line item after line item, we were able to come  together in a bipartisan way.   I would argue this is going to be one of the most important bills  that the Congress passes in 2018, Mr. Speaker. And, again, it took a  lot of hard, bipartisan work to get here.   Our Nation's ports, Mr. Speaker, process about $4 billion in product  a day, imports and exports. About 11 percent of everything we buy in  the State of Georgia has come through one of our ports. Nearly 440,000  jobs, Mr. Speaker, in my State alone are dependent on ports and  waterways, and there is $25 billion worth of State income from that.   And that is just a State like Georgia, Mr. Speaker. If you go to  Florida, North Carolina, Louisiana, California,  [[Page H4787]]  or Washington State, you are going to hear those same stories told time  and time again.   Now, I would like to believe, because we passed this bill out of the  Transportation Committee where transportation experts sit, that we  produced a perfect work product out of the Transportation Committee.  But wearing my Rules Committee hat, I recognize that other Members of  this Chamber may have some good ideas of their own that they would like  to make in order for the debate on the Water Resources Development Act.   To that end, the rule today, Mr. Speaker, passed by this body will  make 52 additional amendments in order to be considered for this bill.  That is 19 Republican amendments, 20 Democratic amendments, and 13  bipartisan amendments.    I will say that again, Mr. Speaker. Fifty-two amendments were made in  order by this rule for the Water Resources Development Act: 19  Republican amendments, 20 Democratic amendments, and 13 bipartisan  amendments.   All amendments are intended to make this bill better. This body will  decide, if this rule is approved, whether, in fact, they do.   We had four subcommittee meetings on WRDA this year, this cycle, Mr.  Speaker--two roundtable discussions in Florida and Oregon, and two  hearings here in Washington, D.C.--all seeking to involve stakeholders.   You may not recall, Mr. Speaker, but there was a while that this  Congress was unable to pass WRDA bills. We went through 7 years of this  Congress failing to pass any WRDA bills at all. I was not in Congress  at the time that began, but I am in Congress at the time that that  comes to an end.   Beginning with Bill Shuster's leadership there on the Transportation  Committee, we have gotten back in the habit of moving a water resources  bill every single Congress. This will be the third in that cycle, and  it matters: It matters for certainty to stakeholders back home; it  matters for certainty to constituents back home; and it matters that we  don't have to do it all in one giant omnibus bill every single time. We  are able to break it down into smaller chunks because we are taking  care of it as challenges arise, again, in a bipartisan fashion.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to sit on the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee where the kind of collaboration and mutual  respect that you have heard me talk about exists every single day.   I want to thank, again, Chairman Shuster and Ranking Member DeFazio  for making that environment one that can exist.   I think we brought a very fair rule to the floor today to try to  bring not just the Water Resources Development Act to the floor, the  Project Safe Neighborhoods Grant Program Authorization to the floor,  but also the first three appropriations bills in our annual cycle to  the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I hope all my colleagues can support the rule, I hope  they will support the underlying bills, and I reserve the balance of my  time.                                time  1245     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I didn't come to the floor today to tell anybody that  the process was perfect, and I didn't come to the floor today to tell  anybody that the pieces of legislation before us are perfect. I am  certain that they are not perfect, Mr. Speaker, because I didn't write  every line of every one of them. That is my indication that they didn't  turn out exactly right.   What I did do, however, because I serve on the committees of  jurisdiction, is I worked with my Democratic colleagues to get to a  bill that we can all be proud of.   Understand what we are talking about here today, Mr. Speaker. We can  go back and have a series of recriminations and talk about all the  injustices that have happened to each and every one of us over the  years or we can celebrate the fact that in a really difficult budget  environment we found a way to get the appropriations bills out--two out  of three of these bills today unanimously--to the floor. The third one  that didn't come out unanimously still came out with a bipartisan vote,  Mr. Speaker. We should be celebrating that, not pretending that we are  not making an honest effort with one another to get things done.   The Water Resources Development Act, Mr. Speaker, the largest water  infrastructure bill that this Congress will produce, and we produced it  on a committee that has members from the far left to the far right and  produced it unanimously, Mr. Speaker, because we did not take no for an  answer and continued to work shoulder to shoulder until we found a  place that each and every member could live with.   No, these bills are not perfect today, which is why, in the case of  WRDA, for example--again, the best work product the Transportation and  Infrastructure Committee could produce--we allowed more than 50  additional amendments--more Democratic amendments than Republican  amendments, bipartisan amendments as well--to try to improve that  language.   How does this WRDA bill come to the floor? It comes after a long  period of time where this Congress was controlled by both parties where  no WRDA bill was produced at all. I will say it again, Mr. Speaker: it  comes after a time when this Congress, controlled by both parties,  produced no Water Resources bill at all. No bill for ports, no bill for  inland waterways, no bill for water infrastructure, and no bill for  locks and dams. No bill, Mr. Speaker, at all.   Fast forward to today, Mr. Speaker. We are talking about the third  consecutive Congress where we have come together and gotten it done-- not gotten it done for one party or another, not gotten it done for one  Member or another--but gotten it done on behalf of all of our  constituents who sent us all here, not to find excuses, not to find  things to complain about, but to find a way to make it happen.   Support this rule today, Mr. Speaker. I urge all my colleagues to  support this rule today, Mr. Speaker, because if they do, we will bring  that bipartisan work product to the floor. We will bring that  unanimously approved gang violence prevention bill to the floor. And we  will bring those three appropriations bills all passing in a bipartisan  way out of committee to this floor. It is a day we can be proud of, Mr.  Speaker, and I am proud to be here with you to talk about it.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate the words of my friend from Vermont. He is absolutely  right. Fiscal conservatives, as a rule, are out there trying to save  money. Occasionally, we find ourselves in those spaces where we end up  being penny wise and pound foolish.   The flood mitigation projects that my friend from Vermont referenced  saved countless dollars, but, more importantly, countless lives. As  some of these aging infrastructure projects look to be on the brink of  failure, the time to act is now, not later.   I am glad to see that we were able to come together to invest needed  resources today in a water resources development bill so that we are  not spending dollars tomorrow in a disaster relief bill. This is the  right time to do it, and I appreciate my friend from Vermont making  that point.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would advise my friend that I am prepared  to close when he is.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, first things first. I mentioned earlier I don't think  any of these bills are perfect bills; I just think they are the best we  were able to work out together.   I do want to mention that in the Rules Committee report in the  summary of Mr. Nolan's amendment, we did describe that amendment  incorrectly. We have now corrected that for the record, that has been  submitted, but I just want to highlight that for the purposes of  transparency.   I think my friend from Massachusetts is exactly right, Mr. Speaker.  It is time for us to decide how we want to run this institution. I  don't question his numbers. He is very good. When he says this is the  most closed Congress in American history, I am sure he has some set of  numbers that backs up that attestation.   But what I know is, when I was running for Congress and Democrats  were leading this institution at the time, for the entire cycle that I  was running, Democrats allowed less than 1,000 amendments totally for  the entire session of Congress.   Mr. Speaker, this Congress, we have considered more than 1,000  amendments before the month of May got out. We haven't even gotten into  the appropriations cycle yet. That doesn't include the 30 amendments  made in order on the appropriations bill today. It doesn't include the  50-plus amendments made in order on WRDA today.   We have already done more to allow Members to be heard in this  Congress than was happening when the other side led this institution. I  don't think that should be the measure of success, Mr. Speaker. I don't  think that should be the measure of success. My friend from  Massachusetts was right when he said we are going to get bigger votes  and better votes when we bring better bills and a better process to the  House floor.   Let me tell you what I have brought today, Mr. Speaker. I will tell  you what I brought today. I brought a bill that passed this House  unanimously before it went to the Senate to be passed unanimously after  a few amendments--and I brought it back here so that we can again pass  it unanimously--a bill to protect communities, to empower law  enforcement to fight gang violence on the front lines. I want to send  that bill to the President, Mr. Speaker. And if we pass this rule  today, we will be able to send that unanimously agreed-upon legislation  to the President. That is in this rule.    Also in this rule is the Water Resources Development Act, which  passed the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee unanimously.  Unanimously. Republicans, Democrats, conservatives, liberals, everyone  working together to bring a bill out of committee. We brought it out of  committee unanimously.   The Rules Committee still made another 50 amendments in order in case  folks want to improve upon it--50-plus--but we made those amendments in  order to a bill that had already been agreed upon unanimously.   What else does this rule do?   It brings a third piece of legislation to the floor as a part of our  appropriations package, the legislative branch appropriations bill,  which passed out of committee how, Mr. Speaker? Unanimously,  Republicans and Democrats working together to bring that bill out of  committee.   We include the Military Construction-Veterans Affairs bill in this  package, Mr. Speaker. It came out of committee how? Don't tell me.   Unanimously, as Republicans and Democrats came together to move that  legislation forward.                                time  1315    And then we have a fifth part of this package, the Energy and Water  appropriations bill, which I confess--I want to be clear; I want to be  transparent--did not pass unanimously. It just received a simple  bipartisan vote to come out of committee.   So I challenge my colleagues who want a better process, who want to  see better bills come to the floor. We are already making more  amendments in order than my friends on the other side ever dreamed of  doing. We are already bringing bills to the floor that have passed in a  collaborative, in fact, unanimous way.   If Members support this rule, they will be supporting five things,  four of them that passed unanimously, and one that passed with a  bipartisan vote. Is that going to get everybody what they want here  today? I doubt it. It is a tall order, but is it worth supporting? Is  it worth saying it is a step in the right direction? Is it worth  celebrating because you know it could have gone a different way, but we  committed ourselves to the excellence that we have here? It is.   I will finish where I began, Mr. Speaker. I am proud to be down here  carrying this rule today. I am the luckiest guy in the world to be able  to come down here and talk about it, because folks don't get to hear  it, they don't get to read about it, they don't get that around the  water cooler back home, Mr. Speaker, that we are working together; that  we are working together not only on the easy problems, but on the hard  problems; that we are doing things here together that we have not done  before, but we are doing them now because we have serious men and women  on both sides of the aisle who want to make it happen.   Support this rule. Support this rule. Let's show the American people  the work product that has gone into this legislation: the rule and  those five underlying provisions. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that, during  consideration of H.R. 8 in the Committee of the Whole pursuant to House  Resolution 918, the amendment by Mr. Moulton of Massachusetts now at  the desk be considered as though printed as the last amendment printed  in part A of House Report 115-711 and be debatable for 10 minutes.
