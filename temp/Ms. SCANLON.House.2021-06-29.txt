During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is  for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be  given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, yesterday, the Rules Committee met and reported a rule,  House Resolution 504, providing for consideration of H.R. 2662, the IG  Independence and Empowerment Act, under a structured rule. The rule  provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair  and ranking minority member of the Committee on Oversight and Reform,  makes in order six amendments, provides for en bloc authority, and  provides one motion to recommit.   The rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 3005 under a closed  rule. The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled  by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on House  Administration and provides one motion to recommit.   The rule further provides for consideration of H.R. 3684, the INVEST  in America Act. The rule provides 90 minutes of general debate with 60  minutes equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  minority member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,  and 30 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. It combines  the Rules Committee prints for the surface transportation and clean  water provisions of the bill, self-executes a manager's amendment from  Chairman DeFazio, and provides one motion to recommit.   The rule additionally provides for consideration of H. Res. 503,  Establishing the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack  on the United States Capitol, under a closed rule. The rule provides 1  hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking  minority member of the Committee on Rules.   Finally, the rule provides the majority leader or his designee the  ability to en bloc requested rollcall votes on suspension bills  considered on June 28 or 29, and this authority lasts through July 1.   Mr. Speaker, we are here today to consider a rule for four measures  that address some of the most fundamental issues upon which Congress  may act as we continually strive to form a more perfect Union,  establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility, provide for the common  defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of  liberty for all of us and our descendants.   In passing these three bills and in creating a select committee to  investigate the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, the U.S. House of  Representatives is putting forward real solutions to repair our  physical infrastructure, protect our systems of accountability,  acknowledge our relationship with the past, and establish a shared  understanding and plan to address the deep wounds inflicted upon this  building, those who serve and protect here, our government, and our  democratic Republic by the attack on the Capitol on January 6.   Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank the Members and committees that  worked on the bills we consider here today, in particular, the  Herculean efforts by the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee  and the Oversight and Reform Committee, and Congresswoman Barbara Lee,  Majority Whip Clyburn, and Majority Leader Hoyer for their leadership  to remove symbols of hate from the Capitol Building.   Mr. Speaker, no one can deny that our Nation's infrastructure is in a  shameful state of disrepair. For decades, we have heard a lot of talk  about infrastructure while efforts to build and maintain the networks  and systems on which we all rely have been grossly underfunded. Whether  it be roads and bridges or ports and rail lines, year after year, we  fail to muster the political will to properly fund infrastructure, and  the consequences are increasingly dire.   My district, Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District, is home to  Philadelphia's airport, port, rail yard, and, as a key part of the  Northeast Corridor, dozens of miles of interstate highways and  passenger rail lines, as well as regional commuter and light rail lines  that link Philadelphia and its suburbs.   True to its position, PA-05 sits as a transportation keystone to a  vast interstate and international economic network. The problems facing  my district's transportation infrastructure are not that different from  those of other regions. Our infrastructure is  [[Page H3252]]  aging and, in some cases, beyond usable lifespan. It is heavily used,  and State and local authorities don't have enough money to meet  maintenance needs, much less to make investments in modernization,  expansion, or other improvements. Anyone who travels our roadways knows  that axle-bending, tire-rattling potholes are the norm.   Nationwide, the situation is no better: aging and inadequate  electrical grids, shamefully deficient water infrastructure, 47,000  structurally deficient bridges. You can go to any congressional  district and find a litany of projects in desperate need of funding.   We have heard lip service about infrastructure week for so long that  it has become a sick national joke. We must act now.   While the U.S. has sat on its hands, our allies and adversaries  around the world have forged ahead with advancements in transportation  networks, from high-speed rail that puts ours to shame to building up  broadband and 5G networks.   China spends 8 percent of its GDP on infrastructure. Our European  partners spend 5 percent of their GDP on infrastructure. Here in the  United States, we spend a meager 2.4 percent.   We are falling behind the rest of the world and, in doing so, failing  to promote the general welfare of our citizens.   That is why I am proud to support this rule to pass the INVEST in  America Act. This bill will provide over $715 billion over the next 5  years to repair and improve our Nation's infrastructure. It will create  good-paying jobs and lay the foundation for robust economic growth in  the 21st century.    It will make record investments in roads, transit, and rails,  allowing State departments of transportation to address maintenance  backlogs and make forward-thinking investments in road safety, climate  mitigation and resiliency, and low-income and underserved communities  in our cities, suburbs, and rural areas.   It will help build out our Nation's EV infrastructure and help  Americans shift to the next generation of clean energy vehicles. It  will assist transit agencies in expanding service areas and adopting  zero-emission vehicles, and it gives States funding to help prepare for  the impacts of climate change and extreme weather.   This package also includes over $160 billion for drinking water and  wastewater infrastructure. Right now in the United States, there are  millions of Americans who don't have access to clean drinking water or  who aren't connected to a wastewater network. There is no excuse for  that. The water provisions include much-needed funding to fully replace  lead pipes throughout the country and strengthen water standards so the  EPA can better address PFAS contamination.   These issues are vitally important to my district and others in  southeastern Pennsylvania and across the country. I commend the Energy  and Commerce Committee for crafting this comprehensive water  infrastructure package.   Lastly, I want to state my strong support for the Member designated  projects included in the INVEST in America Act. I thank Chairman  DeFazio for giving my colleagues and I, on both sides of the aisle, the  opportunity to secure dedicated funding for important local projects in  our districts and for instituting strong safeguards in this funding to  prevent fraud and abuse.   The Member designated projects process allowed us to work with our  State and local transit agencies and local governments to highlight  high-impact transportation projects in need of funding.   I am proud that $20 million for seven great projects in my district  have been included in this bill, including redesign of dangerous rail  crossings and upgrades to commuter stations, and perhaps most  significantly, this bill includes a project I submitted with my  Pennsylvania colleague (Mr. Evans), to redesign Cobbs Creek Parkway,  one of the most dangerous corridors in our region and the site of  hundreds of crashes and multiple fatalities year after year. The  redesign will make Cobbs Creek Parkway safer for pedestrians, cyclists,  and motorists.   Voting against this bill to invest in America is voting against jobs;  it is voting against economic growth; it is voting against safety; and  it is voting against making sure people have clean drinking water. Now  is the time to tackle these issues, and so I urge all my colleagues to  support this measure.   Mr. Speaker, also included in this bill is the IG Independence and  Empowerment Act, a bill from the House Oversight and Reform Committee  to overhaul and reform the legal powers and protections of our  inspectors general.   Inspectors general are a vital part of our Federal institutions,  ensuring that taxpayers and officials have an independent source of  oversight and information to ensure government employees, from the  interns to the President, are following the law and properly  administering their duties.   For our government to function and be free of waste and corruption,  to protect against fraud and impropriety, we need inspectors general  who are empowered to act and who are protected from arbitrary,  capricious, or personal attacks. But we saw, over the past 4 years,  that there were critical flaws in the law that govern our inspector  general programs. We saw that it was possible for an administration to  undermine the independence of the inspectors general through  unprecedented firings and denial of access to information.   A little over a year ago, the former President fired five Cabinet  inspectors general over 6 weeks, with the announcements often coming on  Friday nights when the Nation's attention was elsewhere.   The inspector general for Health and Human Services was fired for  reporting accurately on the Nation's dire shortage of lifesaving PPE  during the beginning of the pandemic. The State Department inspector  general was fired for investigating then-Secretary Pompeo's use of  government staff to run personal errands. And the Department of  Transportation inspector general was fired for investigating suspicious  grant awards to Kentucky, the State represented by the former  Secretary's husband and the then-Senate majority leader. In other  words, these inspectors general were fired for doing their jobs.   The IG Independence and Empowerment Act will enact needed reforms to  protect IGs from political firings, give them increased powers and  resources to investigate waste and corruption, and increase  accountability and transparency for the Council of the Inspectors  General on Integrity and Efficiency. I strongly support the IG  Independence and Empowerment Act and call on my colleagues to do the  same.   Mr. Speaker, the last bill in today's rule is long overdue. The bill  would replace the bust of Roger Brooke Taney in the Old Supreme Court  Chamber in the Capitol with a bust of Thurgood Marshall and would  remove the statues of individuals who voluntarily served in the  Confederate States of America from display in the Capitol.                                time  1245    In Philadelphia, we have a street named after Chief Justice Taney and  we have a Little League World Series Champion baseball team named after  that street.   In 2020, following conversations about race and inclusiveness in  America, the Taney Dragons Little League team decided to rename itself  the Philadelphia Dragons saying that they cannot ignore the very real  feelings that the name ``Taney'' engenders among members of our  community, and that the new name will be inclusive, nondivisive, and  also speak to our league's geography.   I say we follow the lead of our children on this issue. If they can  do it, so can we. As we seek to form that more perfect Union and secure  the blessings of liberty for all, we cannot accept the presence in this  Capitol Building of Confederate icons, including the bust of the author  of the Dred Scott decision or those who fought to protect slavery and  wage war against the United States. Symbols of the Confederacy deserve  to be in textbooks and museums, not venerated in the Capitol.   Finally, Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for the creation of a select  committee to investigate the January 6 attack on the United States  Capitol Building where we stand. I am, and I think most of the public  is, disappointed that the Senate failed to join in the establishment of  a bipartisan commission to establish once and for all the facts about  what happened on that day.  [[Page H3253]]    We had a bipartisan bill. Chairman Thompson and Ranking Member Katko  of Homeland Security, through good-faith negotiations, were able to  craft bipartisan legislation to create a commission to investigate the  January 6 insurrection. Our Republican colleagues got everything they  wanted in that bill, and yet, their leadership withdrew its support at  the last moment and couldn't take yes for an answer.   Since our colleagues refused to approve a bipartisan commission, the  House must move ahead with an investigation of the January 6 events and  a select committee is our final avenue. We must investigate the causes  and events that led to that attack. It is my sincere hope that the  committee can dive into the facts and produce a cohesive narrative  around January 6 and the events that preceded it and make  recommendations that will prevent such horrors from ever being repeated  again.   The January 6 attack on our Capitol was a crime, a crime against our  government and a crime against the men and women who serve here,  whether it was elected officials, congressional staff, or law  enforcement. Period. It was an ugly, violent crime and crimes need to  be investigated. Thousands participated and over 800 illegally entered  the building.   Roughly 500 so far have been criminally charged by law enforcement.  Some have pled guilty. But the fact-finding is not yet done. We need to  know how organized they were and what their level of coordination was.   Despite the claims of some in this Chamber, we now know that many of  these rioters were armed, which means that every single one of us and  all of our staffs were in very real danger. Some of the rioters came to  abduct the Vice President and the Speaker of the House and put them on  trial. Some planned to take this building over and hold it until  January 20 in an attempt to stave off President Biden's inauguration.  Some just wanted to destroy things, and they did.   That, too, the intention of the rioters, needs to be probed. Some  think Donald Trump incited this riot; some think he did not. New and  wild claims have surfaced about who instigated the violence. Let's  investigate that, too. Let's investigate everything connected to this  horrible event honestly, unflinchingly, objectively, and without  passion or prejudice, but let us not leave this crime unexamined.   If we are to come together as a Nation to unite behind our shared  constitutional values, to ensure domestic tranquility and secure the  blessings of democracy and liberty, we must do so from a shared  understanding of reality.   Mr. Speaker, I hope that every member of this Chamber can find it in  themselves to vote for this rule when it is considered on the floor.  Our country cannot afford to wait longer on infrastructure. If we  continue with business as usual, our infrastructure deficit will  continue to grow. Our roads and bridges will continue to deteriorate,  and our national economy will be less vibrant and competitive as a  result.   We need to pass the INVEST in America Act. Full stop. We also need to  pass the IG Independence and Empowerment Act, and we need to remove  racist icons from the Capitol. These repairs and reforms cannot wait,  and so I hope that Congress can find the political will to  expeditiously pass the bills considered under the rule today.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is really straightforward. It increases money  for surface transportation. It focuses on hard infrastructure. We need  to fix the basics and then we can improve and expand them. This bill  does include money specifically directed to our rural areas, and the  crack about urban yuppies is kind of crazy.   We know that in Pennsylvania, which both the gentleman and I  represent, we know that we have businesses in western Pennsylvania that  are losing money because of the state of our roadways. If you build a  turbine in western Pennsylvania, in order to get it to the port in  eastern Pennsylvania right now, those companies have to take an 800- mile detour because our roadways cannot support that turbine. So it is  impacting their businesses.   It is increasing energy costs. It is wasting time. But these kinds of  things affect businesses across our entire Commonwealth and across our  entire country. So these are much-needed, overdue by decades,  bipartisan neglect. This bill addresses some of those issues.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman from Pennsylvania have  further speakers?     Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, does the gentleman have additional  speakers?    Mr. Speaker, I think I have one more speaker.   I am finding the argument a little bit hard to follow for my  colleagues across the aisle because, as I understand it, it was a bad  thing to shut down businesses in the U.S. to protect people when there  was a virus rampant here. But we have to shut down the border because  there is a virus rampant here. It is just a little hard to follow the  logic sometimes.   If the gentleman is prepared to close, then I reserve the balance of  my time.                                time  1315     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle for the lively debate today. I understand that there are some who  have concerns with the rule and its underlying legislation, but these  bills are vitally important to our country, and I am confident they  would greatly benefit all of us.   We should be able to support robust infrastructure spending that  meets our Nation's current needs. We should all support a vigorous  corps of inspectors general who can weed out fraud, waste, and  corruption in the Federal Government. We should all support removing  symbols of hate from the Capitol. These should be easy bills for us all  to get behind.   Lastly, I strongly support the creation of a select committee to  investigate the January 6 insurrection and debunk the absurd theories  and falsehoods that have infected our collective understanding of that  day. While some of our colleagues may continue their denial, those of  us in this Chamber who are committed to transparency and accountability  and the well-being of the Nation can no longer afford to be held back  by the sensitivities of those who put their fealty to the former  President over their duty or obligation to the country.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote for the rule and the  previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Reschenthaler is as  follows:                     Amendment to House Resolution 504         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 9 Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 471) to prohibit the Secretary of Health and Human       Services from lessening the stringency of, and to prohibit       the Secretary of Homeland Security from ceasing or lessening       implementation of, the COVID-19 border health provisions       through the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, and for other       purposes. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. The bill shall be considered as read. All       points of order against provisions in the bill are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill and on any amendment thereto to final passage without       intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally       divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority       member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce; and (2) one       motion to recommit.        Sec. 10. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 471.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back balance of my time, and I move  the previous question on the resolution.
