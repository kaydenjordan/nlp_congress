 Madam Speaker, I would like to address my remarks to  President Biden.   Mr. President, as you rightly said in Philadelphia this month, we  face the most dangerous threat to free and fair elections in our  history. To meet this threat to our democracy, we need only do what is  plainly possible: Use our majorities to pass the For the People Act.   But we cannot succeed unless you call for abolishing or reforming the  filibuster.   You have urged the American people to be, ``clear-eyed about the  obstruction we face.'' Well, that obstruction comes not only from  Republicans, but also from Members of our own party.   I know that you do not have a voice in the Senate. But you do have a  voice, the most powerful on the planet. Unless you use it to lead, the  Senators who stand in the way of democracy will continue to do so.   The truth is, Mr. President, we can't just out-organize partisan  gerrymanders. We can't just out-vote a party that is committed to  overturning elections whose results they don't like.   And we better not ask Black and Brown voters to do twice as much to  save our democracy, when we in Washington cannot be bothered to do half  as much as we should.   We need new laws and we need your help to pass them.
