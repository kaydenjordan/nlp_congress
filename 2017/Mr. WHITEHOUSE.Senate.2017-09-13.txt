 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, as the Senate considers the annual  authorization of our military and national defense programs, I am here  for my 178th ``Time to Wake Up'' speech, to discuss the security risks  climate change presents to our Nation. I urge my colleagues to heed the  warnings from our national security experts, not just the self-serving  propaganda of the fossil fuel industry that blankets us. What are these  national security risks?   A first order of security risk is the physical damage climate change  is causing in our atmosphere, oceans, and environment. Science and our  senses are already perceiving this damage, indeed already measuring  this damage. This order of security risk--risk to the Earth's natural  order--will hurt farming communities, coastal communities, fishing  communities, and anyone vulnerable to wildfires and extreme weather all  around the world. Of course, the poorer you are, the more vulnerable  you are to this risk.   The second order of security risk from climate change is the  consequences in human society from those physical, biological, and  chemical changes in our Earth's environment. As farms or fisheries  fail, people are impoverished and dislocated. Scarcity of resources  leads to conflicts and confrontations. Storms and fires and floods can  make the suffering acute. People who are hungry or dislocated or  [[Page S5473]]  torn from their roots can become desperate, can become radicalized and  violent. That is why the Department of Defense has for many years  called climate change a ``catalyst of conflict.''   Researchers from NASA and the University of Arizona determined that  drought in Syria was very likely the worst in a thousand years. Massive  crop failures and livestock losses moved farmers into stressed cities,  where popular protests met brutal violence from the Assad regime. The  tide of refugees from that chaos swamped Europe. To the extent the  droughts in Syria were a root cause of the discontent that led to the  conflict, and ultimately to the flight of refugees, European  governments have seen this second order of security risk up close.   There is a third order of security risk, and that is damage to the  keystone institutions of our present world order--market capitalism and  democratic government. We depend for the quality of life we enjoy on  market capitalism and democratic governance, and those institutions-- capitalism and democracy--in turn depend on popular approval and  confidence. But if you are a person whose livelihood has been harmed by  the first-order environmental effects of climate change or if you are a  person swept up in the second-order societal effects of climate change  or even if you are simply a person who is dismayed as you witness the  suffering and harm caused by climate change around you, you will want  answers. It is human nature to want answers. When people are hurt, they  want a reckoning. When that reckoning comes, the discredit to  institutions like capitalism and democracy could be profound for having  failed to act in face of a known risk.   Add to that failure to act a moral failure--why the failure to act?  Fossil fuel companies, corporate entities, are knowingly causing this  harm, and at least in the United States, they are aggressively fighting  political solutions to the problem. They are fighting with  professionally administered misinformation. Climate denial is the  original fake news--with an absurd arsenal of political money.    Companies not in the fossil fuel industry often have excellent  climate policies within their corporate fence lines and sometimes even  for their supply chains. But as we know in this building, these good  companies collectively take essentially no action, particularly here in  Congress, to offset the political force of the fossil fuel industry.  Indeed, many companies with good climate policies nevertheless support  industry organizations that are the instruments of the fossil fuel  companies in preventing solutions. This all stands to be a lasting and  dangerous discredit to the corporate sector and to market capitalism  generally, and the discredit will worsen as the danger worsens.   In Congress, we have nothing to brag about. We have shown ourselves  unable to resist the fossil fuel industry, despite knowing it to be  deeply burdened with obvious and enormous conflicts of interest and  despite clear and repeated warnings from our national security experts.  They could not have made it plainer. The Pentagon's 2014 Quadrennial  Defense Review described climate change as a ``global threat  multiplier,'' warning that ``the pressures caused by climate change  will influence resource competition while placing additional burdens on  economies, societies, and governance institutions around the world.''  Similar were the 2010 QDR and our national intelligence reviews.   During his Senate confirmation process, Secretary of Defense James  Mattis told this body:         Climate change is impacting stability in areas of the world       where our troops are operating today. It is appropriate for       the Combatant Commands to incorporate drivers of instability       that impact the security environment in their areas into       their planning.    That is, climate change needs to be a part of command planning.   In response to a question from the Armed Services Committee, he  testified:         I agree that the effects of a changing climate--such as       increased maritime access to the Arctic, rising sea levels,       desertification, among others--impact our security situation.       I will ensure that the Department continues to be prepared to       conduct operations today and in the future, and that we are       prepared to address the effects of a changing climate on our       threat assessments, resources, and readiness.    Former Admiral Samuel Locklear, as head of U.S. Pacific Command,  warned in 2013 that climate change was the biggest long-term security  threat in his area of operation, noting the need for the military to  organize for ``when the effects of climate change start to impact these  massive populations.''   ``If it goes bad,'' he said, ``you could have hundreds of thousands  or millions of people displaced and then security will start to crumble  pretty quickly.''   The Government Accountability Office is our Federal Government's  watchdog. GAO has warned that climate change could affect military  testing, training, and operating activities, hampering readiness and  mission continuity. They have also warned of DOD's ``fiscal exposure''  to climate change. GAO says that climate change is already affecting  our defense infrastructure around the globe--555,000 facilities and 28  million acres of land, with a replacement value of close to $850  billion. For instance, the Army's Fort Irwin, CA, is susceptible to  heavy rain and flooding. Air Force radar installations in Alaska stand  on unstable, thawing permafrost. The Diego Garcia installation in the  Indian Ocean and Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia each face rising  seas.   In his new book ``The Water Will Come,'' author Jeff Goodell quotes  the former Norfolk naval station commander, Joe Bouchard. The commander  said:         It was not a nuisance problem--it was not a minor       operational issue. Sea-level rise was interfering with the       combat readiness for the Atlantic fleet.    I repeat: Sea-level rise was interfering with the combat readiness of  our Atlantic fleet.   The Navy is spending hundreds of millions of dollars to raise piers  and other infrastructure above the rising waters. Goodell writes:         But a base like Norfolk . . . is the hub of an entire       ecosystem that has grown up around it . . . fuel suppliers       and electrical lines and railroad tracks and repair shops and       . . . housing . . . and . . . schools. . . . You can't just       move all this to some random spot.    What is happening in Norfolk is pretty damn serious.   In 2015, Secretary of State John Kerry went to Norfolk, and he asked  officers there how long they thought the base could hold out. ``Twenty  to 50 years,'' Captain J. Pat Rios replied. Goodell describes it as  what he calls ``an extraordinary moment in the annals of American  military history: A U.S. naval captain had just told the Secretary of  State that the strategically important base, home to six aircraft  carriers and key to operations in Europe and the Middle East, would be  essentially inoperable in as little as 20 years.''   The bill approved by the Armed Services Committee recognizes this and  requires the Pentagon to submit a ``comprehensive threat assessment,''  describing the climate risks to military missions and the climate- related vulnerabilities of that massive DOD infrastructure. The  Department is further directed to submit an ``implementation master  plan,'' detailing the steps that DOD will take to mitigate climate- related mission risks, incorporate climate-related events in combatant  commanders' theater campaign plans, address military infrastructure  vulnerabilities, update military construction standards for predicted  flooding and extreme weather, and evaluate DOD's progress adapting to  climate change. I commend Chairman John McCain and Ranking Member Jack  Reed, my senior Senator, for seeing to it that this language was  included in this bill.   I also commend my House colleague Jim Langevin for getting similar  language into the House version. The House provision states--by the  way, this was a big bipartisan provision when it was voted on in the  House. It states: ``Climate change is a direct threat to the national  security of the United States,'' and it further requires that the  Department of Defense be ``prepared to address the effects of a  changing climate on threat assessments, resources, and readiness.''   In the shadow of Harvey and Irma, storms that were amped up by warmed  seas and that flooded further inland due to risen seas and that held  and dumped more rain because of warmed air, and watching the  unprecedented fires blazing across the American West and with these  bipartisan provisions agreed to in the NDAA bills, I hope we  [[Page S5474]]  may be on the brink of finally freeing ourselves from the relentless,  remorseless political pressures of the fossil fuel industry. They have  had their way around here long enough. We need to have a long overdue  discussion of the effects of climate change on our national security,  on our health, on our economy, and, ultimately, on our national  reputation.   Pope Francis has reminded us that we have ``a moral responsibility.  We have to take it seriously.''   He said: ``You can see the effects of climate change and scientists  have clearly said what path we have to follow.''   He went on: ``If someone is doubtful that this is true, they should  ask scientists. They are very clear. They are not opinions made on the  fly. They are very clear.''   Pope Francis is a scientist himself, and having heard plenty of  confessions, he is also a man of the world, and he understands the  weakness of humankind. He understands political pressures. ``When you  don't want to see, you don't see,'' he said. But he reminds us that  ``history will judge the decisions.''   America is an exemplary Nation. As an exemplary Nation, one that  projects power by example and not just by force, America will be  stronger and more respected if we pull together and craft American  climate solutions. For a country that seeks to stand as an example in  this world--a city on a hill, we often say--and a country that benefits  from the power of that example, this shaming display of out-of-control  special interest influence will have consequences. The world is  watching. We have a role to play in this world, we Americans, and it is  time we got about it before the consequences of climate change become,  to quote Donald Trump in 2009, ``catastrophic and irreversible.''   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
