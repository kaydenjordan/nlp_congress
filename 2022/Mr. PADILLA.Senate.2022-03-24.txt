 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Supportive Services Expansion Act and  the Accelerating Small Business Growth Act, which I introduced today.   The unprecedented investment in American infrastructure over the next  decade provides a major opportunity to strengthen our most underserved  businesses and communities. Providing resources to help develop women- owned, minority-owned, and disadvantaged businesses will uplift our  entire economy, and it is how we truly build back better.   Last year, President Biden set a goal of increasing the share of  Federal contracts going to small, disadvantaged businesses by 50  percent by 2025, which would translate to an additional $100 billion  for these businesses.   To help accomplish this ambitious goal, we should empower Federal,  State, and local agencies to deliver resources to underserved  businesses to help them become self-sufficient and grow.   Established in 1970, the Federal Highway Administration's  Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Supportive Services Program already  provides training, assistance, and services to minority- and women- owned businesses to help them develop into self-sufficient  organizations that viably compete for federally assisted highway  project contracts. Unfortunately, Congress has not allowed this program  to keep up with the needs of our underserved businesses.   The Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Supportive Services Expansion  Act would increase this program's annual funding cap for the first time  in nearly 50 years from $10 million to $25 million. Additionally, the  bill would create similar programs at the Federal Aviation  Administration and the Federal Transit Administration.   Local, regional, and State agencies have also been leaders in  developing innovative programs to prioritize disadvantaged businesses,  invest in efforts to create equitable competition, and promote diverse  economic development initiatives.   The Accelerating Small Business Growth Act would create a new grant  program to help transportation agencies across our Nation carry out  these innovative programs to help underserved businesses grow and  achieve proficiency to compete, on an equal basis, for contracts and  subcontracts in federally funded transportation projects. Agencies that  receive funding through this grant program would be required to submit  reports to the Department of Transportation evaluating the  effectiveness of their activities, which would help inform future  Federal procurement policymaking.   I want to thank Representatives Pete Aguilar and Jimmy Gomez for co- leading these bills with me, and I hope colleagues will join us in  support of this legislation to minority-owned, women-owned, and  disadvantaged businesses compete for contracts to develop and build  Federal infrastructure projects funded by the bipartisan infrastructure  law.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Supportive Services Expansion Act and  the Accelerating Small Business Growth Act, which I introduced today.
