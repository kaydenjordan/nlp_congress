 Mr. Speaker, I rise in favor of H. Res. 521 to censure and  condemn Congressman Adam Schiff.   The bottom line is this: Congressman Schiff utilized his position and  hid behind classifications to mislead the American people.   He abused his congressional authority and security clearance to push  his own party's political agenda. This was not meant to be an unbiased  jurisdiction of change; this was meant to be a political witch hunt.   When Members are appointed to the select committees on intelligence,  they are trusted with privileged information. Other Members of the  House are taking them for their word.   As someone who has worked within the intelligence community, I can  tell you that our classifications that were available to take and read  is not to be abused for our own ulterior motives.   I hope my colleagues will join Congresswoman Luna to censure and hold  Congressman Schiff accountable and to put an end to the waste, fraud,  abuse, and the gross neglect in how we take advantage of the American  people.
