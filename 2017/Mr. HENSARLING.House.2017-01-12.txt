 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks  and to submit extraneous material on H.R. 78, to improve the  consideration by the Securities and Exchange Commission of the costs  and benefits of its regulations and orders.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 78, the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act.   I thank the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner) for leading this  effort in the House.   This bill is technically about something called economic analysis or  cost-benefit analysis. That may sound like Ph.D. economics, but it is  really about kitchen table economics because, Mr. Chairman, it is truly  about whether we are going to have a stronger economy--one that creates  good-paying jobs so that parents can afford to raise their children  today and these same children can have a brighter future tomorrow. It  is about making sure we have an accountable government that expands  personal opportunity, not government bureaucracy.   Mr. Chairman, I think we all know that small businesses are truly  America's job engine. They create nearly two-thirds of all new jobs in  our economy. Our economy works better for all when small businesses can  focus on creating jobs and on serving their customers rather than  navigating needless government red tape.   Unfortunately, for America's small businesses, bureaucratic red tape  has no better friend than the Obama administration. It has issued more  than 4,400 final regulations, with an astronomical cost to all of us of  $1 trillion. Just since the election on November 8, the Obama  administration had cynically issued 145 midnight regulations with a  cost of more than $21 billion.   For anyone who believes that this doesn't hurt our small businesses,  they need to listen to their constituents, because I certainly listen  to mine. I heard from a small business owner named Chris, who is back  in my district and who wrote me:         We have seen wave after wave of Federal regulations affect       our ability to grow. The costs associated with additional       reporting, auditing, and compliance are massive. The money       spent is significant and costs jobs and potential jobs.    Mr. Chairman, he is exactly right. The true cost of Washington red  tape cannot just be measured in dollars. The true cost includes the  jobs not created, the small businesses not started, and the dreams of  our children not fulfilled. Ill-advised laws like the Dodd-Frank Act  empower unelected, unaccountable bureaucrats to callously hand down  crushing regulations without adequately considering what impact those  regulations have on jobs.   As one former SEC Commissioner testified before the Financial  Services Committee, which I have the honor of chairing, these  Washington elites have forgotten the key to sensible regulation:         The most appropriate regulatory solution should be the one       that imposes the least burden on society while maximizing       potential benefits even if that means choosing not to       regulate at all.    Although the Securities and Exchange Commission is one of the few  Washington agencies that engages in at least some base level of  economic analysis, putting this requirement into law is definitely  preferable to current agency procedures. After all, the SEC's recent  interest in economic analysis came only on the heels of numerous  Federal courts throwing out some of its regulations because the  Commission failed to adequately take into account, again, the true  costs and benefits of its rules.   Passing this bill will erase any doubt that the Securities and  Exchange Commission must conduct sound economic analysis. It must  consider the impact of their rules on our jobs and our family budgets.  That is what cost-benefit analysis is all about.   Mr. Chairman, we may hear today from the usual suspects--the  opponents of this bill--that somehow this is meant to hinder the  rulemaking process and encourage litigation against the SEC. You will  hear these same people say, once again, that this is somehow dangerous.  Mr. Chairman, what is dangerous is being ignorant of the impact the  proposed regulations will have on our economy and on the American  people's wallets before they get implemented. That is what is  dangerous.   What is interesting, Mr. Chairman, is that Presidents, frankly, of  both parties seem to agree. Even Presidents Clinton and Obama directed  independent agencies to engage in, essentially, exactly the same  procedures that H.R. 78 would make into law. Such irony, Mr. Chairman,  that some Democrats will come to the floor today and oppose codifying  into law Clinton and Obama policy. Again, the irony of it all.   I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill because we must  hold Washington accountable to the American people. We must build a  stronger, healthier economy so struggling Americans can get back to  work and achieve financial independence.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I am very pleased now to yield 4  minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), the author of  the SEC Regulatory Accountability Act and the chairman of our Oversight  and Investigations Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Huizenga), the chairman of our Subcommittee on Capital  Markets and Government Sponsored Enterprises.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Michigan.
