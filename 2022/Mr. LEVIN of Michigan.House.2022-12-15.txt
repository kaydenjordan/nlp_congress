 Madam Speaker, this is an hour to celebrate  Members who are departing this Congress, including myself, and I have  some remarks to share. I will also be joined later by the gentlewoman  from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), but first we are going to hear  from the chairman of the Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch of the  Committee on Appropriations of the U.S. House of Representatives, one  of our cardinals, a great public servant from the State of Ohio,  Representative Tim Ryan.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ryan).    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Ryan for his  wonderful public service here not only for the people of Ohio, but  really for all the people of this country.   What does it mean to run for Congress, to serve in Congress? Why do  it?   Personally, I didn't run for Congress until I was 58 years old, after  a career as a union organizer, a human rights activist, running  Michigan's workforce system, and creating innovative new programs under  then-Governor Jennifer Granholm, our Energy Secretary today, and then  starting my own statewide clean energy finance market as a green energy  entrepreneur. But a Trump Presidency put these priorities, each and  every one of them, and indeed our very democracy in grave danger, and I  was inspired to run to replace my father after his retirement.   Coming into Congress with the historic freshman class of House  Democrats in the 116th Congress, we started in the middle of a record- breaking government shutdown. Our very first action as an office was  gathering impacted workers together alongside my Michigan colleagues at  the Detroit airport. We had workers reflecting the full range of  Federal duties: From transportation professionals to environmental  stewards who worked for the EPA.   Gathering this coalition would serve as a model for the work we would  do over the next 4 years. When our staff met at UAW Region One a few  months later for our first retreat, we would define our priorities, and  it was really three overarching priorities for our office: First,  raising the standard of living for working people; second, protecting  our one precious Earth; and third, fighting for human rights at home  and abroad. We have organized our work around these priorities ever  since.   Let's start with raising the standard of living for working people.  Certainly, making education affordable is a key part of that. After the  Speaker appointed me to the Education and Labor Committee, I was  honored to be elected vice chair of the committee by my fellow  Democrats.   And then Chairman  Bobby Scott asked me to lead the America's College  Promise Act to provide 2 years of tuition-and-fee-free community  college and also 2 years of virtually free study at historically Black  colleges and universities and other minority-serving institutions.   We introduced the bill, and we debated it. But can you imagine how  amazing it was when Joe Biden was moving toward the nomination to be  the Democratic candidate for President and he adopted my bill, and then  he made it part of his Build Back Better plan?   I had the privilege of welcoming First Lady Jill Biden to a community  college in my district once and Education Secretary Miguel Cardona to  two different community colleges to celebrate the inclusion of this  bill in the President's Build Back Better plan and fight for its  passage. We didn't get it across the finish line due to the  intransigence of one person, Joe Manchin, but we are not about to give  up until we make free community college and accessibility of HBCUs for  everyone a reality.  [[Page H9887]]    Probably the biggest area of my advocacy for workers and their  families came in labor and employment policy.   I served as a whip to push the Raise the Wage Act through the House,  and we fended off efforts to water it down with things like regional  minimum wages that would consign poor areas of this country to  permanent, structural poverty. We had to fight hard to keep the one  fair wage aspect in the bill, to make sure we end subminimum wages for  tipped workers, who are mostly women and disproportionately of color.   I helped write the PRO Act and was so honored to play a special role  in shepherding it through the Education and Labor Committee and the  floor of the House.   I led a small band of labor stalwarts in opposition to Trump's new  NAFTA, which is called the USMCA. While I fervently hope the  legislation succeeds, and I have worked with the Biden administration  to ensure that Mexico and Canada meet their obligations, I fear too  much of our trade policy discards the views of workers here at home and  also abroad in the name of furthering the interests of multinational  corporations. That has to end, and we have to put workers' interests  and the planet's interests first.   One core part of my belief about how to be a Congressman is that it  is not all about passing legislation and overseeing the administration.  When it comes to labor issues, I believe you have got to get out there  and support workers' organizing and bargaining campaigns directly. We  did this many, many times. Let me give you just a few examples.   We organized a major solidarity action when the UAW struck General  Motors, and I walked the picket line regularly and welcomed many  colleagues, including Senator Elizabeth Warren.   When the RWDSU helped Amazon workers in Bessemer, Alabama, organize  to join the union, I organized a delegation of Congresspeople to go  down there with me, and I went a second time by myself to join current  AFL-CIO president Liz Shuler to encourage the workers to keep fighting  after they lost their first election, which was marred by many unfair  labor practices by the corporation.   I organized almost all of my fellow Harvard alums in the House to  support Harvard grad employees when they were campaigning to win a  first contract, and that was ultimately successful under pressure from  us and many others.    More recently, when Senate cafeteria workers who are members of UNITE  HERE Local 23 were fighting for a long overdue, just contract, I got  arrested with many of them to push the issue. Happily, Mr. Speaker,  they won a good contract soon thereafter.   Just recently, I participated in campaigns to support railroaders who  desperately need paid sick days and the demand for full funding for the  National Labor Relations Board so it can fulfill its function to  support private sector workers' rights to organize and bargain  collectively.   I can tell you, I am going to continue not only my own efforts to  support workers, but I am going to continue organizing Members of  Congress to be involved.   There is so much more we can and must do to lift up working families  and help them live dignified lives. We did preserve the pensions of  millions of American workers. I am so proud we got that done.   I was proud to fight with my brothers and sisters in the Progressive  Caucus to include affordable childcare, universal preschool for 3- and  4-year-olds, paid sick leave for all, and the child tax credit in the  House version of Build Back Better. Congress needs to keep fighting to  get these things done.   Our team was super active on our second priority as well, protecting  our one precious Earth. Let's start with clean air, water, and land. I  joined the bipartisan PFAS task force right away, and I passed  legislation twice to prevent the harmful incineration of PFAS  chemicals, especially on military bases. We have so much more work to  do on PFAS, that is for sure. It is truly the DDT of our times, and we  have got to deal with it.   Around Christmas of 2019 green ooze began to leak out onto I-696, the  interstate highway through my district in the town of Madison Heights.  My staff and I led an effort to help ensure the cleanup of toxic waste,  in coordination with the EPA and State and local governments, and it  was really everybody working together that got it done.   There were many such efforts, but of course my biggest focus was  climate change. I supported the original Green New Deal resolution from  day one. I remember being out on the lawn when we introduced it. I am  one of only 27 Senators and Representatives out of 535, Mr. Speaker, to  support all 12 Green New Deal bills. Even more importantly, I helped  put meat on the bones personally in several ways.   Senator Elizabeth Warren and I authored the BUILD Green Act to invest  $500 billion over 10 years to jump-start the transition to all-electric  public vehicles, mass transit, rail, and help modernize the Nation's  crumbling infrastructure.   Senator Sherrod Brown and I introduced the American Energy Worker  Opportunity Act to support fossil fuel and coal workers and their  families impacted by the transition we need to make as soon as possible  to clean energy. Simply stated, workers who, over generations, built up  wonderful pay and benefit packages; if they work on a pipeline or a  refinery or a coal mine, it is not their fault that we have to change,  and they shouldn't suffer, and that bill would take care of that issue.   I introduced the EV Freedom Act with Representative Alexandria  Ocasio-Cortez to build a nationwide network of high-speed EV chargers  to transform our transportation sector and end our reliance on fossil  fuels.   And I am still going, right up to my last days in Congress. Today,  this very day, I partnered with the chair of the Speaker's Select  Committee on Climate Crisis, Kathy Castor from Tampa, to introduce the  CLEANER Buildings Act, my bill, alongside her bill, the LOWER Energy  Bills Act. These pieces of legislation will ensure we can meet  President Biden's goal to reduce economy-wide emissions and transform  our Nation's buildings to be energy efficient and climate resilient.   Mr. Speaker, people count the amount of emissions, greenhouse gas  emissions, in different ways, but if you add up the energy we use to  heat and cool and light our buildings, it is 42 percent of all the  emissions in this country, all the electricity and natural gas. So we  really have to deal with that.   These measures are collaborations between my amazing staff and many  advocacy groups fighting for environmental justice and to save life on  Earth as we know it in a way that actually advances racial and economic  justice.   In terms of my priorities, the third is peace and human rights for  all people everywhere, and we have been equally active in that area as  well.   First, though, let me say that while I have worked super hard on  peace, this is probably Congress' and the Democratic Party's greatest  weakness. Our business is largely unfinished on these. For example,  authorizations for use of military force, or AUMF.   The Constitution says this body, the Congress, the Article I body, is  responsible for deciding when to send our young people into harm's way,  and then the President is the Commander in Chief. We have fallen down  in this duty, and we are still falling down.   We are relying on decades-old authorizations for use of military  force. We ought to have the guts to end every one of them and work with  the administration when we need a new one to put it into place. Every  time we do it, it should have a sunset so that we force ourselves to  make the hard decisions about war and peace.   Secondly, nuclear nonproliferation. I don't need to talk long about  this. Almost nothing is happening. We are down to having one agreement  with Russia left. We are really nowhere with China. We have an  increasing number of nuclear states. We are, hopefully, battling hard  to keep Iran from joining them. But we need to get back to the business  that was really bipartisan.   Who can forget Ronald Reagan taking on ending the use of nuclear  weapons? So we have really got a long way to go there.   Also, Mr. Speaker, reducing military spending. My goodness. Just the  increase in the Pentagon budget that we passed through this House in  the NDAA recently, the other day, just the increase above what the  Pentagon asked  [[Page H9888]]  for that Congress stuffed in there would have paid for my whole  America's College Promise Act, plus some other big needs of the  American people. I am for the U.S. absolutely being the strongest  military in the world, but we shouldn't be spending more than the next  8 to 10 countries combined.   We have got to have a diplomacy first, a peace first, a human rights  first foreign policy and take care of the needs of our people and the  poor and working people around the world.                                time  1415    As a lifelong human rights advocate, I feel I can say that we had  more success in the human rights area. Although, the situation is  certainly dire in so many parts of the world. Let me mention just a few  highlights.   The House passed my bipartisan resolution condemning the coup in  Burma, and we have continued oversight of the very troubling human  rights situation there, as well as the inspiring efforts of the Burmese  people to resist repression.   Indeed, my first foreign trip as a Congressman was to Bangladesh to  visit Rohingya refugees just over the border from Burma there.   I have been a vocal advocate for human rights in places like India,  which is in danger of becoming a Hindu nationalist state rather than a  secular democracy; the world's largest democracy.   I am a lover of Hinduism, a lover of Jainism, Buddhism, other  religions that were born in India, but we need to protect the rights of  all people there, whether they are Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Jews,  Christians, Jains--whatever.   I have been active about human rights in Egypt, where thousands of  political prisoners languish in jail. Israel and Palestine have been a  particular focus of mine. I am proud to have written the Two-State  Solution Act, the most forward-leaning U.S. bill in many years to try  to hold Israeli and Palestinian leaders alike accountable to take steps  to advance a two-state solution.   Now, with a far-right government filled with troubling racist and  homophobic leaders taking over in Israel, all of us who love that  country's democratic ideals and seek justice for Palestinians as well  will have to redouble our efforts. Perhaps my biggest focus in this  area has been Haiti.   I founded the first House Haiti Caucus in Congress in decades and  recruited three dynamic Congresswomen who represent large Haitian- American constituencies to co-chair with me: Val Demings of Florida,  Yvette Clarke of New York, and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts.   With the support of our great Committee on Foreign Affairs chairman,   Greg Meeks, we greatly increased Congressional oversight of U.S. policy  on Haiti, including two standalone hearings with witnesses representing  diverse perspectives and a Department of Homeland Security review of  its policies after the humanitarian disaster in Del Rio.   We have pointed out that the status quo is untenable, and we have  demanded inclusion of the breadth of Haitian civil society in dealing  with the ongoing crisis there.   Whether on our three overarching priority areas that I have just  discussed or other vital matters, like reducing the epidemic of gun  violence, one thing I want to emphasize is that working in Congress is  all about teamwork. We have got a tremendous amount done in these last  4 years, and it is all due to an amazing team of individuals who  brought tremendous idealism, passion, professionalism, hard work, and  love to make life better for working families.   I am going to share the names of everyone who has worked on Team  Levin these last 4 years. Let's start with the District Office in  alphabetical order: Jenny Byer; Robert Charara; Will Cochran; Eleanor  Gamalski; Jolie Habashy; Walt Herzig; Zeenath Hussain; Dan Klein; Kyle  Pollet; Lauren Schandevel; Amairris Simmons; Justin Walters; Sean  Wolski; America Yahya; Stephanie Yaldo-Sheena.   And here in the Washington, D.C. office:   Abbas Alawieh; Mez Araya; Taryn Brown; Don Chen; Erica Fein; Ben  Gerstein; Julia Kalusniak; Courtney Laudick; Austin Laufersweiler;  MaryGrace Menner; Ven Neralla; Colton Puckett; Catherine Rowland;  Jamari Torrence; Alex Schmitt; Sabrina Steel; Derrick Utley; Janae  Washington, who is sitting here with me now; and Jacob Wilson.   And what did we get done, this amazing group of people?   In the 116th Congress, speaking of legislation, we introduced 59  pieces of legislation: 22 bills, 30 amendments, and 7 resolutions.   We passed 40 pieces of legislation through the House of  Representatives: 10 bills and 30 amendments.   And we got 6 pieces of legislation all the way through the process  and signed into law by that previous President.   In the 117th Congress, as of earlier this week, we introduced 50  pieces of legislation: 32 bills, 13 amendments, and 5 resolutions. And  we are introducing three more pieces of legislation yet this week, one  of which I mentioned.   We passed 21 pieces of legislation through the House so far: 6 bills,  2 resolutions, and 13 amendments; and we saw three pieces of  legislation signed into law.   Mr. Speaker, we are still hoping for two more: Renaming the post  offices in Bloomfield Township and Hazel Park, two Michigan communities  in my district.   Passing legislation is just one part of our work. Serving all of our  constituents, regardless of their political views or their  circumstances, is another big part.   The bottom line, being a good Member of Congress is about taking care  of people, whether their problems relate to immigration, Social  Security, veteran benefits--whatever. And rather than get into numbers  here, let me focus on just a few stories.   We led a bipartisan push to prevent the deportation of Iraqi  nationals, and we secured the return of Jimmy Aldaoud's remains to the  U.S. after he was deported, and he died of diabetic shock just weeks  later. That man had never set foot in Iraq, he spoke no Arabic. He was  obviously American. I won't go into all the upset about that, but his  tragic story helped awaken society to these senseless deportations.   Together, we helped our residents navigate a once-in-a-century  pandemic. We worked with State partners to help constituents obtain  expanded pandemic unemployment benefits that this House created, and  we worked with the State Department to help constituents stuck overseas  during the early global COVID shutdown. We helped them make it home.  And we helped countless small businesses, of course, obtain PPE and the  EIDL loans.    We fought successfully for the release of a Black high school student  who was put in juvenile detention for not completing her homework, Mr.  Speaker, during remote learning; put in, essentially, jail for young  people.   Remember the story of Grace, as she was called? It made national  news. And the fact that it happened speaks to structural racism in  educational and criminal justice systems. And the need to fight it both  case-by-case, like we did with Grace, and systemically to end it as a  future of our country.   We helped a Royal Oak couple overcome incredible odds to be able to  complete their fertility treatment overseas during the height of the  pandemic.   Just last month, my wife Mary and I visited with this wonderful  couple and the son who was born as a result of these efforts, who is  today a healthy toddler.   And what to say about the case of Danny Fenster, a journalist who  attended the same high school as me who was held as a political  prisoner for 5\1/2\ months in the horrible, insane prison in Burma.   His incredibly tenacious family and I were in constant contact, and I  spoke to ambassadors across the globe working to bring him home.   My staff and I were so honored to join the family to welcome him home  to the U.S. when he touched down in New York, and to follow his  continued advocacy for press freedom in Burma and everywhere. And  today, he is a journalism fellow at one of our most prestigious  universities.   One of the things I think is most important for an effective  Congressional operation is breaking down barriers and creating great  collaboration between the D.C. and district offices. It is not that  easy.  [[Page H9889]]    Let me share a few stories that illustrate why I think this is so  important. In a virtual outreach event with sexual assault survivors  and advocates, we met Carmen Wargel of Royal Oak and heard about  significant problems for survivors seeking to prosecute those who  abused them.   Because of that activity in the district, we authored an amendment  that passed the House in the Violence Against Women Act to promote  better outcomes and care through vertical integration in prosecution of  sexual assault.   Okay, let me put this straight. I had never heard of virtual  integration in prosecution. I am a lawyer. I know what virtual  integration is in business. I had never heard of it.   When we put together what had happened to this person--I think she  had five different prosecutors on her case, one after the other--it was  because of our discussions with constituents in the district that we  wrote legislation that passed the House.   Another big deal for us was introducing a resolution recognizing  Abortion Provider Appreciation Day. It was the first time this had ever  been done in Congressional history. But we didn't just do this in D.C.  It was inspired by abortion care providers at home in the district, and  we marked it with an event at the Northland Family Planning Clinic with  Renee and Lara Chelian in Sterling Heights, Michigan.   Certainly, our Community Project Funding projects are another great  example of D.C.-district collaboration. We worked with community  leaders to put forward projects for Federal funding in line with our  shared priorities; nearly $28 million when you combine fiscal years  2022 and 2023. In March of this year, 2022, all 10 of our projects for  the fiscal year were signed into law by President Joe Biden.   To give just a few examples of this, we are providing 3.5 million  gallons of additional storage at the Chapaton Retention Basin to reduce  combined sewage overflows, alleviate residential basement flooding  during heavy rain events, and improve the water quality of Lake St.  Clair, which serves as a source of drinking water for much of Southeast  Michigan.   We are creating a community space to serve as a heating and cooling  center for residents of Hazel Park and neighboring Ferndale, a gallery  for local artists, and a location for job fairs and educational  seminars.   We are establishing an Individual Development Account program at  Macomb Community College for workforce development and certification  courses, offering direct services to individuals to enhance employment  opportunities and regional prosperity.   We have done a lot, and I am so proud of all that this team has  accomplished, and especially the way we have done it, not just working  hard but supporting each other. Building the beloved community from the  inside out, even as we fight for justice in our local communities and  in far-flung areas all across this planet.   So I suppose there is no better place to conclude than one of our  signal achievements: Passing a resolution to allow the staff of this  very House of Representatives to organize unions and bargain  collectively.   Amazingly, Congress passed legislation in 1995 to apply Federal  employment regulations including collective bargaining to Capitol Hill.  But when they implemented the legislation in 1996 the next year, they  included the Capitol Police and the Library of Congress and the  Architect of the Capitol, and so forth. But they left out the people  who work with us most directly--our own staff in the district offices,  in our D.C. offices, and on our committees.   That was 26 years ago, and that wrong was never corrected until this  year when House employees came to introduce a resolution to extend  these basic rights of democracy to our staff, and together, we passed  it through this House of Representatives.   I was so moved when my own staff were the very first to organize a  union with a Congressional Workers Union, and now they are the very  first to bargain a contract.   Mr. Speaker, already 14 offices have voted to unionize with CWU, so  the precedent is set, and I believe more offices will organize and more  contracts will be bargained in the 118th Congress.    That is why I came to Congress, to expand human rights, to expand the  voice and power of workers and justice for their families, whether they  are in the halls of Congress or on farms or in factories or offices  across this land and beyond our shores.   I don't believe in the great person theory of history, Mr. Speaker.  This has never been about me as a person or a leader. It is about  building a team that wants to fight for justice. It is about partnering  with activists doing the same. It is about learning from each other,  falling down, and getting up to fight on another day.   I am so grateful to the people of Michigan's Ninth District for  giving me the opportunity to serve you in this way. I have learned so  much from you in our union halls, our veterans' lodges, our school  buildings, and our workplaces.   As I leave Congress, I believe just as strongly as I did when I  started helping workers organize unions with SEIU in 1983, that it is  for the working people to set the direction of this country. That is  our hope to tackle climate change. That is our hope to create a world  of racial and economic justice. Onward we go.                                time  1430    Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn  B. Maloney), one of my amazing colleagues, the chairwoman of the House  Committee on Oversight and Reform, and a fearless champion for New  Yorkers and Americans from all over this country.    Representative Maloney, your account is  overflowing with the work of justice that you did for the people of New  York and, indeed, the American people. We all know it, so thank you so  much.    That was quite an honor.    That sounds right to me.    It was a big honor to be arrested with you.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my wife, Mary Freeman, and my kids, Koby, Saul,  Ben, and Molly.   It has been a real honor to serve in this body, and I promise to keep  the fire under your feet to do the work of justice.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
