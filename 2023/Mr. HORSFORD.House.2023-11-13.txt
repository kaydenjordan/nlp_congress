 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I thank both Congressman Jackson and Congresswoman  Cherfilus-McCormick for their leadership and for co-chairing and co- anchoring tonight's Special Order hour for the Congressional Black  Caucus.   To the previous speaker and my classmate, Representative   Donald  Payne, I am grateful for his tremendous leadership and personal lived  experience on this very important topic.   I am grateful for so many of the other members of the CBC who have  spoken on the importance of recognizing November as National Diabetes  Awareness Month and have highlighted the disparate impact that diabetes  has on the Black community.   According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Black  Americans are 60 percent more likely than White Americans to be  diagnosed with diabetes by a physician. Additionally, the health  outcomes of Black Americans diagnosed with diabetes are worse than the  outcomes experienced by White Americans. Black Americans are 2.5 times  more likely to be hospitalized from long-term complications, 3.2 times  more likely to be diagnosed with end-stage renal disease, and twice as  likely to die from this disease.   We know that the rate of diagnoses among Black Americans is on the  rise. Over the past two decades, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes for  Black and Hispanic youth has increased by 95 percent.  [[Page H5722]]    At the start of the 117th Congress, the Biden-Harris administration  and Democrats in the majority of the House and Senate made it our  priority to lower everyday costs for the American people and to improve  the affordability of lifesaving prescription drugs like insulin. We  delivered on that promise.   With unanimous support from the Congressional Black Caucus and House  and Senate Democrats, President Biden signed into law the Inflation  Reduction Act, which capped the cost of insulin at $35 per month under  Medicare prescription drug coverage, traditional Medicare, and Medicare  Advantage. Because of this action, some private companies have extended  that reduced cost to others, including children.   The IRA has significantly improved the affordability and  accessibility of lifesaving insulin for the 1 in 10 Americans with  diabetes, including millions of seniors who in some cases were paying  as much as $400 for a month's supply of insulin.   After the insulin cap for seniors went into effect, the top three  insulin manufacturers reduced their prices for all Americans, as I  indicated. This is what we can do when the government works for the  people. This is what the Democratic Party does when we are in the  majority. We put people over politics, and we will continue to do that  on behalf of the American people, who deserve nothing less.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues of the Congressional Black Caucus,  including Congresswoman Shontel Brown, who led the CBC in a press  conference today by marking National Diabetes Month, as well as all of  our members for their work in uplifting the stories of their  constituents who are living with diabetes and who have benefited from  the insulin cap under the Inflation Reduction Act.                                time  2100
