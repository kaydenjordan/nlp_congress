 Mr. Speaker, since the Bill of Rights was  ratified in 1791, the right to free speech has been the cornerstone of  American democracy.   Sadly, we have seen deliberate and malicious attempts by President  Biden  [[Page H3686]]  and his administration to censor and silence this unalienable right.   Under the guise of public health, the Biden administration has  attempted to use the Oval Office as a bully pulpit to punish those who  share beliefs that the President disagrees with and news that he  doesn't like.   The Federal Government should never punish Americans for using First  Amendment rights, and the decision by a U.S. district judge to limit  the Biden administration's contact with social media companies is a  positive first step toward correcting these wrongs.   My constituents who have been censored deserve accountability, and it  is time for the Biden administration to fully admit to the actions that  were taken to stifle free speech.                            ____________________
