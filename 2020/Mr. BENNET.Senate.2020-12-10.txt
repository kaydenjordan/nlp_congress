 Mr. President, I rise to commend a great educator,  Susana Cordova, for her service to Denver, our schools, and our  children. As Susana steps down as superintendent of Denver Public  Schools, it is the right time to say thank you and, more, to say how  much we love and respect her for her dedication. She has done so much  more than give 30 years to the Denver Public Schools.   At every moment of her DPS career, Susana has been an educator's  educator--committed to each student, able to see their unique gifts and  envision their individual success, and willing to meet them where they  are so she could walk alongside them as they learned.   She began as a teacher, first at Denver's Horace Mann Middle School  and West High School. There, she taught language arts to students who  mostly spoke Spanish at home. She became an assistant principal at  Bryant-Webster Elementary School and then a principal at Remington  Elementary School, two more schools that served Spanish-speaking  families. In her 4 years at Remington, the school saw gains of 33  percent in reading.   In 2002, she joined district leadership and again worked tirelessly  to improve outcomes for students. Susana knew that the way to do this  was to challenge students academically--to read the poem and write a  clear argument about it, to think like a mathematician and show your  work, to take courses that earned college credit or offered real  workplace experience. Her approach placed high expectations on teachers  and principals, not just students. But because she had done the work  herself, she was compassionate and always joined with her colleagues  learning how to meet those expectations.   In nearly all of these years, DPS improved graduation, literacy, and  math rates faster than the State of Colorado. Just as important,  achievement gaps narrowed. Throughout Susana's tenure as an  instructional leader, DPS focused on improving the academic outcomes of  students of color and students from families who qualify for free  lunch. She would be the first to say that Denver, like other big-city  school systems, has plenty of work left to do. There are still Denver  children who might have even greater opportunity when they graduated if  they were challenged to read ``Bless Me, Ultima,'' if they had a few  more chances to learn how to balance a chemical equation, or if they  graduated with a little college credit to help them along the way to  earning a college degree.   Susana's commitment to DPS is more than professional. As a student,  she attended kindergarten at Denver's Barnum Elementary School. She  went on to Kepner Middle School and graduated from Abraham Lincoln High  [[Page S7420]]  School. She became the first in her family to go to college. Her roots  in DPS span three generations. Her mother, Rita Cordova, attended  Denver's Franklin and Greenlee elementary schools, Baker Junior High  School, and West High School, before beginning a career as an office  professional at Denver's Lake Junior High and then her alma mater,  West. Both of Susana and Eric's children, Alex and Carmen, are DPS  graduates.   Public education is one generation's commitment of equity, freedom,  and prosperity to the generation that follows. Susana's story teaches  us what happens when we follow through. Mothers and fathers pass the  benefits forward to their daughters and sons. At a community meeting  held before she was selected by the Denver Board of Education to become  superintendent, she described the promise of public education like  this:         It gave me access and opportunity to a world that didn't       exist in my neighborhood. My mother grew up in Denver and       went to the Denver public schools, as well. She didn't have       access to the kinds of classes I had access to. It leveled       the playing field for minority kids like me.    Public education is not a promise that keeps itself. Susana's career  in DPS teaches us how much work is needed to make sure we don't drop  the ball. We keep the promise one student and one classroom at a time.  It takes teachers, principals and district leaders, families, and  community members, each willing, like Susana, to do their part with the  patience and diligence they would wish for their own child.                            ____________________
