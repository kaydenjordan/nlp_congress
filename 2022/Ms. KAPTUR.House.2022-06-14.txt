 Mr. Speaker, the Biden administration abandoning tariffs  on imported solar companies is terrible.   What is the administration's strategy to protect American companies  and American workers who are going to be harmed?   First Solar and Solar Toledo, Ohio, two companies whose products are  unrivaled anywhere on Earth, are at risk with thousands of workers'  jobs on the line.   These firms employ hardworking Ohioans earning living wages that  support themselves and their families, and it is unacceptable to allow  China to lay waste to American industries. China has violated the rules  and tilted the playing field in its favor. Our workers are sick of it.   I have introduced a bill to create an office of manufacturing within  the White House to champion good jobs in the USA. This bipartisan bill  would ensure there is an explicit, long-term plan to grow American  manufacturing industries and unleash our full manufacturing potential.    Domestic manufacturing is the backbone of our region's middle class,  and it is time the Federal Government recognizes it.   Enough is enough. Let America's workers succeed.                            ____________________
