 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the Republican's  default on America plan that will hurt Rhode Island's seniors. The MAGA  Republicans that have taken control of this House have given us a false  choice.   Either we go along with their plan for painful cuts for veterans,  seniors, and children, or they will purposefully wreck the economy by  defaulting on the debt. This false choice is wrong and we do not need  to accept it.   In particular, their plan would enact painful cuts on senior citizens  in Rhode Island. How?   By cutting funding to the Social Security Administration so that the  quarter million elderly and disabled Rhode Islanders who depend on  Social Security would face longer wait times for their benefits. Also,  by cutting funding for seniors' nutrition programs like Meals on  Wheels, housing, and slashing funding for home care, putting the lives  of seniors at risk.   This is not about deficit reduction. If this was about deficit  reduction, my Republican colleagues would be lining up to support  President Biden's budget, which reduces the deficit by $3 trillion. No.  This is an extreme agenda that puts working people, in particular  seniors, in the back seat while doing the bidding of wealthy donors and  billionaires and corporations.    We do not need to accept it. People will not stand for it. I will  fight this default on America plan with everything that I have.                            ____________________
