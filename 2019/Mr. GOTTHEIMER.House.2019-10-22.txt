 Mr. Speaker, I rise to welcome my dear friend and a  true leader, Reverend Dr. Marilyn Monroe Harris, and thank her for  delivering today's invocation.   Dr. Harris is the fifth pastor and the first female pastor of the  First Baptist Church of Teaneck, Teaneck, New Jersey, and she is a  beacon of leadership for north Jersey and our Nation.   She is joined today by her niece, Amma, and fellow pastors,  colleagues, and friends from the Lott Carey Foreign Mission Convention.   Pastor Harris is a lifelong civil servant; the founder of the  Christian Women's Alliance, allowing clergywomen to grow together; a  founder of the Foundation Building Christian Institute; and a recipient  of New Jersey's NAACP Award for Pastoral Leadership and Excellence.   She has preached across the globe, from Spain to South Africa.  Reverend Harris also supports our first responders back home, serving  as the first female African American chaplain of the Teaneck Fire  Department, and she currently serves as the first female president of  the United Missionary Baptist Convention of New Jersey.   Dr. Harris brings integrity and excellence to everything she does.  With so much in our country dividing us, Reverend Harris' words can  bring us together so that we can better serve our great country, the  greatest country in the world.   I thank Reverend Harris for praying with us today.   May God continue to bless the United States of America.                            ____________________
