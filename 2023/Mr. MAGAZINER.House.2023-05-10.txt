 Mr. Speaker, Americans are counting on us to pass  real, comprehensive immigration reform. The bill being put forward by  our Republicans colleagues is a cruel and counterproductive measure  that will only make our immigration problems worse by restricting legal  immigration, criminalizing nonprofit organizations, putting children's  lives at risk, and increasing the workload of Border Patrol officers  without the support they need to do their jobs.   Let's send this flawed bill back to committee for further work and  instead pass H. Res. 178 to declare our sense that we are committed to  protecting Social Security and Medicare.   During the President's State of the Union Address, the American  people saw in real time as President Biden shamed our Republican  colleagues into backing off their plans to cut Social Security and  Medicare for now, but we know that there are many in their caucus that  are still scheming to cut these essential programs.   Last year, Democrats and President Biden passed a measure to allow  Medicare to negotiate with the drug companies to lower drug prices. We  should expand this program. Social Security and Medicare are vital  lifelines. We must protect them.
