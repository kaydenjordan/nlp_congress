 I ask for the yeas and nays, please.    Mr. President, service is at the heart of the Americans  ethos. We take inspiration from those who have answered the call to  serve, whether in defense of our Nation abroad or in strengthening our  communities at home. Finding common cause through service is how we  will overcome the major challenges of our time, from recovering from  the COVID-19 pandemic to addressing inequality to strengthening civil  society and democratic institutions to leaving a healthy, resilient  planet to future generations. That is why I am proud to join  Congressman John Larson of Connecticut in introducing the America's  Call to Improving Opportunities Now, ACTION for National Service Act.  Our legislation calls for a historic expansion of the number of service  opportunities and an increased investment in those who serve.   The ACTION for National Service Act will honor our national value of  service, while addressing the barriers that limit citizens'  opportunities to serve. Our legislation will set us on a path to 1  million national service positions within 10 years. It will increase  the educational award so that an individual completing 2 full years of  service will earn the equivalent of 4 years of the average in-state  tuition at a public college or university. Indeed, those who are  willing to serve should not be left to carry a heavy financial burden  of student loan debt. The ACTION for National Service Act will also  ease other financial barriers to service by increasing the living  allowance and eliminating the tax liability for the education awards  and living stipends. The bill calls for a robust outreach effort to  ensure that all young people will know about the many opportunities to  serve their country and their communities. It will mobilize a Civilian  Climate Corps to address the urgent needs of hardest hit communities.  Finally, the ACTION for National Service Act calls for elevating the  Corporation for National and Community Service to a Cabinet-level  Agency and establishes a National Service Foundation to leverage  private sector resources to support national service activities.   Mr. President, it is time we reinvigorate the social contract we have  with each other. Americans have a deep tradition of service, starting  with the dedicated men and women of our Armed Forces and including all  those who have served in AmeriCorps, Senior Corps, and the Peace Corps.  However, as more Americans desire to serve, it is important that they  be given the opportunity to do so. It is just as important to invest in  the education and professional development of those who have sacrificed  and given so much to our Nation. Developing the talents of our most  committed citizens pays lifelong dividends. Our investment in the GI  Bill not only honors our servicemembers but also enriches our Nation.  Similarly, the education awards for those who have served through our  national programs have economic impacts beyond the individuals who earn  them. That is the new deal that the ACTION for National Service Act  offers.   All AmeriCorps members take a pledge to get things done for  Americans, to make communities safer, smarter and healthier, and to  bring us together. It is a pledge we all should commit ourselves to.   I would like to thank Senators Coons, Baldwin, Brown, Blumenthal,  Gillibrand, and Klobuchar for joining me as original cosponsors of the  ACTION for National Service Act and to urge our colleagues to join us  in working for its passage so we can ensure that all who aspire to  serve have the opportunity to do so.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Ms. Ernst, Mr. Durbin, Ms.          Murkowski, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Capito,          Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Portman, Mr. Schatz, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Brown,          Mr. Cramer, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Tillis, Mr. Blumenthal, Mr. Moran,          Mr. Manchin, and Mr. Burr):   S. 3623.
