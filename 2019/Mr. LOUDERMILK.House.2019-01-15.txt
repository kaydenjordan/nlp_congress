 Madam Speaker, I also want to thank my colleagues  from the Freedom Caucus for the hour that they spent sharing with the  American people the facts and the statistics of what is happening at  our southern border because of the inaction of Congress over quite a  long time.   As a historian, I love this building. I love the Capitol. I love  spending time  [[Page H595]]  in this Chamber just thinking about the history of our Nation and the  historical moments that have taken place in here.   I love giving tours of the Capitol to constituents when they come. I  bring them into this Chamber and, as they sit here, I share with them  that it is from this rostrum behind me that President Franklin  Roosevelt gave his day of infamy speech.   We walk down the hallway and we go to the rotunda, the magnificent  rotunda that has portraits hanging in the rotunda that depict the  history of America. I share with them about how this is the greatest  legislative body in the history of the world.   We have become the envy of other nations, our deliberative bodies,  for the strength of America and all that we have accomplished in this  Nation, the mind-boggling things that we have accomplished, from  aerospace to business and the ingenuity of America, because of the  strength of our freedom that has been built by a legislative body that  brings the different sides together and negotiates to come up with  solutions, solutions that are good for America.   Our strength isn't because we have always agreed. No, we, quite  frankly, disagree. And our disagreements go back to the beginning of  our Nation.   In that rotunda is a portrait portraying a turning point in American  history, a very critical part of American history. It happened during  the Second Continental Congress, when our predecessors, those who came  before us, the representative body that we now represent, were faced  with a very critical decision. That decision was whether to vote in  favor of declaring independence against Great Britain.   There were strong advocates, very strong advocates in favor of  independence. One of those was John Adams from Massachusetts. John  Adams was strongly in favor of independence and spoke very passionately  of voting in favor of independence. But just as strongly as John Adams  was in favor of independence, you had John Dickinson from Pennsylvania  who also was as strongly opposed to independence.    They continued to debate all aspects of whether they should declare  independence. And, in fact, there were others who disagreed, even to  the point where the first vote for independence failed.   But Dr. Benjamin Franklin understood the power of negotiating, the  power of compromise, the power of bringing two sides together, and he  began to negotiate. He began to bring the sides together. And by the  time they took the second and final vote for independence, he had  garnered enough votes to actually pass the motion to declare our  independence from Great Britain.   Now, the difference between John Adams and John Dickinson wasn't that  they disagreed on the problem they were facing. No, they both agreed  that there were atrocities committed on the American Colonies by Great  Britain. They only disagreed on how to deal with it.   As I mention that, and as you know from history, the second vote  barely passed. John Dickinson remained opposed to declaring  independence. In fact, he voted ``no'' on the resolution when it was  brought before the floor. However, as soon as the resolution passed,  John Dickinson left Philadelphia, and he joined the fight for  independence.                                time  1800    We are at an impasse here in this historic Chamber today, not because  we have a differing opinion, but because we are even refusing to come  together to lay out the facts, to lay out the ideas, and to lay out the  various solutions to this problem.   We are the greatest, most powerful, and most influential legislative  body in the world. We have been the envy of the entire world. Other  nations have modeled or tried to model their legislative bodies after  ours. But we should be embarrassed to where we are today because the  system is broken, and it isn't broken because of a design flaw. It is  broken because of what we have turned this into. We have broken the  system because we have chosen to ignore our own rules, our own laws,  and our own procedures.   Most Americans may not realize it, but we have a deadline. We have a  deadline every year of September 30 to fully fund the government. But  the last time that was done was in the 1990s. We have continued to kick  the can down the road. Every September we get to the point that we just  do a continuing resolution, and we put it off to another date and to  another date until we get to a point that creates a crisis and we must  fund the government. Then somebody holds the funding of the government  hostage for whatever political partisan reason that they want.   The 4 years I have been in Congress I have worked diligently with  others to try to change this status quo system of ignoring our own  laws, rules, and procedures and consolidating the power of  appropriations to just a few who get to call the shots and allow others  to hold the American workers, the citizens, and the businesses that  rely on those workers who were furloughed, hold them all hostage in our  political partisan wrangling. I don't like where we are. I don't like  the way the process is broken. We should not be here because we should  have fully funded the entire government before the end of September.   Now, to give credit where credit is due, over the last couple of  years the House Republicans have made great efforts to try to  accomplish that. In 2017, we were actually able to pass all 12 of our  appropriations bills out of this Chamber before the deadline. It didn't  happen in the Senate, but we were able to do it here. This year we made  an even greater accomplishment; we passed several of them. We passed  five out of here that also went to the Senate. The Senate passed it. It  went to the President's desk, and he signed it. But it is those  remaining appropriations bills that have us where we are today, because  we did not follow our own rules.   I don't like it. Most of the Members I know on our side don't like  it. My dad, a World War II veteran, used to give me a piece of advice.  He said: Son, if there is something in life you don't like, you have  two choices. You can do something to change the situation or just  accept the status quo and go on with your life. But complaining never  accomplishes anything.   We are at an impasse where two sides have dug in on what they both  claim are ideological principles. Let's look at where we are. One side,  the Republican side, believes that the drug trafficking, the weapon  trafficking, human trafficking, sex trafficking, and terrorist travel  coming across the border is a national security and humanitarian  crisis. In fact, the Vice President, when he met with us last week,  used those words, that this is a national security and a humanitarian  crisis we have at the border. The President of the United States also  agrees that we have a crisis at the border.   However, the other side that is also dug in, the Democrats, don't  believe that we have a crisis. In fact, the talking points of the day  have been, as you heard earlier, that the crisis has been manufactured,  that the desire to build a border wall or a physical barrier is a  vanity project for the President, or as one reporter stated as he was  at the border, he said: Things are tranquil here.   So we have one side claiming a crisis, and the other side claiming  conspiracy.   I believe we do have a crisis at the border. I believe that that  crisis is real and that crisis has been going on for quite some time.  As you can see on the board next to me here, I am not the only one who  believes that, not only do we have a crisis but we have had a crisis  that has existed for quite some time.   The President of the United States in 2014 stated: ``We now have an  actual humanitarian crisis on the border.'' In fact, what he said was:  ``We now have an actual humanitarian crisis on the border that only  underscores the need to drop the politics and fix our immigration  system once and for all.''   Now, some of you who are watching on television right now will look  at that and immediately attribute that to our current President,  President Trump. But if you think back, Mr. Speaker, the President of  the United States in 2014 was President Barack Obama. He is the one who  said: Yes, we do have a crisis. It is a humanitarian crisis at the  border.   But today my Democratic colleagues on the other side say that the  crisis doesn't exist, that it is manufactured, and that it is a  conspiracy. It really doesn't exist. Things are tranquil.  [[Page H596]]    Well then you have to ask the question: What changed?   We must have done something significant during that time period. But  nothing has changed. We still have the status quo when it comes to our  border and border security.   In fact, President Obama went on to say: ``In recent weeks we've seen  a surge of unaccompanied children arrive at the border, brought here  and to other countries by smugglers and traffickers.''   ``The journey is unbelievably dangerous for these kids. The children  who are fortunate enough to survive it will be taken care of while they  go through the legal process, but in most cases that process will lead  them to being sent back home.''   This is exactly what our current President is saying. We have a  humanitarian crisis as well as a national security crisis. In fact, for  the 4 years I have served in Congress, I have been saying that our  crisis at the border should not be categorized just as an immigration  crisis, but it is a national security crisis.    When I served on the Homeland Security Committee, we had many  briefings by the then-Obama administration Department of Homeland  Security who went through all of what was going on at the border, the  crossings at the border, the drugs, the weapons, and who they were  intercepting, and I identified at that time that we had a crisis at the  border.   But this issue at the border goes beyond even the time I have been in  Congress. It has been going on for decades. It is a decades-old problem  that because of status quo, because of the broken system that we are  working under, because politicians are comfortable with the status quo,  we have not done anything to address it.   In 2006, I was serving in the State legislature in Georgia. I was a  young businessman who didn't like the way things were going in the  State, so I took the advice of my father that if there is something in  life you don't like, do something to change the situation. So I ran for  the State house, and I was elected.   We were dealing with issues in Georgia of immigration. In fact, a  young man by the name of Dustin Inman had lost his life because an  illegal immigrant driving drunk hit the car killing Dustin Inman and  permanently making his mom disabled. It appeared to us that the Federal  Government, the Congress in Washington, D.C. wasn't doing anything to  fix the situation, so a group of legislators got together.   We said: Look, we may have to address some of this on our own. So we  will go to the border. We will spend several days at the border to see  what is going on ourselves.   While I was at the border, I spent time with Border Patrol agents. We  went up and down the border. They showed us where the physical barriers  were working, but they also showed us where they had problems, and it  was usually where the physical barrier ended. They shared with us the  lack of funding that they had and the lack of adequate Border Patrol  agents. They told us of the dangers that they were facing, but they  also told us the frustrations of catch and release.   We also spent the night with a rancher, after we had met with several  residents who lived along the border. They were telling us the horrific  stories of crime that were going on on their property and in their  neighborhoods, because of the cartel activity going on at the border.  While we sat at this rancher's home that evening--because of the lack  of the adequate number of Border Patrol agents, he had to set up his  own security systems and surveillance systems just to protect his  property and protect his employees on his ranch.   We sat in his home that evening watching on infrared night vision  cameras. You could see coyotes, those who were helping to bring  illegals across into the United States, as they would congregate inside  of Mexico and they would move up to where there was a physical barrier,  a border wall.   I asked him: At this point, what is going to happen? Are they going  to scale the barrier?   He said: No. They are just staging. All they are going to do is move  a few miles down that wall to where the wall doesn't exist, and they  will walk right across into the United States.   That is exactly what happened. We watched as they came into the  United States, they ran to a gully, and they hid in a gully until  somebody came and picked them up. By the time the Border Patrol was  able to get there, they were long gone.   I kept a journal. The other day I went back, and I pulled that  journal out from 2006. I was reading over my experiences, and I got to  the last entry of that journal that I wrote when I got home. That  journal said: I believe the government in Washington, D.C., doesn't  want to solve the problem at our southern border.   Again, they are happy with the status quo.   Americans have been asking Congress to do something, not just about  illegal immigration but about the drugs coming across into our Nation.  As you heard earlier, the Department of Homeland Security has  intercepted enough fentanyl used in opioids to kill nearly two-thirds  of the entire population of the United States. They want us to do  something about the sex trafficking, other drugs coming across the  border, weapons, criminal activity, human trafficking, and terrorism,  the terrorists who are traveling across the border.   But we can't solve any of these issues nor reopen this government  until we are willing and ready to come together and have a national  debate, a debate about the merits of each side. Each side needs to come  forward and present what their priorities are and what their ideas are  for the solutions.   Republicans have done that. We have laid out several different ideas  and several different solutions. We have yet to hear anything from our  colleagues on the other side except for the word no.   We must lay out our priorities. We must lay out our ideas, not just  hurl insults at each side.   Then we must debate, and the debate must be based on truth, on facts,  not perceptions and not accusations. It has to be based on what is best  for the American people, not what is best for the politicians or  political victory or preparing for the next election.   If we are going to get to this place there has to be some things that  take place. First of all, we have to have meetings, we have to have  discussion, and we have to have negotiation. Just as Dr. Benjamin  Franklin did at the onset of this Nation, he brought the parties  together in meetings. They began discussing, and then they started  negotiating. That is how they came up with compromise.   You have to have all three. You can't have one without the other. You  can't have a discussion without first having a meeting.   Two weeks ago, congressional leaders were invited to the White House  to; first of all, have a meeting to discuss, Where do we go from here  to end the shutdown; to do something about border security; to move  forward?   But the answer given to the President when he asked was: Are you  willing to negotiate border security which includes building a physical  barrier?    The answer was no, end of story, end of discussion.   Meetings aren't effective unless you actually are able to have a  discussion and both sides are willing to negotiate.   Mr. Speaker, you also have to be able to deal with facts. Both sides  have to be able to deal with facts. Again, the President invited  leadership of the House to the White House to the Situation Room to  discuss the facts and the issues that you have heard several of here  tonight.   However, as the Secretary of Homeland Security began to go through  these issues one by one, she was interrupted by the Speaker of the  House, Ms. Pelosi, and was told that she wasn't interested in hearing  the facts. In fact, according to a news media report, it was, ``I  reject your facts.''   Secretary Nielsen said: ``These aren't my facts, they are the  facts.''   So we have to be able to deal with the truth, the facts. One question  that I am always asked back home is: Your colleagues on the other side  of the aisle continue to say they are for border security, they are for  national security and they just don't want a wall.   Well, that is a question I have. So when the Democrats rejected the  facts that came from the Department of Homeland Security about the  atrocities that are going on, the criminal activities going on at the  border, the President took it upon himself, and he sent it to Members  of Congress. Immediately upon receiving this data, my  [[Page H597]]  colleagues and my friends on the other side started dismissing the  data.                                time  1815    When it came out in 2017 that the Department of Homeland Security  intercepted 3,755 terrorists, that number was immediately challenged.  And the other side was quick to point out, well, not all of those were  caught at the border.   And they were right; not all were caught at the southern border. In  fact, they properly pointed out that many of them were caught at our  ports of entry at airports, so we should focus in that area and not on  a border wall, even though a number were caught at the border.   Well, that is fine. They say they are for border security; however, I  question that because, when President Trump, in his first year in  office, identified this very problem, that we had terrorists coming in  from nations that are known to harbor, train, and fund terrorists and  he tried to put a travel ban on people coming in from those countries,  the Democrats objected to it and actually took it to court and tried to  stop him from actually implementing that.   So it leads to the question: Do they really want border security?   When the statistic came out that 6,000 illegals associated with gangs  have been apprehended by ICE, again my colleagues challenged that  statistic and brought up that, well, only 800 gang members were  actually apprehended at the southern border--only 800.   Just the other day, the district attorney of one of the largest  counties in Georgia said that the greatest threat to Georgians today is  gangs. And, as we started looking at how do these gang members come in,  our colleagues on the other side adequately pointed out that most of  these gang members were not coming across the border, but they were  here as a result of visa overstays. ``But we really do want border  security, so we should address that.''   Last year, H.R. 4760, in June, was brought to this floor, which  actually made visa overstays a Federal misdemeanor, but my colleagues  on the other side--every one of them--voted against that bill.   The Department of Homeland Security also put out the statistic that  17,000 adults were detained at the southern border with criminal  records. The other side has made the argument that these are just  families that want a better life.   Again, they have rejected the facts. So my question is: Do they  really want border security? Are they really willing to come to the  table and lay out what their priorities for border security really are?   Is it port security at our airports? Well, obviously, they opposed  the President when he took that route.   Is it addressing visa overstays? Well, obviously they voted against  that bill when we brought it forward.   Do they really want to keep the government open and address border  security? Well, they all voted against the continuing resolution the  Republicans brought to the floor back in December and opted to close  the government.   Do I believe that my colleagues want terrorists to come into the  Nation? No, I do not.   Do I believe they want more gang members to infiltrate our  communities? No, I don't believe that is what they want.   I don't believe they don't think that there is a crisis at the  border. I just think that they are happy with the status quo.   You see, this city often runs on people who have learned how to  navigate the swamp. They learn how to use the status quo to their  advantage.   And if you go back and you look over the history of this Nation,  especially the modern history of this body of Congress, we are still  debating several of the issues that we were debating 10, 15, and 20  years ago. It seems that these become campaign issues more than they  are issues that we want to resolve for the American people. Why?  Because we don't want to address the status quo.   What we have in the White House right now is a President whose main  objective is to change the status quo in Washington, to change the way  we do things. Those ideas I support because what we are doing now is  broken. The way we are doing it now is broken.   There is only one way out of this situation. It is for my colleagues  from the other side of the aisle to actually agree to attend the  meetings.   In fact, the President opened up the White House today for another  meeting to start discussing and hopefully get to negotiations, but the  leadership on the Democratic side refused to even show up.   We offered several compromises last year in December to avoid the  shutdown, but the resounding response we received from the other side  was ``no.'' Every attempt that we have brought to this floor to try to  resolve the situation at the border has been met with a resounding  ``no.''   At some point, we have to get away from our own partisan political  wrangling and understand that what we are doing is for the safety and  the security of the American people. It is time to quit just saying  ``no'' and say ``but if.''   I appreciate every person who was elected to represent the American  people, but now is the time to sit down, to have a discussion, and to  begin to negotiate so we can reopen the government and, more  importantly, ensure the safety and the security of all Americans.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
