 Mr. Speaker, the story of the birth of Jesus Christ from  the Gospel of Luke:         And it came to pass in those days that there went out a       decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be       taxed. And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was       Governor of Syria. And all went to be taxed, everyone into       his own city.    And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,  into Judaea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because  he was of the house and lineage of David, to be taxed with Mary, his  espoused wife, being great with child.   And so it was that, while they were there, the days were accomplished  that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her firstborn Son,  and wrapped Him in swaddling clothes, and laid Him in a manger; because  there was no room for them in the inn.   And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field,  keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord  came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them, and  they were sore afraid.   And the angel said unto them: Fear not, for, behold, I bring you good  tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you is  born this day in the city of David a Savior which is Christ the Lord.                            ____________________
