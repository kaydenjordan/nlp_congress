 Madam President, today I rise in support of the  confirmation of Ms. Christine O'Hearn to the U.S. District Court for  the District of New Jersey. I was proud to recommend Ms. O'Hearn for  this nomination. She has the qualifications, intellect, and the  temperament necessary to make an excellent and impartial Federal judge,  and I am confident that she will serve the U.S. District of New Jersey  well.   A proud South Jersey native, Ms. O'Hearn was born in Camden,  graduated from the University of Delaware, and earned her juris doctor  from Temple University's Beasley School of Law in Philadelphia. She is  an expert in employment and labor law who has worked on behalf of both  employers and workers during her impressive career.   She is currently a partner at the firm of Brown & Connery in  Westmont, NJ, where she is highly regarded by her colleagues for her  keen insight and confident command of the issues at hand in every case  she takes on. Twice she was named one of the Top 40 attorneys under 40  in New Jersey. She has also been featured in New Jersey Law Journal's  ``Women and Minorities in the Profession.'' Ms. O'Hearn also previously  served as an adjunct professor at Rutgers University School of Law in  Camden.   In 2020, Ms. O'Hearn was appointed to the U.S. Magistrate Judge  Selection Committee and has served on various distinguished boards,  including the New Jersey State Committee of the American College of  Trial Lawyers and the New Jersey Court's District IV Ethics Committee.   And this year--this gives you an insight of the person that she is  beyond her competence and capability and intellect--she has spent more  than 85 hours volunteering as a pro bono attorney for newly arriving  Afghan refugees in Fort Dix, NJ, informing them of their rights and  helping them navigate our complicated immigration laws. She described  this work as immensely fulfilling and humbling, and I hope it inspires  others in the legal profession to lend a hand to the nationwide refugee  resettlement effort.   Ms. O'Hearn's professional credentials, combined with her compassion  and commitment to the fair and impartial administration of justice,  will make her an outstanding judge.   Finally, I would like to remind my colleagues that the U.S. District  of New Jersey is one of the busiest courts in all of America. As of  last year, more than 46,000 cases were pending before it, many of them  among the most complex and challenging cases in the Nation.   Yet multiple vacancies on the court have left its seated judges with  some of the highest caseloads in the country, prompting the Judicial  Conference of the United States to declare them judicial emergencies.   Now, we have made some encouraging progress on that front in recent  months. However, the people of New Jersey deserve nothing less than a  fully staffed district court, not to mention all of the parties with  business pending before it.   I am confident that Ms. O'Hearn's experience and intellectual rigor  will be an asset to the U.S. District Court of New Jersey, and I urge  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in support of her  swift confirmation.   I yield the floor.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote  that was scheduled for 2:30 occur immediately.    Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, for the Committee on Foreign Relations I  report favorably the following nomination lists which were printed in  the  [[Page S7072]]  Records on the dates indicated, and ask unanimous consent, to save the  expense of reprinting on the Executive Calendar that these nominations  lie at the Secretary's desk for the information of Senators.
