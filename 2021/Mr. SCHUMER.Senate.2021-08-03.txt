 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, Senators continue to work through the  bipartisan infrastructure bill here on the floor. Members from both  sides want to be able to consider as many germane amendments as  possible, but we want to work efficiently to allow those votes.   Yesterday was a positive day in that respect. Democrats and  Republicans agreed to vote on three amendments, two of which were led  by Republicans. Two bipartisan amendments--one led by Senators Thune  and Tillis, another led by Senators Padilla and Moran--were adopted  with over 90 votes.   We have one--potentially two--more amendment votes lined up this  morning. We can hold even more amendment votes today if our Republican  colleagues grant us the consent to do so.   The bottom line is this: The Senate can work through amendments  rather efficiently when we have cooperation between the majority and  the minority, as we have had in this bipartisan legislation. It can go  rather slowly, of course, without that cooperation. In either case, the  Senate is going to stay here until we finish our work.   I will conclude my remarks now in order to give time to the other  Members waiting to speak, but I will come back to the floor shortly  afterwards to join the chair and ranking member of the Rules Committee  asking the Senate to award the Congressional Gold Medal to members of  the Capitol Police force who defended us from a violent mob on January  6.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Well, Mr. President, as you know, as we all know,  January 6 unleashed many horrors, but it also revealed many heroes. A  day that many of us remember for its violence, anger, and destruction  was not without its share of bravery, sacrifice, and selflessness.   I am, of course, talking about the Capitol Police and the  Metropolitan Police. In a few moments, my colleagues Senators Klobuchar  and Blunt will ask the Senate to award them the Congressional Gold  Medal. It is the highest expression of gratitude that Congress can  bestow. I cannot imagine more worthy recipients than the men and women  who put their lives on the line to defend this temple of democracy.   I want to thank Senator Klobuchar, the chair of the Rules Committee,  and  [[Page S5686]]  Senator Blunt, the ranking member of the Rules Committee, for working  so hard on this. And I want to commend the House and Speaker Pelosi and  the House Members who voted for it as well.   Now I must mention that I am still stunned by what happened in the  House, where 21 Members of the House Republican caucus voted against  this legislation. The Senate is different. I expect this to pass  unanimously. That is why we are here doing it today. But those folks in  the House were some of the same folks who likened the January 6 attack  to ``a normal tourist visit,'' who deny the events that day were an  insurrection. The same folks who screamed the loudest about the dangers  of defunding the police refused to defend the police--the very police  that shielded them--from the vicious mob on January 6.   For the life of me, I don't know how they sleep at night.   That is one of the many reasons this gold medal is so important. The  gold medal is about setting the record straight and recognizing the  true heroism on display that fateful day.   My colleagues, we have a moral obligation to never forget what our  first responders faced down. A mob of White supremacists and domestic  terrorists stormed the barriers with vicious force, using flag poles as  spears and fences as battering rams. Capitol Police officers were  swarmed, beaten, crushed between the doorways, and tasered repeatedly.  One hundred forty officers were assaulted that day. Fifteen required  hospitalization. Seven people have lost their lives in connection with  this attack.   Just this week, sadly--I read this story and I ached--two more police  officers took their own lives, heaping tragedy upon tragedy. These past  6 months have been the hardest in the history of the Capitol Police  Force. And yet they still keep watch. They still stand guard. They do  their jobs every single day with professionalism, excellence, and  grace.   Awarding the Congressional Gold Medal is a way to commemorate their  sacrifice and make sure that the truth of January 6 is recognized and  remembered forever.   To our Capitol and Metropolitan Police, thank you, thank you, thank  you for all that you do. This recognition is the very least you  deserve.   Once again, I want to give real praise to my colleague from Minnesota  as I yield to her. She has done an amazing job as head of the Rules  Committee in many different ways and this is one of many. And I want to  thank Senator Blunt who always works in a spirit of bipartisanship. We  are in quite a bipartisan week here, and that is a good thing.   Senator Klobuchar.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote  on the Johnson amendment No. 2245, scheduled for 11 a.m. tomorrow,  occur at 12:15 p.m. tomorrow, August 4.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 250.    I might parenthetically add, a great nominee from New  York.    Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.  [[Page S5708]]     I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum call  for the cloture motion filed today, August 3, be waived.    Madam President, under the rule, this cloture vote on  the nominee will occur 1 hour after convening on Thursday.   For the information of Senators, the process of confirming this  nominee will in no way interfere with the Senate's continued  consideration of additional amendments of the bipartisan infrastructure  bill. We already have a vote on an amendment scheduled tomorrow and  expect further votes as well.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate  consider the following nomination: Calendar No. 294.    I ask unanimous consent that the Senate vote on the  nomination with no intervening action or debate; that if confirmed, the  motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, all  with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in  order to the nomination; that any statements related to the nomination  be printed in the Record; and that the President be immediately  notified of the Senate's action.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that when the  Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10:30 a.m.,  Wednesday, August 4; that following the prayer and pledge, the morning  hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date,  the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the  day, and morning business be closed; that upon the conclusion of  morning business, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 3684.    Madam President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order.   Thereupon, the Senate, at 8:23 p.m., adjourned until Wednesday,  August 4, 2021, at 10:30 a.m.                            ____________________
