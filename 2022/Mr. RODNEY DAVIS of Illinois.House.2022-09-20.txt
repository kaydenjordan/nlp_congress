 Madam Speaker, all I have to say on  this rule is to listen to whatever she said, nothing of what my  colleague from the State of Colorado says.  [[Page H7980]]    I am actually here because my good friend, Mrs. Fischbach, is  allowing me to correct a mistake. I missed the 1-minute time period, so  I am going to use my time to actually honor one of my constituents.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Dr. Thomas Ramage, the fifth  president of Parkland College since its 1966 inception, who will retire  at the end of this year following a remarkable 15 years as president  and 24 years of service to the institution.   Under the leadership of Dr. Ramage, Parkland College completed a $92  million campus master plan that created six new buildings, adding  250,000 square feet of classrooms, labs, and student service spaces to  provide the quality educational facilities that our students need.   During his time at Parkland, Tom has continued to adapt to the  changing needs of industry, acquiring the Institute of Aviation at  Willard Airport from the University of Illinois and forming lasting  relationships with private-sector partners.   Under his guidance, Parkland also leads the Illinois community  college system by enrolling more than 350 international students,  representing well over 50 countries.   Dr. Ramage's strong fiscal management and guidance led Parkland  College through a recession, a State budget crisis, and a pandemic. The  legacy of excellence that he leaves behind is even stronger than when  he became president in 2007.   I have had the pleasure of working with Tom throughout my decade in  Congress. I am proud to call him my friend, and I congratulate him on  his well-earned retirement.
