 Mr. Chair, I thank my good friend, the chair of our  committee, for yielding time.   I come to speak in strong support of the Whistleblower Protection  Improvement Act, of which I am a cosponsor. I especially appreciate  this bill since, as a Member of Congress for the District of Columbia,  many Federal employees are my constituents.   Importantly, this bill would expand whistleblower protections and  ensure due process and enable relief for whistleblowers. We should  appreciate and celebrate our Federal employees, especially our  whistleblowers, and I am particularly pleased that this bill would  clarify that Federal employees cannot be retaliated against for sharing  information with Congress.   It is important that Congress have full information about the  operations  [[Page H7828]]  of our government, and this good-governance measure will help with that  goal.   I am grateful to Chairwoman Maloney for introducing this important  bill, and I am pleased to speak in support of it.
