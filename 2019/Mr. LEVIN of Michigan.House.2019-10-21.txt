 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize  National Disability Employment Awareness Month and to celebrate the  enormous contributions people with disabilities have made and will  continue to make throughout the American workforce.   I especially want to highlight the work being done in Michigan's  Ninth District by the Commission on Disabilities to promote inclusion  in Warren, Michigan. On October 23 the commission is cohosting a  Disability Awareness Fair to commemorate this month and connect workers  with disabilities to important resources.   America is strongest when we harness the talents and creativity of  all of our people. I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating  National Disability Employment Awareness Month and the indisputable  contributions of America's workers with disabilities.                            ____________________
