 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, I want to spend a few minutes talking  about the partial government shutdown, which is happening right now,  and, more importantly, related to it, the men and women of the U.S.  Coast Guard who are working today, like every other member of the  military, risking their lives here, in my State of Alaska, and overseas  in the Middle East, and are not getting paid to do so. They are the  only branch of the U.S. military not getting paid to risk their lives  for their country. They missed their first paycheck today, but here is  the good news. We are offering a solution--a solution that is working  through the Federal Government that has a lot of potential.   Before I get to that, I want to talk a little bit about the partial  government shutdown itself and make clear that I believe the Trump  administration's effort to secure the border should be part of the  solution. Every nation has the right and has the responsibility to  protect its citizens and to protect its sovereignty. In my view, this  is something that should not be controversial. Every nation has the  right and responsibility to do this, and that is what the citizens of  each country expect. It should not be controversial.   In fact, over the past 25 years, every single President of the United  States--Democrat and Republican--has attempted to secure the southern  border and has come before the Congress and said: I am going to secure  the southern border. They have campaigned on securing the southern  border. They have all said this. Even the Members of Congress-- Democrats and Republicans--year after year have come to the floor of  both Houses and said: We need to do it.   In a big speech in 2014, President Obama called the situation on the  southern border a crisis. That was 4 years ago. He called it a crisis-- the previous President, President Obama. I agreed with his assessment  then, and I agree with President Trump's assessment now, which is the  same assessment.   That is why the President is asking for $5.7 billion to secure our  border. It is not an unreasonable request, particularly, when Members  of this body, just last spring, when we were debating immigration  reform, voted for dollar amounts that were much greater than that.  Again, Democrats and Republicans, last spring, debating on the floor of  this body immigration reform and border security, voted way north of  $5.7 billion.   This is just one of the many solutions we need to grapple with in  order to have a functional immigration system that secures our border,  enforces the law, helps to grow our economy, and, importantly, keeps  families together. Securing the border is an important goal.   I am hoping that as we all work on this, Speaker Pelosi, Minority  Leader Schumer, the President, and my Republican colleagues could get  to a compromise on this issue soon. We all need to come together.   The good news, as I mentioned, is that we might be on the verge of  coming together--those parties that I just mentioned--on one of the  issues that relate to securing our border, that relate to this broader  challenge on the partial government shutdown involving the U.S. Coast  Guard. I am hopeful that this could be a template for getting out of  the broader partial government shutdown.   As you know, the partial government shutdown is negatively impacting  Federal workers, but none--none--more so than the brave men and women  of the U.S. Coast Guard. As I mentioned, they are currently the only  members of the U.S. military who are not getting paid during this  partial government shutdown. The Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and the  Marines are all out there risking their lives for our Nation. We  greatly appreciate that. And guess what. They are getting paid to do  it, as they should be, but the Coast Guard members are also out there  risking their lives, especially in my State, the great State of Alaska.  They are out on the Bering Seas, some of the roughest and most  dangerous oceans in the world, keeping our fishermen safe and doing  rescues. They are deployed overseas. They are deployed in the Middle  East. They have been in Florida and Texas helping with natural  disasters, hurricanes--all heroic service. There have been many  shutdowns before in the Federal Government, unfortunately, dating back  decades, but this might be the first time ever that you have every  branch of the military being paid during the shutdown, with the  exception of one.    Let me read a letter from the commandant of the Coast Guard, ADM Karl  Schultz, to the men and women of the Coast Guard.         To the Men and Women of the United States Coast Guard,        Today you will not be receiving your regularly scheduled       mid-month paycheck. To the best of my knowledge, this marks       the first time in our Nation's history that servicemembers in       a U.S. Armed Force have not been paid during a lapse in       government appropriations.    That is the first paragraph in the Commandant's letter to all the  members of the U.S. Coast Guard. It is the first time in the U.S.  history we are doing this to members of the military.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed  in the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:         To the Men and Women of the United States Coast Guard,       Today you will not be  [[Page S205]]       receiving your regularly scheduled mid-month paycheck. To the       best of my knowledge, this marks the first time in our       Nation's history that servicemembers in a U.S. Armed Force       have not been paid during a lapse in government       appropriations.        Your senior leadership, including Secretary Nielsen,       remains fully engaged and we will maintain a steady flow of       communications to keep you updated on developments.        I recognize the anxiety and uncertainty this situation       places on you and your family, and we are working closely       with service organizations on your behalf. To this end, I am       encouraged to share that Coast Guard Mutual Assistance (CGMA)       has received a $15 million donation from USAA to support our       people in need. In partnership with CGMA, the American Red       Cross will assist in the distribution of these funds to our       military and civilian workforce requiring assistance.        I am grateful for the outpouring of support across the       country, particularly in local communities, for our men and       women. It is a direct reflection of the American public's       sentiment towards their United States Coast Guard; they       recognize the sacrifice that you and your family make in       service to your country.        It is also not lost on me that our dedicated civilians are       already adjusting to a missed paycheck--we are confronting       this challenge together.        The strength of our Service has, and always will be, our       people. You have proven time and again the ability to rise       above adversity. Stay the course, stand the watch, and serve       with pride. You are not, and will not, be forgotten.            Semper Paratus,                                           Admiral Karl L. Schultz,                                                        Commandant.     Nobody thinks this is a good idea. Nobody thinks this  is a good idea. So last week, a number of us in this body, Democrats  and Republicans, put forward a bill that simply says we should pay the  men and women of the Coast Guard, even if we are in a partial  government shutdown, just like paying the men and women of the other  branches of the military. They are risking their lives daily. They  can't just quit their job. By the way, if they want to just go quit,  they are going to be court-martialed. That is different than other  Federal service. So that is what we said we were going to do.   When the President came to the Senate last week, I had the  opportunity to raise this issue with the President and his team and  highlighted the fact that this is very different, and we need to work  together. We have a bill. If we get the President's support and  signature on it, that would be a good way to move it forward, and I  have been in communication with his administration ever since the  lunch--working with us.   I am hopeful we are on the verge of a breakthrough because the White  House has said the President recognizes this is a rather unique  situation--very unique--so he has now said he is going to support this  bill. We have Democrats, Republicans, the White House, and the  President of the United States all saying, all right, we are not there  yet, but this is a good start, and this is an important issue.   What is going on right now in this body is we are trying to UC this.  We are trying to get unanimous consent from Democrats and Republicans  on this bill. Again, leadership on the Democratic side and on the  Republican side have all supported this bill: pay the Coast Guard like  the other military servicemembers. The White House is now supportive.  Hopefully, tonight we are going to get this cleared, and we are going  to get it over to the House; Speaker Pelosi and her team will recognize  how dire and important this is--just like Democrats, Republicans, the  President, and Secretary Nielsen Secretary of Homeland Security all  recognize this--and we get to a solution. It is not going to end  everything, but it will be a solution.   I am asking my colleagues tonight, as this bill is being moved  through the hotline for unanimous consent--and I thank all the  Republicans who have already said they will support it. We get my  colleagues on the Democratic side--again, there are a number of  Democratic cosponsors on this bill. The President said he would sign  it. We get it over to the House, and we start to get solutions as  opposed to just roadblocks.   There are just two broader issues I want to raise. As I am  indicating, this kind of work can be a template to getting to a broader  solution with regard to the partial government shutdown--Democrats and  Republicans in this body working together, the White House working with  us, the Trump administration working with us, and, hopefully, the House  will see the wisdom of this when the bill comes over to them, and we  will get a bill signed that takes care of almost 50,000 Active-Duty  patriots--men and women--risking their lives, right now as we speak,  with no pay. I am hopeful that is a template.   Another broader issue that this matter actually raises--that we need  to focus on a lot more in the Senate--is a problem I have seen in the  last 4 years during my time here; that sometimes the Coast Guard gets  short shrift relative to other members of the military. It is wrong,  and we need to work on it together.   Why has that happened? Certainly not because they are not as heroic  and dedicated and patriotic as the rest of the military. I don't think  it is intentional. It is more bureaucratic. The Coast Guard falls under  the Commerce Committee. The Coast Guard falls under the Homeland  Security Secretary. The Marines, the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force  are under the Armed Services Committee and under the Pentagon.  Sometimes things just happen, whether it is retirement pay, whether it  is the example of paying the military, where the Coast Guard gets  treated in an unequal manner. They shouldn't. They shouldn't. We need  to treat all members of the military, all five branches, the same: pay,  retirement, shutdowns. Again, I don't think it is intentional, but it  does happen.   I am the chairman of the subcommittee in the Commerce Committee in  charge of the Coast Guard. I sit on the Armed Services Committee. I  know a lot of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, have recognized  this is a problem. The chairman of the Commerce Committee, the chairman  of the Armed Services Committee have. I think we are all focused-- again, bipartisan--to address some of these challenges where the Coast  Guard is not treated equally among the other services, and that is just  wrong. We need to start working on that, and I am going to continue to  focus on that issue.   The best way we can start working on that is tonight: Fix this pay  problem, which every single American knows is inequitable, knows is not  fair to the men and women of the Coast Guard, but we are on the verge  of a solution. Let's UC this bill tonight--we have the White House's  support--and get it over to the House. At least we will take care of  one issue where there is an inequality between the men and women in the  other branches of the services and the Coast Guard, and then we will  work to fix all the others. I am hopeful we are going to get there  tonight and hopefully will solve this problem in the next 24 to 48  hours.   I yield the floor.
