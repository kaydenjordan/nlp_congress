 Mr. President, near the beginning of the document that  made us free, our Declaration of Independence, Thomas Jefferson wrote:  ``We hold these truths to be self-evident.'' So from our very  beginnings, our freedom has been predicated on truth. The Founders were  visionary in this regard, understanding well that good faith and shared  facts between the governed and the government would be the very basis  of this ongoing idea of America.   As the distinguished former Member of this body, Daniel Patrick  Moynihan of New York, famously said, ``Everyone is entitled to his own  opinion, but not his own facts.'' During this past year, I am alarmed  to say, Senator Moynihan's proposition has likely been tested more  severely than at any time in our history. It is for that reason that I  rise today to talk about the truth and the truth's relationship to  democracy, for without truth and a principled fidelity to truth and to  shared facts, our democracy will not last.   Mr. President, 2017 was a year which saw the truth--objective,  empirical,  [[Page S216]]  evidence-based truth--more battered and abused than at any time in the  history of our country, at the hands of the most powerful figure in our  government. It was a year which saw the White House enshrine  ``alternative facts'' into the American lexicon as justification for  what used to be simply called old-fashioned falsehoods. It was a year  in which an unrelenting daily assault on the constitutionally protected  free press was launched by the same White House, an assault that is as  unprecedented as it is unwarranted.   ``The enemy of the people'' was what the President of the United  States called the free press in 2017. It is a testament to the  condition of our democracy that our own President uses words infamously  spoken by Joseph Stalin to describe his enemies. It bears noting that  so fraught with malice was the phrase ``enemy of the people'' that even  Nikita Khrushchev forbade its use, telling the Soviet Communist Party  that the phrase had been introduced by Stalin for the purpose of  ``annihilating such individuals'' who disagreed with the supreme  leader. This alone should be the source of great shame for us in this  body--especially for those of us in the President's party--for they are  shameful, repulsive statements.   And, of course, the President has it precisely backward--despotism is  the enemy of the people. The free press is the despot's enemy, which  makes the free press the guardian of democracy. When a figure in power  reflexively calls any press that doesn't suit him ``fake news,'' it is  that person who should be the figure of suspicion, not the press.   I dare say that anyone who has the privilege and awesome  responsibility to serve in this Chamber knows that these reflexive  slurs of ``fake news'' are dubious at best. Those of us who travel  overseas, especially to war zones and other troubled areas all around  the globe, encounter members of U.S.-based media who risk their lives  and sometimes lose their lives reporting on the truth. To dismiss their  work as fake news is an affront to their commitment and their  sacrifice. According to the International Federation of Journalists, 80  journalists were killed in 2017. A new report from the Committee to  Protect Journalists documents that the number of journalists imprisoned  around the world has reached 262, which is a new record. This total  includes 21 reporters who are being held on ``false news'' charges.   So powerful is the Presidency that the damage done by the sustained  attack on the truth will not be confined to this President's time in  office. Here in America, we do not pay obeisance to the powerful. In  fact, we question the powerful most ardently. To do so is our  birthright and a requirement of our citizenship. And so we know well  that, no matter how powerful, no President will ever have dominion over  objective reality. No politician will ever tell us what the truth is  and what it is not. And anyone who presumes to try to attack or  manipulate the press for his own purposes should be made to realize his  mistake and be held to account. That is our job here. That is just as  Madison, Hamilton, and Jay would have it.   Of course, a major difference between politicians and the free press  is that the free press usually corrects itself when it has made a  mistake. Politicians don't.   No longer can we compound attacks on truth with our silent  acquiescence. No longer can we turn a blind eye or a deaf ear to those  assaults on our institutions.   An American President who cannot take criticism, who must constantly  deflect and distort and distract, who must find someone else to blame,  is charting a very dangerous path. And a Congress that fails to act as  a check on the President adds to that danger.   Now we are told via Twitter that today the President intends to  announce his choice for the ``most corrupt and dishonest'' media  awards. It beggars belief that an American President would engage in  such a spectacle, but here we are.   So 2018 must be the year in which the truth takes a stand against  power that would weaken it. In this effort, the choice is quite simple,  and in this effort, the truth needs as many allies as possible.  Together, my colleagues, we are powerful. Together, we have it within  us to turn back these attacks, to right these wrongs, repair this  damage, restore reverence for our institutions, and prevent further  moral vandalism. Together, united in this purpose to do our jobs under  the Constitution, without regard to party or party loyalty, let us  resolve to be allies of the truth and not partners in its destruction.   It is not my purpose here to inventory all the official untruths of  the past year, but a brief survey is in order. Some untruths are  trivial, such as the bizarre contention regarding the crowd size at  last year's inaugural, but many untruths are not at all trivial, such  as the seminal untruth of the President's political career--the oft- repeated conspiracy about the birthplace of President Obama. Also not  trivial are the equally pernicious fantasies about rigged elections and  massive voter fraud, which are as destructive as they are inaccurate;  to the effort to undermine confidence in the Federal courts, Federal  law enforcement, the intelligence community, and the free press; to  perhaps the most vexing untruth of all--the supposed ``hoax'' at the  heart of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.   To be very clear, to call the Russian matter a ``hoax,'' as the  President has done so many times, is a falsehood. We know that the  attacks orchestrated by the Russian Government during the election were  real. They constituted a grave threat to both American sovereignty and  to our national security. It is in the interest of every American to  get to the bottom of this matter, wherever the investigation leads.    Ignoring or denying the truth about hostile Russian intentions toward  the United States leaves us vulnerable to future attacks. We are told  by our intelligence agencies that these attacks are ongoing. Yet it has  recently been reported that there has not been a single Cabinet-level  meeting regarding Russian interference and how to defend America  against these attacks--not one. What might seem like a casual and  routine untruth--so casual and routine that it has now become the white  noise of Washington--is, in fact, a serious lapse in the defense of our  country.   Let us be clear. The impulses underlying the dissemination of such  untruths are not benign. They have the effect of eroding trust in our  vital institutions and conditioning the public to no longer trust them.  The destructive effect of this kind of behavior on our democracy cannot  be overstated.   Every word that a President utters projects American values around  the world. The values of free expression and reverence for the free  press have been our global hallmark, for it is our ability to freely  air the truth that keeps our government honest and keeps the people  free. Between the mighty and the modest, truth is a great leveler. So  respect for freedom of the press has always been one of our most  important exports.   But a recent report published in our free press should raise an  alarm. I will read from the story: ``In February, Syrian President  Bashar Assad brushed off an Amnesty International report that some  13,000 people had been killed at one of his military prisons by saying,  `You can forge anything these days,' we are living in a fake news  era.''   In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has complained of being  ``demonized'' by ``fake news.'' Last month, the report continues, with  our President ``laughing by his side'' Duterte called reporters  ``spies.''   In July, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro complained to the  Russian propaganda outlet that the world media had ``spread lots of  false versions, lots of lies'' about his country, adding: ``This is  what we call `fake news' today, isn't it?''   There are more.   A state official in Myanmar recently said: ``There is no such thing  as Rohingya. It is fake news.''   He was referring to the persecuted ethnic group.   Leaders in Singapore, a country known for restricting free speech,  have promised ``fake news'' legislation in the next year--and on and on  and on.   This feedback loop is disgraceful. Not only has the past year seen an  American President borrow despotic language to refer to the free press,  but it seems he has now, in turn, inspired dictators and authoritarians  with his own language. That is reprehensible.  [[Page S217]]    We are not in a ``fake news'' era, as Bashar Assad said. Rather, we  are in an era in which the authoritarian impulse is reasserting itself  to challenge free people and free societies everywhere.   In our own country, from the trivial to the truly dangerous, it is  the range and regularity of the untruths we see that should be the  cause for profound alarm and spur to action. Add to that the by now  predictable habit of calling true things false and false things true,  and we have a recipe for disaster.   George Orwell warned: ``The further a society drifts from the truth,  the more it will hate those who speak it.''   Any of us who have spent time in public life have endured news  coverage we felt was jaded or unfair, but in our positions, to employ  even idle threats, to use laws or regulations to stifle criticism is  corrosive to our democratic institutions. Simply put, it is the press's  obligation to uncover the truth about power. It is the people's right  to criticize their government, and it is our job to take it.   What is the goal of laying siege to the truth? In his spurring speech  on the 20th anniversary of the Voice of America, President John F.  Kennedy was eloquent in the answer to that question. He said:         We are not afraid to entrust the American people with       unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies, and       competitive values. For a nation that is afraid to let its       people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a       nation afraid of its people.    The question of why the truth is now under such assault may be for  historians to determine, but for those who cherish American  constitutional democracy, what matters is the effect on America and her  people and her standing in an increasingly unstable world, made all the  more unstable by these very fabrications. What matters is the daily  disassembling of our democratic institutions.   We are a mature democracy. It is past time to stop excusing or  ignoring or, worse, endorsing these attacks on the truth. For if we  compromise the truth for the sake of our politics, we are lost.   I sincerely thank my colleagues for their indulgence today. I will  close by borrowing the words of an early adherent to my faith that I  find has special resonance at this moment. His name was John Jacques.  As a young missionary in England, he contemplated the question: What is  truth? His search was expressed in poetry and ultimately in a hymn that  I grew up with titled, ``Oh Say, What is Truth?'' It ends as follows:         Then say, what is truth? 'Tis the last and the first,        For the limits of time it steps oe'r.        Tho the heavens depart and the earth's fountains burst,        Truth, the sum of existence, will weather the worst,        Eternal, unchanged, evermore.    Thank you, Mr. President.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I appreciate this colloquy. I appreciate my  colleagues who have been through a lot on this proposal. Many of us  have worked in prior years on immigration reform measures, and I think  we have built up a level of trust between us that helps on these  issues.   Senator Durbin is right. There were a couple of times when you would  just throw your hands up and say: I don't know if we can get there. Yet  our staffs worked hard and well, and I do believe that we have a  proposal that can get 60 votes. We have worked so long under rules of  reconciliation that sometimes we forget that we have to get 60 votes  around here. That is what this bill is designed to do. In the end, that  is what it is going to take--60 votes.   I come from Arizona. We have a lot of Dreamers there, obviously, some  50,000. I have met so many of them over the years, and to say that they  deserve this is an understatement. They have waited so long, some of  them delaying their educations because of not knowing what is on the  other side and some not being able to get the kinds of jobs that they  need because of the uncertainty in their moving ahead. These are the  people whom Senator Graham said we want here. We ought to roll out the  red carpet and say: Please stay here and help build your country. This  is the only country they know. They have everything but the papers. So  I hope we can move forward on this.   Let me talk about a few aspects of the proposal.   There are some who have said that the Democrats are unwilling to give  on this. I hear that on my side of the aisle. I can tell you, on any  compromise proposal--anything that is a bipartisan proposal--both sides  are going to give, all sides are going to give. Yet this one, the Dream  Act, of which I am a sponsor, would have a faster path to citizenship  for kids. This is a slower path here, which is a big give on the  Democratic side, from some 5 years to 12. That is not easy. It is not  easy to tell people: You have to wait a little longer than you  expected. It is part of the legislative process.   I know a lot of people aren't keen on some of the structure that will  go along the border, whether it is called a wall or whatever, but those  of us in border States realize that we need better infrastructure, that  we need better security, that we need better technology, that we need  more manpower, and it is all a compromise. That is what it is about,  and that is why I appreciate this process.   I know that if we allow this to come to the floor and are able to  present this proposal to our colleagues, we will have a lot more  support than we have already on the Republican side.   It was said by some on our side today that the only way we can move  forward is if we get an OK from the White House--if we know what they  want and what the President will sign. I am not sure that we will ever  get there unless we actually put a proposal on the floor of the Senate  and debate it and vote on it. At that point, we will know. Then the  White House will come and say: Yes, I can support that, or, we can  support that with this change or that change. If we are waiting for the  White House to come to us with a proposal that it can support, we will  likely be waiting a long time.   Many of us met with the White House, starting 6 weeks ago, in our  asking for proposals on the border. We said: Tell us what the White  House can live with. What is needed? What is a must have?   We waited and waited and waited for weeks and then got a big proposal  with just about everything thrown in.   I would submit that we have to put something on the floor, and this  proposal is ready. I think we ought to continue over the next couple of  days to build support and add Republican and Democratic cosponsors.  Then I would ask our leadership to put this on the floor. Let's see  where the votes are. We have a short period of time. We don't have much  runway. The last thing we want to do is to come right up against the  deadline, right up against March 5.   The administration has asked the High Court to rule on whether or not  there can be any further extensions or if March 5 is the ``deadline''  deadline. It is my opinion that the Court will come back and say: Yes,  that is it. We have to be ready for that. We cannot afford to wait  anymore. It is time with this proposal to put it on the floor.   Again, I thank my colleagues for their work on this. I thank the  White House--those who have sat down and the President's comments the  other day in that this needs to be a bill of love. I think that it is.  It is also, as Senator Durbin said, a bill that is tough, that has  border security elements, as we want to make sure we are not in this  situation a few years from now.   We have to have a bill, first and foremost, that has the support to  pass the House and the Senate. That is what this is. Make no mistake in  that this is the bipartisan approach. This is the only game in town. As  much as others want to say that they are going to reach an agreement,  they are basically where we were a few months ago. They have a long way  to go. We have a proposal here that can garner enough support to pass  the Senate, so let's move on with it.   I yield to Senator Menendez.
