 Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 539) to require the Director of the National Science  Foundation to develop an I-Corps course to support commercialization- ready innovation companies, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.   The text of the bill is as follows:                                  H.R. 539         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Innovators to Entrepreneurs       Act of 2019''.       SEC. 2. FINDINGS.         Congress finds the following:        (1) The National Science Foundation Innovation Corps       Program (hereinafter referred to as ``I-Corps''), created       administratively by the Foundation in 2011 and statutorily       authorized in the American Innovation and Competitiveness       Act, has succeeded in increasing the commercialization of       Government-funded research.        (2) I-Corps provides valuable entrepreneurial education to       graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and other       researchers, providing formal training for scientists and       engineers to pursue careers in business, an increasingly       common path for advanced degree holders.        (3) The I-Corps Teams program is successful in part due to       its focus on providing the specific types of education and       mentoring entrepreneurs need based on the early stage of       their companies, however the program does not provide similar       support to them at later stages.        (4) The success of I-Corps in the very early stages of the       innovation continuum should be expanded upon by offering       additional entrepreneurship training to small businesses as       they advance toward commercialization.        (5) The excellent training made available to grantees of       participating agencies through the I-Corps Program should be       made available to all Federal grantees as well as other       businesses willing to pay the cost of attending such       training.        (6) The success of the I-Corps Program at promoting       entrepreneurship within research institutions and encouraging       research commercialization has been due in part to the       National Science Foundation's efforts to date on building a       national network of science entrepreneurs, including       convening stakeholders, promoting national I-Corps courses,       cataloguing best practices and encourage sharing between       sites and institutions, and developing a mentor network.        (7) As the I-Corps Program continues to grow and expand,       the National Science Foundation should maintain its focus on       networking and information sharing to ensure that innovators       across the country can learn from their peers and remain       competitive.       SEC. 3. EXPANDED PARTICIPATION IN I-CORPS.         Section 601(c)(2) of the American Innovation and       Competitiveness Act (42 U.S.C. 1862s-8(c)(2)) is amended by       adding at the end the following:        ``(C) Additional participants.--        ``(i) Eligibility.--The Director, in consultation with       relevant stakeholders, as determined by the Director, which       may include Federal agencies, I-Corps regional nodes,       universities, and public and private entities engaged in       technology transfer or commercialization of technologies,       shall provide an option for participation in an I-Corps Teams       course by--  [[Page H2056]]         ``(I) Small Business Innovation Research Program grantees;       and        ``(II) other entities, as determined appropriate by the       Director.         ``(ii) Cost of participation.--The cost of participation by       a Small Business Innovation Research Program grantee in such       course may be provided--         ``(I) through I-Corps Teams grants;        ``(II) through funds awarded to grantees under the Small       Business Innovation Research Program or the Small Business       Technology Transfer Program;        ``(III) by the grantor Federal agency of the grantee using       funds set aside for the Small Business Innovation Research       Program under section 9(f)(1) of the Small Business Act (15       U.S.C. 638(f)(1));        ``(IV) by the grantor Federal agency of the grantee using       funds set aside for the Small Business Technology Transfer       Program under section 9(n)(1) of the Small Business Act (15       U.S.C. 638(n)(1)); or        ``(V) by the participating teams.''.       SEC. 4. I-CORPS COURSE FOR COMMERCIALIZATION-READY                     PARTICIPANTS.         (a) In General.--In carrying out the I-Corps program       described in section 601(c) of the American Innovation and       Competitiveness Act (42 U.S.C. 1862s-8(c)), the Director       shall develop an I-Corps course offered by I-Corps regional       nodes to support commercialization-ready participants.

SEC. 5. REPORT.         Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this       Act, the Comptroller General of the United States shall       submit to Congress a report containing an evaluation of the       I-Corps program described in section 601(c) of the American       Innovation and Competitiveness Act (42 U.S.C. 1862s-8(c)).       Such evaluation shall include an assessment of the effects of       I-Corps on--        (1) the commercialization of Federally funded research and       development;        (2) the higher education system; and        (3) regional economies and the national economy.       SEC. 6. FUNDING.         (a) In General.--Out of amounts otherwise authorized for       the National Science Foundation, there is authorized to be       appropriated a total of $5,000,000 for fiscal years 2020 and       2021 to carry out the activities described in section 4 and       the amendment made by section 3.        (b) Limitation.--No additional funds are authorized to be       appropriated to carry out this Act and the amendments made by       this Act, and this Act and such amendments shall be carried       out using amounts otherwise available for such purpose.     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on H.R. 539, the bill now under  consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to put before the House today H.R.  539.   The House passed a nearly identical bill, H.R. 5086, in the 115th  Congress and, unfortunately, that is as far as the bill got. Hopefully,  we can get more movement on it this time around, get it through the  Senate, and to the President's desk for his signature.   Mr. Speaker, the Innovators to Entrepreneurs Act is a bill I  introduced to spur entrepreneurship and turn American innovation into  American jobs. This bill expands the National Science Foundation's  highly successful Innovation Corps, or I-Corps program, a program I am  proud to have championed since its inception in 2011.   I-Corps teaches scientists and engineers, including many women and  underrepresented minorities, how to turn their federally-funded  laboratory research into successful products and services.   The program has educated more than 1,300 teams, representing 271  universities in 47 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico.  It has been linked to almost 650 startup companies that have raised  almost $300 million in follow-on funding.   In the 114th Congress, I led the effort that authorized I-Corps and  expanded its reach to other agencies, including the National Institutes  of Health, NASA, and the Department of Energy.   The Federal Government invests billions of dollars in research and  development annually, both at government facilities, such as national  labs, and at universities and research institutions. I-Corps is a  modest investment that leads to a higher return on our research  spending by significantly increasing rates of commercialization,  economic activity, and job creation.   Our economy is driven by the ingenuity of our scientists and  engineers, developing innovations today that become tomorrow's great  products. And yet, still only a small minority of federally-funded  research with commercial potential ever makes it to the marketplace.  The I-Corps program helps to change that.   This bill expands I-Corps to meet some pressing needs.   First, it helps more people participate in the program. Right now,  unless you are a grantee of NSF or another agency with an I-Corps  program, the training can be difficult to access. This bill will give  recipients of small business grants from any Federal agency the  flexibility to pay for I-Corps with their grant funds, and will also  allow other entrepreneurs to apply and pay out-of-pocket to  participate.   Second, the bill directs NSF to establish a new course as part of the  I-Corps program to teach scientist-entrepreneurs how to start and grow  a company. While the current I-Corps course does a great job of helping  scientists and engineers determine who their customers are and whether  their innovation is suitable for commercialization, it offers only  limited guidance on what to do after a scientist makes the decision to  become an entrepreneur.   Skills like how to write a business plan, hire a team, and attract  investment are taught in business schools, but not in Ph.D. programs.  NSF recognized this need and has already begun a pilot program to test  curriculum for this new course. This bill will make sure the new course  is fully developed and made available around the country.   Finally, this bill requires a GAO assessment of the I-Corps program,  its first comprehensive, independent evaluation since it was created.  Although the program's success to date speaks for itself, it is  important to continuously improve it by developing metrics to measure  its performance and ensure that Federal funds are well spent.   This bill has been endorsed by a wide range of stakeholders,  including the ``father of modern entrepreneurship,'' who developed the  curriculum that I-Corps is based on, Steve Blank; the former NSF  program officer, who founded the program, Dr. Errol Arkilic; and  several directors of I-Corps Nodes around the country.   This bill is also endorsed by the Information Technology and  Innovation Foundation, the National Venture Capital Association, the  Association of American Universities; the Council on Governmental  Relations; and the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities.    I thank my cosponsors, Daniel Webster of Florida, Anthony Gonzalez of  Ohio, Science, Space, and Technology Committee Chairwoman Eddie Bernice  Johnson of Texas, and Ranking Member Frank Lucas of Oklahoma. I also  thank Senators Coons and Young, who are cosponsors of the Senate  companion to this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I believe that helping our scientists, engineers, and  academics not only advance our knowledge and understanding of the  world, but also create jobs and products that fuel our economy, is a  goal we all can share.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank full committee Chairwoman Eddie  Bernice Johnson for cosponsoring. I want to thank Ranking Member Lucas,  Mr. Gonzalez, and Mr. Webster for cosponsoring--Mr. Webster as the lead  Republican cosponsor on this bill now and in the previous Congress.   Mr. Webster talked about being an engineer. I was an engineer and  then an academic; although, I wasn't an academic as an engineer. I was  a political scientist. But I understand that a lot of scientists,  engineers, political scientists have a lot of great ideas, a lot of  great research.   We as taxpayers put a lot of money into this research. There are a  lot of  [[Page H2058]]  great ideas that come out of it, the possibility for great innovations.   I will always remember when I first met with Steve Blank and saw him  teaching the course that was the basis for I-Corps out of Stanford  University. I thought this made complete sense to me, to be able to  teach scientists and engineers, teach them how to be entrepreneurs,  teach them how to develop ideas into new products, new services, and,  hopefully, new American jobs.   The I-Corps program has been one of the most successful programs that  I have seen during my time in Washington, D.C. This bill will help to  advance that, and in doing so, help advance American innovation. I  think that is a goal that we can all embrace.   So I ask my colleagues to support this bill, and, hopefully, we will  work on it and get it through the Senate and to the President's desk,  because I think this will be a great victory for our country.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the  bill (H.R. 425) to promote veteran involvement in STEM education,  computer science, and scientific research, and for other purposes.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on H.R. 425, the bill now under consideration.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may  consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 425, the Supporting Veterans  in STEM Careers Act.   I want to thank Mr. Dunn and Mr. Lamb for introducing this important  legislation.   Now, more than ever, U.S. global competitiveness depends on our  ability to grow and sustain a STEM-capable workforce poised to meet the  needs of the private sector. With an economy that is rapidly evolving  and increasingly reliant on big data automation and advanced  technologies, the workforce is struggling to keep up.   Although STEM careers offer good pay and job security, companies  across all sectors report having difficulty recruiting workers with the  skills that they need.   The good news is veterans and transitioning servicemembers represent  a group of highly trained individuals with STEM knowledge base and  skill sets employers need. The question is how to get more veterans to  produce STEM degrees and join the STEM workforce.   H.R. 425 addresses this question by supporting research to identify  and lower barriers for veterans transitioning from military to civilian  work environments. The bill directs the National Science Foundation to  develop a comprehensive plan for outreach to veterans with the goal of  increasing veteran participation in the agency STEM education and  research programs.   It also requires NSF, in its biennial Science and Engineering  Indicators report, to publish available data on veterans in STEM  studies and careers.   Further, the bill adds veterans as a target demographic for outreach  under several existing NSF programs, including the Robert Noyce Teacher  Scholarship Program.   Finally, H.R. 425 creates an interagency committee on veterans in  STEM and directs the creation of a strategic plan for transitioning and  training veterans and military spouses into STEM careers.   Mr. Speaker, H.R. 425 will help us cement our global leadership by  ensuring more veterans with the STEM skills we need are able to  translate their talent into STEM careers. I strongly urge my colleagues  to support this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from  Pennsylvania (Mr. Lamb).    Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Dunn for introducing this bill again, and we  will work hard to see this through to the end.   I thank Mr. Lamb for his comments. It is certainly something that I  have experienced, which is employers needing to find more workers. The  men and women who are coming out of our armed services have those  skills that are needed. We just need to give them a little more help to  get them connected. This bill does that.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I yield  back the balance of my time.
