 Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer my support for the  RSC 2020 budget.   I have a copy of that here, so I encourage everyone to take the  opportunity to study it and look for those positive aspects that are  important that Congressman Banks and his team put together to have a  balanced budget.   It reduces Federal spending by over $12 trillion in the next decade  and balances our Federal budget in the next 6 years.   As the gentleman mentioned, the State of Indiana passed an amendment  to the constitution in 2018 to require our budgets to balance, and  Hoosiers have enjoyed a balanced State budget since 2012.   We are among a minority of States that have a Triple-A credit rating,  and Indiana has cut 15 different taxes while still balancing our budget  and funding key State priorities.   This proposed budget addresses out-of-control spending and rightfully  aims to significantly decrease our national debt. We are $22 trillion  in debt as a Nation. That is not my money. That is money that belongs  to the taxpayers. Because we have been paying interest on this debt for  decades, it is really the money of our next generation of American  taxpayers, our kids and our grandchildren.   Madam Speaker, I am proud of what Hoosiers have been able to do in  our State, and I will continue to fight for that same Hoosier common  sense here in D.C.                                time  1730
