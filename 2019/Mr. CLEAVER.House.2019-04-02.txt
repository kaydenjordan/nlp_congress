 Mr. Speaker, I seldom come to this floor to stand in  this well. To me, it is almost a sacred place where the great orators  like Webster debated. But I have got to talk about this because it is  something that is impacting thousands and thousands of people I  represent in my district.   In a recent letter from the President of the Missouri Soybean  Association, farmers expressed their concerns regarding President  Trump's ongoing statements on tariffs and the U.S.-China trade  relationships, stating: ``Missouri farmers have invested time away from  their farm, family, and millions of dollars in developing their foreign  markets, and it's imperative that we don't jeopardize these  investments. . . .''   At what point do we call on one another to address the inevitable  detriment these farmers are routinely placed in under this  administration?   In Missouri alone, the restricted access to China, which is the  number one trading partner for U.S. soybean farmers, has created a $2  drop in soybean prices, resulting in nearly $212 million in lost  earnings, over 3,000 fewer jobs, and an estimated $726.6 million annual  reduction in State and local economic activity--for the State of  Missouri alone. Imagine the combined impact this has had on other  States that are major producers and exporters.    Using America's farmers as collateral in a trade war is wrong, and  hardworking farmers, their families, and our communities deserve much  better.   Farmers in Missouri and across this country working to not only  provide for their families deserve market stability and access to the  opportunity to forge trade relationships abroad. They deserve to have  the backing of a Federal Government that supports and advocates for  their success.   Simply put, farmers deserve not to be caught in the crossfire or  become collateral damage in an imposed and impractical trade war.   Farming is a risky endeavor, and Mother Nature may at any time bring  drought, flooding, hail, and other disasters. The last thing farmers  should worry about is a reactionary trade and policy decision made by  the President, whom most of the farmers supported.   Moreover, though farmers have been patient holding out for the  situation to improve, each passing day that we fail to take into  consideration the interest of American farmers only contributes to a  mounting problem that we must not ignore any longer. Enough is enough.   As the Representative of a geographically diverse district that  encompasses several rural communities, I fear what a continued,  retaliatory imposition of tariffs on China would mean for the farmers  in my district: that this is going to hurt.   Now, making a bad decision, Mr. President, is understandable, but not  correcting it is untenable and unfertile.   Last Friday, the President decided to hit below the belt with his  threats to shut down the southern border with Mexico. A border shutdown  would wreak havoc on the U.S. economy. I didn't say this. This comes  from just about every major economist in the country.   A border shutdown is not in the best interests of the Midwest or this  country. This is another blow to our farmers, and they cannot afford  it. They will be forced to tap out.   Missouri farmers depend on foreign trade to market their crops. In my  State, we have an $80 billion industry called agriculture. When it is  disrupted, the whole State is disrupted.   We have the largest export market, after China and Canada, to Mexico.  The U.S. shipped $19 billion worth of agricultural products to Mexico  in 2018. Mexico is our top market for corn and our third largest market  for U.S. beef.   Missouri pork producers cannot afford the loss of the Mexican market  on top of all the financial losses from retaliatory tariffs from Mexico  and China.   The very threat of a border closure creates uncertainty and depresses  the trade of $1.7 billion in goods and services, daily, that cross the  border.   Missouri's economy has a direct connection to Mexico through Kansas  City Southern Railroad.   Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by just saying we have a 2,000-mile  border between the United States and Mexico. If we shut that down, we  are shutting down the U.S. economy.                            ____________________
