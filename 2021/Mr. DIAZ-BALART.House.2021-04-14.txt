 Madam Speaker, it is my solemn duty to rise today on  behalf of the Florida delegation as we continue to grieve the passing  of our colleague and our friend, Alcee Hastings of Florida.   Congressman Alcee Hastings was more than a colleague; he was a dear  friend to me and to my family. Madam Speaker, my brother, Congressman  Lincoln Diaz-Balart, served with Alcee Hastings on the Rules Committee;  and, through him, I also developed a very special relationship.   Along with Congresswomen Carrie Meek and Corrine Brown, Alcee  Hastings was the first African American from Florida to serve in  Congress after more than 100 years.   Alcee Hastings dedicated his life to serving others and to fighting  for human rights. You know, Alcee lived by Dr. Martin Luther King's  phrase, ``An injustice anywhere is an affront to justice everywhere.''   Alcee Hastings' brilliance, his perseverance, and his charisma, along  with his ceaseless fight for human rights, built a lasting and  meaningful legacy. And even during that last battle of his, the one  that ultimately took his life, he continued to serve with passion, with  great heart, and always with that special spark that he had, that smile  of his that he always had.   We are truly heartbroken by his passing, and we offer our deepest  condolences and prayers to his family and all of those who knew and  loved him.   Florida and Congress really lost a trailblazer.   Madam Speaker, I would also like to thank one very special person,  Lale Morrison, Alcee's longtime chief of staff, for her service to the  people of Florida and equally as important, her dedication and her  friendship to Alcee Hastings.   Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Castor).    Madam Speaker, I offer a privileged resolution and  ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 312         Resolved, That the House has heard with profound sorrow of       the death of the Honorable Alcee L. Hastings, a       Representative from the State of Florida.        Resolved, That a committee of such Members of the House as       the Speaker may designate, together with such Members of the       Senate as may be joined, be appointed to attend the funeral.        Resolved, That the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House be       authorized and directed to take such steps as may be       necessary for carrying out the provisions of these       resolutions and that the necessary expenses in connection       therewith be paid out of applicable accounts of the House.        Resolved, That the Clerk communicate these resolutions to       the Senate and transmit a copy thereof to the family of the       deceased.        Resolved, That when the House adjourns today, it adjourn as       a further mark of respect to the memory of the deceased.   The resolution was agreed to.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
