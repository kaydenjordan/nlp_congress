 Madam Speaker, in the era of COVID-19,  people are reliant on the United States Postal Service more than ever,  a beloved American institution built on trust, reliability, and  durability.   During the Presidential elections of 1864, 156 years ago, during the  end of the Civil War, soldiers were mailed ballots, and they voted and  returned those ballots via the United States Postal Service. There was  no fraud.   Sadly and unbelievably, the United States Postal Service is being  sabotaged from within. The Trump Postmaster has removed and destroyed  671 sorting machines nationally, including 5 of 20 from Buffalo. I  inspected the Buffalo facility on September 9 and found priority mail  delayed for more than a month--or longer.   The dedicated postal workers at the Buffalo facility report that the  situation has worsened in the past few days. Mail is sitting on the  floor. Five of 20 mail sorters were removed or destroyed.   Today I am calling on the Nation's Postmaster to fix and to restore  all mail sorters to the Buffalo facility.   Our postal workers and letter carriers do great work for the American  people. This administration needs to get out of the way and allow them  to do their job, their good and honest public service.                            ____________________
