 Madam Speaker, I rise today to join the Chino  Hills community of the 39th District in California in celebrating its  30th birthday and honoring its rich history, natural beauty, and  wonderful people.   From Chino Hills State Park to excellent schools and a vibrant small  business community, Chino Hills is a great place to live and visit.   We honor our community's past; we recognize the more than 82,000  residents contributing to our history, culture, and economy each day;  and we commit to working together to ensure Chino Hills continues to  prosper for future generations.   I am honored to represent Chino Hills in Congress and will do all I  can to ensure our community continues to thrive for many generations to  come.   Happy birthday, Chino Hills.                            ____________________
