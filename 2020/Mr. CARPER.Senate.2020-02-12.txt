 Mr. President, our Presiding Officer, if I am not  mistaken, is a veteran himself--I want to say Army. Navy salutes Army.  Different uniform, same team.   I want to express my thanks to Senator Whitehouse for his comments  relating to the Vietnam war. I stand before you as the last Vietnam  veteran serving in the U.S. Senate, with the death of John McCain.   I had the privilege of leading a bipartisan congressional  delegation--three Democrats, three Republicans--back to Southeast Asia  to try to find out what happened to our MIAs in 1991--Vietnam,  Cambodia, Laos. One of the people with me in that delegation--amazing  meetings we had with the brandnew leader of Vietnam, a Gorbachev-like  character with whom we met during that visit. We carried with us to  Southeast Asia on that trip a roadmap to normalize relations between  the United States and Vietnam. Vietnam by that time was not North  Vietnam, South Vietnam. Out of our meetings, we started something that  went really well and led to normalizing relations. John McCain worked  it here and John Kerry worked it here in the Senate. A bipartisan codel  worked it in the House.   One of the members in the codel was a former POW--was Air Force, shot  down over Vietnam, POW for 5 or 6 years--named Pete Peterson. He was a  longtime friend and still is my friend. He became the first U.S.  Ambassador to a united Vietnam all those years ago.   I know every time I run down to the Lincoln Memorial and I run back  to the Capitol, I run past the Vietnam  [[Page S1019]]  Memorial with the names of 58,000 brothers and sisters with whom I  served all those years ago.   So I want to express my thanks to Senator Whitehouse for raising up  our colleagues, my brothers and sisters, as he just did.                          Clean Economy Act of 2020    Mr. President, I rise today with a message to our colleagues and to  this world we inhabit: Climate change has become the greatest threat to  our planet. There are others, but this is the greatest.   This image right next to me was designed by climate scientist Ed  Hawkins. From left to right, these are called warming stripes. In fact,  this work of art is called ``Warming Stripes.'' It visualizes our  planet's annual average temperature from 1850 over here to 2018 over  there, going from deep blue to a brilliant orange and red.   What this design fails to capture is just how menacing these rising  temperatures have been and will continue to be for our planet and what  this means for all of us who inhabit this planet today and will in the  years to come.   Our rising seas are already at the highest levels ever recorded. Our  Nation's leading scientists have warned us that if we fail to start  seriously reducing carbon emissions now, by the end of this century, we  may well witness sea levels rise another 6 feet. I am 6 feet tall.  Another 6 feet of sea level rise puts a large part of the United States  and, frankly, other nations around the world underwater--underwater.  The east coast and west coast won't look like they do today.   For America alone, that would result in an estimated $3.6 trillion-- that is trillion with a ``t''--$3.6 trillion in cumulative damages to  our country's coastal properties--think gulf coast, west coast, east  coast, Great Lakes--$3.6 trillion in cumulative damage to our country's  costal properties and infrastructure over the next 70 years.   I might add that the Flood Insurance Program for our country is, the  last time I checked, billions of dollars and maybe tens of billions of  dollars underwater, in the red, already.   While global temperatures warm, ice caps melt, and sea levels rise,  we also know that the extreme weather we are witnessing throughout the  world is not going to get better. It is going to get worse. The  devastating hurricanes and typhoons, torrential rains and catastrophic  floods, the heat waves and drought-fueled wildfires will only become  more dangerous and more disruptive to our economy and to our lives.  Let's take a look at one of the places where that happened just last  month.   This is a real picture from Australia. It is not a movie; it is a  real picture. This is Australia.   The world watched in horror last month as bushfires scorched millions  of acres of forest in Australia--an area the size of my native State of  West Virginia. At least 25 people died in those bushfires, including 3  American firefighters. Experts initially estimated that 500 million  animals died in those bushfires. More recently, that was doubled to 1  billion animals--1 billion, in 1 country.   Meanwhile, our country has been no stranger to tragedy and  devastation caused by wildfires--including fueled by drought and heat-- like those that continue to plague the State of California. Scientists  tell us that by 2050, we could face wildfire seasons that burn up to  six times more forest area each year than today. I will say that  again--wildfire seasons that burn up to six times more forest area each  year than today.   If we do nothing to address carbon emissions, the extreme weather  events we are experiencing now will pale in comparison to the  devastation that lies ahead.   Last year, some 13 agencies across the Trump administration released  a report that predicted that the United States could see climate- related losses of up to half a trillion dollars by the end of this  century--half a trillion dollars.   If we do nothing, the effects from climate change could slash up to  10 percent of our gross domestic product by the next century--more than  double the losses of the great recession. How much is 10 percent of our  GDP? More than double the losses of the great recession.   This is something provided to us I think by the United Nations and  called U.N. Warning. In order to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of  climate change, the world's leading scientists have warned us that we  need to limit global warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius--a  1.5-degree increase in Celsius, period. To do that, humanity would need  to collectively reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by the  middle of this century. Right now, we are not on track to meet that  goal. I wish we were. We are dangerously close to losing our only shot.   As the latest United Nations annual ``Emissions Gap Report'' made  clear, collective global efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions are  falling short, and time is running out.   If we want to avoid the most catastrophic impact of climate change,  we need to step up. We need to step up our game.   This is a chart that indicates the countries that are not in the  Paris accord. It looks like--I am looking at all these countries here,  and I see only one country, ours, that is in red. Ours is the only  country today that is not in the Paris Agreement.   The climate crisis is one that can be solved only by everyone who  shares in the plan working together as one. That is why nearly 200  nations came together in common cause to implement the Paris Agreement  and why they are working together to find solutions to the climate  crisis, but instead of leading the world in this fight, America stands  alone.   We know the EPA already has the authority and tools to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions, but under the Trump administration, EPA's  policies have been used to increase harmful emissions, not decrease  them. President Trump is putting America in the slow lane while much of  the rest of the world races toward a global clean economy.   President Trump claims Americans must choose between a healthy  economy on one side and a healthier planet on the other side. In the  words of a good friend of mine, that is malarkey--or in the words of  President Trump, that is--fill in the blank. Come up with whatever you  do.   Choosing between environmental progress and economic growth is a  false choice. On the one hand, we do face a very real choice, one that  was made clear in the U.N. report released this past December. We  either act now on climate change or we ``face the consequences of a  planet [that has been] radically altered by climate change.''   I say let's choose to save our one and only planet, planet Earth, and  I say it is time for the United States to once again lead the world in  this fight.   The next chart we are going to take a look at is something called the  Clean Economy Act, which we introduced yesterday with over 30  cosponsors. I introduced with my colleagues--33 of them, actually-- legislation that will put the United States on a path to achieve net  zero emissions by 2050. The Clean Economy Act heeds the call for bold  climate action while fostering economic growth that is fair for  everyone.   The Clean Economy Act empowers the EPA to use the authorities and  tools already at its disposal to reach net zero greenhouse gas  emissions by no later than midcentury, 2050. This is the quickest way  we can jump-start governmentwide climate action, by empowering agencies  to use the tools they already have.   The Clean Economy Act builds upon successful climate programs in  States, cities, and private companies, and ensures that economywide  climate change actions continue regardless of who sits in the Oval  Office. Our legislation sets important guardrails to make sure all  Americans reap the benefits as we move our country toward net zero  emissions.   Here are just three examples of those protections. The Clean Economy  Act minimizes costs. First, EPA must maximize greenhouse gas reductions  while minimizing costs to consumers and providing regulatory  flexibility to industry.   Our next floorchart shows that the bill prioritizes environmental  justice. Under our legislation, the EPA must consider and protect  frontline communities. We know climate change disproportionately  affects impoverished and disadvantaged communities. More often than  not, these communities are downwind from dangerous pollution,  [[Page S1020]]  located near industrial facilities or factories, or located in areas  that are already experiencing flooding and extreme weather fueled by  climate change. This legislation will prioritize input from and  investment in those communities.   Our next chart on the Clean Economy Act prioritizes American workers.  The Clean Economy Act focuses on American competitiveness and on the  American worker. Our legislation compels EPA to use American workers,  domestic materials, and strong labor standards to get the job done-- relying on our country's talents to get to net zero emissions no later  than 2050--no later than 2050. The Clean Economy Act also requires EPA  to work with other Federal agencies on programs to protect and uplift  communities and workers displaced or dislocated by our transition to a  cleaner economy, such as in places like West Virginia where my sister  and I were born.   This legislation will not come at the expense of jobs or economic  growth. Moving toward a clean economy will drive innovation and create  millions of new jobs here at home. The Clean Economy Act is about  realizing our true economic potential, potential that under this  administration, sadly, has gone untapped. The Clean Economy Act hits  what we call the sweet spot between organized labor, business  community, and environmental group support.   I just want to thank the many organizations that helped us in  crafting our bill, the Clean Economy Act, including the Environmental  Defense Fund, Moms Clean Air Force, the League of Conservation Voters,  NRDC, Environment America, the BlueGreen Alliance, and the Utility  Workers. I also want to thank the organizations that joined me  yesterday in unveiling this legislation, including the United  Steelworkers, Sierra Club, the National Wildlife Federation, and CERES.   To say the least, it is disappointing that President Trump has  decided to abandon the tremendous economic opportunity to create  millions of clean energy jobs. There are already 3 million. Sadly, for  the folks in West Virginia and Wyoming and other places, they lost a  lot of coal mining jobs. The country is down to about 65,000 coal  mining jobs, but folks who can be trained to mine coal can be trained  to create windmill farms off of our coast. Folks who have the skills to  mine coal have the ability to create corridors of fueling stations for  hydrogen and natural gas and to create charging stations for electric- powered vehicles in the heavily traveled corridors across our country.   Part of what we tried to do in this legislation is to make sure that  we looked out for those workers and to help make sure they have a place  to go and ways to support themselves and their families while at the  same time having clean air to breathe where they call home.   I think it is shameful that our President has forsaken our country's  leadership in this fight for our one and only planet for the sake of  misplaced political gain. That abdication of leadership will be a dark,  indelible stain on his legacy, but while President Trump may not be up  for the climate challenge, our colleagues and I are here to say to the  world that the majority of Americans are ready for that challenge. We  have faith in American innovation. We have faith in American workers to  take on this climate fight and win. The Clean Economy Act will put the  United States on a path to once again lead the world in the fight  against climate change while lifting up America and American workers.   This bill corrects our President's failure to lead on this issue and  directs the EPA and other agencies to move swiftly to address this  serious problem for the good of our planet and for the strengthening of  our economy and creation of even more new jobs.   Famed economist John Kenneth Galbraith once said these words:         All of the great leaders have had one characteristic in       common: it was the willingness to confront unequivocally the       major anxiety of their people in their time. This, and not       much else, is the essence of leadership.    That is worth repeating. All of the great leaders we have had share  one common characteristic, and that is the willingness to confront  unequivocally the major anxiety of their people in their time. This,  and not much else, is the essence of leadership. I am Tom Carper, and I  approve that message.   The Clean Economy Act is our message to the rest of the world about  climate leadership. The United States is preparing to once again lead  the fight against this climate crisis. America, let's roll.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I am sorry. Will the Senator from New  Mexico please yield?    Thank you, Madam President, and I thank the Senator for  yielding to me.   Madam President, former Senator and Vice President Joe Biden was  blessed with many wonderful staff members over the years, and one of  them was John DiEleuterio.   I would like to take just 3 minutes to mention him. He just passed  away. He was a giant in the State of Delaware and also served in the  military.                       Remembering John M. DiEleuterio    Madam President, I rise today on behalf of Delaware's congressional  delegation, Senator Chris Coons and Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester,  in tribute to John M. DiEleuterio, a dedicated public servant who  proudly served our State and country throughout his long career and  life.   John was what I call a happy warrior--in the military for many years  and in his service to the people of Delaware. He supported a multitude  of nonprofits that focused on helping people in need. He was a person  who loved people, and they loved him just as much.   John exemplified what it means to be the ``go-to person'' to get  things done. His relationships and friendships with people throughout  our State enabled him to get things done with speed and dispatch and, I  would add, with a sense of joy.   John's persistence and innate ability to work a room and make  connections, his strong work ethic and ever-present sense of humor was  the core of what made John so successful. His impressive career  included serving as State director--and you know how important our  State directors are in New Mexico, Delaware, and Tennessee. He was  State director for then-Senator Joe Biden, his longtime friend and  former University of Delaware classmate. They were classmates together  for a number of years.   His service included more than 30 years of combined service as a  decorated officer in both the Delaware and Maryland Army National  Guard. He had an impressive career for over 26 years with the Campbell  Soup Company as their vice president of human resources.   In addition, John gave freely of his time serving all kinds of  community groups, including serving on the board of the Delaware  Military Academy, a blue-ribbon public high school. He served on the  board of Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge, the Leukemia Society of  America, the U.S. Service Academy Selection Committee, the Cavaliers  Country Club, St. Anthony's Communion Committee, and New Castle County  Ethics Commission, among others.   He was equally committed to his family, including his wonderful wife  Marlene for 30 years, their children and grandchild, and the many  friends he made along the way, and they are legion.   So on behalf of Senator Chris Coons and Congresswoman Lisa Blunt  Rochester, I am privileged to rise today to evoke the name of our dear  friend John DiEleuterio. People from many walks of life loved serving  with him, loved being with him. I am certainly one of them. The people  of Delaware and our country are very fortunate to count John as a  fellow Delawarean, and it is a far better place to live and work  because of his stewardship.   I will close with the words of another beloved Delawarean who used to  say this: If you want to be happy for an hour, take a nap. If you want  to be happy for a week, take a vacation. If  [[Page S1021]]  you want to be happy for a lifetime, help people. Think about that. I  will close with the words of another beloved Delawarean, who used to  say this to us and to me: If you want to be happy for an hour, take a  nap. If you want to be happy for a week, take a vacation. If you want  to be happy for a lifetime, help people. That is exactly what John  DiEleuterio did his whole life. He helped people. I said earlier he was  a happy warrior. Boy, he was, and we are going to miss him. Thank you  for allowing me to add these comments.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Gary Jonesi  and Kristin Butler, two legislative fellows on my staff, be granted  privileges of the floor for the duration of the 116th Congress.
