 Mr. Speaker, today I stand here humbled and honored to  have had the opportunity to serve the people of California's 39th  District in the 116th Congress.   When I was 18, I wanted to serve my country, so I joined the United  States Navy, and that is what I have done for most of my adult life: I  have served to help both my country and others.   As a Representative of the 39th District, I am proud of the high  level of  [[Page H6910]]  engagement, accessibility, and visibility I have had with my  constituents. I was able to bring back over $367 million to the  district for our schools, job creation programs, fire departments,  resources to combat homelessness, and COVID-19 relief.   Our district office recovered over $550,000 for constituents through  casework and helped 419 constituents resolve their Federal issues, from  Social Security to Medicare benefits to immigration casework and  Veterans Affairs healthcare. We have responded to over 119,000  constituent letters and participated in over 250 community events. I  hosted 30 townhalls over the past 2 years.   At the start of this pandemic, my team swiftly changed their  operations to respond to every concern and question that came through,  working tirelessly day and night to help the 39th District get through  this pandemic. Their commitment and dedication to public service knows  no limit. We raised the bar significantly and set the standard of what  representation should look like for the 39th District. We delivered,  because anything less would have been unacceptable.   From California to Washington, D.C., I listened to constituents,  worked across the aisle, and turned problems into legislative action. I  voted to protect the Affordable Care Act, preserve protections for  preexisting conditions, and lower the price of prescription drug costs.   I also helped secure House passage of H.R. 8, the Bipartisan  Background Checks bill, to bring us closer to ending this gun violence  epidemic and keeping our communities safe. For the first time in over  25 years, the CDC received funding to research gun safety, a  significant step for our country.   As a Navy veteran and member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I  have worked across party lines to improve access to benefits for our  veterans. We got the blue water Navy bill passed and signed into law to  help our veterans, like my father, who was exposed to Agent Orange  during the Vietnam war. Just recently, my bipartisan bill to prevent  veteran suicide and substance use problems was signed into law within a  larger landmark veterans' mental healthcare bill.   I am proud of the work I was able to do on the Armed Services  Committee to protect our servicemembers and their families. I am proud  of the work I have done to diversify our officer corps, protect  military children from child abuse, and fight sexual harassment and  assault in our military.   In the House, we have also passed legislation to protect our  Dreamers, lift the SALT cap, support small businesses, and strengthen  voting rights, which is what the American people want. But the work  must continue to help those things become law.   There is so much more that needs to be done. It has become abundantly  clear that partisan gridlock is preventing Congress and the Federal  Government from doing its job.   What I am most proud of is when this House came together to get  things done for the American people. We came together to pass great  bipartisan legislation like the blue water Navy bill. At the beginning  of this pandemic, we came together as a House, a Congress, and as a  government to pass legislation that was beneficial to the American  people and businesses. That type of collaboration is what the American  people want to see, and it is what they should expect.   We are still in the middle of this pandemic, and families, workers,  and businesses are being left behind, and this legislative body must  come together again to prevent that from happening. In the end, we must  remember and never forget that we are here to serve the American  people.   As I conclude, I just want to take this opportunity to say thank you.  No one ever does anything alone, so I want to thank my wife, Jacki, and  my boys, Alexander and Christopher, for their love and support.   I want to thank my staff in D.C. and in the district. I can't tell  you how many times I was told by so many people how responsive and  wonderful they all were to work with.   From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank the people of the 39th  District for allowing me to serve as their Representative.   Those who know me know that I am a big baseball fan and a big Dodger  fan. One of my favorite baseball players, the legendary Jackie  Robinson, once said: ``A life is not important except in the impact it  has on other lives.''   I do not know what the future holds for me, but I can assure you  this, Mr. Speaker: I will continue to work to have a positive impact on  others' lives for both my community and my country.                            ____________________
