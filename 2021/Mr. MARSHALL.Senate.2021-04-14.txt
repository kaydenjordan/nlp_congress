 Mr. President, today I am honored to stand on this  hallowed Senate floor and share my gratitude for and the priorities of  the people of Kansas.   I want to start by thanking the people of Kansas who believed in me  and sent me here to represent them. It is an honor of a lifetime to  follow in the steps of heroic Kansans who preceded me in this  legislative body. That includes sharing this tour of duty with my long- time friend whom I have admired for decades and now my senior Senator,  Jerry Moran, as well as legends of this Chamber, my mentors Bob Dole  and Pat Roberts.   But before I continue, I want to say a special word of gratitude to  my family for all of their support. I would not be here today without  the support of my wife of 37 years now, Laina, our four children and  their spouses, our three grandchildren, as well as my parents, brother,  sister, and extended family, who in so many ways have contributed to  our campaigns and the work we have done in Congress. I am grateful for  their understanding, their unwavering support, and sacrifice of privacy  and family time, but, mostly, I am grateful for the values they passed  on to me.   I am grateful for the many teachers, coaches, pastors, and personal  friends who inspired me and gave me a solid foundation of values that  have seen us through tough times. These values provided the foundation  for me, a fifth-generation farm kid, to become a first-generation  college student and live my American dream as a physician in rural  America.   And these values have become pillars, the sturdiest of which in my  life are faith, family, community, education, and hard work--a faith  that you live in your heart, not wear on your shirt sleeves; a family  that loves and stands beside you no matter what; a community where  everyone looks out for each other; an education that is the great  equalizer, leveling the playing field for all; and, finally, a belief  in hard work that paves the way to achieve your American dream.   As I traveled Kansas this past year, I carried these pillars with me  while I heard from people all over the State, and they gave three very  clear priorities: No. 1, provide for their safety, health, and  security; No. 2, to bring back our jobs and economy; and, No. 3, to  protect our values and our God-given, inalienable rights.   I am here in the Senate to do just that, to fight for the people of  Kansas,  [[Page S1910]]  for all Americans. But more than anyone else, I am here to fight for  our children and grandchildren. And like another great Kansan, the 34th  President of the United States, Dwight David Eisenhower, the decisions  I make will be most guided by the impact they will have on future  generations, not by tonight's news or the simultaneous tweet that goes  out as I raise my thumb up or down. History will be the judge of my  decisions, not social media.   The motto of the 1st Infantry Division of the U.S. Army, the Big Red  One, housed in my home State of Kansas is ``No Mission Too Difficult.  No Sacrifice Too Great. Duty First!''   It is with this fighting attitude I intend to fully fund our  military; secure our borders; as the son and brother of veterans, and  as a veteran myself, honor our commitment to those who protected our  freedoms and values; and as the son of a police chief, fully support  our law enforcement.   I am so grateful for all law enforcement officers, including those  here at the U.S. Capitol. They put their lives on the line every day,  and we join the entire Nation in mourning those heroic officers who  have made the ultimate sacrifice keeping us safe.   While we too often hear calls to defund the police and weaken our  military readiness, we are still a nation of law and order, and we must  advance President Reagan's philosophy of peace through strength.   Pre-COVID, we had the strongest economy in my lifetime, thanks to  Republican-led policies put into place over the last 4 years. Lower  taxes and deregulation resulted in historically low unemployment rates,  as well as American energy independence and affordable energy costs.  With agriculture being responsible for 40 percent of the Kansas  economy, these policies, along with strong trade agreements, provided  the tools necessary to ensure our farmers, ranchers, and producers  remain profitable and our rural communities prosperous.   But here is what concerns me today. Like my grandma often told me at  the family supper table, there are three things you can count on from  the current majority party: They will spend a lot of your money. They  will raise your taxes. And they will increase regulations. Just like my  grandma warned, within the first 3 months of this new administration,  we have seen an onslaught of harmful redtape, proposed tax increases,  and an unprecedented spending spree.   Fighting government redtape and working to ensure Kansans keep more  of their hard-earned money as a means to harness job growth and help  our economy recover will be what I work for each day.   Lastly and most importantly, as this is what is keeping me up late at  night, I was sent here to protect the Kansas values I was raised on.  These values are still held by the majority of Americans, and many of  us are tired of being canceled, censured, and lectured to.   I acknowledge we all need to be woke up sometimes--woke up for church  on Sundays, woke as a child to help milk the cows on my grandparents'  farm--but we certainly don't need the woke mob to shake us out of bed  every day.   Like all nations of people, we make plenty of mistakes and we have  room to grow, but we Kansans are still proud of our American history.  Rather than cancel it, we should embrace it. America has accomplished  incredible things and defeated enemies of freedom. We should be proud  of our history, hang onto it, and learn from it.   God has given our Nation enormous bounty and blessings to help feed  the world, maintain peace, and protect human rights. America has been  called upon to be the salt of the Earth and remain a bright, burning  candle, not hidden under a bushel.   I believe our country will not fall from another military giant, nor  will it succumb to economic failure created from foreign lands. Our  greatest risk of failure comes from falling under our own weight if we  continue to ignore the self-evident values our forefathers taught us.   Indeed, if we continue paying too much attention to silly hyperbole,  social media hype, and political correctness, this Nation will struggle  and not be the leader of the free world we were intended to be.   Before I leave the subject of values, I want to share how important  and personal the sanctity of life is to me. I had the honor, as an  obstetrician, to deliver over 5,000 babies, and I promise I will work  as hard in this Chamber to protect the lives of the unborn and our  children as I did in the delivery room all those years. I will always  lead on this issue and protect our values.   Leadership is the quality I most remember my dad looking for and  praising in others, and I have always tried to study and emulate great  leaders. To this end, as I sometimes wander the Capitol looking for  solitude and inspiration, I am struck by one of my favorite paintings  hanging in the Capitol Rotunda.   In this portrait, the artist depicts General George Washington,  shortly after the Revolutionary War, surrendering his commission as an  officer. And behind Washington, resting on an otherwise empty King's  throne, are the robes of a King, the robes he declined.   The leadership lesson is that great leaders don't seize more power  when they see the opportunity. Three months into this 117th Congress,  it appears that the power grab General Washington declined is now the  majority's primary modus operandi. We have seen a record number of  Executive orders, the first partisan COVID relief bill, steps to grant  DC statehood to tip the scales of power, an attempt to federalize  elections and destroy election integrity with H.R. 1, and now a  commission to study expanding the Supreme Court.   Like Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz watching the grains of sand dropping  through the hourglass, additional partisan priorities remain on standby  while the timing of dropping the ultimate power grab--the elimination  of the filibuster--is carefully weighed.   The filibuster is meant to force both parties to work together to  come up with long-lasting policies which help Americans. Without it, we  will see tax laws and many other policies go up and down like a roller  coaster, creating uncertainty and making it impossible for long-term  planning.   We are witnessing what may be the most blatantly hypocritical policy  switch we have ever seen, as most all Senators and the President have  been on record previously in support of the filibuster. This flip-flop  appears to be all in the name of greed and power.   So while I come to the Senate intent on fighting against efforts to  weaken our security, harm our economy, and diminish our American  values, I also want to discuss what I am for.   My favorite memories of growing up were spent in the great outdoors  with the people I love the most: my friends and family. Make no  mistake, I will do everything in my power to leave this world cleaner,  safer, and healthier than I found it, and this can be accomplished  while at the same time maintaining affordable energy.   Whether it is environmental policy or economic policy, we need to  level the playing field, both at home and abroad. We must prioritize  jobs for Americans, secure our supply chains, and continue to develop  fair and reciprocal trade agreements. We must lower the cost of quality  healthcare for all Americans. We must stop intellectual property theft,  along with economic coercion, forced technology transfer, and cyber  espionage.   We must stop counterfeit products and illicit drugs from entering our  Nation. In addition, we must stop all censorship, especially the  censorship of conservative thought that is under attack.   For our grandchildren's sake, we must modernize our policies  surrounding Big Tech and social media before they engulf our society.   So this Nation, still very young in the scheme of world history, we  have our challenges, but as long as we stay true to our American  values, we will get more right than we get wrong. But we have to learn  to forgive our pasts and forgive each other.   Over this Easter break, one of my sons told me something that made my  heart go pitter-patter. He said:         Dad, capitalism keeps America at the tip of the spear.    Capitalism keeps America at the tip of the spear. You know, he was  spot on. American innovation, our pioneer spirit, and hard work will  always lead the way and bring victory over totalitarianism and singular  thought and rule.   Each and every American youth and young adult has their own story to  write, and my job here is to ensure everyone has their shot at  happiness and  [[Page S1911]]  their shot at their American dream. While we cannot guarantee happiness  for any of them, those of us in this Chamber can pave the way with an  abundance of opportunity.   As the dreams and stories of so many Americans are interweaved, this  American portrait--this tapestry of blues and grays, of pastels and  earth tones--will keep this Republic in good shape. It is our diversity  that makes us great. As long as we pass on our American values that  have seen this Nation through so many dark nights, we will succeed  through current and future trials and conflicts.   May God bless this great Republic.   I yield the floor.
