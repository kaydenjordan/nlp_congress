 Madam Speaker, last week I had the pleasure of meeting  a young boy named Micah Pickering. He was cute and shy and, you know,  as young boys often are, he would give me a high five, play around and  run to where everybody had to catch him.   Now, he gave me this bracelet. You see, it says: ``Miracles for  Micah.'' And you know what? He is a miracle. He is strong. He was born  prematurely at only 20 weeks. He spent the first 128 days of his life  in a neonatal intensive care unit.   Though he could fit in the palm of your hand, his parents couldn't  hold him at first. His skin was so sensitive, the slightest touch would  cause little Micah intensive pain. It didn't matter where he was. If he  was in that intensive care unit, or if he was still waiting for that  expected date to be born, he could feel, and he wanted to live.   The fact is that children at 20 weeks feel pain. Science increasingly  shows it. The European Journal of Anesthesiology describes how it is  critical to administer anesthesia during fetal surgery procedures.   You know, a standard text on human development, Patten's Foundations  of Embryology, shows how the basics of the nervous system are formed by  week 4.   Dr. Ronald Brusseau, of Boston's Children's Hospital, wrote that by  week 18, children have developed sensory receptors for pain.   Two independent studies in 2006 used brain scans and showed unborn  children respond to pain. These children have noses, eyes, and ears.  You can hear their heartbeats and feel them move. They are human.   The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act--I like to call it  Micah's Law--is called what it is because children like Micah feel  pain. Those children are strong, just like Micah is strong, and those  children should be protected.   Now, I have to admit, Madam Speaker, across the aisle I do hear some  beautiful speeches filled with compassion for the voiceless, the  defenseless, and the marginalized. They are trying to speak for those  who can't speak for themselves.   But what about Micah? What about the thousands of others like him,  the same age he was born? What about the millions who were never given  a chance?   Look into Micah's face--I think we all should--and tell me he isn't  human. Look at him when he was born and tell me that child doesn't have  a right to live.   We should care for the voiceless, for those whose cries of pain are  never heard. We should care for the defenseless, for those who will  only be saved if we act to protect them.   We should care for the marginalized, for those who have their very  humanity denied, even as their noses, eyes, ears, and heartbeats, every  movement are visible testaments of their lives.   These children need love. Their mothers need love. Let's end the  pain. These children are suffering, so let's end the pain. These  children want to live, so let's end their pain.   Micah is a beautiful kid, and there are millions of Micahs who will  never smile; Micahs who will never walk; Micahs who will never scrape  their knees and get into trouble; Micahs who will never learn to read;  Micahs who will never fall in love and have children of their own;  Micahs who will never have the chance to tell their mother and father:  ``I love you.''   We will never know those Micahs. Our lives are poorer because their  lives were cut short. But there are more. Instead of pain--instead of  pain--we should fill them with love.                                time  1645
