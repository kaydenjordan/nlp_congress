 Madam Speaker, I thank Mr. Gohmert for yielding to  me.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the accomplishments of an  incredible athlete from Iowa's Second District.   Kevin McKee of Davenport recently finished competing in the Beijing  2020 Paralympics, where he won a gold medal in sled hockey. Kevin has  proudly represented the United States for over a decade, winning gold  medals in the last three Paralympics.   Kevin has always had a passion for sports, playing tennis in high  school and wheelchair basketball in college. However, Kevin soon  realized his passion for sled hockey in 2020 when he started playing on  the sled hockey club team with the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago.   Beginning in 1960, the Paralympic Games are held every 4 years and  feature a wide range of athletes with different physical abilities,  including impaired muscle power, impaired passive range of motion, limb  deficiency, leg length difference, hypertonia, ataxia, athetosis,  vision impairment, and intellectual impairment. The  [[Page H4120]]  Paralympics are held almost immediately following the respective Summer  and Winter Olympic Games.   Paralympians like Kevin show all of us that with hard work,  dedication, and the drive to succeed, anything is possible.   Congratulations, Kevin, on an outstanding performance. I look forward  to cheering you on in the future.
