 Madam President, yesterday, the House of Representatives  passed a joint resolution that will ensure our railroads continue to  operate and our economy continues to function as the holiday season  commences.   Last night, I invoked rule XIV to place that resolution directly onto  the legislative Calendar. Senators are working morning, noon, and night  to reach an agreement for us to act on this measure ASAP. The Senate  cannot leave until we get the job done, and Democrats will keep working  with Republicans to find a path forward that everyone can support.   One of my top priorities is holding a vote to provide rail workers  with the paid sick leave many of them have asked for. I support paid  sick leave. My Democratic colleagues support paid sick leave, and  we want to see it included in the package. We hope some of our  Republican colleagues will join us.    Forcing workers to choose between their health and their livelihoods  is unacceptable, and for that reason, Democrats--myself included--think  it should be included.   One thing is certain--one thing is certain--time is of the essence. A  rail shutdown is set to begin December 9, but the truth is, we need to  resolve this impasse well in advance of that date.   Suppliers and businesses across the Nation are going to begin  shutting down operations soon if they think a strike is imminent. They  are not going to wait until December 9. They are not going to put  something on a railcar in Seattle on December 7 that may be stuck in  Peoria on December 9 because there is a rail strike, even when it is  headed, say, to the East Coast. So for the suppliers and businesses,  the date, the drop-dead date, if you will, before damage occurs is a  lot sooner than December 9. And there would be painful disruptions to  the economy before December 9 if we didn't act soon.   The consequences of inaction would be severe: unsafe drinking water,  unusable gasoline, shuttered powerplants, and a crippling shutdown of  passenger rail across the country. And those are just a few of the  myriad of problems, serious problems, that would occur if there is a  rail shutdown.   In that scenario, nobody wins; everybody loses. So the responsible  thing to do here is to move forward and do everything we can to include  paid sick leave. Again, we must keep working until the task is  complete.  [[Page S6920]]         Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and proceed to the immediate  consideration of Calendar No. 570, H.J. Res. 100; that the only  amendment in order to the joint resolution be the Sullivan-Cotton  amendment No. 6503; that there be up to 20 minutes for debate equally  divided between the leaders or their designees; that upon the use or  yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the amendment; further, that  following disposition of amendment No. 6503, the Senate then proceed to  the immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 119, which was received  from the House and is at the desk; that there be up to 20 minutes for  debate equally divided between the two leaders or their designees prior  to a vote on the concurrent resolution; finally, that upon the  disposition of the concurrent resolution, the Senate resume  consideration of H.J. Res. 100 and that there be 2 minutes of debate  equally divided between the two leaders or their designees, and upon  the use or the yielding back of time, the joint resolution be  considered read a third time and the Senate vote on the passage of the  joint resolution, as amended, if amended; and that the amendment,  concurrent resolution, and joint resolution require 60 affirmative  votes for adoption, all without further intervening action or debate.    Mr. President, for the information of Members, we are  going to resume votes very soon, first on the Sullivan resolution, then  on the sick-day resolution, and then on the concurrent, final  resolution. Votes will be quick.   I am glad that the two sides have come together so that we can avoid  this shutdown, which would be extremely damaging to the country. I hope  that we can add sick days under the Sanders resolution. And I urge  Members--we are going to try to vote as quickly as we can to get this  done.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    I ask unanimous consent that all postcloture time on the  Blackwell and Pryor nominations be considered expired; that the vote on  confirmation of the Blackwell nomination occur at a time to be  determined by the majority leader, following consultation with the  Republican leader; and that the vote on the confirmation of the Pryor  nomination occur at 5:30 p.m. on Monday, December 5.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I move to proceed to legislative session.    I move to proceed to executive session to consider  Calendar No. 1184.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    I move to proceed to legislative session.    I move to proceed to executive session to consider  Calendar No. 1186.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    Madam President, I move to proceed to executive session  to consider Calendar No. 1187.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.    Madam President, I move to proceed to legislative  session.    I move to proceed to executive session to consider  Calendar No. 1185.    I send a cloture motion to the desk.  [[Page S6936]]     Finally, Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that  the mandatory quorum calls for the cloture motions filed today,  December 1, be waived.    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
