 Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute  to a fallen warrior and a true American hero from the beautiful 25th  District of California. Gunnery Sergeant Diego Pongo of Simi Valley was  killed in action by enemy fire in the Makhmur Mountains of Iraq back on  March 8 of this year. Diego was a marine and part of the elite MARSOC  Raiders unit charged with eliminating entrenched bastions of ISIS in  Iraq.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        August 22, 2020, on page H4254, the following appeared: (Mr.  Garcia of California asked and was given permission to address the  House for 1 minute.)  Madam Speaker,      The online version has been corrected to read: (Mr. Garcia of  California asked and was given permission to address the House for  1 minute.)  Madam Speaker,    ========================= END NOTE =========================     Because of delays as a result of the COVID pandemic, Gunnery Sergeant  Pongo's funeral and formal ceremony were held just 2 days ago at the  hallowed ground of Arlington National Cemetery.   I had the unfortunate honor to attend services along with his family.  My thoughts and prayers are with Diego and his family, his parents,  Kathryn and Carlos; his brothers, Andres and Jorge; his ex-wife, Randi;  and most of all his beautiful 8-year-old daughter, Avery.   Madam Speaker, we lost a true American patriot and a hero, and we, as  a nation, are eternally indebted to him and his family. May we never  forget.                            ____________________
