 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6198, the Countering Weapons  of Mass Destruction Act of 2018. This bill authorizes the Department of  Homeland Security to reorganize itself in order to prevent, prepare  for, and respond to a biological, chemical, radiological, or nuclear  attack.   Yesterday, we came together to mark the 17th anniversary of the 9/11  terrorist attacks. As a proud New Jerseyan, I carry those images of  that day in the work that I do in Congress and on the Committee on  Homeland Security.   Today, in a small way, we are here to honor the loss and sacrifice  Americans felt that day by positioning DHS to better address emerging  terrorist threats. Plans to reorganize DHS' biological, chemical,  radiological, and nuclear programs first surfaced in the Obama  administration.   In December 2017, then-Acting DHS Secretary Elaine Duke exercised her  statutory authority to reorganize elements within the Department to  establish a new Countering Weapons of Mass Destruction Office. The CWMD  Office merged the functions of the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office,  DNDO; the majority of the Office of Health Affairs, OHA; parts of  Science and Technology Directorate, S&T parts of DHS Office of  Strategy, Policy, and Plans, SPP; and DHS Office of Operations  Coordination, OPS.   Though many of us in Congress were disappointed that DHS acted  without explicit congressional authorization to make this major  operational change, the reorganization appears to have been effective  in harmonizing efforts within DHS.   I am pleased that the legislation before you today contains language  authored to ensure that CWMD Office leverages research and development  resources and capabilities by coordinating with the Science and  Technology Directorate.   H.R. 6198 also contains language, already passed by the House, to  authorize the Securing the Cities program. Securing the Cities is an  important tool to protecting New York City and other major metropolitan  areas.   Mr. Speaker, I would encourage my colleagues to support this bill,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, in closing, the ultimate success of the CWMD  Office rests with the dedicated men and women who have served at the  Department.   The threat landscape is diverse, with conventional and  nonconventional threats emerging daily. It is critical that we stay  vigilant and do all we can to ensure that the Federal Department we  established in response to the 9/11 attacks is positioned to meet the  demands of the current threat landscape. By passing H.R. 6198, we can  do our part to set the CWMD Office on a positive course.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this measure, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman from  Massachusetts for giving me the opportunity to speak on what we all  consider a national tragedy, but are trying to do something here that  will help us remember those lost on that fateful day.   Yesterday morning, like many of my colleagues, I was back in my  district to reflect on the tragic events of September 11, 2001. My  district borders on New York City. Across the river, I can see the  World Trade Center building from my district office. Every single day  thousands of my constituents travel to and from New York City for work.   The 9/11 attacks were deeply personal for New Jersey's 10th  Congressional District, as we lost 57 residents from my home county in  which I live in Newark, New Jersey, the County of Essex, and we have  erected a beautiful memorial in Essex County at Eagle Rock Reservation,  which is a mountaintop where you can see over into New York City, where  many people ventured to see what had happened on that fateful day.   And so it has become a beautiful memorial there at Eagle Rock  Reservation, and it is a pristine, beautiful symbol of never  forgetting. The names of all of the people who perished that day are  printed on a marble wall that overlooks New York.   H.R. 6287 will ensure that ``never again'' is more than a slogan. It  will help protect memorials in my district and across the country for  future generations.   The men and women who lost their lives on 9/11 and in the aftermath  of the attacks are American heroes. I am proud to support this bill  which will make sure that the memorials to those heroes are preserved  for future generations.    Mr. Speaker, Hurricane Florence is possibly the most  devastating hurricane to hit the Carolinas in a lifetime. Let us  prepare for the worst and hope for the best.   As global climate change makes extreme weather events more likely and  more dangerous, the Trump administration is burying its head in the  sand. A month ago, FEMA released an internal review of its response to  Hurricane Maria, admitting that, among other things, when Hurricane  Maria struck, FEMA's warehouses in Puerto Rico were basically empty.   Then yesterday we find out that the Trump administration diverted $10  million from FEMA to ICE in order to boost its detention program and  lock up children in cages away from their parents and babies from their  mothers.   This is outrageous. It is just another example of how callous the  Trump administration is and how misplaced its priorities are.   I hope that FEMA and the Trump administration do better in the  Carolinas because Hurricane Florence is going to be devastating.                            ____________________
