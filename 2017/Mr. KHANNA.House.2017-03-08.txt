 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for  yielding time.   The issue before us is far more basic than one's view on the  Affordable Care Act. I recognize that there is a philosophical  difference about the Affordable Care Act: on our side of the aisle, we  think it is good legislation; on the opposite side of the aisle, they  have concerns. But the issue is whether the American people, whether  taxpayers, ought to know the cost of the repeal legislation, whether  they have the right to know how much a legislation introduced in this  House costs.   Now, here is the irony: the Speaker of the House, the distinguished  gentleman from Wisconsin, made his entire career demanding that we know  numbers behind legislation. That was his mantra in his time of service  in the House.   You talk to Doug Elmendorf, who was the former Congressional Budget  Office Director, and he said that the one thing he respected about the  Speaker is that he would actually insist on the numbers, that he would  want to know how much we are adding to a $20 trillion deficit. That is  why it is incomprehensible to me that, in this Congress, under this  Speaker, we would ever be asked to vote on legislation without knowing  the financial impact of that legislation.   These are basic issues:   How much is the repeal legislation going to add to our deficit?   How much is it going to finance tax cuts for the wealthy?   How many people will it leave out of insurance or how many people  would it add to insurance?   There just ought to be a transparent discussion.   Now, it is not just Democrats who want this transparent discussion;  actually, a Republican, the gentleman from Ohio, a founder of the  Freedom Caucus, has expressed similar concerns. He has expressed  concerns that this repeal legislation will balloon the deficit and  explode the deficit, and he wants to know the numbers.   We can have as much respectful disagreement about how to cover people  and whether the Affordable Care Act is  [[Page H1608]]  a good piece of legislation or not, but what we should not be debating  is the public's right to transparency. That is why I urge my colleagues  to reject the previous question so that we can hold an immediate vote  on requiring the Congressional Budget Office to score the repeal  legislation and provide the American people with the basic financial  costs of the legislation.                                time  1300
