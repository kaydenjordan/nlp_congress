 Mr. Speaker, almost a year ago, I spoke here about the  delays in our postal system, and a year later the calls to our office  have not stopped. In fact, they have gotten more frequent and more  frantic.   Since the start of this year, 50 percent of all the phone calls our  office has received are about disruptions in the Postal Service. These  are from seniors whose essential medications and Social Security checks  were over 2 weeks delayed; folks with missing credit card statements,  Medicare cards, past due still undelivered bills accruing interest that  they can't pay because their paycheck hasn't come in; small business  owners reliant on the mail who are completely unable to operate.   Now, to be sure, the pandemic contributes to some of this. It has  increased demand on the mail system, even as postal workers are staying  home, quarantining, looking after loved ones. While leaders in the  private sector have adapted to this moment, Postmaster DeJoy has  responded to this by eliminating overtime, closing mail processing  facilities, and removing mail sorting machines. He has made things  worse.   Now, in the private sector we would fix that. A corporate board  wouldn't tolerate it. They would hold this man to account. That hasn't  happened because we still don't have a fully staffed Postal Board of  Governors thanks to the Senate's failure to confirm President Biden's  nominations. This is no way to run a business. It is no way to treat  the American people.   The Postal Service needs leaders as committed to public service as  our letter carriers and mail handlers. Frankly, so does the U.S.  Senate. It is time for them to act, to confirm these nominees and  ensure the post office has a fully staffed and fully functioning board.                            ____________________
