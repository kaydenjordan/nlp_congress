 Mr. Speaker, Americans are facing the worst  inflation crisis in 40 years because of the Democrats' reckless  spending agenda, including President Biden's $2 trillion bailout bill.   President Biden's new budget deliberately doubles down on that  agenda. It spends $73 trillion over the next 10 years, a 66 percent  increase. The President's budget assumes inflation will average 4.7  percent this year. Right now, inflation is 7.9 percent. To hit their  target, inflation would have to be 2 percent, starting today, every  month for the next 10 years.   Despite ample warning that the President's agenda would fuel the  inflation fire, inflation has now risen 8.9 percent since President  Biden took office. Hardworking families have already paid a $3,500  inflation tax last year and are expected to pay a $5,200 inflation tax  this year. The American people can't afford that.                            ____________________
