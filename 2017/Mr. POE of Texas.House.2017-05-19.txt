 Mr. Speaker, on this legislation, I think it is  important that individuals understand probation officers. I worked at  the courthouse in Houston, Texas, as a prosecutor and then as a  criminal court judge for 22 years. I had probation officers report to  me. That was our system. I knew a lot of probation officers, Federal  and State. I think our society does not understand how important their  job is.   A person comes to court charged with a crime, and the judge decides  to release that person on supervised probation. The person goes back  out into the community and is supposed to follow a bunch of rules or  the probation could be revoked. Probation officers not only have  probationers come to their office to report, but probation officers go  out there where these probationers are--in their homes and where they  are working--and check up on them, trying to make sure they toe the  line. It is a very, very dangerous job, in my opinion.   Many of these probation officers work alone, just because of budget  problems. So they will go out there,  [[Page H4366]]  and they will talk to some probationer about their probation and try to  encourage them to, for example, get a job. That is what you are  supposed to do when you are on probation. And they encounter other  people--sometimes family members, sometimes friends, sometimes  roommates, business associates--and they start yelling and screaming at  the probation officer. Sometimes they commit a crime against the  probation officer. What is the probation officer supposed to do? Call  the police? No.   Under this legislation, it allows the probation officer to arrest  other people who are basically committing a crime against the probation  officer, whether it is an assault or whether it is a threat or whether  it is interfering, maybe, with the arrest of the probationer. That is  what this legislation does. It helps protect the probation officer when  they are out there trying to rehabilitate probationers.   I have heard stories over the 22 years at the courthouse from  probation officers about how, when they go out in one of these areas of  Houston, Texas, some of the people that are there with the probationer  aren't the nicest folks in the world, and they start yelling,  screaming, and actually will commit a crime against the probation  officer--for example, a threat, or maybe even an assault.   Remember, many of these individuals are working alone. They don't go  out there with a SWAT team. They are out there by themselves, and they  are doing, really, what we want them to do to keep that probationer  following the straight and narrow, make sure they are doing what they  are supposed to do. And then sometimes people interfere. This  legislation protects the probation officer and allows the officer to  keep those folks at bay and arrest them.    Now, I have heard the concerns of whether or not this is a violation  of the Fourth Amendment. There is no one more supportive of the Fourth  Amendment than I am. It does not violate the Fourth Amendment. It gives  the probation officer authority to arrest only after probable cause  because a crime was committed. Rather than call for help, call for the  Texas Rangers, they can actually arrest that individual who is  interfering.   I do not believe it is a violation of the Fourth Amendment. I would  hope those people who think so would read the Fourth Amendment and then  read the statute as well.   I support this legislation. I appreciate what the chairman and  Sheriff Reichert had to say.   And that is just the way it is, Mr. Speaker.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire if the other side has any  additional speakers?    Mr. Speaker, as the hot Texas sun set in the west  last night at about 10 p.m., the brave first responders of the San  Antonio Fire Department answered the alarms as a strip mall went up in  a fiery inferno. Sixty-one fire trucks with lights and sirens sped to  the scene. The firefighters dashed into the buildings performing a  search-and-recovery operation, making sure no one was there.   As the fire grew, the intense smoke and heat became suffocating. Two  firefighters were injured, but their lives were saved by other  firefighters. But Firefighter Scott Dean was trapped in the inferno.  This 6-year veteran of the force's life was stolen by the hellish  blaze. He gave his life while saving others from harm.   Texas lost another one of its finest last night. Firefighters such as  Scott Dean are a rare and tenacious breed. They are the American breed.  They run into the flames that everyone else desperately flees from.   Firefighters restore order from chaos, answering the alarm. Mr.  Speaker, they always answer the alarm.   It has been said that all people are created equal, but a few turn  out to be firefighters. One of those rare breed was firefighter Scott  Dean. So the last alarm has sounded for Scott Dean. He answered the  call, and he gave it all for the people of San Antonio, Texas.   And that is just the way it is.                            ____________________
