 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 646, line 3, after the first dollar amount insert       ``(reduced by $5,000,000)''.        Page 647, line 12, after the dollar amount insert       ``(increased by $5,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 500, the gentleman  from California (Mr. Hunter) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.    Mr. Chairman, my amendment transfers $5 million from  [[Page H7081]]  the Coast Guard's Operating Expenses account to its Research,  Development, Test, and Evaluation account. The intent is to support sea  trials for a Jones Act compliant icebreaker so the Coast Guard can  determine whether a leased vessel can meet its immediate needs in  fulfilling its 11 statutory missions around the globe.   I am going to stop my diatribe here. Steve Scalise has a statement.  He is in his rehabilitation center, but he actually cared enough to  write this. I am going to speak here, and these are his words, not  mine:   ``I support this amendment that will improve America's strategic,  economic, and national security interests in the Arctic. As other  countries are advancing their interests in the Arctic, the U.S.  continues to lag behind. This amendment makes clear that Congress  supports moving forward in identifying options for icebreaking  capabilities in the Arctic.   ``The Coast Guard has repeatedly stated we need a fleet of  icebreakers to maintain the presence necessary in the Arctic and  Antarctic to meet and protect U.S. sovereign interests and protect life  and property at sea. Currently, the U.S. has two icebreakers--one of  which is our Nation's only heavy icebreaker and is over 40 years old.  Russia has more than 40 icebreakers, with more under construction.   ``As the Arctic becomes increasingly accessible to maritime traffic,  tourism, and energy exploration, we cannot continue to defer this much- needed capability--especially at a time when China and Russia are  increasing their presence in the Arctic, expanding their icebreaker  fleets, and encroaching over the extended U.S. continental shelf.   ``I urge support for this amendment that will address this immediate  and necessary investment and protect U.S. national security  interests.''   That is from Steve Scalise. Now back to my words.   To help narrow this capability gap between America and our peer  competitors, the Coast Guard should examine the lease of icebreakers  that could be deployed in the near term.   My subcommittee has held countless hearings on this issue, and I am  convinced that a short-term lease of an existing icebreaker is one of  the best chances to ensure the Coast Guard can meet its near-term and  urgent mission objectives in the Arctic.   Mr. Chair, I urge all Members to support my amendment, and I reserve  the balance of my time.                                time  0040    Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Chair, I rise to claim the time in opposition  to the amendment.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California is recognized for 5  minutes.   Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment and so does the  Coast Guard. This is not a new issue. It has to do with a particular,  underutilized commercial anchor handling tug supply vessel, the Aiviq,  which is owned by Edison Chouest Offshore, based in Louisiana.   Over the last few years, the Coast Guard has been repeatedly pushed  to lease this vessel. The Coast Guard has repeatedly made it clear that  this vessel does not have the capability to adequately fulfill its  multimission needs in the Arctic.   The question before us is whether leasing this particular vessel for  icebreaking would be a wise use of taxpayers' dollars, and whether it  would benefit the Coast Guard more than investments in other  priorities.   The Coast Guard needs a heavy icebreaker as soon as possible, but  this is not a heavy icebreaker, or even a medium icebreaker. According  to the Coast Guard, the Aiviq is underpowered for icebreaking, making  it unsuitable for ice rescue operations.   It has an inadequate fuel storage capacity and transit speed, vastly  limiting its deployment time. The Aiviq has no helicopter hangar,  making it unsuitable for patrol activities, search and rescue  operations, and self-rescue. It also has a propulsion system that lacks  redundancy and reliability, and it does not have thrusters rated for  ice operations.   Beyond the inadequacy of the vessel's base icebreaking capabilities,  the current configuration of the vessel is not suited to Coast Guard  missions. It would need to be significantly reconfigured at significant  costs. The fact that it is a commercial vessel also limits its ability  to perform all 11 Coast Guard statutory missions.   For instance, it could not conduct right-of-visit boardings, or  engage in freedom of navigation exercises that are critical to  protecting U.S. sovereignty. And it would be vulnerable to right-of- visit boarding by foreign warships under international law.   The owner of the Aiviq has proposed a 7-year lease of the vessel,  costing $35 million to $40 million per year. The cost, however, would  be much higher considering the cost of reconfiguration.   While this amendment would not force the Coast Guard to sign a lease  for the Aiviq, it seems intended to push the Coast Guard down that  path. Taking $5 million from the operating expenses account for sea  trials would detract from the Coast Guard's operational needs.   If the owner of the Aiviq or any other private interests want the  Coast Guard to seriously consider the use of their vessels for  icebreaking, they should be the ones paying for any ice trials. We  should not be making the Coast Guard pay for it, and we should not be  pushing the Coast Guard to enter into a lease arrangement that it does  not want and that is not a good investment in helping the Coast Guard  carry out its critical missions.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, how much time is remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 3 minutes  remaining.    Mr. Chair, how much time is remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 3 minutes  remaining.    Mr. Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Texas (Mr. Carter), the chairman.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Texas. The  gentlewoman brought up some points about a ship, which I didn't name.   The Coast Guard hasn't built an icebreaker in almost 50 years. We  only have one. There is only one Jones Act ship in the entire country.  It is the Aiviq, but there is only one. All we say here is that it has  to got to be an American-made ship. That is what the Jones Act is.   If we are going to build an icebreaker with U.S. taxpayer dollars, we  are going to use an American-made, and American-crewed, and American- steel ship.   Mr. Garamendi, the ranking member on my subcommittee, has voted for  amendments like this in the past, and he supports amendments like this  going forward. Anything that puts Americans to work, that gives us more  than the one icebreaker that works for 6 months out of the year, this  is a step in that direction.   This is simply for sea trials. This is so that the Coast Guard,  because they haven't made an icebreaker in 50 years, they can take one  out besides the Healy, which is a medium icebreaker that they operate  and ask: Hey, what do we need here? Do we need to expand the bow,  expand the stern? How could we make this what we want?   That is all we are doing here, and it is $5 million.   This is a step in the right direction. Otherwise, we are never going  to have an icebreaker. We are not going to be able to compete in the  Arctic. It will be energy exploration for Russia and China, and not us  because we are not going to be there unless we start right now in this  appropriations bill.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.   Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California  will be postponed.                    Amendment No. 78 Offered by Mrs. Torres    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 78  printed in part B of House Report 115-295.  [[Page H7082]]
