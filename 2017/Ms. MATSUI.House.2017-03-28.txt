 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to S.J. Res. 34.  This is just the latest attempt from our Republican colleagues to use  the Congressional Review Act to gut critical protections for American  consumers.   The internet is increasingly intertwined with our daily lives, and  nearly every American family uses the internet to access and share  personal and sensitive information. The business we conduct online  includes financial information, details about our medical history, and  even information on our kids.   If this resolution of disapproval passes today, there will be no  rules on the books to stop internet service providers from selling that  browsing history without your permission. Because our Republican  colleagues are using the Congressional Review Act to overturn these  critical consumer protections, the FCC can't go back and write new  rules in the future.   Despite what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have said,  the Federal Trade Commission cannot bring cases against broadband  providers. That is why the FTC supported these rules when the FCC  adopted them last year.   Even if you think the FCC did not get these rules right, this  resolution effectively eliminates the FCC from ever acting to protect  consumer privacy in the future. We should be working together to  address any real shortcomings if these rules need to be fixed. That is  not what the resolution before us will do.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against this damaging  resolution.
