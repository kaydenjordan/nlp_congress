 I yield the floor.    Mr. President, you know, these days, information is  only a few clicks away on your computer, and there is more information  to be consumed than there are hours in the day. It is information  overload, and it is overwhelming to sift through all the noise. But no  matter the narrative being pushed, one thing remains: the facts. The  facts don't lie. It is information overload.   The facts tell the story better than anyone. Facts take many forms  and play out in many ways. They are the impacts of decisions made and  actions taken, whether we like it or not. But it doesn't take long for  anyone to see this fact: The decisions coming out of the White House  have followed one overall thought, one guiding ideology. It is not a  unifying ideology that protects the freedoms and liberties we hold dear  as Americans. It doesn't safeguard the values of our country or promote  a vision for a brighter tomorrow and a more prosperous nation for  future generations. It is a Big Government, socialist ideology. It is a  vision of transformation. It is a strategy of undoing everything done  by the previous administration even if those policies were successful.   Since President Biden's inauguration, every executive order, every  regulatory rollback, and every message of so-called unity we were once  promised has been in the spirit of doing the opposite of the previous  administration, with an emphasis on the ``woke'' transformation of  America's founding principles. ``But not Trump'' is not a strategy. It  is not a policy stance. It is a reactionary and misguided posture that  has plunged our Nation into domestic and international disarray.   It is a backward approach to implementing an agenda to transform the  culture and the values of America, and we are seeing the on-the-ground  effects of this approach in our communities, at our borders, and  abroad.   When the singular driving force of your Presidency is simply being  the opposite of your predecessor, our country faces the consequences of  that decision. We are facing crises that were preventable, crises that  are a direct result of policy decisions. This is an uncomfortable and  inconvenient fact for President Biden, and Democrats don't seem too  interested in the facts about the consequences of this administration's  decision, either.   So let me lay them out. Here are some facts. The Biden administration  inherited a conditions-based withdrawal strategy on Afghanistan. The  idea was that we will have a withdrawal of forces that kept some boots  on the ground to maintain stability and limit chaos and, importantly,  preserve the progress our troops had made. Instead of continuing this  conditions-based approach that would protect our servicemembers,  allies, and innocent civilians, President Biden came up with a new  plan, one he thought would make for better headlines, rather than  listening to our commanders on the ground.   President Trump's plan was to roll people out strategically and  maintain our assets to prevent attacks on the United States in the  future. The plan certainly did not involve leaving American citizens  behind. Instead, President Biden's decision left chaos in its wake. His  decision left our troops vulnerable and resulted in the death of 13-- 13--U.S. servicemembers. The average age of these servicemembers was 22  years old.  [[Page S6706]]    His decision has disrespected the sacrifices of more than 800,000  U.S. veterans who bravely served during the War on Terror. His decision  gave the Taliban their greatest victory to date and made them one of  the top 10 most well-equipped militaries in the world, funded by the  hard-working taxpayers of this country. His decision abandoned innocent  Americans in a country governed by radical terrorists, and it is clear  that he ignored the best military advice given to him by his top  commanders and ordered our troops to put down their weapons and  retreat.   President Biden's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan this way gave  the Taliban everything they wanted: control of the region, our own  weapons, and, ultimately, a breeding ground for terrorism. The fact of  the matter is, our country will be facing the consequences of President  Biden's decision for decades--for decades to come.   Our country was safer for the past 20 years thanks to the bravest  fighting forces in the world, our men and women in uniform.  Counterterrorism is still necessary, but we just made it harder on  ourselves by not having ground forces and by closing Bagram Airfield.   The myth from the White House is that our country had no choice but  that we were beholden to a deal made before January 20. But the policy  decisions made by President Biden emboldened the Taliban, endangered  Americans, and encouraged our adversaries.   Tomorrow, the Senate Armed Services Committee will hold the first  open hearing--hopefully, one of many--to review President Biden's  decision and what caused our time in Afghanistan to conclude the way it  did. The American people deserve facts, and I and the rest of our  delegation will not rest until we have answers from the people  involved.   From abroad to right here at our own southwest border, we are  witnessing the disastrous effects of the Biden Presidency play out in  epic proportions. The numbers do not lie.   Fact: In July and August, apprehensions at the southern border  surpassed 200,000 each month. That is quadruple the amount from this  time last year.   Fact: We have seen recordbreaking numbers of illegal immigrants at  our southwest border from the day President Biden was inaugurated. Over  1.3 million people have been apprehended trying to illegally cross our  southwest border, and that is only the ones we know of. There are  hundreds of thousands more getting into our country.   And fact: All of this is a direct result of President Biden's open  border policies, a reversal from those of the previous administration.   This is a prime example of the Biden administration putting politics  over policy. On January 20, his first day in office, President Biden  announced a suspension of the border wall construction. Now billions of  taxpayer dollars are being spent to cover the cost of canceling the  contracts the Federal Government entered into to build the wall. On the  same day, he terminated the Migrant Protection Protocols policy.   In February, President Biden terminated the asylum cooperative  agreements with the Northern Triangle countries established under  President Trump. Doing away with these agreements has allowed caravans  to travel thousands of miles through multiple countries to our  southwest border, without any capacity support from our regional  partners.   These decisions have directly contributed to the unprecedented  numbers of illegal immigrant encounters we have seen, because with  these decisions, President Biden signaled to the world that anyone  wanting to leave their country for ours would be admitted to the United  States of America.   After months of avoiding the word ``crisis'' to describe the border,  President Biden recently said: ``We will get the border under  control.'' To even say he will ``get the border under control'' means  he acknowledges that it is not under control.   Well, I guess that is one fact that we can all come to agreement on.   The facts that Democrats seem to want to ignore most are those that  deal with our economy. The separation from fact to fiction for our  friends across the aisle could not be starker than when it comes to the  American economy.   It is a fact that inflation is sky high--as high as it has been since  2010. Despite rising inflation and increasing prices, the President is  still marching forward with his vision of Big Government--a big  government welfare State, enacted through the Democrats' reckless tax- and-spend spree. He wants to create a massive welfare State paid for by  staggering--and I mean staggering--tax hikes that would destroy  economic growth.   And the Democrats are his captive audience. President Biden's America  is one where our businesses and job creators pay for all. That is not  ``pay your fair share.'' That is wealth distribution.   He is not interested in boosting the economy and helping Americans.  He is interested in remaking the system with subsidies and  entitlements--a welfare state to keep everyone beholden to the  government--no work requirements, just complete government dependency.   Our country was founded on freedom. It was founded on opportunity-- the opportunity to work hard and to achieve the American dream. That is  what this country owes you, not a handout but a hand up.   The programs laid out in the Democrats' reckless tax-and-spend spree  are a transparent effort to a woke transformation of the values and  culture upon which our country was built. If that wasn't bad enough,  they are going to raise taxes to pay for them, picking from a menu of  more than 30 new taxes.   Our businesses, small and large, create jobs and grow the economy.  Increasing their taxes means they can't spend and invest in their own  businesses. If they can't expand, they can't create more jobs. In fact,  it is quite the opposite. Businesses will squeeze inward, cutting  workers and wages.   A higher corporate tax rate isn't ``paying their fair share.'' It is  destroying the blue-collar jobs that have fueled the middle class.   Why would we ever take pride in the fact that our corporate tax rate  is higher than China's? When did that become a worthy goal?   I have an answer for you: It is not. But the terrible proposals to  offset the cost of this bill just keep on coming.   The Biden administration wants to require financial institutions to  report account balances and transactions greater than $600 made by  Americans to the IRS, the Internal Revenue Service. Any transaction you  make over $600 will be reported to the IRS. That is every taxpayer in  this country. Today, only transactions over $10,000, which is a lot of  money, are reported.   Yes, that is the same Agency with a long history of data security  failures. Earlier this year, the confidential tax information of a  number of prominent Americans leaked--surprisingly, leaked--from the  IRS and was published in the press.   The Agency also has a history of singling out certain taxpayers for  political purposes. You have a rent payment over $600, planning to buy  airplane tickets over $600--how about a new hunting rifle? a wedding  dress for your daughter? All of this--any transaction over $600--would  be sent to the IRS under President Biden's plan. This is Big Brother  Government at its worst.   We are talking about routine financial transactions that Americans  make every day. The IRS has no business monitoring these--none. The IRS  is intrusive enough as it is. This is something Americans of all  political stripes should agree on.   Not only would the IRS be looking over Americans' shoulders, but this  would place a heavy burden on community banks and credit unions that  play a key role in providing financial services to rural and minority  communities. These financial institutions cannot afford to monitor and  report all this data to the IRS. They can't afford it. It will put many  of these folks out of business, destroying mainstream American  communities that rely on all of them in the process.   But don't just take my word for it. The Independent Community Bankers  of America's Minority Bank Advisory Council wrote:         Our primary concern is that the proposal would undermine       the critical relationship of trust we foster within the       communities we serve--communities prone to distrust of       institutions and government agencies. We fear  [[Page S6707]]       that invasive and indiscriminate account reporting would       undermine the policy priority of bringing more people into       the banking system and may drive many of those in the system       to leave.    I couldn't have said it better.   This is one of the most outrageous proposals coming from this  administration--and there have been a lot of them over the last 9  months. This is like a shakedown squad coming around to try to get  every single cent from you that they can.   So, today, I introduced a bill called the Protecting Financial  Privacy Act that would proactively prohibit this. My bill prohibits any  Federal Agency from creating, implementing, or administering a  financial account information reporting regime that would require  financial institutions or individuals to report data on financial  transactions or account balances to the IRS in excess of what is  already required by the Bank Secrecy Act. The last thing Americans want  or need is Big Brother looking over their shoulders.    The President wants to run from the facts. He would rather hide  behind them and point fingers. The facts, for him, don't fit. But it is  time for the President to wake up. It is time to stop blaming President  Trump for disasters that are clearly his own making. It is time to stop  an entitlement state of our country that Americans don't want. It is  time for the President to face the facts and listen to the American  people. He cannot be allowed to deflect responsibility and attempt to  distract the American people from crises that were predictable and  preventable, especially when the facts couldn't be clearer.                            ____________________
