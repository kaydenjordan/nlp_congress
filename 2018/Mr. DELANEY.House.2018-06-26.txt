 Mr. Speaker, I was unable to cast my vote on rollcall  No. 289 through No. 293.   Had I been present to vote on rollcall No. 289, I would have voted  ``yea.''   Had I been present to vote on rollcall No. 290, I would have voted  ``yea.''   Had I been present to vote on rollcall No. 291, I would have voted  ``nay.''   Had I been present to vote on rollcall No. 292, I would have voted  ``nay.''   Had I been present to vote on rollcall No. 293, I would have voted  ``yea.''                            ____________________
