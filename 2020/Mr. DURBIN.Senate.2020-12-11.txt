 I announce that the Senator from California (Ms. Harris)  is necessarily absent.    Mr. President, I join my colleagues in thanking Senator  Pat Roberts of Kansas for his service to his State and our Nation.   Years ago, Pat Roberts and I served together on the House Agriculture  Committee. We now serve together on the Senate Agriculture Committee.  From our earliest days working together in House until today, Pat  Roberts has been a consistent champion of Kansans and of farmers and  people in small towns and rural communities across America.   Through his leadership, Senator Roberts has shepherded eight  bipartisan farm bills into law. Farmers say that farm bills give them  the certainty that they can count on. Farmers could rely on Pat Roberts  for that certainty too.   Pat Roberts not only has worked to address the day-to-day challenges  of agriculture, he also worked to prepare American farmers and ranchers  for the future. From the creation of the Foundation for Food and  Agriculture Research in the 2014 farm bill to protecting agriculture  from disease by modernizing and building the National Bio and Agro- Defense Facility in Kansas, Senator Roberts knew the value in investing  in research. Most recently, he joined me in the America Grows Act to  increase Federal investments in basic USDA research across the board.   There is no doubt that Senator Roberts' legacy will reap benefits for  years. But his commitment to rural communities didn't stop with  farmers. In April 2018, I met with Illinois EMS advocates. We talked  about how rural EMS are on the frontlines in delivering quality  emergency response, service coordination, and patient care. They spoke  about how they were responding to the opioid epidemic and treating the  emergency needs of an aging population. I became convinced that  Congress needed to find a way to support rural EMS agencies with  Federal funding so they could better serve their communities, but I  needed a partner for it. The solution was obvious. I found Senator  Roberts in the Senate gym and pitched him on the bill.   Within a few weeks, we introduced the Supporting and Improving Rural  EMS Needs, or SIREN, Act. Senator Debbie Stabenow joined as a partner  to the bill, and we started working hard to pass it. The SIREN Act was  included in the 2018 farm bill. And this past summer, the first grant  award went to Illinois when our healthcare providers needed it most for  this pandemic.   For four decades, Senator Roberts has been a significant part of  Federal agriculture policy. He is the only lawmaker to have chaired  both the House and Senate Agriculture Committees. Farm bills don't  happen without bipartisanship, and Pat's legacy of bipartisanship is  something we should honor in the future.   It has been an honor and privilege, working with him. I will miss his  bipartisan spirit and his dry wit. I wish him, his wife Franki, and  their family happiness in his next chapter.                            ____________________     Mr. President, this week's Nobel Peace Prize celebration  in Oslo, Norway, is honoring the United Nations World Food Programme  for its efforts to combat hunger, for its contributions to bettering  conditions for peace in conflict-affected areas and for acting as a  driving force in efforts to prevent the use of hunger as a weapon of  war and conflict.   I am proud to add my voice in congratulating this deeply important  organization and the thousands of its heroic and courageous staff on  this well-deserved honor.   In 1961, President Eisenhower called on the United Nations to address  hunger, leading to the creation of the World Food Programme. Since  then, the World Food Programme has provided lifesaving help in some of  the world's most difficult places and conditions.   The United States remains a strong partner of the World Food  Programme and one of its biggest funders. During my time in the Senate,  I joined several of my colleagues such as the late Senator Dick Lugar  and Senator Bob Casey in strong bipartisan support for the organization  and related efforts to combat hunger at omeand abroad.   Today, the World Food Programme is the world's largest humanitarian  organization and the leading global agency delivering food assistance  in emergencies and working with communities to improve nutrition and  build resilience. It provides more than 15 billion meals to 100 million  people in more than 80 countries each year. Through war zones, floods,  famines, and earthquakes, the World Food Programme is on the ground for  those most in need, a ray of hope in the lives of the most vulnerable.  It has truly earned recognition as ``the world's first responder,'' as  noted by U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres.   Like all first responders, it did not hesitate to answer the call  when the COVID-19 pandemic hit earlier this year. The COVID-19 pandemic  has disrupted every sector of life all over the world, adding another  level of hardship on those in the midst of conflict and poverty and  potentially doubling the number of people facing acute hunger to 270  million. But since the start of this emergency, the World Food  Programme has continued providing relief to children and families in  the mounting crisis.   While the need for food relief has drastically increased during the  pandemic, hunger has long been used a tactic in conflicts around the  world. Food supply chains are disrupted or humanitarian aid is  restricted, essentially starving innocent civilians caught in the  crossfire. In turn, starvation leads to more conflict over scare  resources. The link between food insecurity and conflict is clear: one  fuels the other. And it is also clear that helping populations with  emergency relief and long-term sustainability prevents millions of  people from experiencing the horrors of starvation as a tactic of war  and conflicts from erupting out of the desperation of hunger. Not only  is it a moral responsibility to aid the world's most vulnerable, but it  is in the best interest of the international community for a more  secure world.   The World Food Programme is one of the best examples of the good that  comes from global cooperation. From our American farmers working  alongside farmers all over the world, to the staff on the ground, it  takes many to help feed the world's poor. No country alone would be  able to reach every comer of the globe, especially in the most  entrenched of conflicts such as Yemen, Syria, and South Sudan. It is  critical that the United States continues to support the World Food  Programme, and I will continue to work to ensure that Congress provides  the funds to do so.   While the global COVID pandemic is a setback in feeding the world, I  am confident that the World Food Programme will help lead the way to  alleviating the suffering. I again congratulate the World Food  Programme and all of its staff for their courageous efforts.  [[Page S7445]]                                ____________________
