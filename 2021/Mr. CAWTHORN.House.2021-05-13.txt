 Mr. Speaker, National Police Week presents a unique  opportunity to honor police officers nationwide. In my district, we  have great respect for law enforcement, and we honor those who gave  their lives in the line of duty.   Today, I wanted to draw attention to the Law Enforcement Officer  Memorial Service being observed this weekend in my hometown in  Henderson County. Ten North Carolina officers made the ultimate  sacrifice this year in defense of their communities and loved ones.  Their memory will never be forgotten.   In my district, Deputy Sheriff Ryan Hendrix lost his life in a  gunfight this year bravely protecting his community from harm. His  family are personal friends of mine, and my heart goes out to them as  we remember his bold sacrifice.   Mr. Speaker, I now call for a moment of silence to honor the 10 North  Carolina officers who have lost their lives this year in the line of  duty.                            ____________________
