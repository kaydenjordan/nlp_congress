 Mr. President, as we celebrate National Hispanic Heritage  Month, we join together to acknowledge and express our appreciation for  Hispanic communities across America and their innumerable gifts to our  diverse Nation. Hispanic individuals have been critical in making this  country a more inclusive and pluralistic union. In Maryland, Hispanics  are the second-largest minority group, comprising more than 12 percent  of our population, according to the 2020 Census. Hispanics in every  corner of our State continue to engage in and strengthen our economy,  educational and cultural institutions, and government.   National Hispanic Heritage Month, first established in 1968,  recognizes these achievements while encouraging the pursuit of new  ones. This year, we particularly recognize the sacrifices made by  Hispanic educators, essential workers, and healthcare professionals  during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also honor those  Hispanic veterans who have served in the U.S. Armed Forces and  honorably protected the values and ideals that we hold so dear.   While acknowledging Hispanic contributions to American history,  culture, and identity, we also pledge to combat xenophobia and  ignorance in all its manifestations. We support Hispanics as they seek  fair access to equitable healthcare, affordable education and housing,  and equal representation and in the private and public sectors. We also  renew our commitment to pursuing comprehensive immigration reform and  to protecting immigrant populations who call this Nation their home,  including Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals--DACA--and Temporary  Protected Status--TPS--recipients. As Americans, we all share a  responsibility to treat one another with respect, decency, and  compassion. Moreover, as we approach the 2022 midterm elections, we  must recognize the need to address the disproportionate targeting of  Hispanic voters with election-related disinformation.   During the remainder of National Hispanic Heritage Month and  throughout the year, let us renew our commitments to a diverse society  and mark the unique contributions Hispanics have made in every area of  American life, culture, and history. Let us continually celebrate these  achievements with appreciation and joy.                            ____________________
