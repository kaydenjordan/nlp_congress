 Madam Speaker, let me begin by wishing you a  very happy birthday on behalf of the 435 Members of the U.S. House of  Representatives.   Madam Speaker, it is my honor to introduce Reverend Tony Lee. He is  the founder and senior pastor of the Community of Hope AME Church.   Reverend Lee is a pillar of our community in Prince George's County  and the entire region, not just as a faith leader, but as an advocate  for those in need.   I have had a longstanding relationship with him, partnering on a wide  variety of issues, including domestic violence, building trust between  the community and law enforcement, tackling poverty, and moving forward  on social justice issues. And, during the month of January and  February, we worked together during the government shutdown, serving  working families who were struggling to make ends meet.   I have had the privilege of worshipping at Community of Hope many  times over the years. The name of the church reflects its character: a  community where we live and raise our families, where we pray and teach  hope as a critical ingredient necessary for faith and our daily lives.    He is a preacher who speaks to people in a language they understand.  He draws people into church who would not otherwise do so, going into  every neighborhood and going down every street.   Reverend Tony Lee is the son of proud parents, Orlando Lee and  Reverend Nancy T. Lee, who are joining us in the Capitol today.                            ____________________
