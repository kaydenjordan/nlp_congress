 Mr. Speaker, I have always found this debate  interesting, but we know what this is all about. This is all about the  negotiations on border security.   What I found interesting is to listen to everybody talk about the  President not being willing to negotiate, not being willing to  compromise. Yet, he has offered many of the things that the Democrats  say that they want in any border security bill.   A negotiation ends when both parties can say they got something that  they want. Yet, the Democratic leaders in the House and the Senate  continue to say ``no'' to anything the President wants. He wants a  border wall for a part of border security, and they continue to say  ``no.'' That is no kind of negotiation, and we know that is what has  led us here today.   Every one of us wants government reopened, but we know the games that  are being played here. I will tell you, the problem with what is on the  floor today is that we are bringing up the Senate bills that completely  ignore the priorities of House Republicans and House Democrats in the  appropriations process.   Most of these bills have been conferenced. Why bring up just the  Senate bill and not the conference report that was done that recognizes  both Senate and House priorities?   Let me give you one example. The House T-HUD bill carried a  bipartisan provision that raises the length limit for specific vehicles  used to transport sugar beets, and only on specific routes used to ship  sugar beets between Oregon and Idaho for processing. It is a provision  that is supported by the Oregon Department of Transportation, the U.S.  Department of Transportation, and the State of Idaho. It is very  limited--only sugar beets on non-interstate highways--and everybody  agrees with it.   Mr. Speaker, I have a letter here from two Senators, one from Idaho  and one from Oregon, who support this provision, and I will include it  in the Record.                                                     U.S. Senate,                                 Washington, DC, September 11, 2018.      Hon. Richard Shelby,      Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations,      Washington, DC.      Hon. Susan Collins,      Chairwoman, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development,           and Related Agencies Subcommittee, Washington, DC.      Hon. Patrick Leahy,      Vice Chair, Senate Committee on Appropriations, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Jack Reed,      Ranking Member, Transportation, Housing and Urban           Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee,           Washington, DC.        Dear Chairman Shelby, Ranking Member Leahy, Subcommittee       Chairwoman Collins, and Ranking Subcommittee Chairman Reed:       We are writing to support a provision in H.R 6072, reported       by the House Appropriations Committee, which would increase       the allowable length of uniquely configured trucks hauling       sugar beets by 14'; 8", but only on less than 55 miles of       specifically identified, on non-Interstate roads in rural       Malheur County, Oregon.        These trucks use limited non-Interstate routes as they       drive from Oregon sugar beet receiving stations to Idaho beet       processing facilities. In Idaho, trucks hauling sugar beets       have been safely using this configuration since 2003.       Extending this to Oregon sugar beet growers across the border       means 1,830 fewer truck trips on our roads.        This provision has bi-partisan support. The four       undersigned, representing Oregon and Idaho, introduced this       provision as an amendment when the THUD bill was considered       by the Senate, although it was not voted upon.        The proposed language has been extensively reviewed by       technical experts at the Federal Highways Administration as       well as the Oregon Department of Transportation Motor Carrier       Division as well, both of which assisted with its drafting.        We encourage you to help Oregon sugar beet farmers and       their families by including the narrow provision for trucks       hauling Oregon sugar beets on defined Malheur County routes       in the final legislation.            Sincerely,          Ron Wyden, United States Senator;          James E. Risch, United States Senator;          Mike Crapo, United States Senator;          Jeffrey A. Merkley, United States Senator.     Mr. Speaker, this provision is noncontroversial. It is  in the House bill. Guess what? It is not in the Senate bill. That  means, if you adopt the Senate bill, you have dropped out this  provision and you have dropped out many other provisions that are a  priority for both House Republicans and House Democrats.   Why would we turn over everything to the Senate and their priorities?  [[Page H424]]    You all know how this works. When we write a bill, we emphasize House  priorities and we downplay Senate priorities. They do the same thing on  their side, emphasizing Senate priorities and downplaying House  priorities. Then we go to conference, and we work it out and find a  compromise. But we are not doing that with this bill.   I will tell you, if you bring up the conferenced bills, the bills  that have been conferenced last year between the House and the Senate,  you will have my support. I will vote for them, but not for a bill that  just emphasizes the Senate priorities and ignores the work of the House  and the House Appropriations Committee.
