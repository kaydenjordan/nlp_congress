 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership  in bringing this important legislation, more than one piece of  legislation, to the floor today.   As I rise to speak in support of reversing the anti-consumer fake  lender rule pushed through in the final weeks of the previous  administration, I just want to take a moment to put it in perspective.   Madam Speaker, in November, the people elected Democratic majorities  in the Congress that would be for the people, fighting for the public  interests, not the special interests.   To that end, they elected majorities that would reverse the damage  inflicted on their health and financial security by the last  administration.   That mission is why the House this week is passing legislation under  the Congressional Review Act to reverse three of the past President's  most egregious assaults on families' well-being.   The Congressional Review Act is one of Congress' most important tools  to reassert the power of the people's House to deliver for the people  and to reclaim our authority under the Constitution, upholding the  balance of powers that is the foundation of our American democracy.   With the gentlewoman's permission, I wish to speak to the anti- consumer fake lender rule, but also speak to two other issues under the  Congressional Review Act this afternoon.   On the floor today is legislation, again, to reverse the anti- consumer fake lender rule pushed through in the final weeks of the  previous administration.   This fake lender rule greenlights rent-a-bank schemes in which  predatory lenders evade bank interest rate limits to swindle vulnerable  consumers. This is done by putting a bank  [[Page H3102]]  name on loan paperwork and claiming that the bank, not the predatory  lender, issued the loan.   To take one example, in California, where the interest rate on a 2- year $2,000 loan is capped at 25 percent, lenders can use rent-a-bank  partnerships to make loans with rates up to 225 percent.   This bipartisan resolution to end the fake lender rule is supported  by many: a bipartisan coalition of 25 State attorneys general; faith  leaders, including the National Latino Evangelical Coalition, the  National Association of Evangelicals, the National Baptist Convention  USA, hundreds of banking law and consumer finance regulation scholars,  and Americans across the country and across parties, urging us to  support this Congressional Review Act reversal of the anti-consumer  fake lender rule.   Also today, we are considering legislation to undo the antiworker,  pro-discrimination rule forced through in the final week of the past  administration.   The EEOC was established to protect working people from  discrimination and ensure that discrimination charges are resolved  fairly. But this rule would impose draconian new obligations that bias  the conciliation process against employees, toward employers; escalate  the potential for retaliation, because retaliation claims make up half  of EEOC's charges filed at the EEOC last year; siphon off scarce EEOC  resources and saddle the EEOC with wasteful collateral litigation,  prolonging harm to workers through delays; and contravene both the  Supreme Court precedent and Congressional intent.   This month, civil rights and workers' rights organizations wrote to  Congress in support of S.J. Res. 13, writing: ``The EEOC must be able  to conduct its work efficiently . . . to prevent and remedy workplace  discrimination.   ``This mission is even more critical in the middle of a global  pandemic that continues to have severe economic repercussions for  women, people of color, and other marginalized communities.    ``The final rule will only deepen the barriers working people face  coming forward to report discrimination and obtain justice.''   This Congressional Review Act legislation passed the Senate.  Hopefully, it will pass the House today.   Finally, tomorrow we take up bipartisan legislation that paves the  way to restore the Obama-era protections against harmful methane  pollution, which the most recent past President rolled back.   Briefly, these safeguards are key protections for public health that  will also make a serious difference in combating the climate crisis.  Methane is responsible for at least one-quarter of the warming of the  planet. And it is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide in trapping  heat in the atmosphere.   This resolution passed on a bipartisan basis in the Senate and in the  Energy and Commerce Committee. It builds on the commitment of the  President and the Democratic Congress to tackle the climate crisis.   As the administration has stated, addressing methane pollution is an  urgent and essential step.   Madam Speaker, with that, as Speaker, I am proud to be able to use  the Speaker's prerogative to speak beyond the item on the floor right  now.   I am proud to support these important actions to reverse the Trump  damage and to deliver results that make a difference in the lives of  hardworking American families.   I thank all of our leaders for this legislation for the people: Chair   Bobby Scott and Representative Suzanne Bonamici on the EEOC  resolution; Representative Chuy Garcia for his work on the true lender  resolution; Representative Diana DeGette and Chairman Frank Pallone,  and many others, on the methane resolution from the Energy and Commerce  Committee.   I urge strong votes for S.J. Res. 13, 14, and 15.   Coming back to the resolution on the floor right now, I thank the  distinguished chair of the Financial Services Committee for her  leadership in looking out always for the consumer, for competition, for  fairness, for the people.                                time  1345
