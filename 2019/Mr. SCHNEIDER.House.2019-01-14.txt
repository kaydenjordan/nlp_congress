 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 190, the  Expanding Contracting Opportunities for Small Businesses Act of 2019. I  am proud to again introduce this bill with my friend from Kansas (Mr.  Marshall).   As they did in the last Congress, I encourage my colleagues to join  us in passing this important bipartisan legislation.   Women-owned businesses, companies owned by service-disabled veterans,  and other types of small firms have unique opportunities to work with  the Federal Government through sole source contracting.   Unfortunately, regulations governing these types of contracts,  specifically the maximum value amount of the contract, have not kept  pace with inflation, and many small business owners often won't pursue  these opportunities due to their diminished return. Furthermore, the  law includes option years towards the cap, reducing the projected  returns and lowering the appeal of sole source contracts.   For these reasons, many eligible small businesses overlook sole  source contracts as a quality opportunity to do business with the  Federal Government. Our bill would bring the sole source contracting  requirements in line with inflation and only apply base years, not the  option years, to a contract's cap.   Additionally, programs such as sole source contracting currently  depend on small businesses certifying their own eligibility. It is  important that we better ensure the integrity of these programs.   H.R. 190 protects these programs through a process whereby the Small  Business Administration would confirm eligibility of a participating  company. Sole source contractors should present a real opportunity for  eligible small businesses. Our legislation would make these contracts  more competitive, while enhancing how we ensure they are awarded to  eligible companies.   Mr. Speaker, I am proud to have introduced this bipartisan  legislation with Dr. Marshall to help small businesses, and I urge my  colleagues to support its adoption.                                time  1645
