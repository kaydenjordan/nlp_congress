 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of  H.R. 5305, the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency  Assistance Act. This important piece of legislation will achieve two  vital goals: keeping our government funded through December 3 and  providing much-needed relief to areas impacted by natural disasters  this year.   The emergency assistance is vital for my constituents who were  heavily impacted by Hurricane Ida, which caused historic flooding  across central Jersey. This assistance will ensure that townships and  individuals in my district can fully recover and repair from the  damages of the storm.   Along with this funding, I am pleased to see the inclusion of  canceling the outstanding balances of FEMA's community disaster loans.                                time  1930    This will lift a financial burden that New Jersey, as well as other  States and territories, have struggled with in the wake of recovering  from multiple disasters dating back to Hurricane Sandy. I have been  fighting for this relief with my New Jersey colleagues for years, and I  thank the chairwoman from the bottom of my heart for working with me to  get it included in the text.   Mr. Speaker, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  bill and its quick passage towards the President's desk.
