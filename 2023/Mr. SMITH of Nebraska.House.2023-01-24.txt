 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to recognize Third  District native Pete McClymont for his contributions to the Nebraska  beef industry.   Pete was raised on a farm and ranching operation near Holdrege,  Nebraska, and has maintained a lifelong commitment to growing the  Nebraska cattle business and advancing the State as a leader in  agriculture.   With steadfast excellence, Pete has fostered growth in numerous  sectors of agribusiness in Nebraska and recently announced his  retirement after 25 years of service in several roles with the Nebraska  Cattlemen, including the last 10 as the organization's executive vice  president.   Nebraska's first nickname was ``The Beef State,'' and Pete's list of  accomplishments in maintaining that reputation is long. Despite having  to navigate the difficult conditions of disasters, drought, and market  challenges, Nebraska's beef industry is better for his leadership, and  we continue to be grateful for his outstanding service.                            ____________________
