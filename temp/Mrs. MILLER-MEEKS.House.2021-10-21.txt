 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the  recent success of a high school football team in Iowa's Second  District. For the first time in 31 years, the Clarke Community High  School Indians are headed to the playoffs. The team finished the  regular season with a 5-and-3 record, which is also a first in 31  years.   Although their season had plenty of ups and downs, the team  persevered and worked hard to make their community proud. They will be  traveling up to Williamsburg, Iowa, tomorrow, October 22, to take on  the Raiders in the first round of the playoffs. I am confident that  Clarke will make the Second District proud.   Congratulations to Coach Quinlan and his staff, and all the players,  and the entire Clarke County community on their success, and good luck  tomorrow night.                           Save our Servicemembers     Madam Speaker, I rise today to discuss an issue  that has become a national crisis and that must be immediately  addressed. Serving in the Army for 24 years as both a nurse and a  physician, from the Vietnam era to the first Gulf War, I have seen many  of my fellow veterans suffer from anxiety, depression, survivor's  guilt, and PTSD. Many veterans are still living with those scars, and  without proper care and treatment, mental health crises can make  everyday life a struggle or even life-threatening for them or their  families.   Yesterday, I partnered with my fellow veterans, Congressman Ruben  Gallego, a corporal in the Marine Corps, Senator Joni Ernst, a fellow  veteran and a fellow Army lieutenant colonel, and Senator Mark Kelly, a  captain in the Navy, to introduce the Save Our Servicemembers Act.   This bipartisan and bicameral legislation would direct the Pentagon  to evaluate the effectiveness of their suicide prevention efforts and  to improve its data collection, reduce bureaucratic duplication, and  strengthen collaboration between its offices.   I am heartbroken at the continued rise in suicides in the veteran  community and our military communities. It is no secret that our  servicemembers often face invisible challenges when they return to  civilian life, and we need to do a better job addressing their needs  and the needs of their families.   We need to look into all of our mental health and suicide prevention  programs to better service our heroes, and I am proud to partner with  an incredible group of veterans in Congress on this legislation.   To our servicemembers and our veterans, I want you to know that you  are not alone and there are people who care and are trained to help you  in any mental health crisis you might face.   I encourage everyone to check in on your family and your friends  because sometimes the deepest wounds are the ones that we cannot see.                 Mourning the Loss of State Trooper Ted Benda     Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  tragic loss of one of Iowa's heroes.   Yesterday, October 20, Iowa State Trooper Ted Benda passed away from  injuries sustained during a crash while responding to a call for help  to detain a wanted suspect in Clayton County.   Over his 16-year public safety career, Trooper Benda served with  honor and courage each and every day. Trooper Benda began his public  safety career with the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation in 2005.  He later moved to the Special Enforcement Operations Bureau, and  finally, to the Iowa State Patrol, admirably serving communities in  Northeast Iowa.   It is days like this when we are reminded of the sacrifices so many  of our law enforcement officers make every day. I am proud to say that  I was always ready to support them and do whatever I could in Congress  to ensure that they are properly funded, trained, and equipped. Trooper  Benda was a hero, not just in his community, but to all of Iowa. His  years of dedication and service will never be forgotten.   My thoughts and prayers are with Trooper Benda's wife, Holly, their  four young children, all of his loved ones, and the entire Iowa State  Patrol family.                            ____________________
