 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 971, I call up  the resolution (H. Res. 970) insisting that the Department of Justice  fully comply with the requests, including subpoenas, of the Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence and the subpoena issued by the  Committee on the Judiciary relating to potential violations of the  Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act by personnel of the Department of  Justice and related matters, and ask for its immediate consideration in  the House.   The Clerk read the title of the resolution.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and add  extraneous materials into the Record.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a resolution that literally  is about this institution. And when we look at this, it is about the  Department of Justice and the FBI giving documents to this institution  so that they can conduct proper oversight.   We have had months and months go by with multiple requests where  those requests have been largely ignored by the Department of Justice.   It is time that the American people actually have the transparency  that they deserve in being able to see these documents and let them  judge for themselves what did or did not go on within the Department of  Justice and FBI.   Mr. Speaker, Lady Justice should have a blindfold, and that means  that justice should not be meted out to those that are well connected  or well financed. It should be even in all regards.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Jordan).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I would make one comment. It is interesting, when the gentleman  opposite, Mr. Speaker, is talking about motives and what is designed by  this when we have not had a conversation about that.   It is also interesting, when we talk about those very motives about  an ongoing investigation, part of this request is asking for 10,000  pages of documents on an investigation that is already complete. I  would think we would have the ability to get those from the Department  of Justice.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Biggs).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership on  this particular issue, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   The reality of this is the very document that the gentlewoman from  Texas put up, that 500-page report, is actually investigative  conclusions based on 1.2 million documents, of which this body--this  body--has received less than 24,000 pages of the same documents that  she mentions. So all we are asking for is for us, the legislative body,  and the American people, to be able to get the very same documents the  Department of Justice has.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr.  Gosar).    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his leadership  and tenacious spirit on this, and I reserve the balance of my time.                            Parliamentary Inquiry     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gohmert), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, I might remind the Speaker and all those  who are in this Chamber today that this is about this very fundamental  principle of this institution being able to do oversight.   Since when is it not a good idea to have the documents from all  agencies brought forth to this body so that the American people can  judge for themselves?   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Garrett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I ask the Speaker if he would remind others that are in  this well, that if they are really concerned about family  reunification, I have a bill--and the gentleman opposite is certainly  welcome to come in and cosponsor that bill--to reunify those.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr.  Griffith), my good friend.  [[Page H5840]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from Virginia.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, that is exactly what we are trying to do. We are trying  to do our job, and the gentleman opposite makes an eloquent speech  about doing our job of proper oversight.   I can tell you, I have served on the Oversight and Government Reform  Committee for 6 years. And in that 6 years, not only have we been  tenacious in getting documents, but we have also had a responsive  dialogue back and forth with many in the executive branch.   At what point do you do oversight if you can't get the very documents  that we request? My friends on the other side of the aisle many times  will talk about getting documents when it serves a particular political  purpose that they want to espouse. And, yet, when we are talking about  the fundamentals of this country, Lady Justice, and meting out justice  without any favoritism, indeed, that is why we need the documents. That  is why we are trying to do our job, and that is why this resolution is  so critical.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Jody B. Hice), my good friend.    Mr. Speaker, obviously, the gentlewoman from California  lays out an unbelievable claim that this is the lowest of low that has  ever been seen in this body. I find that just remarkable that that  statement could even be made.   The other issue is we are not asking for any special counsel  documents. We are not asking for sources and methods. We are asking for  the documents that we have a right, as this body, to see.   Transparency is a good thing, Mr. Speaker. Transparency is what the  American people deserve. When we are talking about what it will do and  what it will not do, yes, when we get these documents, we believe that  it will do away with this whole fiasco of what they call the Russian- Trump collusion, because there wasn't any.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr.  Davidson).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Zeldin).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman opposite for his impassioned  arguments and debate on this issue. I thank all of those who have come  down to the floor today to stand up for this institution's right to  provide proper oversight and conduct it according to the Constitution,  but, more importantly, for good transparency. Transparency is a good  thing, and I think it is high time that we do it.   For 8 months, Mr. Speaker, we have made a request of the Department  of Justice. They have not fully complied. On March 22, 99 days ago, we  sent a subpoena giving them 14 days. They did not comply. Two weeks  ago, the Speaker of the House actually reached out and said, ``You have  another week.'' They did not comply.   This is our last attempt to give them the benefit of the doubt that  they have nothing to hide. They need to start acting like it, Mr.  Speaker.   Mr. Speaker, I encourage a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance  of my time
