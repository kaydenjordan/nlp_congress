 Mr. Speaker, we are halfway through this year and 6 months  into this pandemic, and our Nation still lacks a national testing  strategy.   The President claimed that he was a wartime President, but with  150,000 Americans dead, this administration has not given this the  wartime seriousness it deserves.   The administration must get serious about this virus. Invoke our full  powers through the Defense Production Act and urge the Senate to pass  the testing resources the House has made available in the HEROES Act.  Protect American citizens across this Nation.   Our Nation needs a national strategy. It needs results, not long  waiting times making it impossible to manage and mitigate the pandemic.  In my district alone, people are waiting for 10 days or more to receive  their results. That is simply unacceptable. And while they wait, they  may be going out, putting others at risk.   Mr. Speaker, it is dangerously irresponsible to have such inadequate  testing in the United States of America, where our resources are so  vast. I urge this administration to summon our vast resources and the  courage to command a national testing strategy.                            ____________________
