 Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize June as Gun Violence  Awareness Month and to ask my colleagues across the aisle: How many  lives must we sacrifice at the altar of the gun lobby before Congress  says enough is enough?   I saw in the news today that David Hogg, one of the Parkland  survivors, wore a price tag instead of his tassel to his graduation. It  is said that he is worth about $1.05. That is how much David calculated  the NRA spent per student to help elect an NRA-aligned United States  Senator in Florida.   Mr. Speaker, our children deserve more.   Mr. Speaker, our children are worth more.   The NRA spends millions of dollars in our elections, but all the  American people get is ``no Republican action''--NRA--because that is  what the gun lobby pays for.   Well, Mr. Speaker, our young people know what is up, and they are  registering to vote because they know they are worth more than just a  dollar and a nickel.                            ____________________
