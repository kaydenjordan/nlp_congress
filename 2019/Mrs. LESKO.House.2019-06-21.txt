 Madam Chair, I am proud to sponsor an amendment that will  help women veterans. My amendment would ensure that no less than $3  million under the Veterans Health Administration should be directed  toward  [[Page H5014]]  women-only inpatient clinics for mental healthcare.   The current system could force women suffering with PTSD caused by  military sexual trauma to be admitted into a male-dominant ward, which  could further traumatize or revictimize them.   The veteran suicide rate is, sadly, only increasing, and we need to  protect our veterans when they are feeling vulnerable. Women veterans  should not be humiliated, marginalized, traumatized, or victimized to  the point of giving up and believing that suicide is the only way out.  We need to protect them.
