 Mr. Speaker, I rise to address the topic of the recent  protests in Cuba, where individuals there are simply asking for freedom  and liberty.   My mother is one of 14 children. Her maiden name is Suarez, Eulalia  Maria Suarez. She came from Cuba at 20 years old in 1961. My mother and  my father raised me to defend freedom, freedom of speech. My father  fought in Vietnam against the communist advance there.   What we in America sometimes don't realize is, many other countries,  especially communist countries that are tyrannical like Cuba, do not  enjoy the basic human rights that we enjoy in this country and many  other people in the world enjoy.   Those rights, such as free speech and uncensored internet access,  they don't have that in Cuba. Freedom of the press, freedom to protest,  freedom to criticize your government, the right to vote in an actual  election with more than one candidate who doesn't get 100 percent of  the vote, they don't have those rights in Cuba.   What they have is a tyrannical, evil regime that oppresses their  people every day. They arrest demonstrators. We saw brave men and women  in Cuba for the first time since 1994, almost 30 years, thousands of  brave men and women, people in Cuba, protesting against their  government, asking for freedoms, asking for basic rights like the ones  I just mentioned that they don't have.   What did they do? They all got arrested. They put them in jail. They  say it is for a year. When that year goes by, when the regime in Cuba  hopes nobody else is looking, they are going to make it 5 years. And  they abuse them in jail. That is what happens to protesters in these  types of countries.   Now, look, I want to say that I actually agree with Joe Biden on  this, on what he said. Joe Biden said, on July 12, this year, and I am  going to quote him: ``We stand with the Cuban people and their clarion  call for freedom and relief from the tragic grip of the pandemic and  from the decades of repression and economic suffering to which they  have been subjected by Cuba's authoritarian regime. The Cuban people  are bravely asserting fundamental and universal rights.''   President Biden continues: ``Those rights, including the right of  peaceful protest and the right to freely determine their own future,  must be respected. The United States calls on the Cuban regime to hear  their people and serve their needs at this vital moment rather than  enriching themselves.''  [[Page H3918]]                                     time  1100    Look, President Biden and, unfortunately not all, but many, Democrats  and Republicans agree on this issue, but we need aggressive solutions  to the issue.   If the United States of America does not lead, no one else will. They  are looking to us for leadership. They are looking to President Biden  for leadership. They are looking to Congress for leadership. We need  every freedom-loving country to condemn this evil, tyrannical regime  and their constant abuses of their people.   America and other countries should not do business with this  Communist regime. As Biden himself said, they will only ``enrich  themselves,'' and that is what they do. Instead, we should use every  pressure point we can to defend freedom and the basic rights for the  Cuban people.   This is a heartfelt issue for many. We enjoy these freedoms, and  sometimes we forget how tough it is and how much support people need in  struggling countries like Cuba. Right now is the time to show strong  support for the people of Cuba and for their basic human rights.                            ____________________
