 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mr. Kent  Braithwaite on his retirement after 39 years of service as a teacher,  counselor, and role model for the students of Coachella Valley High  School.   During his tenure, Mr. Braithwaite has left an indelible impression  on countless students. As a social studies and English teacher, an  adviser, and a mentor, he has helped countless students prepare for and  pursue a college education. More importantly, he instilled in his  students a lifelong love of learning.  [[Page H5102]]    Many years ago, I was one of those students in Mr. Braithwaite's  English class. I like to think I tried my best in every class, but Mr.  Braithwaite was the kind of teacher who not only taught, but inspired  his students to work even harder. He challenged my classmates and me  every day, pushing us to write clearly, read carefully, and question  the beliefs and assumptions we brought to his classroom.   In the Coachella Valley, the region I grew up in and have the  privilege to represent, there are still far too many young people who  drop out of high school before they can graduate or pursue a higher  education. Teachers like Mr. Braithwaite are helping to show these  students that they can achieve their dreams by pursuing their  education.   During his nearly four decades of teaching, Mr. Braithwaite has  served his fellow teachers and the Coachella Valley Unified School  District in various leadership positions and received prestigious  recognitions from the California State Assembly, the House of  Representatives, and many local advocacy organizations for his  excellence in teaching. Most importantly, he has the gratitude of  thousands of Coachella Valley High School alumni.   Mr. Braithwaite is joining his wife and fellow teacher, Jennifer  Braithwaite, for a well-earned retirement. Over her 38-year career,  Mrs. Braithwaite invited Holocaust survivors and Vietnam veterans to  speak to her classes, gave out scholarships to her students, and helped  bring the Advanced Placement program to Coachella Valley High School.  Like her husband, Mrs. Braithwaite has always gone above and beyond to  serve her students.   On behalf of all the students whose lives Mr. and Mrs. Braithwaite  have touched, I would like to offer my sincerest thanks and  congratulate them both on their inspiring and meaningful careers.               Congratulating Rafael Barboza on His Retirement     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Mr. Rafael  Barboza on his retirement after more than 30 years of service as a  guidance counselor for the students of Coachella Valley High School.   For more than 30 years, Mr. Barboza has spearheaded Coachella Valley  High School's efforts to make attending college a reality, leading  college application workshops and connecting students with financial  aid and scholarship opportunities. He has influenced countless  students' lives, and our entire community is grateful for his  dedication and commitment to the next generation of leaders.   When I was a student at Coachella Valley High School, my goal was to  one day attend medical school and become a doctor. That dream often  felt very far away, and at times I wondered whether it might come true.  If it wasn't for the support and encouragement of my teachers and  counselors, especially Mr. Barboza, I do not know whether I would have  achieved my lifelong dream of becoming a physician.   Mr. Barboza was my guidance counselor and mentor, as he has been for  thousands of students over the years. Few people have had such a  positive impact on my life. Mr. Barboza drove me to become a better  student and a better person. He taught me the value of hard work,  integrity, and perseverance.   Like me, many students in my congressional district aspire to pursue  a higher education but often struggle to afford the application fees,  tuition, textbooks, and many other expenses. When the time came for me  to apply for college and money was tight at home, Mr. Barboza paid for  my application, as I am sure he has done for others. Without his  generosity, the first step in my journey towards becoming a doctor  would never have been possible.   Mr. Barboza has also lent his voice to local and national  conversations about the rising cost of higher education. As someone on  the front lines of our public school system, I hope he will continue to  enrich this discussion with his insights.   In recognition of the positive impact he has had on my life and the  lives of countless students and alumni of Coachella Valley High School,  it was my privilege to host Mr. Barboza as my guest for President  Barack Obama's 2015 State of the Union Address. Now, on the eve of his  retirement, I am honored to congratulate my counselor and mentor, Mr.  Rafael Barboza, on his well-earned retirement and wish him health and  happiness in this new chapter of life.                            ____________________
