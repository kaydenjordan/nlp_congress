 Mr. President, earlier today I voted in support of the  resolution offered by Senator Baldwin to roll back rules adopted in  August by the Trump administration that would allow individuals to  purchase so-called short-term, limited duration health insurance plans  for up to 1 year. The Obama administration had previously limited the  duration of such plans to 3 months. I rise now to explain why I chose  to support the resolution and, beyond that, to note the critical need  to take action to protect individuals who have no other affordable  health insurance option.   First, as proponents of the resolution have noted, short-term limited  duration plans do not provide protections for enrollees who suffer from  preexisting conditions. As I have often emphasized, it is essential  that individuals who suffer from preexisting conditions are covered. In  June of this year, I wrote to Attorney General Sessions urging him to  reconsider his decision not to defend provisions protecting individuals  with preexisting conditions in ongoing litigation challenging the  Affordable Care Act in Federal court in Texas. As I noted in my letter,  striking down these protections is no small matter:   ``In 2016, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that 27 percent of  American adults under age 65 have pre-existing conditions that would  leave them uninsurable in the individual market. More recently, 57  percent of Americans responding to a poll said that they, or someone in  their household, suffers from a pre-existing condition. These numbers  include 590,000 Mainers, roughly 45 percent of the state's  population.''   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter be printed in  the Record immediately following my remarks.   At the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that many individuals  lack an affordable health insurance option. For example, individuals  who earn more than 400 percent of the Federal poverty level--about  $49,000--are not entitled to the ACA's premium tax credits and must  shoulder the full cost of plans they purchase in the exchange. For a  64-year-old male living in Caribou, ME, this amounts to about $9,500  for the cheapest bronze plan--or nearly 20 percent of his income--far  too expensive. Based on the statistics I have already cited, there is a  better than even chance that this individual suffers from a preexisting  condition.   Individuals who lose their jobs and their healthcare coverage along  with it may also benefit from these plans. If someone is struggling to  pay rent or a mortgage and trying to keep up with other bills, a short- term plan can help them achieve some measure of coverage without  compounding their financial worries. There is a role for these plans,  and I believe that we should work together to address these real-world  situations.   The underlying flaw in the Affordable Care Act is that it does not  provide affordable coverage, but I believe this flaw can be addressed  without jeopardizing protections for individuals with preexisting  conditions. In fact, earlier this year, I offered legislation with my  good friend Lamar Alexander that would have done exactly that. Our  bill, would have funded cost-sharing reductions, reformed the section  1332 waiver program, and provided $30 billion over 3 years to support  State reinsurance or invisible high-risk pools--methods proven to  reduce rates without discriminating against those with preexisting  conditions. Furthermore, healthcare experts at Oliver Wyman projected  that our bill would have lowered individual health insurance premiums  in the individual market by as much as 40 percent compared to what  people would otherwise pay, while also expanding coverage to an  additional 3.2 million individuals.   Unfortunately--and incredibly--when we tried to advance this  legislation, the Democratic leaders blocked it.   I remain deeply disappointed that members on the other side of the  aisle chose to derail legislation that could have lowered rates for the  18 million Americans who get their health insurance coverage from the  individual market. I am also disappointed that we again find ourselves  in an ``all or nothing, take it or leave it'' situation. I can only  hope that some of the energy now stoking partisan animosity will be  redirected soon toward finding healthcare solutions that work for all  Americans.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Senate,                                      Washington, DC, June 27, 2018.      Re Texas v. United States, No. 4:18-cv-00167-O (N,D. Tex.).       Hon. Jeff Sessions,      Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice,      Washington, DC.        Dear Attorney General Sessions: I am writing regarding the       Department's recent decision not to defend critical consumer       protections in ongoing litigation challenging the Affordable       Care Act (ACA) before the United States District Court for       the Northern District of Texas. I urge you to reconsider your       position and to defend these critical protections for       individuals with pre-existing conditions like asthma,       arthritis, cancer, diabetes, and heart disease.        In your June 7, 2018. letter to Speaker Ryan explaining the       Department's decision, you argue that the ACA's provisions       protecting people with pre-existing conditions are not       severable from the individual mandate, and cannot survive if       that provision is struck down as unconstitutional.       Respectfully, I disagree,        This is no small matter. In 2016, the Kaiser Family       Foundation estimated that 27 percent of American adults under       age 65 have pre-existing conditions that would leave them       uninsurable in the individual market. More recently, 57       percent of Americans responding to a poll said that they or       someone in their household suffers from a pre-existing       condition. These numbers include 590,000 Mainers, roughly 45       percent of the State's population.        I want to make clear that my concern is to protect       individuals with pre-existing conditions, not to defend the       individual mandate. Data show that the individual mandate is       highly regressive--80 percent of those who pay the fine make       less than $50,000 per year. The Supreme Court was right to       find that the individual mandate is not within the powers       granted to Congress under the Commerce Clause, and Congress       was right in eliminating the individual mandate's penalty       through the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, P.L. 115-      97.        I do not dispute your contention that the individual       mandate will cease to be constitutional as a tax when it no       longer produces revenue, beginning in 2019. But it does not       follow that eliminating this penalty requires that important       consumer protections--such as provisions ensuring that       Americans with pre-existing conditions have access to health       insurance--must also fall. In my view, the severability       argument you outlined in your letter is focused on the wrong       period of time: severability should not be measured by       Congress's intent in 2010, when the Affordable Care Act was       passed into law, but rather by Congress's intent in 2017,       when Congress amended it through the Tax Cuts and lobs Act.       It is implausible that Congress intended protections for       those with pre-existing conditions to stand or fall together       with the individual mandate, when Congress affirmatively       eliminated the penalty while leaving these critical consumer       protections in place. If Congress had intended to eliminate       these consumer protections along with the individual mandate,       it could have done so. It chose not to.        Your letter states that it is ``rare'' for the Department       to forgo defense of duly enacted statutes. The Department       should do its duty and defend the important consumer       protections in the ACA, particularly those that ensure that       people with pre-existing conditions can secure insurance.            Sincerely,                                                  Susan M. Collins,      United States Senator.                            ____________________
