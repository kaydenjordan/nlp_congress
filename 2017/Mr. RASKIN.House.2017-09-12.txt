 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division C (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may       be used to implement Order Number 3946-2017 of the Attorney       General allowing Department of Justice components and       agencies to forfeit assets seized by State or local law       enforcement agencies.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Raskin) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Chairman, I also want to thank my colleagues, Mr.  Sensenbrenner, Mr. Conyers, and Mr. Mooney, for cosponsoring and  supporting this amendment.   It is a bipartisan amendment and, I think, a natural complement to  the excellent amendments just added from Mr. Walberg and also from Mr.  Amash. It would prohibit funding made available by this act from being  used to implement the recent DOJ policy change, which dramatically  expands the Federal Government's civil Asset Forfeiture Program.   The new policy revives a controversial and, I think, unconstitutional  practice that has been decried by Americans and Members of Congress  across the political spectrum who hold dear the idea of due process and  the presumption of innocence as it applies not just to us as people but  also to our private property as well.   The new policy allows State and local law enforcement to circumvent  State laws limiting civil asset forfeiture by having Federal agencies  adopt State and local cases. Under this dubious practice, law  enforcement may seize a citizen's cash and property simply because  someone suspects it of being connected to criminal activity without  convicting, indicting, arresting, or even charging the property owner  with having committed a crime and without proving or even alleging in  court that the property is somehow connected to criminal activity.   Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of property have been seized in  this way by law enforcement on an officer's mere suspicion. In order to  get your property back, you have to go out and hire a lawyer, you have  to go to court, and you have to prove that your property was obtained  through innocent means, completely reversing the constitutional  presumption of innocence that is at the heart of due process.   This practice is an outrageous violation of property rights, of civil  liberties, and of the due process principle that we are all presumed to  be innocent as American citizens, and it raises profound questions also  under the Takings Clause, which forbids the taking of private property  without just compensation by the government.   Although the resurrected policy contains a few new safeguards, they  will not remotely prevent abusive seizures or eliminate the profit  incentives that encourage rampant civil asset forfeiture. The policy  will lead to the same abuses uncovered in 2014.   A Washington Post investigation found that, since 2001, State and  local law enforcement had made more than 55,000 seizures of cash and  property worth nearly $2.5 billion under the civil Asset Forfeiture  Program.   One striking case discussed by The New York Times was of Carole  Hinders, owner of a restaurant in Arnolds Park, Iowa, who deposited her  cash earnings in the bank on a weekly basis, and it was always under  $10,000. She was suspected of illegally structuring her deposits,  although they were perfectly innocent, and the IRS simply seized  $33,000 from her, causing huge problems for her business.   Another case that caught my eye was of a Chinese-American  restaurateur who was traveling with a large sum of  [[Page H7275]]  money because he was about to buy a building for his new restaurant. He  had been saving for decades to buy his own restaurant. He was stopped  by the police and became understandably very anxious during the  encounter. The police said that they found the large sum of cash money  he had with him suspicious, and his nervous demeanor also telling, and  they simply seized his money. They detained him for 2 hours. They let  him go. They didn't charge him with anything, but they seized his  money, his life savings that he had planned to use to purchase the  building for his restaurant. He was a lucky one in that he was able,  eventually years later, to get his money back, but he lost the business  deal and his deposit in the process.   In 2014, the value of money and property seized under civil asset  forfeitures by Federal law enforcement exceeded the total of losses in  money and property from burglaries in our country. That means our  people lost more money at the hands of the government through civil  asset forfeiture than from being burglarized.   Because of the abuses revealed in 2015, the DOJ imposed restrictions  to limit when the Federal Government could adopt forfeiture cases, and  banned State and local police from using Federal law to seize cash and  property without criminal charges or warrants, but the new policy lifts  these restrictions and places the Federal Government back on the side  of the trampling of people's constitutional rights.   With civil asset forfeiture, people cannot only lose their property  without being charged with a crime, they can also lose their property  when someone else allegedly uses their property in commission of a  crime.   A Michigan woman lost a car she co-owned with her husband because he  was caught soliciting prostitution while driving her car.   This policy runs roughshod over the property rights of the innocent  and burdens our citizens with onerous costs to get their property back  that they never should have lost in the first place.   Mr. Chair, Democrats, Republicans, and Independents all agree that  civil asset forfeiture is a serious threat to constitutional values.   Mr. Chair, I urge all of us to vote for this important amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Raskin).   The amendment was agreed to.           Amendments En Bloc No. 4 Offered by Mr. Cole of Oklahoma
