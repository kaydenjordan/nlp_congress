 Madam President, small businesses are a very important  part of the U.S. economy, so we want to recognize this week, marking  the 57th anniversary of what we call National Small Business Week-- proper recognition for a big part of the economy.   According to the most up-to-date government statistics, Iowa had  270,484 small businesses and 651,635 employees. They account for 99-3/ 10th percent of businesses and 48-1/10th percent of the private  workforce. Small businesses create jobs and export products around the  world. Small businesses are the backbone of our communities, and I know  this pandemic has really hit small businesses very, very hard.   I honor these hard-working Iowa entrepreneurs and, of course, their  employees in celebrating the week of September 20th as National Small  Business Week.   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
