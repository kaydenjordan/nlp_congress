 Mr. President, I rise today to express my sympathy and  support for the people in my home State of Georgia. This past weekend,  severe storms and deadly tornadoes tore through South Georgia  destroying homes and businesses and taking the lives, unfortunately, of  at least 15 Georgians.   Among those areas hit the hardest were counties surrounding the  cities of Adel and Albany. These counties and cities are very near  where I grew up and where I now reside personally. When last weekend's  storms hit, emergency management teams there were still leading  recovery efforts in response to deadly storms that had just caused  widespread destruction earlier this month.   I am very grateful for the tireless and ongoing efforts of our first  responders in our State and stand with our Georgia families during this  difficult time. Our hearts, of course, go out to the families affected  by these severe storms.   I now yield for the senior Senator from Georgia.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.    Mr. President. I now ask unanimous consent that the  Senate observe a moment of silence for those who have lost their lives  in Georgia and across the southeast in these recent storms.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The Senate will now observe a moment of silence.   (Moment of silence.)    Mr. President. I now ask unanimous consent that the  Senate observe a moment of silence for those who have lost their lives  in Georgia and across the southeast in these recent storms.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.   The Senate will now observe a moment of silence.   (Moment of silence.)    I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.   The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
