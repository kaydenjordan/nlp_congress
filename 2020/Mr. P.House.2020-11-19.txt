 Irving Green on July 26, 1941, and they  moved to Biloxi, Mississippi, in 1947.   Mrs. Green founded and operated Green's Kindergarten for 17 years,  and she was the first African-American teacher at Biloxi High School.  Mrs. Green also worked in the Star Program and worked as the assistant  education director of the Head Start Program.   Mrs. Green joined the New Bethel Baptist Church under the pastorship  of Reverend E.H. Potter, and she served as a teacher of the  intermediate class, superintendent of the Sunday school, director of  the vacation Bible school, member of the senior mission, member of the  kitchen committee, and member of the bus committee. She also served as  assistant secretary of the Shiloh District of the Congress of Christian  Workers.   After retiring from her many years of dedication to her students at  Biloxi High School, she volunteered at the Veterans Hospital in  Gulfport, Mississippi. Along with her volunteer work, she was a member  of the Cheerios Homemakers Club and the Senior Citizen Group.   Mrs. Green spent a great many years contributing to her community,  and for many of her students and brothers and sisters in Christ, she  was a strong pillar in the community.   Of the 103 years, 11 months, and 23 days that she spent with us, most  of her time was spent bettering the lives of those around her.   Mrs. Ruby Thompson Green was an outstanding citizen of the kingdom of  God, the United States of America, Mississippi, and Biloxi, and her  contributions stand as a reminder to all of us that it is better to  serve than to be served.   It is my honor and privilege to recognize the wonderful life of Mrs.  Ruby Thompson Green.
