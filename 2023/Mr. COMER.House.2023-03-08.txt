 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and insert  extraneous material on H.R. 140.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 140, the Protecting Speech from  Government Interference Act. This legislation is clearly needed.   During the Oversight and Accountability Committee's February 8  hearing on protecting speech from government interference and social  media bias, the Oversight and Accountability Committee learned just how  easy it was for the Federal Government to influence a private company  to accomplish what it constitutionally cannot, and that is limit the  free exercise of speech.   At the hearing, we heard hours of witness testimony that revealed the  extent to which Federal employees have repeatedly and consistently  communicated with social media platforms to censor and suppress the  lawful speech of Americans.   The hearing exposed just how much the Biden administration attempted  to normalize a policy of Federal censorship. Biden administration  officials have publicly called upon and privately coordinated with  private-sector social media companies to ban specific accounts viewed  as politically inconvenient.   During our February 8 hearing, one of our witnesses, a former FBI  official and former Twitter employee, called for Federal legislation  that would reasonably and effectively limit government interactions  with private-sector platforms.   I agree with him. It is inappropriate and dangerous for the Federal  Government to decide what lawful speech is allowed on a private-sector  platform.   My bill, the Protecting Speech from Government Interference Act,  makes this type of behavior an unlawful activity for Federal officials  to engage in, subjecting those who attempt to censor the lawful speech  of Americans to disciplinary actions and monetary penalties.   The Federal Government should not be able to decide what lawful  speech is allowed. We have the First Amendment for a very good reason.  Federal officials, no matter their rank or resources, must be  prohibited from coercing the private sector to suppress certain  information or limit the ability of citizens to freely express their  own views on a private-sector internet platform.   Former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, for example, should not  have been free to use her official authority to openly call for  Facebook or any other social media company to ban specific accounts or  types of speech from its platform. That was not an appropriate use of  the authorities or resources of a senior executive branch official.   Further, Federal employees should not feel empowered to infringe on  the independence of private entities by pressuring them to complicate  or change their community guidelines and content modernization  policies.   If the Biden administration needs to express its policy positions or  political preferences, it has immense communication resources of its  own through which to engage in the public square and offer its  information and arguments.   If the administration feels it is losing the policy argument and the  public's  [[Page H1181]]  confidence to stronger voices, the answer should never be to deploy the  resources and power of the Federal Government to limit the speech of  others.   The legislation before us today expands the current Federal employee  political activity limitations of the Hatch Act to include a  prohibition on Federal employees using their official authority to  influence or coerce a private-sector internet platform to censor lawful  speech.   This includes a prohibition on actions that would result in a  private-sector platform suppressing, restricting, or adding disclaimers  or alerts to any lawful speech posted on its platform by a person or  entity.   Whether an ordinary citizen or an established media organization, all  Americans have a right to utilize these new and powerful communication  technology resources to share their views and opinions without Uncle  Sam putting his thumb on the scale to tilt the debate in one direction.   Americans know that the First Amendment protects them from this kind  of government censorship, protects them from Federal officials who seek  to use their positions, their influence, and their resources to censor  lawful speech.   The only thing that has changed is that the public square has moved  online, with powerful new communication tools.   We are discussing this legislation today because Americans know that  something is wrong, and they have asked Congress to fix it.   This bill is a targeted first step to address one clear part of the  problem--the troubling development that Federal officials in the U.S.  Government view it as their role to censor the speech of Americans.   I urge all my colleagues to support this very necessary legislation.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Colorado (Mrs. Boebert).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Tennessee (Mr. Rose).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  North Carolina (Mr. Edwards).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South  Carolina (Mr. Fry).    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the gentleman  from Wisconsin.    I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the problem I face is that the Federal  employees see it as part of their job to censor Americans' First  Amendment protected speech on social media and internet platforms,  especially if the speech is misaligned or inconvenient for the  administration's political priorities.   This legislation fixes and addresses this problem head-on with a  narrow prohibition on the activities of civil servants.   This bill expands the Hatch Act to prohibit Federal employees from  using their official authority to censor lawful speech on third-party  online platforms. This is the first step toward important work that  should be done in this space of addressing the challenges of preserving  free speech on the internet for all Americans.   I thank Judiciary Committee Chairman   Jim Jordan and Energy and  Commerce Committee Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers for their early support  in crafting this very important legislation.   I urge my colleagues to support this necessary bill.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the amendment.   The Protecting Free Speech from Government Interference Act ensures  that this new prohibition on government censorship is enforced in the  same way as the Hatch Act.   My colleague, Mr. Clyde's, amendment provides much-needed oversight  of the implementation and enforcement of this new prohibited Federal  employee activity. The amendment's required annual reports by the  Attorney General--to be generated in consultation with the Office of  Special Counsel--will help Congress evaluate the governmentwide  compliance with this new prohibition.                                time  1615    The Clyde amendment will help create transparency and provide  Congress valuable insight into any violations of this prohibition of  government censorship. I appreciate the gentleman from Georgia working  with the committee on his amendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote  ``yes.''    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   My amendment makes minor enhancements to this important piece of  [[Page H1188]]  legislation that were brought to our attention after our markup.   First, this amendment makes a few technical drafting edits. Second,  this amendment clarifies the enforcement section of this legislation  with the conforming edit to ensure that the U.S. Office of Special  Counsel has the specific authority necessary to carry out the  enforcement provisions this legislation establishes for senior  government officials.   With this technical change to the special counsel's enforcement  capabilities, we are ensuring that the real penalties we have  introduced for senior officials can be carried out. We must ensure that  senior officials will not escape accountability when they engage in  government censorship prohibited by H.R. 140. This will help deter  government employees.   Further, this amendment clarifies that the OSC can enforce a civil  monetary fine of up to $10,000 against senior officials, as clearly  intended by the text we reported out of committee.   Mr. Chair, I ask for my colleagues' full support of this amendment,  and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I just want to reiterate this. This bill  protects the First Amendment rights for American citizens. My  colleagues would like us to believe that by protecting an Americans'  right to say whatever lawful speech they want, we are empowering Russia  and China. It is just not true.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the amendment.   The Protecting Speech from Government Interference Act prohibits  Federal employees from censoring lawful speech while ensuring that the  government can still protect American citizens and enforce the law. It  does this by narrowly exempting lawful actions to exercise legitimate  law enforcement functions from the prohibition on censorship.   These are lawful actions to suppress unlawful speech, such as child  pornography, the illegal transportation of controlled substances, or  preventing the unlawful dissemination of properly classified national  security information.   My colleague's amendment further clarifies the initial intent of this  exemption while preserving the bill's reporting requirement to provide  Congress timely reports on any lawful actions taken by agencies under  this exemption.   Mr. Chair, I thank my colleague for his engagement on this important  issue.    Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the amendment.   The Protecting Speech from Government Interference Act ensures that  the new prohibition on government censorship is enforced in the same  manner as the Hatch Act is currently enforced.   My colleague's amendment further strengthens this enforcement. It  enshrines Congress' intent to ensure that the Office of Special Counsel  continues to treat employees exercising public-sector union-negotiated  official time as official duty time.   Official time is taxpayer funded, and this amendment makes certain  the Hatch Act's new censorship prohibition will continue to act to  apply to Federal employees on official time.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Good amendment.   This bill clarifies that Federal agencies are not prohibited from  taking lawful actions to enforce our Nation's laws and regulations. My  colleague's amendment clarifies that Federal agencies may still enforce  our Nation's laws that combat obscene matters which are not protected  by the First Amendment.   This amendment clarifies congressional intent that our Federal  agencies must continue working to keep our children safe from the lewd  materials so often circulating on the Internet. Protecting our children  should be a central focus of this legislative body, and this amendment  cements that commitment.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this bill is timely and necessary. We have  learned just how easy it is for the Federal Government to influence a  private company to limit the exercise of First Amendment protected  speech.   During a recent hearing on the Twitter files, the Oversight and  Accountability Committee heard from a former FBI official and Twitter  employee who called for Federal legislation that would reasonably and  effectively limit government interactions with private-sector  platforms.   Let me be clear: A former FBI official and former Twitter employee  endorsed and called for legislation just like this.   This legislation should not be controversial, but the intention of  this amendment is to gut this bill. The intention of this amendment is  to risk the implementation of this necessary legislation.                                time  1700    The inclusion of the clause this amendment removes is standard  legislative practice. All this clause does is make sure that if a court  decides to strike down any part of this act, that the rest of the act  stays intact. It is that simple.   These clauses have been used in legislation for decades. Including a  clause like the one in this legislation is standard practice that  ensures that this much-needed and noncontroversial legislation can be  faithfully implemented.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and  I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, the Protecting Speech from Government  Interference Act aims to prevent Federal employees from censoring the  lawful speech of Americans.   My colleague's amendment further strengthens the enforcement of this  new prohibition on Federal employee actions by increasing the potential  debarment penalty from 5 to 10 years.   Increasing this debarment for up to 10 years serves as a strong  deterrent to Federal employees and clearly underscores Congress'  understanding of the significant harm these censorship activities have  done to America's trust in their Federal Government.   We must rebuild this public trust that the Federal agencies Congress  is charged with conducting oversight over are operating within the  boundaries of their lawful authorities.   Civil servants that extend their duties beyond their legal authority  to encroach on the speech rights of Americans do not deserve to serve  in our Nation's government.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Ogles amendment.   The Protecting Speech from Government Interference Act introduces  newly created civil fines for the most senior officials.   My colleague's amendment further strengthens this enforcement penalty  for senior officials by increasing the civil monetary fines up to  $50,000.   This $50,000 will serve as a deterrent to the administration's most  senior officials--Senate-confirmed Presidential appointees and the  White House staff--to prevent them from censoring the lawful speech of  ordinary Americans.   It is especially important that our Nation's most senior leaders are  held to a higher level of accountability given their higher level of  influence.   I thank the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ogles) for proposing this  amendment which preserves the carefully negotiated structure of the  bill.   I ask my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Alford) having assumed the chair, Mr. Moolenaar, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that  that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 140) to  amend title 5, United States Code, to prohibit Federal employees from  advocating for censorship of viewpoints in their official capacity, and  for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I move that the committee do now rise.   The motion was agreed to.   Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr.  Hunt) having assumed the chair, Mr. Moolenaar, Acting Chair of the  Committee of the Whole House on the state  [[Page H1198]]  of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under  consideration the bill (H.R. 140) to amend title 5, United States Code,  to prohibit Federal employees from advocating for censorship of  viewpoints in their official capacity, and for other purposes, had come  to no resolution thereon.                            ____________________
