 Madam President, today I rise to introduce two  pieces of legislation, the Assault Weapons Ban and the Age 21 Act.   Assault weapons are weapons of war and they have no place on our  streets. We have successfully banned assault weapons in the past, and  it is long past time that we do it again.   Last year, our Nation suffered 648 mass shootings according to data  from the Gun Violence Archive. That is nearly two mass shootings every  day. An analysis by the Rockefeller Institute of Government found that  mass shootings involving assault weapons resulted in an average of 2.3  more deaths and 4.4 more injuries than mass shootings that did not  involve assault weapons.   Congress must do more to protect people from these deadly weapons.   The good news is, we have a solution that has been proven effective  in the past: the Assault Weapons Ban.   I introduced the original Assault Weapons Ban that was signed into  law in 1994. In the 10 years that the Assault Weapons Ban was in place,  our country saw a 37-percent decline in gun massacres. In the decade  after the Assault Weapons Ban expired, gun massacres shot back up by a  stunning 183 percent.   There is no doubt that this bill would save lives. While the Assault  Weapons Ban was in effect, gun massacres were down. After it expired,  gun massacres rose.   We must once again pass the Assault Weapons Ban. I am pleased that so  many of my Democratic colleagues have agreed to cosponsor this bill.   At the very least, Congress needs to take the important step of  preventing individuals under the age of 21 from purchasing assault  weapons. The Age 21 Act, which I am reintroducing today, would do just  that.   Under current law, a firearms licensee may not sell or deliver a  handgun to a buyer under the age of 21. However, this commonsense  protection does not apply to assault weapon purchases. This loophole  costs lives.   The Giffords Law Center, using FBI and census data, calculated that  while 18- to 20-year-olds make up just 4 percent of the U.S.  population, they commit 17 percent of all homicides.   So it makes sense that the law restricts individuals under the age of  21 from purchasing a handgun. But it does not make sense that this  restriction does not extend to assault weapons as well. In the last 2  years, the shooter in three of the five deadliest mass shootings in the  United States was a man under the age of 21.   If the Age 21 Act had been law last year, it could have stopped the  18-year-old who killed 10 people in Buffalo, NY, and the 18-year-old  who killed 21 people in Uvalde, TX. These shooters used assault-style  weapons that were legally purchased shortly after their 18th birthdays.   I thank the Senators who have stood with me in support of the Assault  Weapons Ban and the Age 21 Act. I urge the rest of our colleagues to  join us.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Daines):   S. 21. A bill to amend the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 to  modify the definition of the term ``at-risk community'' ; to the  Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.    Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the  Community Wildfire Protection Act, bipartisan legislation that Senator  Daines and I are reintroducing today.   This bill would ensure that those communities that are deemed to be  under the greatest threat from wildfire are eligible to receive  existing Federal wildfire grants. This sounds obvious but unfortunately  is not the case under current law.   The current definition of an ``at-risk community'' was codified in  the 2003 Healthy Forest Restoration Act. That law requires that, in  addition to experiencing significant wildfire risk, an eligible  community must either be adjacent to Federal land or included on a list  generated in 2001 consisting of voluntary input from States and Tribes.   Unfortunately, this 2001 list is far from objective or comprehensive.  Communities on the list were not added based on an objective evaluation  of their wildfire risk or threat to life and property, only whether an  individual Governor or Tribal leader decided to add them. To make  matters worse, there are obvious omissions from the list that show its  inadequacy, and in fact, 19 States and territories never submitted a  single community.  [[Page S56]]    For example, large California cities such as Fresno, Fairfield, and  Napa are not encompassed by this definition, all of which have  experienced recent major wildfires. The list also omits Grizzly Flats,  CA, which was devastated by the 2021 Caldor Fire, despite its proximity  to Federal lands, as well as countless other small towns at great risk  of wildfire.   These small, rural towns are frequently at the highest risk of  wildfire and lack the resources to undertake wildfire resiliency  projects on their own. Obviously, these are some of the towns that  would most benefit from addition Federal help but because of the  outdated definition, may not be eligible.   Aligning the definition in law for at-risk communities to today's  environmental realities is more important than ever given the increased  spread, frequency, and destructiveness of wildfires, especially in the  West.   Our bill would simply end the practice of making Federal grants  contingent on this outdated, incomplete list or proximity to Federal  lands. Instead, our legislation would allow communities to be eligible  based on the most up-to-date quantitative wildfire risk data for the  entire United States--data already maintained by the U.S. Forest  Service.   The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provided $1 billion  for community wildfire resilience grants, and last year's Inflation  Reduction Act included an historic $1.8 billion for wildfire resilience  on federal forestlands. Congress has done the work of providing funding  for wildfire resilience. Now it must ensure that these projects can be  targeted where they are most necessary and completed with the swiftness  that the wildfire crisis demands.   I am pleased to work with Senator Daines on this commonsense bill  that will save lives, save communities, and ensure that Federal dollars  are spent as effectively as possible. This change would help more  communities in our home States of California and Montana and others  throughout the West access Federal grants to reduce hazardous fuels  around their communities and utilize authorities to complete them in a  timely fashion, thereby reducing the threat posed by wildfire.   I am proud that our bill has received the support of the National  Association of Counties, Rural County Representatives of California,  the National Association of State Foresters, the Pacific Forest Trust,  and the California Fire Safe Council.   Our bill is simple, but it would correct a glaring oversight in  current law and ensure that billions of dollars in wildfire resiliency  funding are applied where they are most needed. I urge my colleagues to  cosponsor this legislation.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Padilla, Mr. Wyden, Mr.          Merkley, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Booker,          Mr. Markey, and Mr. Sanders):   S. 22. A bill to amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to  permanently prohibit the conduct of offshore drilling on the outer  Continental Shelf off the coast of California, Oregon, and Washington;  to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.    Madam President, I rise today to introduce the West  Coast Ocean Protection Act, legislation that would prohibit new oil or  natural gas leases in federal waters off the coast of California,  Oregon, and Washington.   I am pleased to be joined today by Senators Padilla, Wyden, Merkley,  Murray, Cantwell, Menendez, Booker, Markey, and Sanders in introducing  this bill, which is critically important to protecting the west coast  from additional oil spills.   Californians know all too well the devastating effects of oil spills.  In 1969, a well blowout on an offshore rig spilled an estimated 3  million gallons of crude oil into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of  Santa Barbara. At the time, it was the worst oil spill in U.S. history  and was catastrophic to the local environment and marine life, closing  beaches, harming the economy, and killing thousands of birds, fish, and  marine mammals.   After the Santa Barbara disaster, California had enough. The State  blocked all new offshore drilling in state waters and in 1994 enacted a  permanent offshore drilling ban. Through local ordinances,  congressional opposition, and Presidential moratoria, no new drilling  in Federal waters off California has been allowed since 1984.   Unfortunately, Californians are still confronting the impacts from  ongoing offshore drilling operations. In October 2021, a ruptured  pipeline spilled more than 25,000 gallons of crude oil into the Pacific  Ocean and onto the beaches of Orange County. Despite numerous alarms,  operators allowed oil to flow from the leak for over 14 hours. It was  absolutely devastating.   The spill covered more than 8,000 acres of the ocean's surface and  required more than a week of cleanup. In that time, local businesses  suffered, fisheries shuttered, and crews worked to remove harmful oil  and tar balls from sensitive wildlife habitat.   Despite the harm caused to individuals and businesses in the  community, the operator has been given permission to repair the  pipeline and begin drilling again, exposing the California coastline to  the risk of yet another accident.   California's coastal and ocean economies are engines of growth that  support millions of jobs and generate significant economic activity for  the State and Nation. Because of the unique nature of the west coast  ocean shelf, any new potential drilling would occur near the coastline  and directly threaten the environment and robust economy.   Beyond that, we are currently in the midst of a historic offshore  energy transition. This past December, a successful auction was held  for five offshore wind energy areas off the California coast, paving  the way for a new floating wind industry. At the same time, the Federal  Government has begun a programmatic review of decommissioning oil and  gas platforms in the Pacific to prepare for their eventual removal. The  era of offshore oil and gas production in the Pacific is coming to a  close, and it is long overdue.   It is time to respect the view of California and our fellow west  coast States by passing the West Coast Ocean Protection Act permanently  ban offshore drilling and protect the Pacific coast for generations to  come.                                  ______                                         By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Padilla, Ms. Klobuchar, and          Mrs. Shaheen):   S. 24. A bill to fight homelessness in the United States by  authorizing a grant program within the Health Resources and Services  Administration for housing programs that offer comprehensive services  and intensive case management for homeless individuals and families; to  the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.    Madam President, I rise today to introduce the  Fighting Homelessness Through Services and Housing Act, which would  establish a new Federal grant program to increase capacity for  comprehensive supportive services paired with housing as a way to  address our country's homelessness crisis.   As we have seen with the growing diversity of our homeless  populations--individuals with mental health conditions or those  struggling with addiction, people who simply could not keep up with  increases in rent, families with children, and veterans--our Nation's  homelessness crisis is not going away on its own without coordinated  efforts at every level of government.   According to the data released in December from the U.S. Department  of Housing and Urban Development, there are approximately 582,500  homeless individuals, including families with small children, in the  United States. Nearly 30 percent of this population is in California,  with approximately 172,000 homeless people sleeping on the streets on  any given night.   In a nation as prosperous and wealthy as ours, we can and we must do  better to address the issue of homelessness.   That is why I am introducing the Fighting Homelessness Through  Services and Housing Act, which would authorize a new Federal funding  stream of $1 billion per year, subject to annual appropriations.  Grantees must serve individuals or families who are homeless or at risk  of becoming homeless by providing housing paired with a comprehensive  set of services and must  [[Page S57]]  provide a 25-percent match for any Federal funds received.   Because each individual and every community is unique, the grant  program would be flexible in order to work in any region or for any  homeless population.   This bill is based on a model that has proven to be effective and  supports the great work already being done across the country, allowing  local governmental entities and nonprofit organizations to expand their  capacity and ensure a greater reach by putting Federal dollars where  they will be most effective.   I am proud that this legislation is supported by a wide coalition of  local governments, housing, health, and child welfare organizations,  including the mayors and CEOs for U.S. Housing Investment, National  League of Cities, National Alliance to End Homelessness, National  Association of Counties, National Low Income Housing Coalition, and the  National Housing Conference.   Supportive services such as mental and physical health care,  substance abuse treatment, education and job training, and life skills  such as financial literacy are critical components. Paired with  intensive case management, supportive housing models make a difference.   We have seen the success of such partnerships in San Francisco, where  the GLIDE Foundation provides critical services that meet an  individual's basic needs, including meals, crisis intervention and  prevention, childcare and educational programming, legal advice, and  housing.   This would not be possible without the organization's partnerships  with the city of San Francisco, particularly the San Francisco  Department of Public Health, and other critical stakeholders. I highly  encourage my colleagues to examine this exemplary homeless services  model to see firsthand how effective partnerships can help to combat  homelessness.   It is imperative that we support these types of partnerships, as well  as nonprofit service providers, as they work to get people into housing  to both mitigate the spread of the coronavirus and address their long- term needs.   I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting the bill and moving  it through the Senate, especially as we continue to contend with the  increase in homelessness.                            ____________________     Madam President, today I rise to introduce two  pieces of legislation, the Assault Weapons Ban and the Age 21 Act.
