 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of impeachment. I  learn so much every single day from my residents at home. Their common  sense and understanding of what is right and wrong is centered on why  they oppose any person using the most powerful position in the world  for personal gain.   We honor our veterans in this Chamber almost on a daily basis. Do we  ever follow their lead, where we serve the people of the United States  and uphold the Constitution, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as  Americans?   We should learn from their sense of duty and responsibility to  country and democracy, not political party. Doing nothing here, Madam  Speaker, is not an option. Looking away from these crimes against our  country is not an option.   This is about protecting the future of our Nation and our democracy  from corruption, abuse of power, criminal coverups, and bribery.   Madam Speaker, this vote is also for my sons and the future of so  many generations. I urge my colleagues to please vote ``yes'' on these  Articles of Impeachment.
