 Madam Speaker, today, I rise to pay tribute to the  late State representative, Kris Jordan of Delaware County, who passed  away unexpectedly this weekend.   Kris and I both entered the Ohio House of Representatives--in the  minority--on the same day in 2009. Kris and I both moved over to the  Ohio Senate in 2011, where he would eventually serve as my vice  chairman on the Ohio Senate Energy and Public Utilities Committee.   Kris will be remembered as a public servant of strong convictions. He  was also a relentless campaigner, going door-to-door year-round, even  when he was uncontested. This earned him the respect and admiration of  a loyal following in Delaware County, a community he served faithfully  in various roles for virtually all of his adult life.   Our prayers continue to be with the many loved ones that Kris leaves  behind, including his three young children, Macy, David, and Everly.                            ____________________
