 Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from New York  and thank him for the negotiations he has engaged in.   It is nothing short of amazing that the Republican leader of the U.S.  Senate comes to the floor of the Senate every morning and criticizes  Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi, who are sitting in a room day after  day after day, trying to hammer out an agreement to help America in  this time of need, while there are two empty chairs at that table.  Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, does not attend the  meetings, and sadly, the Republican leader of the Senate is also  boycotting these meetings. I can't remember a time when this has  occurred, ever--no time in history when there was a critical national  decision to be hammered out between the parties and the leaders of the  Republican Party in Congress refused to attend the meetings.   Senator McConnell gives polished speeches on the floor criticizing  Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi. They should be polished--he has  time to practice them all day instead of going into the negotiations  that can actually make a difference in the future of America.   Americans are genuinely concerned, and they should be. We face a  national health emergency with this pandemic, sadly, where the  infections are spiking across America. It is still amazing to consider  two numbers: the number 5--the United States has about 5 percent of the  world's population; and the number 25--the United States has generated  25 percent of the COVID-19 infections in the world. Five percent of the  population and 25 percent of the reported COVID infections in the  world.   How did we reach this point where this great developed, civilized,  and strong Nation has been brought to its knees by this pandemic? We  have reached this point by lack of leadership. The American people know  that there have been leadership failures at the top. They know this  President refuses to listen to experts. If the experts say something he  doesn't like to hear, he banishes them, as Dr. Fauci has found.   We also know that this President is downplaying the threat that sadly  is taking American lives in the thousands by the day. Just yesterday or  the day before, he branded this pandemic as all but over. Really? There  is hardly anyone in America who would agree with that statement-- certainly no one who is paying any attention to the sad realities  facing families.   This President has failed to tell the truth. He has been engaged in  medical quackery. This hydroxychloroquine that he clings to has been  discredited by the sources that test it. It just isn't an answer. The  President should know better. For goodness' sake, he doesn't have the  competence to make a medical judgment along those lines, but that won't  stop him.   But many people across America are just fed up with it, whether it is  Lysol cocktails or ultraviolet insertions. Lord only knows what he will  come up with next. At a time when people are literally sick and dying,  when our healthcare heroes are risking their lives every day, this  President goes off on these flights of medical fantasy, and the  American people are fed up with it.   This President has failed to take the action that America desperately  needs. We cannot reopen this economy, we cannot consider reopening  schools until we dramatically invest in better, quicker testing. That  is a reality.   As Senator Schumer said earlier, Americans wonder how the President  manages to test everyone who crosses the threshold of the White House  over and over, every single day, and how Major League Baseball and the  National Football League can get test results in a matter of hours  while Americans are standing in line and waiting for results that are  largely irrelevant when they are delivered 5 or 6 days after the  test. What good is a test if it tells you that you are safe 6 days ago,  when you want to see your grandchildren today? That is the reality of  testing in America.    And what has this President done about it? He has made statement  after statement that there are all the tests we could possibly want  available to every American. We know better. All across America, we  know better. Testing has improved and increased, but it is not where we  need it. That should be the highest priority of this administration,  but they failed when it came to providing personal protective  equipment, and they failed when it comes to providing testing.   The biggest failure is the attitude of the Senate Republican leader  and the President when it comes to the crises America faces--first, the  coronavirus crisis and, second, the economic crisis. The biggest  tragedy is the fact that they believe we should do little or nothing-- little or nothing when we are facing some the greatest challenges of  our time, some of the greatest challenges in American history. The  American people expects us to take it seriously and to aggressively go  after this coronavirus and its spread and aggressively help this  economy back to its feet.   We have come up with a plan, which Senator McConnell has come to the  floor and mocked every single day. It passed the House of  Representatives 11 weeks ago. Eleven weeks ago, Speaker Pelosi passed  it and sent it to the Senate. What has happened in that 11-week period?  Speech after speech after speech, deriding the efforts of the House of  Representatives and, literally, nothing on the other side to show for  it.   Finally, last week, they started trickling out a few ideas here and  there, and they weren't very good. They refused to participate, will  not even attend the negotiation sessions with the White House, and come  to the floor each day and mock and criticize Democratic efforts to deal  with the issues before us.   As far as a recovery is concerned, it is essential that we dedicate  ourselves to it, but, first, coronavirus--first, get the infections  under control and save the lives of those who have already been  infected. That is the first thing that needs to be done.   The Republican approach is too little and too late. We have come up  with a $3 trillion plan. They have come up with a $1 trillion plan and  said: We may not even spend that much.   Particularly troublesome for me is this attitude toward the  unemployment compensation being paid to Americans. I couldn't believe  the Senator from Kentucky when he came to  [[Page S4887]]  the floor today and tried to pit our healthcare heroes against the  unemployed, saying: They are going to work every day. Why should we  give any money to those who don't go to work every day?   Really? We have four unemployed Americans--four unemployed  Americans--for every single job opening. I don't believe the doctors,  nurses, and medical professionals who are fighting COVID every single  day resent those who are unemployed. I think they understand full well  the devastation of this pandemic, not only on the individuals they  treat but on the economy at large.   When it comes to these healthcare heroes, the Democrats have stepped  up and called for hazard pay. Will the Republicans join us? We think  these healthcare heroes deserve it--that and more, our gratitude and  more, for all they have given to the United States.   Let me say a word about those who are receiving unemployment  benefits. I met with five of them in Chicago last week, heard their  stories, asked them a few questions, and learned a little bit about  their lives. I wasn't surprised at the hardship they face. Many of them  have been out of work for 4 or 5 months already. It is no surprise that  almost half of the people out of work have exhausted all of their  savings at this point, even with unemployment benefits.   You ask those who are unemployed: Well, what do you do with these  checks that are sent to you each week?   It is pretty obvious to them what you do with it. You pay the  mortgage, if you have one. You pay the rent, the car payment, so it is  not repossessed and taken away from you. You try to keep food on the  table. You try to keep the people issuing the credit cards at bay.  These are the basics that people face every single day. But the  Republicans don't seem to get that. They don't understand it because  they don't get to know these people or even ask them what life is like.  They are not on any bed of roses with $600 a week when you consider the  debts they face, when you consider the expenses they face, and you  consider the fact that many of them are struggling to pay for their own  health insurance at this point. A family trying to pick up the cost of  their health insurance, that their employer once provided half of,  finds themselves spending $1,400 to $1,700 a month on that alone. That  is the reality.   For the record, of those who have returned to work in America, we are  grateful that they are back to work. We are happy that they are back to  work. Seventy percent of them were making more money on unemployment  than they made returning to work. Well, why would they do that? Because  they are not lazy people. They are people who take pride in work,  believe there is dignity with work, and are prepared to return even if  they made more on unemployment. They know that unemployment is a  temporary help. They want to get back to work, a place where they can  prove their worth as individuals and feel some satisfaction that they  are going to work and doing their best. That is part of the reality                            ____________________     Madam President, let me also address for a moment this  issue of reopening of schools. There is a debate raging across the  country right now about what this autumn will look like for our  Nation's schools, the schoolchildren, teachers, and school staff. You  have heard the President, who has literally threatened those who don't  reopen their schools that they may lose Federal funding if they don't  reopen schools. What is that funding spent for? Special education,  school lunches, help for kids in poor schools.   The message has been reiterated by the loyal Education Secretary,  Betsy DeVos. She, too, has joined in the threats of schools that don't  reopen. Now the Republicans in the Senate have taken that threat and  turned it into legislation with their proposal in the next relief  package.   Let me be really clear. There is a concern about empty classrooms.  Those who study childhood behavior worry that lack of socialization  takes its toll on childhood development. Teachers are often sentinels  for evidence of child abuse, which now may be going unreported. Remote  learning works well for some but not for others. But that is not the  concern of this President. He wants schools back so he that can claim  some kind of false victory over the coronavirus.   Last week, I led 24 of my colleagues in writing to the majority  leader and the Democratic leader opposing putting children and teachers  in any danger by conditioning funding of schools reopening in person.   Recently, I had the opportunity to visit the Little Village Academy  in Chicago with the Chicago Public Schools chief, Janice Jackson. Some  wonderful people are there each day passing out lunches to the kids in  the neighborhood who come around the school. They haven't reopened for  classes. They hope they will, but that decision is still to be made.   I can tell you that in Chicago and around my home State of Illinois,  school boards, administrators, teachers, parents, and others are facing  these decisions honestly. They have to provide a safe and effective  learning environment for students and for teachers, whether that be in  person, in school, or at home.   Unlike President Trump, who is nicely insulated in the bubble of the  White House with the multiple daily COVID-19 tests for everyone who  just might come in contact with him, these education professionals in  my home State of Illinois have to answer directly to the families in  their communities. It is a decision that local officials are best  suited to make without intimidation or threats from Washington, DC.   But Washington does have a role to play. The best thing we can do to  help local school districts through this difficult fall and beyond is  to provide the Federal assistance and support they need to ensure the  path they choose is one that keeps students and staff safe while  allowing the learning and development to continue effectively.   It is why, as we negotiate a fourth coronavirus response package, I  will be pushing for the inclusion of the Coronavirus Childcare and  Education Relief Act, being led in the Senate by Senator Patty Murray  of Washington.   In addition to supporting childcare, early education, and higher  education, the bill provides $175 billion to elementary and secondary  schools to help meet technology, cleaning, staffing, and other needs of  schools. It provides funds to school districts based on their share of  low-income children. In that way, it is similar to the CARES Act, which  brought more than $200 million to the Chicago Public Schools and a  total of $512 million across our State of Illinois. Compare that $175  billion to the $70 billion being offered on the Republican side-- another classic example.   We believe this is a serious national issue, when it comes to  education. The Republicans do not. The amount of money that they are  proposing is a fraction of what we offer, and much of it is conditioned  on the schools actually reopening in person, regardless of what is the  safest thing for the schools, the teachers, and the students in any  given area.   Congress shouldn't put State and local officials in the position of  choosing between desperately needed Federal assistance and the safety  of students and the school personnel. Congress should not incentivize  schools to reopen in person prematurely or penalize those where the  public health situation makes it dangerous.   The argument from the administration seems to go: ``Well, if schools  don't reopen, they either don't deserve or don't need any help.'' That  is just not the case. Even schools that are not able to reopen in  person need assistance ensuring their students, especially those from  low-income families, have the ability to participate in remote  learning. They need help keeping staff on payroll, preparing the  buildings so they can return in person in the future, and addressing  any number of difficulties this pandemic has created. For school buses,  if there is going to be social distancing of the kids on the buses,  will there be a need for additional buses and busdrivers?   In addition to funding, the Federal Government should also ensure  that schools have science-based guidance to support safely opening,  free from political influence and Presidential quackery.   They also need the flexibility to continue serving critical meals to  our students, regardless of what the school year looks like this fall.  [[Page S4888]]    Chicago Public Schools have done an incredible job providing 18  million meals since March. We need to ensure the U.S. Department of  Agriculture provides the range of alternative options needed to make  sure that no kid in America goes hungry.   Schools in Chicago and around our State don't need any more tweets or  self-congratulatory briefings, Mr. President. They need Federal  resources and guidance based on the best science our government has to  offer. That is why I am fighting for this relief package to be at a  level to meet the challenge we face across America                            ____________________     Madam President, let me close by saying this. The  majority leader comes to the floor regularly and talks about special  interests. Perhaps he can explain to us why the Republican proposal for  relief for the COVID-19 virus includes a $2 billion allocation for a  new FBI building across the street from the Trump hotel. Perhaps he can  explain the $30 billion wish list from the Department of Defense,  trying to make up for cuts that were made when the President raided  their accounts to build his almighty wall in the southern border.  Perhaps the majority leader can explain to us the liability immunity  which is being proposed by the Republican side as a ``redline, take it  or leave it, we will walk away if you don't like it'' approach.   It would be one thing if the Republican leader were in the room,  actually negotiating, but he just makes a redline and walks away. That  redline is a subsidy to the largest corporations in America, giving  them liability immunity when it comes to possible court suits.   Wouldn't we want a standard to make sure that all businesses and  every individual or group or business is doing its best to keep America  safe? When we say, don't worry about any liability in court if you  ignore the public health reality, that is no guarantee that it is going  to be a safe environment for America when we reopen this economy.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I have come to the floor again today to  speak about an obscure section of immigration law that has a direct  impact on the lives of literally millions of people living and working  in the United States. I am here to speak about the plight of immigrant  workers who are suffering because of a serious problem in our  immigration system, known as the green card backlog. Many of these  immigrants are essential workers helping to lead the fight against  COVID-19. We have just heard tributes on the floor to these healthcare  heroes from Senators on the other side.  [[Page S4900]]    This green card backlog, which I speak to, puts them and their  families at risk of losing their immigration status and being deported  from the United States. Under current law, there are not nearly enough  immigrant visas--also known as green cards--available each year. As a  result, many immigrants are stuck in crippling backlogs for years,  waiting and praying for the moment when their number comes up.   Close to 5 million future Americans are in line, waiting for these  green cards, including 1 million immigrant workers and their families.  Despite this number--5 million--there are only 226,000 family green  cards and 140,000 employment green cards available each year.   These backlogs are really hard on families. They are caught in  immigration limbo. What happens to the children is particularly awful.  Children in many of these families age out while the parents are  waiting for the green cards. What does that mean? They reach the age of  21, and then these children, as adults, face deportation because they  are no longer under the age of 21 by the time the green cards are  available.   The solution to the green card backlog is so clear: Increase the  number of green cards. I have introduced legislation known as the  RELIEF Act with Senator Pat Leahy and Senator Mazie Hirono. The RELIEF  Act would increase the number of green cards to clear the backlogs for  all immigrants waiting in line for green cards within 5 years. The  RELIEF Act would protect aging out children who qualify for a green  card based on the parents' immigration petition.   This RELIEF Act is not new; it is based on the bipartisan 2013  Comprehensive Immigration Reform bill. I know a little bit about it.  That bill was written by eight Senators, and I was one of them--four  Democrats, four Republicans. We worked for months. We took the bill  through the Senate Judiciary Committee. We faced 200 amendments, I  believe, and then brought it to the floor, subject to even more  amendments. At the end of the day, that bill passed with a strong  bipartisan vote of 68 to 32 on the floor of the Senate. But  Republicans, who controlled the House of Representatives, refused to  even consider this comprehensive immigration bill. If they had, we  wouldn't be here today. That bill and the provisions we added to it  eliminated the green card backlog.   Unfortunately, some of my colleagues on the Republican side are still  unwilling to increase the number of immigrant visas even by one. They  want to keep these immigrant workers on temporary visas where they are  at risk of losing their immigration status and being deported.   The senior Senator from Utah, Mr. Lee, introduced a bill, S. 386,  known as the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act, to address the  green card backlog. I have a basic concern with Senator Lee's bill. S.  386 includes no--no--additional green cards.   Without additional green cards, S. 386 will not reduce the green card  backlog. Don't take it from me; listen to the nonpartisan Congressional  Research Service. Here is what they say about Senator Lee's  legislation: ``S. 386 would not reduce future backlogs compared to  current law.''   This is not a partisan group; it is the nonpartisan Congressional  Research Service. S. 386 would not reduce future backlogs.   Despite my concerns about Senator Lee's bill, I told him I was  willing to sit down and work in good faith to see if there was  something we could agree on. Last December, we reached an agreement--a  good one.   Republicans object to increasing the number of green cards, and, as a  result, even our agreement--the amendment we agreed to--wouldn't reduce  the green card backlog. But it was a good bill that we proposed.   Let me highlight two key provisions of this agreement. We protect  immigrants and their families stuck in the backlog. Immigrant workers  and their immediate family members would be allowed to ``early file''  for their green cards. This was a proposal from Senator Lee that I  thought was good and I was willing to support. That doesn't mean they  would receive their green cards early, but they would be able to switch  jobs and travel without losing their immigration status. That, to me,  was only sensible.   Early filing adds a critical protection that was not in Senator Lee's  original bill. It prevents the children of immigrant workers from aging  out of green card eligibility so they will not face deportation while  they are waiting for a green card.   Our agreement also would crack down on the abuse of H1-B temporary  work visas. The amendment we agreed to would prohibit a company from  hiring additional H1-B workers if the company's workforce were more  than 50 employees and more than 50 percent of them were temporary  workers.   These shell companies were created for outsourcing Americans jobs and  abusing the H1-B visa process. I know because Senator Grassley-- Republican of Iowa--and I introduced this reform years and years ago  when this abuse became so obvious. It targets the top recipients of H1- B visas, which are outsourcing companies that use loopholes in the law  to exploit immigrant workers and to offshore American workers' jobs.   Two weeks ago, I came to the floor of the Senate to ask that we pass  this agreement. Unfortunately, at that moment, Senator Lee objected.  Instead, he offered a revised version of our December agreement,  including changes that are required by the Trump administration.   First, Senator Lee wants to remove a provision known as the hold  harmless clause. That assured immigrants who are already waiting for a  green card--sometimes for years--would not lose their place in line  because Congress changed the rules in the middle of the game.   Second, Senator Lee wanted to delay for 3 years the effective date of  this 50-50 rule to crack down on outsourcing companies. I don't believe  we should give these companies that are outsourcing American jobs and  exploiting immigrant workers a free pass for 3 years.   Third, Senator Lee wanted to delay for years early filing for people  who are stuck in the green card backlog. Any children who would age out  in the meantime would lose their chance for a green card and be subject  to deportation.   Those changes suggested by the Senator from Utah were unacceptable,  but because there are so many lives at stake here, families at stake  here--and I know the intensity of emotion behind this issue--I was  determined to keep working to see if we could find some common ground.   Last Tuesday, I sent Senator Lee another compromise offer. The Senate  Republican leader is planning to recess the Senate in a few days, so I  thought it was important to come to the floor today to try to pass this  proposal before the Senate convenes.   Let me be clear. This isn't how we are supposed to make laws in the  Senate. Last year, I sent a letter--joined by every Democrat on the  Senate Judiciary Committee--to the senior Senator from Texas, John  Cornyn, chair of the Immigration Subcommittee. We asked for the regular  order of business in the Senate, which so seldom occurs now. We asked  Senator Cornyn, as chair of the Immigration Subcommittee, to hold a  hearing on this complicated legislation that addresses the green card  backlog. We wanted them to include in the hearing consideration of  Senator Lee's bill and my legislation, the RELIEF Act. We requested a  hearing with witnesses, a markup, a bill, a vote in the committee, and  a vote on the floor. It is almost like something called the U.S. Senate  used to be. This would help the Senate to understand, during the course  of this hearing and debate, the impact of each of these proposals and  to pass legislation that would actually fix the backlog. That really is  how the Senate used to work. I know it is hard for newer Members to  believe it.   The Immigration Subcommittee is certainly not too busy to take up  this hearing. For this session of Congress, which began a year and a  half ago, the Immigration Subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary  Committee has held one hearing--one.   Unfortunately, Senator Cornyn rejected our request. This leaves me no  other option but to bring this proposal directly to the Senate floor.   Let me explain what my amendment would do.   First, it would ensure that the children of immigrant workers do not  age  [[Page S4901]]  out while waiting for a green card. This provision would not increase  the number of green cards. It would not provide any special benefits.  It would simply allow children of immigrant workers to keep their place  in line for a green card and to be protected from deportation until  they can get their green card.   Second, my amendment would delay the bill section that changes the  distribution of green cards by 1 year. This provision, which Senator  Lee actually proposed earlier this year, would not replace the hold- harmless provision; however, it would allow processing time for  immigrants with pending applications to get their green cards.   Third, my amendment would allow for immediate implementation of the  50-50 H-1B visa rule. I was told that the purpose of delaying it 3  years was to protect those currently working for these companies. So  instead of the 3-year delay, my amendment would exempt renewals for  current H-1B employees, which gives current employees the chance to  apply for early filing without creating a loophole for outsourcing  firms.   What I offered Senator Lee after months and months of deliberation  and negotiation was a good-faith effort to find common ground. There  are so many lives at stake. So many families are following this debate  because it literally will decide the fate of each of these individuals  who are applying for the green cards and members of their family.   It is heartbreaking to meet these families who have been waiting for  years for a green card and to realize that the limitations of our  system today make it so difficult. Many of these are good, hard-working  people in America who are doing the right thing.   In my hometown of Springfield, IL, there are physicians whom I have  met and talked to personally who have driven hundreds of miles to plead  their case with me. This one physician brought his young daughter; I  think she was about 12 years old. I haven't forgotten her to this day.  She traveled 200 miles to beg me to try to help. That is why I came in  with this amendment in an effort to protect her and give her family a  chance to be part of America's future.   I will now request unanimous consent to pass my amendment.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Judiciary Committee  be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 1044 and the Senate  proceed to its immediate consideration; further, that the Durbin  substitute amendment at the desk be considered agreed to; the bill, as  amended, be considered read a third time and passed; and the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no  intervening action or debate.    Reserving the right to object.    I thank the Senator from Utah for his response to my  proposal. My staff reviewed his amendment yesterday. We quickly  reviewed the language, and I would like to share my reactions.   Senator Lee does not include my language to protect children of  immigrant workers from aging out during the delay in early filing  because of objections on his side of the aisle. I am disappointed.   Senator Lee's amendment would modify my proposal to allow immediate  implementation of the 50-50 rule, so the rule would go into effect  after 180 days.   Senator Lee would also provide that current H-1B employees may  continue to change employers. My purpose is to prevent outsourcing from  continuing to exploit the H-1B visa program by hiring new H-1B  employees. Senator Lee's language would not allow these companies to  import new H-1B workers to exploit, so that is not objectionable to  me. Senator Lee's amendment also accepts my proposal to delay by 1 year  the bill section changing the distribution of green cards to allow  processing time for pending applications.    To sum up, this amendment currently being considered, for which  unanimous consent has been asked, includes several key provisions I  have advocated for that were not in Senator Lee's original bill,  including early filing to protect immigrant workers and their families  who are stuck in the backlog; an annual green card set-aside for  immigrant workers who are ineligible for early filing because they are  overseas; a 1-year delay in section 2 of the bill to protect immigrant  workers with pending green card applications; and the 50-50 rule to  protect American jobs and workers and to prevent the exploitation of  immigrant workers, which helped to create the green card backlog.   Therefore, I am prepared to accept this amendment in the spirit of  bipartisan compromise. I will not object to Senator Lee's request.    Mr. President, I am disappointed. After all of these  months of negotiation and of the emotion, intensity, and feelings that  we share for the people who are caught in this backlog, it is a real  disappointment that, at the last moment, the Senator from Florida  exercised his right as a Senator to object to our unanimous consent  request--a request which I was prepared to accept.   May I suggest that this is an illustration of the bottom line that I  raised in my statement. In being stuck with a 140,000-limit on green  cards for employment visas and country caps for that 140,000 limit, we  will continue to run into the problem illustrated by the Senator from  Florida.   There will be those who will want to create an exception to the  overall quota or the country caps, and there will be compelling,  personal, and family reasons for them to ask for it. Time and again,  they will find that, if they get a privilege, it will be at the expense  of someone else, and there will be an objection.   The only rational answer is to raise the cap on the green card  quotas. These 140,000 employment-based visas a year might have made  sense 30 or 40 years ago. They make no sense today in the world that we  live in. We are talking about people in the United States who are  working, who are trying to make lives here of a more permanent nature.  They love this country enough to want to bring their families here--to  relocate and live. They are working here and contributing in the  computer industry, in healthcare, and in so many different areas. They  are valuable and important to the future of America.   I sincerely hope that we can resolve the issue that was brought up on  the floor today. Equally important, if not more important, I hope that  we will have the will on a bipartisan basis to tackle comprehensive  immigration reform. We did it 7 years ago. We passed it 7 years ago. It  can be done with Senators of good faith and good will who will work  together. Yet it will mean you will have to accept the premise that  there may be one additional, new immigrant coming to America. Some  people cannot stomach that, and they object to any effort to change  immigration laws that might result in an additional immigrant.   This son of an immigrant, who happens to be a U.S. Senator, believes  that immigration defines this country, that our diversity defines this  country, and that bringing people here who are willing to sacrifice and  risk everything to be part of America's future is part of the reason we  have prospered as a nation.   I hope that Senators on both sides of the aisle will have the good  sense to come to that conclusion and that, at another time, with  another Congress and, perhaps, with another President, we will have a  meaningful and fair-minded conversation.   In the meantime, I will work with Senator Lee to resolve the  differences that we have, which are now down to only a handful. As  evidenced today, I believe we have made dramatic progress. We are  disappointed by the result, but we are not giving up.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.   There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be  printed in the Record, as follows:                                  S. 4450         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of       the United States of America in Congress assembled,       SECTION 1.
