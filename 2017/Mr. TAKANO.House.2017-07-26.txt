 Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division B (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. ___.  There is appropriated, for salaries and expenses       of the Office of Technology Assessment as authorized by the       Technology Assessment Act of 1972 (2 U.S.C. 471 et seq.)       $2,500,000, to be derived from a reduction of $2,647,000 in       the amount provided in this Act for the item for ``Architect       of the Capitol, Capital Construction and Operations''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentleman  from California (Mr. Takano) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my amendment, which would  restore funding to the Office of Technology Assessment, or otherwise  known as OTA. I would like to thank my cosponsors, Representatives  Esty, Foster, Langevin, Lieu, and Lujan.   The foundation for good policy is accurate and objective analysis,  and, for more than two decades, the OTA set that foundation by  providing relevant, unbiased technical and scientific assessments for  Members of Congress and staff.  [[Page H6416]]    But in 1995, the OTA was defunded, stripping Congress of a valuable  resource to understand both emerging technologies as well as the  nuances of the legislative process. In its absence, the need for OTA  has only grown. Many of the issues OTA studied 20 years ago are even  more pressing today.   Antibiotic resistant bacteria, electronic surveillance in the digital  age, and testing in America's schools, these are the complex challenges  our Nation will continue to face, and Congress should have access to  the thorough and insightful analysis OTA can provide.   Investing in the OTA now will actually save us money in the future.  In the last year it operated, the OTA's budget was $23 million, but its  studies on the synthetic fuels corporation saved taxpayers tens of  billions of dollars. Our amendment restores a modest $2.5 million to  the OTA account for salaries and expenses to begin rebuilding the  office.   The cost is offset by a reduction to the Architect of the Capitol's  construction and operations account. This administrative account will  not take resources from specific construction projects.   Mr. Chair, a great surgeon does not operate without modern tools, a  master chef does not cook without fresh ingredients, and Members of  Congress should not make policy decisions without relevant and unbiased  information.   And with that in mind, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this  amendment, to restore funding to the Office of Technology Assessment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 2\1/2\ minutes  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Foster), a member of the Science Committee and also a  physicist.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Foster), a member of the Science Committee and also a  physicist.    Mr. Chair, I reiterate my support for the Office of  Technology Assessment. Congress does not suffer from a lack of  information, but it does suffer from a lack of trusted information to  help make wise policy decisions.   Today, we do need the Office of Technology Assessment more than ever.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.   The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the  gentleman from California (Mr. Takano).   The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes  appeared to have it.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.   The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further  proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California  will be postponed.                  Amendment No. 8 Offered by Ms. Shea-Porter    The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8  printed in House Report 115-259.   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         At the end of division B (before the short title), insert       the following:        Sec. ___.  None of the funds made available in this Act may       be used to mail any mass mailing (as defined in subparagraph       (E) of section 3210(a)(6) of title 39, United States Code)       which is larger than 4\1/4\ inches high x 6 inches long x       0.016 inches thick.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 473, the gentlewoman  [[Page H6417]]  from New Hampshire (Ms. Shea-Porter) and a Member opposed each will  control 5 minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New Hampshire.   Ms. SHEA-PORTER. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chair, my amendment is simple and straightforward. It would  change the way our official taxpayer-funded mass mailings to  constituents look by limiting the mailer to the size of a standard  postcard.   As Members of Congress, it is our job to set the standard for  responsible stewardship of taxpayer funds, and public resources should  not be spent on excessive campaign-style mailers.                                time  1815    A significant part of our duties as elected representatives is to  keep our constituents informed about what we are doing in our offices.  I support mass mailings to our constituents, but we can keep them  informed by sending a simple postcard, without all of the glitz and  gloss.   Also, when official mail looks like campaign mailers, people are more  likely to toss it out, thereby defeating the very purpose of informing  our constituents. Our official mail should not look like campaign ads  or junk mail. Our constituents don't want large mailers. They just want  information. This amendment delivers.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my amendment  which ensures that the Department of Energy continues to fund Energy  Innovation Hubs in the Offices of Science, Energy Efficiency &  Renewable Energy, and Nuclear Energy.                                time  1930    The current report language accompanying H.R. 3266, which is the  Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill, directs the DOE not  to fund these centers.   By passing this amendment, we will clearly express Congress' intent  to continue funding these innovation hubs and request that the final  report language be edited to reflect our intent.   The four existing innovation hubs conduct critical research across  energy fields including nuclear, solar, advanced storage, and energy  supply chains. These hubs are modeled off of the iconic Bell  Laboratories, but private industry no longer sustains this type of  research due to increasing pressure to make short-term profits.   That is why it is essential that the government conduct this  research.   Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support the en bloc and  amend the final report language so these vital innovation hubs continue  to receive funding.
