 Madam President, it was such a joy to be in Tennessee  last week and visit with so many of our local officials, and I had the  opportunity to spend some time with some of our sheriffs. And one of  the sheriffs made a point that I think deserves attention in this body  today.   He said: Marsha, for years, we have measured the drugs we have  apprehended in grams or ounces, but today everything is in pounds. That  is the uptick in volume that our local law enforcement is seeing in our  communities.   Now, the question is, Why is this happening? How is it that so much  more is getting across that southern border? And my colleague from Ohio  and my colleague from Missouri have each mentioned the problems that  exists there--no ``Remain in Mexico,'' no wall.   And we are at a time here in this country where our supply chains are  really being stressed, but the supply chains of the cartels seem to be  doing just fine. Fortunately, our Border Patrol has been able to cause  some blips and some problems with those supply chains, and they have  been able to apprehend some of the drugs coming across our border.   In January, in a period of 7 days--1 week--our Border Patrol caught  47 pounds of methamphetamine in California, 3,800 pounds of marijuana  in two raids in Texas, and 20 pounds of cocaine in Texas.   The street value was about $7 million that they pulled off of the  street, but this is, unfortunately, a blip for the cartels--just a blip  on their radar. These thousands of pounds of drugs are a footnote in  the long history of the ``got-aways'' and the drug mules who keep these  cartel supply lines flowing from South and Central America and into the  United States.   Now, as my colleagues have said, until this administration decides  they want to get serious about protecting our Nation's sovereignty and  securing this southern border, this is going to continue.   Now, what does this cause in our country? What it means is every town  is a border town, and every State is a border State. Until the Biden  administration decides they are going to get serious on that border, it  means that your town will function like a border town, your State like  a border State. Nashville, Knoxville, Memphis are all experiencing some  of the same problems that you are seeing on our Nation's borders.   And whether the State is Maryland or Wisconsin or Nevada, whether  these are other States--Illinois, Colorado--what you are seeing are  these problems that are brought about by an open border: gangs,  cartels, human smuggling, sex trafficking.   So I would ask my Democratic colleagues, and I would hope they would  ask the President: Where else do they think these thousands of pounds  of drugs are being headed?   That is right. It is a rhetorical question, but they are coming to  your neighborhoods, and your local law enforcement agencies are going  to find themselves dealing with this.   Now, the Biden administration has said, repeatedly, that they want to  focus their border policy on finding the root causes of illegal  immigration. So Vice President Harris recently took her second trip to  the Northern Triangle so she could try and figure out what the root  causes are.   But while she is there and meeting with diplomats, the cartels' drug  trade, along with their human trafficking trade, is booming. It is  booming. The number of apprehensions across this southern border are at  an alltime high.   And as my colleague mentioned, the ``got-aways''--the hundreds of  thousands of ``got-aways,'' the hundreds of thousands of ``got-aways''  that are now in your communities--the hundreds or maybe even thousands  of pounds of different drugs are coming into your communities.   We have been down this road before. We have made investments in the  Northern Triangle to try and beat back the poverty, the corruption, and  we are having the same problems. They are the same that they were years  ago.   There is no buy-in on a policy. The only buy-in that this  administration has managed to earn is the buy-in of corrupt officials  and drug lords who have invested in our wide-open border.   Why is it that you have to pay the cartel to come in? Why is it that  the cartels are moving these sex trafficking rings onto U.S. shores?  Why is it that the cartels are setting up distribution centers in our  cities? It is because this administration has that border wide open,  and they see the opportunity to make big bucks, to really enrich  themselves.   How can we expect to fight corruption when we encourage them to set  up these business operations?   I would encourage my Democratic colleagues to take a look at the  numbers that are coming from that southern border, look at numbers that  were there from 2021, look at the numbers of not grams and ounces but  pounds of illicit drugs that are being apprehended, talk to their local  law enforcement about what they are finding on their streets, and then  ask themselves: Are you doing everything you can to keep our  communities safe? Are you doing everything that you can to keep our  children and our grandchildren safe in their communities?   If you had to answer that question today, if the administration had  to answer that question today, the answer would be an emphatic, no,  they are not because the border is open. That policy is failing the  American people; it is failing our communities that are truly  struggling to keep drugs out of the hands of kids; and it is failing  the thousands upon thousands of people who took you at your word--and  then you have seen this border turned over to the cartels.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
