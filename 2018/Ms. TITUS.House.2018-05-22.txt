 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I share the enthusiasm of the chairman for the Soap Box  Derby. I speak in favor of this resolution.   I also want to thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) for  introducing this resolution every Congress on behalf of the Washington  regional delegation.   This annual competitive event encourages boys and girls, ages 7  through 20, to construct, operate, and then race their very own soap  box vehicles. It has become a great tradition here in the Nation's  Capital, and it has been going on for over 20 years. It provides a  terrific opportunity for children to appreciate the workmanship, the  craftsmanship, the time, the effort that goes into the construction of  these vehicles, and then they get to enjoy the thrill of the race and  competition.   The Greater Washington Soap Box Derby organizers will work with the  Architect of the Capitol and with the Capitol Police to ensure that the  appropriate rules and regulations are in place and that the event  remains free to the public.   I want to encourage my colleagues to support this legislation and  then to come out on June 16 to participate in this exciting event.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to the  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), my colleague and leader.    Mr. Speaker, as you know, I represent Las Vegas. I am not  sure we can take bets on the Soap Box Derby in Las Vegas, but I would  say the odds are in favor of somebody from your district winning if it  does occur.   We have no other speakers, and so I just urge my colleagues to vote  in favor.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
