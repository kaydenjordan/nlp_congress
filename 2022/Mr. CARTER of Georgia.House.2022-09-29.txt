 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the  immeasurable service, and share my gratitude to one of the most  valuable members of my staff, Brooke Miller.   Brooke has been a member of my team for 6 years and has become an  integral part of my daily life both here in Washington and at home in  the First Congressional District of Georgia.   I have called her at late hours and on the weekend, and she was  always there for me when I needed help. During her time in our office,  Brooke has served as my scheduler and director of operations. In truth,  I don't know how we would have managed all this time without her.   I have been very fortunate to have someone like Brooke on my team,  and she will be dearly missed by me, especially, along with the rest of  our staff. As she enters this new stage of her life and transitions off  the Hill, I wish her the absolute best of luck.   Her service to the First Congressional District of Georgia, and her  time spent as my lifesaver, will never be forgotten. She has left a  lasting impression on me and everyone that she has come in contact  with. We are so grateful for all of her work.   Brooke, thank you so much for giving us your time and your unyielding  effort and patience. We will surely miss you. Good luck in everything  the future holds for you.                            ____________________     Mr Speaker, I was unavoidably detained.
