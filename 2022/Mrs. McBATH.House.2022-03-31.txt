 Madam Speaker, I really appreciate Mr. DeSaulnier giving  me a few moments of time.   Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 6833, the Affordable  Insulin Now Act.   I want to take this time just to talk about the cost of healthcare  and prescription drugs for all those in our community. It is a topic  that I hear about every single day from my constituents, and it is  something that touches the lives of every single American, whether you  have diabetes or not.   Today, we will be voting on a bill that will actually provide  desperately needed relief to some of the most vulnerable patients in  the United States, in Georgia and all across this Nation.   There is no time off when you live with diabetes. It is a constant,  ever-present disease that influences every aspect of your life. Listen  to those who gave testimony about what they live with every single day  with this chronic disease.    In 1920, before insulin was discovered, it would have been  exceptional for those who had diabetes to live longer than 1 or 2  years. But over the past 100 years, we have been able to save lives  with insulin. For over 100 years, it has remained the most effective  treatment that we have.   Over 100 years later, some estimates state that diabetics spend  around $6,000 a year alone on insulin. This is just absolutely  unconscionable for a drug that has been saving lives for over 100  years. We can and must make it more affordable for Americans who need  it to live.   That is why I joined my colleagues, Angie Craig and  Dan Kildee, who  I find to be healthcare champions, in introducing this critical  legislation.   It is just really very simple. The Affordable Insulin Now Act would  cap out-of-pocket costs of insulin products at $35 per month for  Americans with health insurance.   This bill brings a measure of certainty and affordability to every  American who needs insulin to continue living a healthy life.   Yes, I have heard arguments this afternoon that this doesn't take  care of every individual in the country, specifically those who are  uninsured. We know that. I assure you, we are not completely satisfied  with this either. But if our Republican colleagues would come to the  table with us, with any measures that you have--compromise, come to the  table, consensus. Help us build the ability to make sure that every  American in this country, whether they are insured or not, has the  ability to be able to afford this lifesaving drug. We welcome that from  you because people every single day are dying right beneath our noses.  I am here to save lives.   I look forward to passing this vital legislation out of the House of  Representatives today, and I look forward to continuing to fight for  passage with Senator Warnock in the Senate.   As the President so rightly stated, this legislation can and will  save lives, and it is long overdue.                                time  1530
