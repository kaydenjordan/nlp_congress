 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and  allowing me to speak on this en bloc amendment, which includes my  amendment to add $30 million to the Army Community Services account to  provide family assistance, victim advocacy, financial counseling,  employment readiness, and other similar support services. This program  is so important, and I am grateful the amendment was included.   I am also here to urge the inclusion of the Insulin Affordability  Data Collection Act in the final NDAA. Right now, Minnesotans are dying  because of the real-life impact of the cost of insulin and other  lifesaving prescription drugs.   Madam Speaker, I urge the inclusion of this bill, which is already  included in the Senate's version of NDAA. This issue will study the  rates of diabetic ketoacidosis, which took the life of Minnesotan Alec  Smith 2 years ago after the high cost of insulin forced him to ration  his doses.
