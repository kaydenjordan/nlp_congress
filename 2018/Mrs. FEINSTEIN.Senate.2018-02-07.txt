 Mr. President, I rise to introduce a Senate  Resolution recognizing February 7, 2018 as ``National Girls & Women in  Sports Day''. Since the passage of Title IX of the Education Amendments  of 1972, our Nation has taken many big steps toward achieving equality  for women in our Nation's athletic institutions. In fact, since then,  participation by high school girls in athletic programs has increased  more than six fold. And in college sports, participation by women  athletes has nearly tripled since the passage of Title IX.   However, many disparities still exist between male and female  athletic programs in our Nation today. Because there are simply fewer  athletic opportunities and programs for girls, there are lower levels  of participation in sports amongst present day high school girls than  there were for high school boys in the 1970s.   Across college campuses, women athletes still comprise only 44  percent of the collegiate athlete population. And in some instances,  the numbers have even shrunk over time. In 1972, women occupied more  than 90 percent of coaching positions with collegiate women's teams.  Today, women occupy less than half of these coaching positions.   This resolution recognizes how far we have come, but more  importantly, it acknowledges how much farther we still have to go to  achieve equality for our female athletes. In looking to the future and  resolving together that more must be done to provide girls and women  equal opportunity in sports, we also celebrate and recognize female  athletes from the past who have faced difficult obstacles in their  lives to advance the participation of women in sports.   We honor athletes like Althea Gibson, who was the first African- American athlete to break down racial barriers in international tennis  and who, in 1956, became the first person of color to win a Grand Slam  tennis title with her victory at the French Open.   We celebrate ``Babe'' Didrikson Zaharias, who, in addition to the  Olympic medals she won at the 1932 Olympic Games in track and field,  challenged conventions in the sport of golf to become the first woman  in history who attempted to qualify in the U.S. Open tournament.   We salute Wilma Rudolph, who in the 1960s was considered the fastest  woman in the world and, with her performance at the 1960 Olympic Games,  was the first American woman to achieve three gold medals at any single  Olympics event in history.   Each of these women faced tremendous difficulties to break down  barriers in their respective sports to change not just the culture of  sports in our Nation, but ultimately, to improve our country. Their  names were inscribed in sports history, and in the process they became  positive role models for entire generations of female athletes who  continue to inspire us all with their talents. Finally, this resolution  recognizes the importance of supporting girls and women in sports by  holding to account those who use their positions of power--both  individual and institutional in nature--to abuse and exploit.   Mr. President, our Nation continues to struggle with the revelations  that hundreds of young female athletes were sexually abused within USA  Gymnastics affiliated institutions. The stories of these survivors, who  endured such horrific abuse at the hands of professionals entrusted to  develop their athletic talents, are absolutely heartbreaking and our  Nation must do more to prevent these crimes from ever happening again.  To put an end to this abuse, on January 30, 2018, Congress passed the  Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse and Safe Sport Authorization  Act of 2017, which I had authored and introduced to require all Olympic  sports organizations and amateur sports organizations to immediately  report allegations of sexual abuse to law enforcement.   As the Winter Olympics begin this week in South Korea, our Nation  must continue to do everything we can to enforce this legislation and  advocate on behalf of these young athletes whose lives have been turned  upside down by the abuse that they endured.   I would also like to thank the National Women's Law Center and the  National Girls & Women in Sports Day Coalition for their support of  this resolution. All young people in our Nation deserve equal access to  freely participate in athletic programs and to feel safe and secure so  they can thrive within their chosen sports. With these goals in mind, I  call on all of us to examine the progress we have made and  [[Page S709]]  commit ourselves to addressing the inequalities we must still overcome  to empower female athletes in our Nation.   Mr. President, I yield the floor.                            ____________________
