 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, Special Counsel Mueller officially ended his  investigation several weeks ago. His office is closed. Because of  Attorney General Barr, his report is public.   And his findings are very clear: No collusion and no obstruction.  This is the bottom line of the Mueller report.   But, Mr. Speaker, Democrats refuse to accept it. Mr. Speaker, even  the chairman of the committee refuses to go read the portion that he is  allowed to read, only six lines. He refuses to read it, but he wants to  come here today.   They continue to believe their worst conspiracy theories about the  President, despite all the evidence to the contrary.   Mr. Speaker, it is even reported in newspapers that, in the campaign  to become chairman of the Judiciary Committee, one said he campaigned  for the position because he would be the best with impeachment.   Mr. Speaker, even on the floor of this House, there were more than 60  Members on the other side of the aisle who voted for impeachment before  the Mueller report was ever presented to the public.    At its core, H. Res. 430 is just a desperate attempt to relitigate  the Mueller investigation. That is why I urge my colleagues to oppose  this resolution.   It does not strengthen Congress' oversight powers, contrary to what  you may hear from the other side, Mr. Speaker. Fundamentally, it is an  impeachment effort in everything but name.   Mr. Speaker, just look at the unnecessary contempt citation against  Attorney General Barr. Less than a month after Barr received the  Mueller report, Mr. Speaker, Chairman Nadler issued a subpoena that  would have required the Attorney General of the United States of  America to break the law.   That is not my opinion. Let's be very clear whose words those are:  Jonathan Turley's. Mr. Speaker, probably everybody in this body not  only knows who Jonathan Turley is; he has, probably, the utmost  respect. He is one of the most respected legal scholars in this  country.   Now, he told the committee, Mr. Speaker:         You have to tie your request carefully to your authority to       demand information . . . if Bill Barr had actually complied       with the subpoena as written, he would have violated Federal       law.    If he would have complied, he would have violated Federal law.   Mr. Speaker, that is why we are here. Not only, Mr. Speaker, does the  chairman of that committee ask the attorney general to break the law or  he will try to hold him in contempt; he won't even go read the report.   On May 8, only a few weeks after the first subpoena was issued, House  Judiciary Democrats voted to hold A. G. Barr, the Attorney General of  the United States, in contempt.   Why would they vote to hold him in contempt? Because they were so  angry that the Attorney General wouldn't break the law. They wanted him  to break the law; then he won't be held in contempt.   In a May 24 letter to the Attorney General, Chairman Nadler offered,  for the first time, to negotiate and narrow the scope of his subpoena  request. Then, you know what? He changed his mind.   Yesterday, the Department of Justice reached an agreement with the  Judiciary Committee to turn over documents related to the Mueller  report.   Now, if the public is watching, this just looks so disorganized. You  wonder, from that committee, Mr. Speaker, wouldn't they know better  than to ask the Attorney General to break the law?   Mr. Speaker, wouldn't you know that, when you get to this point in a  career, you wouldn't be so upset that someone just doesn't do exactly  what you want--and you ask them to break the law--that you would vote  to hold them in contempt and force your side of the aisle just to vote  that way.   That is not how it has happened in this body before. If the public  wants to see a good example of congressional oversight, then let's look  at something that is comparable: the House's contempt vote against  Attorney General Holder in 2012.   The House Committee on Oversight and Reform took two important  actions before suing in Federal court. First, it negotiated with  Attorney General Holder in good faith for 15 months--not a few days. It  never asked him to break the law either.   After narrowing the scope of its original subpoena, and only after  extensive back-and-forth negotiations failed, did it vote to hold him  in contempt.   Second, it got the full House to vote on it and approve--you know  what--a bipartisan contempt.   Now, I am not sure why the Committee on the Judiciary, Mr. Speaker,  would not know this, but I did a little research because I was here  during that time. You know why they didn't realize it was the best way  to do it and it was bipartisan? Because, Mr. Speaker, a lot of them  stormed outside of the Chamber.   Yep. You heard me right. Even though 17 Democrats voted in favor of  the criminal contempt resolution against Holder and 21 voted to enforce  civil citation, a number of them stormed outside and protested, took  their ball and ran home. Mr. Speaker, I guess, to the public, it looked  like they had just thrown another fit.   Now, that is pretty significant. As many of you remember, it was  contentious. I remember, Mr. Speaker, watching then-Minority Leader  Pelosi, Minority Whip Hoyer, and Congressman Nadler lead 100 Democrats  off the House floor to protest the vote.   Mr. Speaker, you won't see that on our side. We believe in the rule  of law. Mr. Speaker, we would have done the exact same thing the  Attorney General did, that Jonathan Turley said, that you would have  had to break the law to try to appease somebody's own personal  vendetta.   The idea, Mr. Speaker, that someone would run for a position to say  that they would be best to impeach somebody and even vote to impeach  without even having a report and then, when you get a report and you  could go down and read just those six lines that you want to complain  about, but you won't--the same person, Mr. Speaker, that would run  outside and say: I got elected to Congress, but I am going to pout and  I am going to go outside.   Mr. Speaker, that may be the same person that would want to bring  this to the floor today.   But what is so different about today than all the others? Well, we  are doing something we have never done before. We are doing something  that is going to take the power away of every Member in this body and  give it to a select few.  [[Page H4419]]    Mr. Speaker, if this vote passes today, Members of this body are  going to say: Don't bring it here and let me represent my own people  and vote about going to court. Let's just give it, really, to three  people. Let's give it to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer,  and to the majority whip. Because that is what BLAG is.   I know the courts are going to sit there and say that is not what  Congress is supposed to do. Congress has never done that before. But,  you know what? If this new majority thinks all they want to do is make  an attorney general break the law, I guess they could break every rule,  every history, every point of representation there is inside this body.    Did we wonder if this would happen? Do we wonder why you wouldn't  take the months, as they have shown in the time before, and actually  come to a bipartisan conclusion?   I think the plan was already written. I don't know if people can talk  about the word ``patient'' because, Mr. Speaker, I remember Congressman  Hank Johnson of the Rules Committee--this is the Speaker's committee,  so everybody understands correctly, that is just appointed by the  Speaker on the majority side--said, Mr. Speaker: ``Donald Trump will  stand for reelection again in a very short period of time, and we don't  have 400 days to wait. . . .''   So, don't care about the rule of law. Don't care about asking him to  break the law. Just break every historical trend and try to take the  power away from millions of Americans and from the Members of Congress  who represent them here.   I didn't know today would come. Mr. Speaker, I didn't know if someone  would go this far.   I didn't know, just because someone, Mr. Speaker, despises somebody  else, that an election didn't turn out the way of the desire--Mr.  Speaker, I have been on losing sides before, but I would never think I  would break the law just because of losing an election.   I would never think of asking somebody in as high an office as the  Attorney General of the United States of America to not give due  process, to come to the floor and strip the power of 430 Members and  put it in a select few.   Mr. Speaker, I have to be honest. I don't put anything past what this  new desire is about.                                time  1530    Mr. Speaker, Democrats say we are in a constitutional crisis, and  they are right, but not because of Attorney General Barr. The  constitutional crisis is this: When Democrats can't win, they change  the rules.   I just heard it on the floor, Mr. Speaker, that, yes, from the other  side of the aisle, said this has never been done before, and, yes, this  is nothing this House has ever desired to do. But it is also no way to  govern.   The American people deserve a majority that is serious about coming  up with solutions, not subpoenas. There are plenty of important  challenges that we can be working on to solve.   Just yesterday, Mr. Speaker, I opened The New York Times. It is not a  paper that I think I always agree with, but it had an editorial not for  the first time, but for the second time, and it was talking about the  crisis on the border.   As I read this editorial, I found myself agreeing with it greatly.  When I read it, it talked about the border, talked about Washington  needing to stop dithering and do something about it.   I looked and wondered what committee would be most responsible for  this challenge? Lo and behold, it was the Judiciary. So I turned it on  in hopes that I would see a hearing, maybe I would even see a markup.   No, Mr. Speaker, who did I see? I saw John Dean. John Dean, who  pleaded guilty in Watergate. The same individual who has put more than  900 tweets out against the President, many before any Mueller report  came forth. He was the expert witness--the same individual who is paid  by CNN, the same individual who said the Presidency of George Bush was  worse than Watergate.   I guess this new majority will go to no end. It doesn't matter if the  facts don't go where they want; just change the rules.   I wonder, all these new freshman Democrats, Mr. Speaker, when they  swore in to uphold the Constitution, does that mean trying to make the  Attorney General break the law? Does that mean giving their power away  to a select few?   There is a crisis on the border. The New York Times knows it. The  country of Mexico knows it. I think almost everybody in America knows  it except, Mr. Speaker, I guess, this majority.   The committee of responsibility is more concerned about bringing  somebody in who pleaded guilty in Watergate, who makes their money off,  Mr. Speaker, writing books claiming every Republican President there is  is worse than Watergate and then asking the Attorney General to break  the law.   That is not a legacy I would be proud of. It is not a legacy I would  want to be a part of.   But, Mr. Speaker, I will say on this floor: I will vote against  taking the power away, even the power away from people on the other  side of the aisle. I won't lead a protest, and I won't go outside, and  I won't take my ball, and I won't run home. I believe in the rule of  law.   Mr. Speaker, I had the responsibility and the opportunity to go read  the redacted portions of the Mueller report, just as some on the other  side of the aisle could. It is just six lines. Not that I think it was  just my responsibility, but as an elected official I thought it was a  responsibility, so I went. But, Mr. Speaker, the people leading this  today, they have not. They think they know better.   I don't know if they know better, but one thing I do know: They are  changing the rules of the House simply because they cannot win. That is  not the American way.   Those are the reasons why we stand up. Those are the things that  America unites behind, the rule of law. This will not be a day that is  proud. This will not be a day that, when they look back in history, the  individuals who vote for this will talk about.   It is one when they get asked the question later in life, Mr.  Speaker, is there something they regret, they will regret that emotion  overtook them. They will regret their own personal dislike drove them.   I am not sure if they are proud of the day when they storm out of the  building, even though there is a bipartisan vote here. But I guess that  same emotion, the same, Mr. Speaker, lack of ability to actually look  at the rule of law and work toward something instead of just changing  the rules because you can't have your way, that is what today is about.   The worst part of it all is removing the power of individual Members  and putting in a select three. But then again, Mr. Speaker, when you  study history and forms of government, that is what socialism is all  about.
