 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to complete my  remarks.    I yield the floor.    Mr. President, it is so interesting to always come to  the floor and speak on topics that are important to Tennesseans and I  think also to Americans. As I begin my remarks, I want to kind of build  the context for this and take us back to a time I know the Presiding  Officer recalls, and so do I. It was the sixties. I was a child who was  growing up. I remember it as a decade where bold statements and brash  behavior and activists from each side of the aisle set the standard for  what we today look at and say is a modern-day political protest. What  we saw in this decade was once-sleepy college campuses became the  scenes of widespread unrest. Tensions were high and conditions were  perfect for what else but a Supreme Court battle.   In September 1969, a group of students attending Central Connecticut  State University decided they wanted to organize a local chapter of the  organization Students for Democratic Society. The university president  rejected the application, claiming that the SDS philosophy was  ``antithetical to the school's policies'' and could be a disruptive  influence on campus.   Now, I am sure he thought he had a good point. The national SDS  organization was known for its fiery protests,  [[Page S3263]]  and its now-notorious acts of civil disobedience. They made it their  business to make authority figures nervous. Nervousness, however, is  not an exception to the First Amendment. The students knew that, so the  lawsuits started flying. The students' case finally made it to the  Supreme Court, which held that ``the First Amendment to the  Constitution of the United States applies in full force on the campuses  of public colleges and universities.'' That case, Healy v. James, was a  win for free speech. Although precedent continues to trend in the right  direction, the First Amendment is in danger on the American college  campus. From so-called free speech zones to severely restricted speech  codes, campus officials are doing their best to ensure that students  are protected from anything that may challenge their preexisting  notions of right and wrong.   Instead of creating a safe environment, these policies have  backfired, creating an atmosphere of fear and violence toward opposing  viewpoints.   Just this past April, protesters at the University of Texas at Austin  used smoke bombs to shut down a pro-life speaker at a Young  Conservatives of Texas event.   In 2017, the editorial staff at Wellesley College's student newspaper  threatened hostility toward anyone whose beliefs--their beliefs; not  just their words but their beliefs--did not fit into the acceptable  liberal mold.   That same year, Middlebury College campus--their left behaved so  disgracefully that one progressive columnist begged the students at his  alma mater to find a way to protest views they disagree with without  shutting down speech entirely.   In the face of such hostility toward free and open debate, I ask this  body, what have we done, and what can be done to turn back the tide?   Today, on the eve of National Higher Education Day, I am introducing  the Campus Free Speech Resolution of 2019. It is a first step in  restoring sanity to free speech for American college students. This  resolution first and foremost recognizes that free speech zones and  restrictive speech codes contradict the guarantees of the First  Amendment. It recognizes that universities should protect the free and  open exchange of ideas and that freedom of speech is worth protecting  in a world increasingly hostile to democracy.   Through this resolution, I encourage the Secretary of Education to  promote policies that encourage intellectual curiosity, viewpoint  diversity, and debate. Last but not least, I encourage the Attorney  General to defend and protect the First Amendment.   Standing by as universities surrender to activists who value their  own comfort over the free exchange of ideas isn't just a mistake; it is  a moral inversion.   We have a duty to make sure younger generations understand that  protecting the First Amendment means protecting one another in the  public square--even if we want more than anything to shut down what we  are hearing. I may disagree with what you have to say, but I will  defend your right to say it.   Above all, we have a duty to help them understand that an America  where curiosity is replaced by suspicion, where debate is replaced by  intimidation, and where speech is replaced by silence is no America at  all.                            ____________________
