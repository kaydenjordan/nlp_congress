 Mr. Speaker, let me raise several questions for President  Donald Trump. The American people and Members of Congress would like to  know the answers.   I am deeply concerned the President is compromising the national  security of our Nation. Why would a President share intelligence  information with the highest ranking operatives of Russia close to  President Vladimir Putin?   Though the President's cavalier and, frankly, outrageous behavior  conveniently sucked up the airwaves last week, Americans cannot be  distracted from his simultaneous firing of FBI Director James Comey, an  official who spent his life protecting and defending the Constitution  of our country on liberty's behalf.   Let me ask: Why were no U.S. journalists allowed into the President's  historic meeting with the Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov and Russia's  Ambassador to the United States for many years, Ambassador Kislyak, one  of probably the highest ranking intelligence officers as well as  Ambassador from Russia to the United States? To my knowledge, no U.S.  President has ever received officials from Russia in the Oval Office  and then brought only Russian journalists with digital recording  equipment into that office. Let me repeat that. We don't know who they  were, but they brought equipment, digital recording equipment.   Think about that. Think about that.   Meanwhile, the President excluded American press. Not a single  journalist from this country was allowed in. He replaced them with  Russian state media operatives. Today, CNN reports that, how  conveniently, President Vladimir Putin has now said he will  [[Page H4231]]  make available to America the transcript of that meeting. He is willing  to share it. Well, isn't that nice?   It is further alarming that his National Security Advisor, General  McMaster, said that, despite the President being unaware of the source  of the information, at that meeting he made a spur-of-the-moment  decision to tell the Russians what he knew about very important  intelligence we received from an ally.   It is starting to pile up, Mr. President: more and more reckless and  cavalier behavior every day with America's security stakes very high.   I don't have to remind my colleagues, it is on the record. Russia has  been buzzing into U.S. airspace over Alaska. Her submarines are along  the East Coast. This isn't exactly a friend to us. If you want to make  America great again, you do not compromise America's national security.   Not only is the President struggling for a coherent foreign policy  that keeps Americans safe and secure and doesn't make our allies  quizzical, he fails to keep his attention on promises to working  Americans here on home turf, particularly on trade and jobs. Let's take  the promises he made to our steelworkers in Ohio, that they will not  lose their jobs, that America will be great again, that the coalfields  will just boom; right?   Well, in Lorain, Ohio, thousands of steelworkers are losing their  jobs, with hundreds more, as I stand here today, being pink-slipped and  getting termination notices unless the President takes action by the  end of the first week in June. This is not the only community in  America facing this, but it is not getting any publicity because all  this other stuff is all over the front pages.   We know we need direct and immediate action to save America's steel  industry that has been dumped on by Chinese, Russian, and South Korean  steel for years now. We need to stop foreign-dumped steel. These  workers' jobs are directly impacted by what is happening at our borders  with all that stuff coming in here.    I have invited the President and his Commerce Secretary, Wilbur Ross,  to Lorain, Ohio, to witness firsthand this unfolding tragedy. Well, no  promises are firm yet, not getting any acceptances while our workers  need to be thrown a life raft in the typhoon that they are enduring.  Perhaps it is hard to make America great again if you are moving from  one self-made crisis to another and losing attention on the homeland.   Lorain County carried for Hillary Clinton, but only by 104 votes. It  is a Democratic county. They were hoping jobs might actually begin to  be increased in that area, not zeroed out.   So let's recap: a roller coaster foreign policy confusing not just  us, but our allies, and broken promises regarding jobs.   How about healthcare? Well, let's take this--more confusion.   We can be certain TrumpCare removes--removes--protections for our  seniors and does not address the rising costs of medications. His bill  will take away assistance that closed the Medicare prescription drug  hole after seniors reach a level of $2,500, costing them over $1,000  more a year.   Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve security, they deserve jobs,  they deserve affordable education, and there is no better time to start  than today.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Boyle and Congressman  Veasey for their leadership and the new energy and the innovative ideas  that they bring here from their constituency on behalf of our country.  It is a privilege to join you tonight and talk about the infrastructure  of our country, a major infrastructure bill, and it is certainly  appropriate during this infrastructure week.   The whole vital topic of investing in a national infrastructure plan  and investing in those who will help to modernize America translates  into good jobs, as Congressman Veasey has talked about, and progress  for America that Congressman Boyle has talked about.   When we think about infrastructure, some people only think about  roads and bridges, and we certainly need attention to those across our  country. So many places throughout our Nation are in desperate need of  repair. Frankly, the street I live on, there is a big sinkhole at the  end of the street.   Mr. Speaker, 17 percent of the roads in Ohio, my home State, are in  poor condition, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers.  They estimate that the average Ohio driver pays an extra $475 a year  from driving on roads in need of repair. Look no further than me. I had  to pay $500 for a whole front end because of hitting a big pothole  driving at home at night. So we know how much it costs.   Let me urge President Trump and the administration not to limit their  thinking on an infrastructure bill. Infrastructure should be about our  roads and bridges for sure, but it should go far beyond that for  modernizing the Nation.   As the ranking member on the Appropriations Subcommittee for Energy  and Water Development, I take very seriously America's responsibility  to modernize the country for this new century.    Our energy grid desperately needs an update, and power outages across  this country attest to that. Our waterways need help, too. And our  drinking water infrastructure, just in Ohio it is estimated will cost  $12.2 billion over the next 20 years.   As hard as it is to fathom, and I am sure the President hasn't had a  chance to read the fine print on this, but the President's budget  office proposed to zero out the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative  which is so vital to fresh drinking water in our vast region. The  President has said he wants to help the people in Flint, Michigan. He  campaigned there several times. But it is not an either/or. It is both/ and. You have to have funding in the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative  to take care of the water issues confronting the Great Lakes where  algal blooms get larger and larger every year due to phosphorus and  nitrogen runoff.   Our waterways, our drinking water, are vital components of our  national infrastructure. Over 11 million people just on Lake Erie  alone, the lake that I represent, need that fresh water. The systems  are very old. Some estimate in the cities, cities are losing 30 percent  or more of the water distribution underground because of aging  pipelines. We truly need to look both above the ground and underneath  it.   Through many of the counties that I represent, there are old septic  systems in place, and 40 percent or more of  [[Page H4305]]  them are leaking. They contribute to some of the problems that we are  having in our fresh water systems. These communities need a helping  hand and extra financing to help put their wastewater systems into  compliance.   I have also proposed a bill for a 21st century civilian conservation  corps for needed investments in our States and national parks and  forests. Ohio and Michigan alone need to plant 20 million trees to  replace those that have been damaged by invasive species.   I wanted to also mention, I represent, and I know Congressman Boyle  and Congressman Veasey, we represent urban communities, and many of  those communities have housing that is 100 years old. Some a little  more, some a little less. Imagine if infrastructure could include  weatherization so we could place new roofs on millions of homes across  this country. We could train people how to do this. We could help bring  up the younger generation.   Also windows and insulation. If we look at the condition of America's  housing stock, particularly following the collapse of 2008, if we look  at saving Americans money that they currently spend on wasting energy  because they can't afford to put on a new roof, windows, or insulate  their homes, we could help millions of Americans. As we help to improve  America's infrastructure, I really believe housing has an important  role to play in this regard, especially with energy conservation.   Honestly, as I close my remarks tonight, and I thank Congressman  Boyle and Congressman Veasey for their leadership, Mr. Speaker, it is  not only rewarding to work with them, it is fun, too.   Mr. Speaker, Americans have been waiting for us and the Federal  Government to really give them a helping hand up. I know working  together on a bipartisan basis, we can produce an infrastructure bill  that the country has been waiting for, as Congressman Boyle says, for  decades. I know that our mayors, our county commissioners, and our  Governors across the country would work hand in hand with us, and I  think Americans from coast to coast would applaud what we are able to  do here in order to help our country rebuild itself in this new  century.   Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank  Congresswoman Kaptur.   I mentioned, Mr. Speaker, at the very beginning of my remarks that we  kicked off infrastructure week on Monday morning at an event at  Philadelphia International Airport. One of those Members of Congress  who joined me for that event is the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr.  Norcross), someone who practices what he preaches when it comes to the  issues that most concern the Blue Collar Caucus, and someone who can  really speak about infrastructure from many different perspectives.   I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross).
