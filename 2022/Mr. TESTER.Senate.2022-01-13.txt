 Mr. President, I would like to share a few words today to  honor an outstanding leader and friend of mine who recently passed  away.   Caleb Shields was the retired Chairman and former Councilman of the  Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes of the Fort Peck Reservation in Montana.   We talk a lot about service in this body, but everyone in Congress  could learn from how Caleb lived his life.   He dedicated himself to service--service to this country, where he  served honorably in the United States Navy; service to his Tribe as an  elected leader for 24 years and as one of their most tireless  champions; and as the author of a 500-page book on his Tribe's history,  he served the next generation of the Fort Peck Tribes and the next  generation of Montanans who now have access to knowledge that won't  ever be forgotten.   Caleb was widely regarded as one of the most influential Tribal  leaders in the country during his tenure, a reputation that was well- earned. Among his many achievements are his successful 20-year fight to  get a water pipeline and treatment center on the Fort Peck reservation.  After they were built, they were both named in his honor, and for  generations to come, the name Caleb Shields will continue to serve the  Fort Peck Tribe.   Less widely known were the small ways that Caleb showed his love and  devotion for the Fort Peck Tribe. I am told that Caleb could recite the  record of the Poplar High School basketball team all the way back to  the 1970s. Caleb was devoted to that team, and believed strongly that  basketball could provide hope and momentum that could propel the dreams  of future leaders.   Caleb's legacy, his friendship, and his leadership will be felt for  generations. I want to express my deepest sympathy to Caleb's wife of  58 years, Yvonne, to the whole Shields family, and to the Fort Peck  Tribes for the loss of this great leader. Caleb made our state and our  Nation stronger, and he will never be forgotten.                            ____________________
