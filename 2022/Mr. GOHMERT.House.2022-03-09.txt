 Madam Speaker, there is no way I could vote to exchange  getting oil from Putin for getting oil from some other tyrant who wants  to destroy America, which makes this a rather cynical ploy, so I had to  vote ``no'' on Suspending Energy Imports from Russia Act.   It is time to make America energy independent again and stop the war  on American seniors, Americans on fixed incomes, and those that have to  keep maxing out their credit cards to buy gas just to get to work. I  had to vote ``no'' on what is being referred to as the Russia bill.   We have heard enough of the Biden administration lectures that  Americans should basically eat cake in their brand new expensive  electric cars. People who can't afford a tank of gas today can't afford  $30,000 to $150,000 for a new electric car.   This bill allowed the President to waive the provisions we voted on,  so I voted ``no.''                            ____________________
