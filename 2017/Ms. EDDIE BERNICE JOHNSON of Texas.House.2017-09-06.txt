 Mr. Speaker, let me thank the  majority and minority of the Energy and Commerce Committee for bringing  this unanimous legislation to the floor on self-driving vehicles, which  are revolutionizing the way we conceptualize travel.   Self-driving cars have the potential to lower our infrastructure and  mobility costs, enhance safety on our roads, and enhance mobility in  our cities.   However, like any complex technology, self-driving cars pose new  challenges for the regulatory landscape and our labor markets. That is  why I am pleased to support H.R. 3388, the SELF DRIVE Act, which seeks  to foster innovation in this space while offering protection for  consumers.   The SELF DRIVE Act is one of the many important bills that will need  to be considered by Congress in order to define Federal and State  regulatory roles, provide the U.S. Department of Transportation the  tools it needs to update safety standards, and ensure that the American  people are not left behind as we transition to a 21st century  workforce. Particularly, I am pleased to see that H.R. 3388 allows the  creation of the Highly Automated Vehicle Advisory Council.

[[Page H6676]]    I have been working on separate legislation to create a new  retraining program for workers who are displaced from their jobs due to  the adoption of autonomous vehicle technology. I am very grateful for  Representative Joe Barton and Representative Bob Latta's staff for  working with my office to craft and refine that legislation. I believe  that we are getting closer to a final product, which will ultimately  recognize the inevitable changes to the labor market that this country  will experience in the face of automated technologies.   Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 3388. I know that members  of the Energy & Commerce Committee have worked tirelessly to bring this  measure to the floor after hundreds of meetings with relevant  stakeholders. I encourage my colleagues to support this bill and look  forward to working cooperatively with members on other bills that will  address other aspects of self-driving vehicles and the ramifications  that will have on our economy and our country.                                time  1200
