 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding. I  thank the chair for her patriotic leadership on the House  Administration Committee and her invaluable service and leadership as a  member of the Select Committee on January 6.   Madam Speaker, I thank her for yielding, but I more importantly thank  her for bringing this important legislation to the floor. I salute her  leadership and that of Congresswoman Liz Cheney, vice chair of the  January 6 Select Committee, a principled and courageous voice for  freedom in our country.   This legislation is a manifestation of their courage, their  patriotism, and their determination in our mission to save American  democracy. I thank Chairwoman Lofgren and Vice Chair Cheney.   Madam Speaker, we are really the beneficiaries of such greatness in  our country's history. One of our Founders, Thomas Paine, said that the  times have found them to declare independence; to fight a war for  independence against the greatest naval power that existed at the time;  to win that war under leadership of our great patriarch, George  Washington, and then to write our founding documents. Thank God they  made them amendable so that we could have expanding freedom in our  country.   One of their early documents, the Declaration of Independence, has  been called by some the greatest document of the millennium, of a  thousand years.   Some years later the Union was under threat. Abraham Lincoln--this is  long before he was President--Abraham Lincoln delivered a stark warning  about the state of our Union. Speaking in Springfield in 1837, more  than two decades before the Civil War, he diagnosed a dangerous erosion  of our democracy. ``They were pillars of the temple of liberty,''  Lincoln said, referring to the generation of Americas who fought for  independence and served as living proof of the importance of democracy.  He continued: `` . . . now that they have crumbled away, that temple  must fall unless we, their descendants, supply their places with other  pillars . . .''   His words ring just as true today as we confront a dire threat to our  democracy and a duty to supply new pillars to preserve it.   On January 6, 2021, an insurrection erupted at the Capitol, seeking  to nullify the results of a free and fair election. This was a direct  assault not only on the Capitol, but on our Constitution, on the rule  of law, and on democracy itself; a direct assault on the Constitution  because the Constitution said that day that the Congress would, again,  certify the election of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris per the  Constitution by presenting the electoral college vote. So that was an  assault on the Constitution. That was that day. It wasn't just any day;  it was the day that the Constitution was supposed to be honored.   Now, we have a solemn duty to ensure that future efforts to undermine  elections cannot succeed. That is why the House established the Select  Committee on January 6, to find the truth of the attack and ensure that  it could never happen again. Since then, there have been attempts  across the country to nullify future elections.                                time  1545    That is why, today, we are taking historic and bipartisan legislative  action to safeguard the integrity of future Presidential elections.   The Presidential Election Reform Act takes four necessary steps.   First, the bill reaffirms that under the Constitution, the Vice  President has no authority to reject a slate of electors or delay the  count in any way. This was the heart of the former President's illegal,  false electoral scheme.   Second, the bill directly limits the types of objections to only  those outlined in the Constitution, which can be raised during  certification. You just can't raise any and all, but those that are  allowed in the Constitution. All objections would require one-third of  each Chamber to be entertained and a majority to be sustained.   Third, our bill requires Governors to transmit lawful election  results to Congress or be compelled to by a Federal court. Under this  proposal, no rogue Governor can unlawfully subvert the will of the  people, the heart of a democracy expressed in the democratic electoral  process.   Fourth, our bill makes crystal clear that States cannot change the  rules governing an election after the election has occurred--did you  hear that? ``Cannot change the rules governing an election after the  election has occurred''--preventing radical State legislators from  attempting to nullify the election. I keep using that word,  ``nullify.''   These changes are imperative right now. Emboldened by January 6,  politicians are waging a sinister campaign across America, the country,  to subvert our future elections, peddling the big lie that the 2022  election was stolen; assembling an army of operatives to intimidate  voters at the polls and poll workers, as well; and even threatening to  reverse results for which they disagree.   Wait a minute. We are talking about a democracy. ``Threatening to  reverse results for which they disagree.''   Let me be clear: This is a kitchen table issue for families. We must  ensure that this antidemocratic plot cannot succeed.   It is a kitchen table issue because denying the American people their  fundamental freedom to choose their own leaders denies them their voice  in the policies we pursue. Those policies can make an immense  difference in their everyday lives, on top of which we have a  responsibility. We take an oath to protect and defend the Constitution  of the United States.   This legislation is in furtherance of honoring that oath of office so  that our children, our grandchildren, future generations, know that  they live in a great democracy that cannot be undermined for political  reasons.   Madam Speaker, every Member knows that January 6 was an attempt to  subvert democracy, but many across the aisle refuse to admit the truth.  They refused to admit the truth that very night with blood on the  floor, glass on the floor, and all the rest when we came in to honor  our constitutional responsibility.   Overwhelmingly, others on the other side of the aisle voted not to  accept the results of the people in the election.   Now, House Republican leaders are whipping against this necessary  measure. To all those who oppose this legislation, I ask you: How could  anyone vote against free and fair elections, a cornerstone of our  Constitution? How could anyone vote against our Founders' vision,  placing power in the hands  [[Page H8044]]  of the people? How could anyone vote against their own constituents,  allowing radical politicians to rip away their say in our democracy?   Decades after Lincoln's stark warning, the future he foretold, a  crumbling of the pillars of democracy, came to pass with a Civil War.  One year into the horror and devastation, President Lincoln called on  the Congress to come together to save the Union.   In his message, he wrote--this is when he is President--``We shall  nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of Earth.'' We ``hold  the power and bear the responsibility.''   Today, American democracy, ``the last best hope of Earth,'' is again  in grave danger, and its fate is in our hands.   So, I implore every Member to heed Lincoln's words, to stand up for  the rule of law and our Constitution. In doing so, we pass on a vibrant  democracy for generations to come--America, the beacon of hope in the  world; this building, a symbol, a temple of democracy, synonymous with  freedom and democracy throughout the world, which was assaulted, but we  must correct it.   Madam Speaker, I urge a resounding bipartisan ``aye'' vote on the  Presidential Election Reform Act.   In gratitude to Madam Chair Zoe Lofgren, chair of the House  Administration Committee and a member of the January 6th Committee, and  our very distinguished vice chair of the January 6th Committee, thank  you for your patriotism. Thank you for your leadership. Thank you for  your courage.   Madam Speaker, I urge an ``aye'' vote.
