 Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the budget  scorekeeping report for November 2018. The report compares current-law  levels of spending and revenues with the amounts the Senate agreed to  in the budget resolution for fiscal year 2018, H. Con. Res. 71, and the  Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, BBA18. This information is necessary for  the Senate Budget Committee to determine whether budgetary points of  order lie against pending legislation. The Republican staff of the  Budget Committee and the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, prepared  this report pursuant to section 308(b) of the Congressional Budget Act,  CBA.   This is my sixth scorekeeping report this year. My last filing can be  found in the Congressional Record for July 18, 2018. The information  included in this report is current through November 13, 2018.   Budget Committee Republican staff prepared Tables 1-6.   Table 1 gives the amount by which each Senate authorizing committee  exceeds or is below its allocation for budget authority and outlays  under the most recently adopted budget resolution and the fiscal year  2019 enforceable levels filing. This information is used for enforcing  committee allocations pursuant to section 302 of the CBA. For this  reporting period, 10 of the 16 authorizing committees are not in  compliance with their allocations. The six committees that are fully  compliant with their allocations are the committees on Armed Services,  Foreign Relations, Rules and Administration, Intelligence, Indian  Affairs, and Small Business and Entrepreneurship. The aggregate 10-year  reduction in budget authority shown in table 1 is largely the product  of savings that are generated at the end of the enforcement window  through changes to customs user fees, Miscellaneous Tariff Bill Act of  2018, P.L. 115-239; Orrin G. Hatch Music Modernization Act, P.L. 115- 264, or from the sale of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve,  America's Water Infrastructure Act of 2018, P.L. 115-270.   Tables 2-3 give the amount by which the Senate Committee on  Appropriations is below or exceeds the statutory spending limits. This  information is used to determine points of order related to the  spending caps found in sections 312 and 314 of the CBA. Appropriations  for fiscal year 2018, shown in table 2, are consistent with the  statutory limits. Table 3 shows that the Appropriations Committee is  currently compliant with spending limits for fiscal year 2019.  Currently, seven Appropriations subcommittees are operating under a  continuing resolution, the Department of Defense and Labor, Health and  Human Services, and Education  [[Page S7038]]  Appropriations Act, 2019 and Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019 (P.L.  115-245).   The fiscal year 2018 budget resolution contained points of order  limiting the use of changes in mandatory programs in appropriations  bills, CHIMPs. Tables 4, 5, and 6 track compliance with these points of  order. Tables 4 and 6 show compliance with fiscal year 2018 limits for  overall CHIMPs, $17 billion, and the Crime Victims Fund CHIMP, $11.2  billion, respectively. Table 5, which tracks the CHIMP limit of $15  billion for fiscal year 2019, shows the Appropriations Committee has  enacted $7.7 billion worth of full-year CHIMPs for fiscal year 2019.  The fiscal year 2019 CHIMPs were contained in the Labor, Health and  Human Services, Education and Related Agencies division of P.L. 115- 245. This information is used for determining points of order under  sections 4102, overall limit, and 4103, Crime Victims Fund CHIMP, of H.  Con. Res. 71.   In addition to the tables provided by Budget Committee Republican  staff, I am submitting CBO tables, which I will use to enforce budget  totals approved by Congress.   Because legislation may still be enacted that would have an effect on  fiscal year 2018, CBO provided a report for both fiscal year 2018 and  2019. This information is used to enforce aggregate spending and  revenue levels in the budget resolution under section 311 of the CBA.  CBO's estimates show that current-law levels of spending for fiscal  year 2018 exceed the amounts in last year's budget resolution by $157.4  billion in budget authority and $106.3 billion in outlays. Revenues are  $3.2 billion above the revenue floor for fiscal year 2018 set by the  budget resolution. Social Security outlays are at the levels assumed by  the resolution, while Social Security revenues are $446 million below  these levels.   For fiscal year 2019, CBO annualizes the effects of the current  continuing resolution, P.L. 115-245, which provides funding through  December 7, 2018. For the enforcement of budgetary aggregates, the  Budget Committee historically excludes this temporary funding. As such,  the current-law levels are $307.9 billion and $198.1 billion below  enforceable levels for budget authority and outlays, respectively.  Revenues are $309 million below the level assumed in the budget  resolution. Further, Social Security revenues are at the levels assumed  for fiscal year 2019, while Social Security outlays are $2 million  above assumed levels for the budget year.   CBO's report also provides information needed to enforce the Senate  pay-as-you-go, PAYGO, rule. The PAYGO scorecard shows deficit increases  in fiscal year 2019 of $377 million, $309 million revenue loss, $68  million outlay increase, over the fiscal year 2018-2023 period of  $1,101 million, $698 million revenue loss, $403 million outlay  increase, and over the fiscal year 2018-2028 period of $105 million,  $689 million revenue loss, $584 million outlay decrease. Excluded from  these figures are the budgetary effects of two direct spending and  revenue bills: the VA Mission Act of 2018, P.L. 115-182, and the  Support for Patients and Communities Act, P.L. 115-271. The exclusion  of these budgetary effects is the result of the statutory inclusion of  explicit directions to exclude the effects from the Senate's PAYGO  scorecard. The Senate's PAYGO rule is enforced by section 4106 of H.  Con. Res. 71.   Also included in this submission is a table tracking the Senate's  budget enforcement activity on the floor since the May 7 enforcement  filing. Since my last report, one point of order was raised against a  CHIMP provision in the Labor-HHS division of H.R. 6157 during its  initial Senate consideration. Pursuant to section 314 of S. Con. Res.  70, the fiscal year 2009 budget resolution, I raised a point of order  against a $390 million Pell grant provision. The point of order was  waived by a vote of 68-24.   All years in the accompanying tables are fiscal years.   I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying tables be printed in  the Record.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:   TABLE 1.--SENATE AUTHORIZING COMMITTEES--ENACTED DIRECT SPENDING ABOVE                    (+) OR BELOW (-) BUDGET RESOLUTIONS                         [In millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                   2018      2019    2019-2023  2019-2028 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Agriculture, Nutrition, and  Forestry     Budget Authority..........        47         0          0          0     Outlays...................        47         0          0          0 Armed Services     Budget Authority..........       -33         0          0          0     Outlays...................       -24         0          0          0 Banking, Housing, and Urban  Affairs     Budget Authority..........         0        21        285        382     Outlays...................         0        20        285        382 Commerce, Science, and  Transportation     Budget Authority..........         0         1         38         86     Outlays...................         0         1         35         85 Energy and Natural Resources     Budget Authority..........       220         0          0         -3     Outlays...................       198         0          0         -3 Environment and Public Works     Budget Authority..........         0         2          4       -333     Outlays...................         0         2          4       -333 Finance     Budget Authority..........    21,971       206        991       -919     Outlays...................     5,211       119        988       -919 Foreign Relations     Budget Authority..........         0         0         -5        -20     Outlays...................         0         0         -5        -20 Homeland Security and  Governmental Affairs     Budget Authority..........         0         0          2          4     Outlays...................         0        43         48         49 Judiciary     Budget Authority..........         0         0         76        156     Outlays...................         0         0         72        151 Health, Education, Labor, and  Pensions     Budget Authority..........       705         0        -36        -84     Outlays...................       205         0        -36        -84 Rules and Administration     Budget Authority..........         0         0          0          0     Outlays...................         0         0          0          0 Intelligence     Budget Authority..........         0         0          0          0     Outlays...................         0         0          0          0 Veterans' Affairs     Budget Authority..........     7,300         4          3       -729     Outlays...................     1,850     4,402      4,400      3,668 Indian Affairs     Budget Authority..........         0         0          0          0     Outlays...................         0         0          0          0 Small Business     Budget Authority..........         0         0          0          0     Outlays...................         0         0          0          0                                -----------------------------------------     Total         Budget Authority......    30,210       234      1,358     -1,460         Outlays...............     7,487     4,587      5,791      2,976 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   TABLE 2.--SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE--ENACTED REGULAR DISCRETIONARY                             APPROPRIATIONS\1\                [Budget authority, in millions of dollars] ------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                       2018                                        ---------------------------------                                            Security2       Nonsecurity2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Statutory Discretionary Limits........          629,000          579,000             Amount Provided by Senate Appropriations Subcommittee   Agriculture, Rural Development, and                   0           23,259  Related Agencies.....................

Hon. Mike Enzi,      Chairman, Committee on the Budget,      U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of       Congressional action on the fiscal year 2018 budget and is       current through the end of fiscal year 2018. This report is       submitted under section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of       the Congressional Budget Act, as amended.        The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues       are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of       H. Con. Res. 71, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for       Fiscal Year 2018.        Since our last letter dated July 18, 2018, the Congress has       not cleared any legislation for the President's signature       that affects budget authority, outlays, or revenues in fiscal       year 2018.            Sincerely,                                                        Keith Hall,                                                          Director.        Enclosure.

Colmery Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-48); a   joint resolution compact relating to the establishment of the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission (P.L. 115-   54); the Continuing Appropriations Act, 2018 and Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements   Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-56); the Emergency Aid to American Survivors of Hurricanes Irma and Jose Overseas Act   (P.L. 115-57); the Department of Veterans Affairs Expiring Authorities Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-62); the Disaster   Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-63); the Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria   Education Relief Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-64); and the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief   Requirements Act, 2017 (P.L. 115-72). bEmergency funding that was not designated as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the   Deficit Control Act does not count for certain budgetary enforcement purposes These amounts, which are not   included in the current level totals, are as follows:                                                                         Budget                                                                   Authority         Outlays          Revenues     Disaster Tax Relief and Airport and Airway Extension Act of   -------------263--------------263----------------0  2017 (P.L. 115-63)..........................................

Division A, Subdivision 2 of   Division B, and Divisions C-F contain authorizing legislation, of which the budgetary effects of Subdivision 2   of Division B were designated as being for emergency requirements: Subdivisions 1 and 3 of Division B contain   appropriation legislation. Subdivision 1 provided supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2018 for   disaster relief and designated those amounts as being for emergency requirements, and section 158 of   Subdivision 3 provided authority for the duration of fiscal year 2018, for the Secretary of Energy to draw   down and sell crude oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Division G of P.L. 115-123 provided for the   budgetary treatment of Divisions A-F. dPursuant to section 232(b) of H.C. Res. 290 (106th Congress), the Concurrent Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year   2001, the budgetary effects related to the Federal Reserve's surplus funds are excluded. As a result, the   amounts shown do not include estimated increases in revenues of $2,450 million in fiscal year 2018, $2,180   million over the 2018-2022 period, and $1,750 million over the 2018-2027 period. eSections 540-543 of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act, 2017 (Division F of P.L. 115-31),   extended several immigration programs through the end of fiscal year 2017. Several continuing resolutions   continued those authorities through March 23, 2018, and sections 202-205 of title II of Division M of P.L. 115-   141 further extended those programs through 2018. CBO estimates that extending those authorities for the   entirety of fiscal year 2018 will increase on-budget direct spending by $5 million in fiscal year 2018, $27   million over the 2018-2022 period, and $53 million over the 2018-2027 period. In addition, CBO estimates that   extending those authorities will decrease off-budget direct spending by $1 million over the 2018-2022 period   and by $7 million over the 2022-2027 period Further, CBO estimates that continuing those authorities will   increase revenues by $2 million over the 2018-2022 period and by $7 million over the 2018-2027 period.   Consistent with the budgetary treatment of Divisions K-V of P.L. 115-141, the budgetary effects of extending   the immigration programs through March 23, 2018, are charged to the Appropriations Committee; the effects of   extending the programs for the remainder of fiscal year 2018 are charged to the relevant authorizing   committees. fPursuant to sections 1001-1004 of the 21st Century Cures Act (P.L. 114-255), certain funding provided to the   Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)--in particular the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the   National Institutes of Health (NIH)--in 2017 through 2026 shall not count for the purposes of complying with   provisions of the Deficit Control Act or the Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974. As a   result, the amounts shown do not include $1,056 million in budget authority or $770 million in associated   outlays in fiscal year 2018, specifically, $60 million in budget authority and $22 million in outlays for the   FDA; and $996 million in budget authority and $748 million in outlays for HHS, which includes $500 million in   budget authority for state responses to the opioid abuse crisis and $496 million for NIH. gSection 255 of the Departments of Labor, Health, and Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies   Appropriations Act, 2018 (Division H of P.L. 115-141), delayed implementation of the recommendations of the   United States Preventive Services Task Force with respect to breast cancer screening, mammography, and   prevention. CBO estimates that the delay will increase direct spending (budget authority and outlays) by $14   million in fiscal year 2019 and by $6 million in fiscal year 2020. In addition, CBO estimates that section 225   will decrease revenues by $23 million in fiscal year 2019 (of which $6 million will be off-budget) and will   decrease revenues by $9 million in fiscal year 2020 (of which $2 million will be off-budget). hFor purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as   approved by the Senate, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a   result, current level does not include these items. iPeriodically, the Senate Committee on the Budget revises the budgetary levels in H. Con. Res. 71, pursuant to   various provisions of the resolution. The total for the Initial Senate Resolution shown below excludes $47,660   million in budget authority, $22,467 million in outlays, and $150,003 million in revenues assumed in H. Con.   Res. 71 for discretionary spending not constrained by the budgetary caps established by the Budget Control Act   of 2011 (P.L. 112-25) and subsequently amended, including spending that qualifies for adjustments pursuant to   section 4205 of H. Con. Res. 71.

Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of       Congressional action on the fiscal year 2019 budget and is       current through November 13, 2018.

Therefore, the amounts shown in this report do not include   $771 million in budget authority, and $767 million in estimated outlays. bFor purposes of enforcing section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act in the Senate, the resolution, as   approved by the Senate, does not include budget authority, outlays, or revenues for off-budget amounts. As a   result, current level does not include those items. cPursuant to section 232(b) of H.C. Res. 290 (106th Congress), the Concurrent Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year   2001, the budgetary effects related to the Federal Reserve's surplus funds are excluded. As a result, the   amounts shown do not include estimated increases in revenues of $655 million in fiscal year 2019, $570 million   over the 2019-2023 period, and $454 million over the 2019-2028 period. dDivision I of P.L. 115-254 provided $1.68 billion in supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2019, and   designated those amounts as being for emergency requirements pursuant to section 251 of the Deficit Control   Act. In general, the budgetary effects of authorizing legislation are recorded as direct spending or revenue.   However, consistent with the language in Division I, and at the direction of the Senate Committee on the   Budget, those budgetary effects are classified as discretionary spending. eSection 30103 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 required--in the absence of a concurrent resolution on the   budget for fiscal year 2019--that the Chair of the Senate Committee on the Budget publish the aggregate   spending and revenue levels for fiscal year 2019; those aggregate levels were first published in the   Congressional Record on May 7, 2018. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 also allows the Chair of the Senate   Committee on the Budget to revise the budgetary aggregates:                                                                         Budget                                                                   Authority         Outlays          Revenues ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Original Aggregates Printed on May 7, 2018:..................        3,547,094        3,508,052        2,590,496 Revisions:     Pursuant to sections 311 and 314(a) of the Congressional               921                0                0      Budget Act of 1974......................................
