 For the information of all colleagues, we will take a  break about 2 hours in.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Pursuant to the provisions of S. Res. 483, the  Senate has provided up to 4 hours of argument by the parties, equally  divided, on the question of whether or not it shall be in order to  consider and debate under the impeachment rules any motion to subpoena  witnesses or documents.   Mr. Manager Schiff, are you a proponent or opponent?   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Proponent.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Cipollone, are you a proponent or opponent?    Mr. Chief Justice, I request that the Senate take a  15-minute recess.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, so ordered.   There being no objection, at 2:49 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, recessed until 3:40 p.m.; whereupon the Senate  reassembled when called to order by the Chief Justice.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        On page S761, January 31, 2020, third column, the following  appears:  Mr. Chief Justice, I request that the  Senate take a 15- minute recess. There being no objection, at 2:49  p.m., the Senate, sitting as a Court of Impeachment, recessed  until 3:40 p.m.; whereupon the Senate reassembled when called to  order by the CHIEF JUSTICE.      The online Record has been corrected to read:  Mr.  Chief Justice, I request that the Senate take a 15- minute recess.  The CHIEF JUSTICE. Without objection, so ordered. There being no  objection, at 2:49 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a Court of  Impeachment, recessed until 3:40 p.m.; whereupon the Senate  reassembled when called to order by the CHIEF JUSTICE.    ========================= END NOTE =========================      The CHIEF JUSTICE. Please be seated.   We are ready to hear the presentation from counsel for the President.   Mr. Counsel PHILBIN. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, the  House managers have said throughout their presentation and throughout  all of the proceedings here again and again that you can't have a trial  without witnesses and documents, as if it is just that simple. If you  are going to have a trial, there have to be new witnesses and  documents. But it is not that simple. It is really a trope that is  being used to disguise the real issues, the real decisions that you  would be making on this decision about witnesses, because there is a  lot more at stake. Let me unpack that and explain what is really at  stake there.   The first is this idea that, if you come to trial, you have to always  go to witnesses, have new witnesses come in, but that is not true. In  every legal system and in our legal systems on both the civil and  criminal sides, there is a way to decide right up front, in some quick  way, whether there is really a triable issue, whether you really need  [[Page S762]]  to go to all the trouble of calling in new witnesses and having more  evidence in something like that. There is not here. There is no need  for that because these Articles of Impeachment, on their face, are  defective, and we have explained that. Let me start with the second  article, the obstruction charge.   We have explained that that charge is really trying to say that it is  an impeachable offense for the President to defend the separation of  powers. That can't be right. It is also the case that no witnesses are  going to say anything that makes any difference to the second Article  of Impeachment. That all has to do with the validity of the grounds the  President asserted, the fact that he asserted longstanding  constitutional prerogatives of the executive branch in specific ways to  resist specific deficiencies in the subpoenas that were issued. No fact  witness is going to come in and say anything that relates in any way to  that. It is not going to make any difference.   On the first Article of Impeachment, that, too, is defective on its  face. We have explained. We heard it again today here. They have this  subjective theory of impeachment that will show abuse of power by  focusing just on the President's subjective motives, and they said  again today, here, that the way they can show the President did  something wrong is that he defied the foreign policy of the United  States. I talked about that before, this theory that he defied the  agencies within the executive branch. He wasn't following the policy of  the executive branch. That is not a constitutionally coherent  statement.   The theory of abuse of power that they have framed in the first  Article of Impeachment will do grave damage to the separation of powers  under our Constitution because it would become so malleable that they  could pour into it anything they want to find illicit motives for some  perfectly permissible action. It becomes so malleable that it is no  different than maladministration--the exact ground that the Framers  rejected during the Constitutional Convention.   The Constitution defines specific offenses. It limits and constrains  the impeachment power.   Now, there is also the fact that we actually heard from a lot of  witnesses. We have heard from a lot of witnesses in the proceedings so  far. You have heard 192 video clips, by our count, from 13 different  witnesses. There were 17 witnesses deposed in closed hearings in the  House, and 12 of them testified again in open hearings. You have got  all of those transcripts, so you can see the witnesses' testimony  there. The key portions have been played for you on the screens. And  you have got over 28,000 pages of documents and transcripts. You have  got a lot of evidence already.   But there is another principle that they overlook when they say  ``Well, if you are going to have a trial, there just has to be  witnesses,'' as if the most ordinary thing is you get to trial and then  start subpoenaing new witnesses and documents. That is not true either,  and we pointed this out.   In the regular courts, the way things work is you have got to do a  lot of work preparing a trial--called discovery--to find out about  witnesses and depose them and find out about documents before you get  to trial. You can't show up the day of trial and say: Oh, Your Honor,  actually, we are not ready. We didn't subpoena John Bolton or witness X  or witness Y, and now we want to subpoena that witness. Now we want to  do discovery.   And why does that matter here? Because here, to show up not having  done the work and to expect that work to be done in the Senate, by this  body, has grave consequences for the institutional interests of this  body, and it sets a precedent--really sets an important precedent for  two bodies--for the Senate and for the House--because what the Senate  accepts as an impeachment coming from the House determines not just  precedent for the Senate but, really, precedent for the House in the  future as well.   If the procedures used in the House to bring this proceeding here to  this stage are accepted, if the Senate says ``Yes, we will start  calling new witnesses because you didn't get the job done in whatever  process you used to get it here,'' then that becomes the new normal.  And that is important in a couple of ways.   One is, as we have pointed out, the totally unprecedented process  that was used in the House that violated all notions of due process.  There are precedents going back 150 years in the House, ensuring that  someone accused in an impeachment hearing in the House has due process  rights to be represented by counsel, to cross-examine witnesses, to be  able to present evidence. They didn't allow the President to do that,  and if this body says that is OK, then that becomes the new normal.   And they stand up here, the House managers, and say this body will be  unfair if this body doesn't call the witnesses. They talk about  fairness. Where was the fairness in that proceeding in the House?   And Manager Schiff says that things would be arbitrary if you don't  do what they said and call the witnesses they want. Well, wasn't it  arbitrary in the House when they wouldn't allow the President to be  represented by counsel, wouldn't allow the President to call witnesses?  There was no precedent in a Presidential impeachment inquiry to have  open hearings where the President and his counsel were excluded.   It also would set a precedent to allow a package, a proceeding, from  the House to come here that the House managers say ``Well, now we need  new witnesses; we haven't done all the work,'' and it is witnesses they  didn't even try to get. They didn't subpoena John Bolton, and they  didn't go through the process. When other witnesses were subpoenaed-- when Dr. Kupperman--Charlie Kupperman--went to court, they withdrew the  subpoena. And now to say that ``Well, fairness demands that this body  has to do all that work''--that sets a new precedent, as well, and it  changes--it would change for all of the future the relationship between  the House and the Senate in impeachment inquiries. It would mean that  the Senate has to become the investigatory body.   And the principles that they assert--they did a process that wasn't  fair. They did a process that was arbitrary, that arbitrarily denied  the President rights. They did a process that wouldn't allow witnesses,  and then they came here on the first night--remember when we were all  here until 2 o'clock--and in very belligerent terms said to the Members  of this body: You are on trial. It will be treachery if you don't do  what the House managers say.   That is not right. When it was their errors, when they were arbitrary  and they didn't provide fairness, they can't project that onto this  body to try to say that you have to make up for their errors, and if  you don't, the fault lies here.   Now, they also suggest that it is not going to take a long time, that  they only want a few witnesses. But, of course, if things are opened up  to witnesses and it is going to be fair, it is not just one side; it is  not just the witnesses that they would want. The President would have  to be permitted to have witnesses.   And with all respect, Mr. Chief Justice, the idea that if a subpoena  is sent to a senior adviser to the President and the President  determines that he will stand by the principle of immunity that has  been asserted by virtually every President since Nixon, that that will  just be resolved by the Senate right here, whether or not that  privilege exists, by the Chief Justice sitting as the Presiding  Officer--that doesn't make sense. That is not the way it works.   The Senate, even when the Chief Justice is the Presiding Officer  here, can't unilaterally decide the privileges of the executive branch.  That dispute would have to be resolved in another way, and it could  involve litigation, and it could take a lot of time.   So the idea that this will all be done quickly if everyone just does  what the House managers say is not realistic. It is not the way that  the process would actually have to play out in accord with the  Constitution, and that has another significant consequence, again  affecting this institution as a precedent going forward because what it  suggests--the new normal that would be created then--is kind of an  express path for precisely the sort of impeachment that the Framers  most feared.    The Framers recognized that impeachments could be done for  illegitimate reasons. They recognized that  [[Page S763]]  there could be partisan impeachments. And if this is the new normal,  this is the very epitome of a partisan impeachment. There was  bipartisan opposition to it in the House, and it was rushed through  with unfair procedures--78 days total of inquiry. Think about that. In  Nixon there had been investigating committees, and there was a special  prosecutor long before the House Judiciary Committee started its  investigation.   In Clinton there was a special counsel--an independent counsel for  the better part of a year before the House Judiciary Committee even  started hearings.   Everything from start to finish in this case, from September 24 until  the Articles of Impeachment were considered in the Judiciary Committee,  was done in 78 days--in 78 days--and for 71 of them, the President was  entirely locked out.   So the new normal would be slapdash: Get it done quickly, unfair  procedures in the House to impeach a President; then bring it to the  Senate, and then all the real work of investigation and discovery is  going to have to take place with that impeachment hanging over the  President's head, and that is a particular thing the Framers also were  concerned about. I mentioned this the other day.   In Federalist No. 65 Hamilton warned specifically about what he  called--I am quoting--``the injury to the innocent, from the  procrastinated determination of the charges which might be brought  against them'' because he understood that if an impeachment charge from  the House wasn't resolved quickly, if it was hanging over the  President's head, that in itself would be a problem. And that is why  they structured the impeachment process so that the Senate could be  able to swiftly determine impeachments that were brought. That also  suggests that is why there is a system for having thorough  investigations, a thorough process done in the House.   And Hamilton explained that delay after the impeachment would afford  an opportunity for ``intrigue and corruption,'' and it would also be,  as he put it, ``the detriment to the State, from the prolonged inaction  of men whose firm and faithful execution of their duty might have  exposed them to the persecution of an intemperate or designing majority  in the House of Representatives.'' And that is what has happened here.   And if you create a system now that makes the new normal a half- baked, slapdash process in the House--just get the impeachment done and  get it over to the Senate--and then once the President is impeached and  you have the head of the executive branch, the leader of the free  world, having something like that hanging over his head, then we will  slow everything down, and then we will start doing the investigation  and just drag it out. That is all part of what makes this even more  political, especially in an election year.   It is not the process that the Framers had in mind, and it is not  something the Senate should condone in this case. The Senate is not  here to do the investigatory work that the House didn't do.   Where there has been a process that denied all due process, that  produced a record that can't be relied upon, the reaction from this  body should be to reject the Articles of Impeachment, not to condone  and put its imprimatur on the way the proceedings were handled in the  House and not to prolong matters further by trying to redo work that  the House failed to do by not seeking evidence and not doing a fair and  legitimate process to bring the Articles of Impeachment here.   Thank you.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Mr. Sekulow.   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the Senate, over a  7-day period you did hear evidence. You heard evidence from 13  different witnesses, 192 video clips, and as my colleague the Deputy  White House Counsel said, over 28,000 pages of documents.   You heard testimony from Gordon Sondland. He is the United States  Ambassador to the European Union. You heard that testimony. He  testified in the House proceedings. I did not have an opportunity to  cross-examine him. If we get witnesses, I have to have that  opportunity.   William Taylor, former Acting United States Ambassador to Ukraine,  testified. You heard his testimony. We didn't get the opportunity to  cross-examine him. He would be called.   Tim Morrison, the former senior director for Europe and Russia of the  National Security Council. You saw his testimony. They put it up. We  didn't get an opportunity--we did not have an opportunity to cross- examine him.   Jennifer Williams, special adviser on Europe and Russia for Vice  President Mike Pence. You saw her testimony. They put it up. I did not  have the opportunity to cross-examine her. If we call witnesses, we  would have to have that opportunity.   David Holmes, political counsel to the United States Embassy in  Ukraine. You saw testimony from him. We were not able to cross-examine  him. If he is called or if we get witnesses, we will call the  Ambassador, and we will cross-examine.   LTC Alexander Vindman. You saw his testimony. He appeared before the  House. We didn't have the opportunity to cross-examine him. If we call  witnesses, we will, of course, have that right to cross-examine him.   Fiona Hill. She is the former senior director for Europe and Russia  on the National Security Council. She testified for the House. If we  have witnesses, we have the opportunity to call her then and cross- examine Fiona Hill.   Kurt Volker, former United States Representative for Ukraine  Negotiations. They called him; we did not have the opportunity to  cross-examine. If we are calling witnesses--these are witnesses you  have heard from--we would have the right to call witnesses and to  cross-examine Mr. Volker. George Kent, the Deputy Assistant Secretary  of State for the Bureau of European and Eurasian Affairs, you saw his  testimony. They called him. If we have witnesses, we have the right to  call that witness and to cross-examine Deputy Assistant Secretary Kent.    The former United States Ambassador to Ukraine, Ambassador  Yovanovitch, they called her. You saw that testimony. We did not have  the opportunity to cross-examine her. If we have witnesses, we would  have to call her.   Laura Cooper, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Russia,  Ukraine, and Eurasia, they called her. You saw her witness testimony  right here. We did not have the opportunity to cross-examine her. We  would have to be given that opportunity.   These are the witnesses against the President. Laura Cooper, Deputy  Secretary of Defense for Russia and Eurasia--again, the same thing.   David Hale, the Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs. He  was called by the House. You saw his testimony. We never had the  opportunity to cross-examine him. If we have witnesses, we have to have  the opportunity to do that.   There were other witnesses that were called where you saw their  testimony or heard their testimony or it was referred to. Catherine  Croft, Special Adviser for Ukraine negotiation, Department of State;  Mark Sandy, the Deputy Associate Director for National Security  Programs; and Christopher Anderson, Special Adviser for Ukraine  Negotiations, Department of State--you heard their testimony referred  to. We did not have the opportunity to cross-examine them.   So this isn't going to happen, if witnesses are called in a week.  Now, that is just the witnesses that have been produced that you have  seen by the House managers.   You are being called upon to make consequential constitutional  decisions--consequential decisions for our Constitution. We talked  about the burden of proof. I said this before, and I will say it again.  Thirty-one times the managers said they proved their case. Twenty-nine  times they said the evidence was overwhelming. Manager Nadler--he  didn't only say it was overwhelming in his view, on page 739 of the  Congressional Record, he is very clear. He says not only is it strong,  there is no doubt. That is what he said. ``The one thing the House  managers think the President counsel got right is quoting me''--talking  about Mr. Nadler, Manager Nadler--``as saying `beyond any doubt.' It  is, indeed, beyond any doubt.''   Now, of course, we think that they have not proven their case by any  stretch of any proper constitutional analysis.   In the Clinton investigation, they talk about witnesses being called,  but  [[Page S764]]  the three witnesses that were called had either testified before the  grand jury or before the House committee. There weren't new witnesses.  What Mr. Philbin said is correct; that under our constitutional design,  they are supposed to investigate; you are to deliberate. But what they  are asking you to do is now become the investigative agency, the  investigative body.   If they needed all this additional evidence, which they said they  don't need--and, by the way, not only did they say it in the Record,  this is House Manager Nadler when he was on CNN back on the 15th of  this month: ``We brought the articles of impeachment. Because, despite  the fact that we didn't hear from many witnesses we [could] have heard  from, we heard from enough witnesses to prove the case beyond any doubt  at all.''   The same can be said from Representative Lofgren:         You know, we have evidence proving the case through, for       example, at the meeting when Bolton said it was a drug deal,       well, we have fact witnesses. Hill was there, Vindman was       there, Sondland was there.    So this idea that they haven't had witnesses, that is the smoke  screen. You have heard from a lot of witnesses. The problem with the  case, the problem with their position is, even with all of those  witnesses, it doesn't prove up an impeachable offense. The articles  fail.   I think it is very dangerous if the House runs up--which they did-- Articles of Impeachment quickly, so quickly that they are clamoring for  evidence, despite the fact that they put all of this evidence forward.  They got their wish of an impeachment by Christmas. That was the goal.  But now they want you to do the work they failed to do.   But, as I said, time and time again we heard: You didn't hear from  witnesses. You didn't hear from many witnesses. Mr. Schiff modified  that a little bit today, a little bit. You heard from a lot of  witnesses. But if we go down the road of witnesses, this is not a 1- week process. Remember, I talked about the waving the wand and  Ukrainian corruption was gone? You are not going to have a witness wand  here, where, OK, you got a week to do this and get it done. There is no  way that would be proper under due process. But, you know, due process  is supposed to be for the person accused, and they are turning it on  its head. They brought the articles before you. They are the ones that  rushed the case up and then held it before you could actually start  proceeding, but they are the ones who passed the articles before  Christmas.   You know, we talked a lot about the court system and the fact that  they were seeking witnesses, and when it got close to actually having a  court proceeding, they decided that they didn't want to have that  witness go through that proceeding, and they actually withdrew the  subpoena to move the case out.   How many constitutional challenges will we have in this body because  they placed the burden on you that they would not take themselves in  putting their case forward? If we look at our constitutional framework  and our constitutional structure, that is not the way it is supposed to  work.   Now, our opposition to this motion is rather straightforward, as I  have said. We came here ready to try the case on the record that they  presented, the record that the managers told us was overwhelming and  complete.    Mr. Schiff went through every sentence of the Articles of Impeachment  just a few days ago and said: Proved, proved, proved. But the problem  is that what is proved, proved, proved is not an impeachable offense.  You could have witnesses that prove a lot of things, but if there is  not a violation of the law, if it doesn't meet the constitutional  required process, the constitutional required substantive issues of do  these articles--these allegations rise to the level sufficient for a  removal of office for a duly elected President of the United States? It  doesn't and especially so--especially so--when we are in an election  year.   I am not going to take the time--your time, which is precious, to go  over each and every allegation about witnesses that I can. I could do  it. I could stand here for a long time. I am not going to do that. I am  just going to say this: They created the record. Do not allow them to  penalize the country and the Constitution because they failed to do  their job.   With that Mr. Chief Justice, we yield our time.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, counsel.   The House managers have 30 minutes remaining.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, Senators: I want to  walk through some of the arguments that you just heard from the  President's counsel.   The first argument was made by Mr. Philbin. Mr. Philbin began by  saying the House managers assert that you can't have a trial without  witnesses, and he said: ``It's not that simple.'' Actually, it is. It  is pretty simple. It is pretty simple. In every courthouse, in every  State, in every county in the country, where they have trials, they  have witnesses. And I think you heard Mr. Philbin tie himself into  knots as to why this should be the first trial in which witnesses are  not necessary. But, you know, some things are just as simple as they  appear. A trial without witnesses is simply not a trial. You could call  it something else, but it is not a trial.   Now, Mr. Sekulow said something very interesting. He said: The House  investigates, and the Senate deliberates. Well, he would rewrite our  Constitution with that argument because the last time I checked the  Constitution, it said that the House shall have the sole power of  impeachment, and the Senate shall try the impeachment, not merely  deliberate about it, not merely think about it, not merely wonder about  it. I know you are the greatest deliberative body in the world, but not  even you can deliberate in a trial without witnesses. But Mr. Sekulow  would rewrite the Constitution: Your job is not to try the case, he  says; your job is merely to deliberate. That is not what the Founders  had in mind--not by a long shot.   Now, Mr. Philbin says none of these witnesses would have relevance on  article II--I guess conceding that they would have relevant evidence  under article I. But that is not true either. Imagine what you will see  when you hear from the witnesses who ran the Office of Management and  Budget or imagine what you will see when you read the documents from  the Office of Management and Budget. What you will see is what they  have covered up. What you will see is the motive for their complete  obstruction of Congress. When you see not the redacted emails, not the  fully blacked-out emails that they deigned to give in the litigation  and Freedom of Information Act, but when you see what is under those  redactions, you will have proof of motive. When you see those  documents, you will see just how fallacious these nonassertions of  executive privilege are. You will see, in essence, what they have  covered up. It could not be more relevant to whether their panoply of  legal argumentation to justify ``we shall fight all subpoenas'' is  merely a coverup in a legal window dressing. So these witnesses and  documents are critical on both articles.   Now, you also heard Mr. Philbin argue--and, again, this is where we  expected we would be at the end of the proceeding, which is,  essentially, they proved their case. They proved their case. We pretty  much all know what has gone on here. We all understand just what this  President did. No one really disputes that anymore. So what? So what?  It is a version of the Dershowitz defense. So what? The President can  do no wrong. The President is the State. If the President believes that  corrupt conduct would help him get reelected, if he believes shaking  down an ally and withholding military aid, if he believes soliciting  foreign interference in our election, whether it be from the Ukrainians  or the Russians or the Israeli Prime Minister or anyone else in any  form it may take, so what? He has a God-given right to abuse his power,  and there is nothing you can do about it. It is the Dershowitz  principle of constitutional lawlessness. That is the end-all argument  for them. You don't need to hear witnesses who will prove the  President's misconduct because he has a right to be as corrupt as he  chooses under our Constitution, and there is nothing you can do about  it. God help us if that argument succeeds.   Now, they say that these witnesses already testified, and so you  don't need  [[Page S765]]  to hear from anybody. There are witnesses who already testified, so the  House doesn't get to call witnesses in the Senate. That would be like a  criminal trial in any courthouse in America where the defendant, if  he's rich and powerful enough, can say to the judge: Hey, Judge, the  prosecution got to have witnesses in the grand jury. They don't get to  call anyone here. They had their chance in the grand jury. They called  witnesses in the grand jury. They don't get to call witnesses here.   That is not how it works in any courtroom in America, and it is not  how it should work in this courtroom.   Of course, you heard the argument again repeated time and time again:  The House is saying they are not ready for trial. Of course, we never  said we weren't ready for trial. We came here very prepared for trial.  I would submit to you, the President's team came here unprepared for  trial, unprepared for the fact that there would be, as we all  anticipated, a daily drip of new disclosures that would send them back  on their heels. We came here to try a case--prepared to try a case-- and, yes, we had, I hope, the not unreasonable expectation that in  trying that case, like in every courtroom in America, we could call  witnesses. That is not a lack of preparation. That is the presence of  common sense.    They didn't try to get Bolton, they argue. Someone said: They didn't  even try to get Bolton.   Now, of course, we did try to get Bolton, and what he said when he  refused to show up voluntarily is: If you subpoena me, I will sue you.  I will sue you.   He said basically what Don McGahn told us 9 months ago: I will sue  you; good luck with that.   Now, the public argument that was made by his counsel was that he and  Dr. Kupperman, out of, you know, just due diligence, they just want a  court to opine that it is OK for them to come forward and testify. As  soon as the court blesses their testimony, they are more than willing  to come in. They just are going to court to get a court opinion saying  they can do it.   And so, of course, we said to them: If that is your real motivation,  there is a court about to rule on this very issue of absolute immunity.   And very shortly thereafter, that court did. That was the court-- Judge Jackson in the McGahn case--and the judge said that his argument  about absolute immunity--which, yes, Presidents have always dreamed  about and asserted but which has never succeeded in any court in the  land--it was ridiculed in the case of Harriet Miers. It was made short  shrift in the case of Don McGahn, where the judge said: No, we don't  have Kings here. In the 250 years of jurisprudence, there is not a  single case to support the proposition that the President can simply  say that my advisers are absolutely immune from process.   And, of course, in every other nonimpeachment context where the  courts have looked at the issue of a Congress's power to enforce  subpoenas against witnesses or documents, the courts have said the  power to compel compliance with a subpoena is coequal and coextensive  with the power to legislate because you can't do one without the other.  If we can't find out whether the President is breaking the law,  violating the Impoundment Control Act or any other--whether he is  withholding aid that we appropriated for an ally--how can we legislate  a fix to make sure that this never happens again? We can't. If we can't  get answers, we can't legislate.   That is a proposition indicated by every court in the land. And, of  course, in the context of impeachment, the courts have said that is  never more important--never more important.   Now, I don't know why, after saying he would sue us--and we had to  expect that, like Don McGahn, where we are still in court 9 months  later. I don't know why he changed his mind, but I suspect it is for  the reason that if this trial goes forward and he keeps this to  himself, it will be very difficult to explain to the country why he  saved it for the book. When he knew information of direct relevance and  consequence to a decision that you have to make about whether the  President of the United States should be removed from office, it would  be very difficult to explain why that is saved for a book.   Well, I would submit to you, it would be equally difficult for you to  explain as it would be for him. But you can ask him that question: Why  are you willing to testify before the Senate but not the House? And you  should ask him that question.   Now, it was said, and it has the character of ``you should have  fought harder to overcome our obstruction.'' The House should have  fought harder to overcome our stonewalling. Shame on the House for not  fighting harder to overcome our stonewalling. If only they had fought  harder to overcome our stonewalling, maybe they could have gotten these  witnesses earlier.   That is a really hard argument to make while they are stonewalling:  You should have tried harder. You should have taken the years that  would be necessary to overcome our stonewalling.   And the reason why that argument is in such bad faith? As I pointed  out to you yesterday, while they are in this body arguing the House was  derelict, slapdash, they should have fought harder and longer and  endlessly to overcome our stonewalling--while they are making that  argument to you that the House should have fought up and down the  courts from the district to the court of appeals to the Supreme Court  and back again--they are in the courthouse arguing the opposite. They  are in the courthouse saying: Judge, they are trying to enforce a  subpoena on Don McGahn. You need to throw it out. They don't have the  jurisdiction. This is nonjusticiable. You can't hear this case.   That is a really hard argument to make. I credit them for making it  with a straight face, but that is the character of it: You should have  fought harder to overcome our stonewalling and obstruction.   Now, they also say the Chief Justice cannot decide issues of  privilege. No, the Chief Justice can't make those decisions. You need  to let us litigate this up and down the court system.   That is a pretty remarkable argument because the Senate rules allow  the presiding officer to make judgments and to rule on issues of  evidence, materiality, and privilege. That is permitted under your own  rules. We don't need to go up and down the courts. We have got a  perfectly good judge right here.   Now, you heard our proposal yesterday that we take a week--just a  week--to depose the witnesses that we feel are relevant, that they feel  are relevant, and that the Justice rules are relevant--just one week.  Now, they can say that the Constitution requires them to go to court,  but, of course, it doesn't. There is absolutely no constitutional  impediment from these fine lawyers saying: You know, that is eminently  reasonable. We will allow a neutral party, the Chief Justice of the  United States of America, to rule on whether a witness is material or  immaterial, whether they have been called for purposes of probative  evidence or harassment, and whether you are making a proper claim of  privilege or merely trying to hide crime or fraud.   The concern they have is not that the Chief Justice will be unfair,  but rather that he will be fair. But do not make any mistake about it.  Do not let them suggest that there is something constitutionally  impermissible or it would violate the President's rights to allow the  Chief Justice of the United States to make those decisions in this  court, because he is empowered to do so by your rules and by the  Constitution, which gives you the sole power to try impeachments. In  the sole exercise of your power to try impeachments, you can say: We  will allow the Chief Justice to make those decisions.   Now, Mr. Sekulow said that you have heard the testimony of 13  witnesses. And I think the impression is meant to be given, if not to  you--we know otherwise--maybe the people watching at home, that they  must have been in between errands while watching the Senate trial and  missed where those 13 witnesses came before the Senate and testified.   But of course, you heard no live testimony in this body. There wasn't  any live testimony before this body, and I don't recall any of you in  that supersecret basement bunker they have been talking about. Now, I  will admit, there were 100 Members eligible to be there. So maybe I  missed one of you, but I don't think you were there for the live  testimony in the House.   Now, Mr. Sekulow says the President was deprived of his right of  calling  [[Page S766]]  these witnesses himself and cross-examining these witnesses in the  House, but that is not true either because the President was eligible  to call witnesses in his defense in the Judiciary Committee and chose  not to do so. If the President's counsel felt that, you know, Bill  Taylor says that he spoke with Sondland right after this phone call  with the President, and Sondland talked about how the military aid was  conditioned on these investigations, the President wanted Zelensky in a  public box, and I would really like to cross-examine that West Point  grad and Vietnam vet because I don't believe him, you know, they could  have called Bill Taylor in the Judiciary Committee and cross-examined  him, or they could have called Mick Mulvaney and put him under oath and  let him contradict what we know John Bolton would say. But of course,  they didn't do that. No, they said merely: Just get it over with in the  House. For all there, it was too quick, too slapdash. Get it over with  in the House, because, as the President said, when it comes to the  Senate, we will have a real trial where he gets to call witnesses. But  they have changed their tune because now they know what they have  really known all along; which is, that those witnesses would deeply  incriminate this President.   So, instead, they have fallen back on the argument that if we are  going to go down the road to having a real trial, if we are going to go  down the road in having a real trial, we, the President's lawyers, are  going to make you pay. And the form of this argument is: We are going  to call every witness under the Sun. We are going to call every witness  that testified before the House. We are going to call every witness  that we can think of that would help smear the Bidens. We are going to  keep you here until kingdom come. That is essentially the argument that  they are making when Mr. Sekulow says: We are going to bring in Fiona  Hill, and we are going to bring in Tim Morrison, and we are going to  bring in this witness and bring in that witness.   You have the sole power to try this case. You do not have to allow  the President's lawyers to abuse your time or this process. You have  the power to decide: No, we gave each side 24 hours to make their  arguments. We are going to give each side a shared week to call their  witnesses. You have that power. If you didn't, you couldn't have  constricted the amount of time for our argument. You can likewise  determine how much time should be taken with witness testimony.   Now, Mr. Sekulow ended his argument against witnesses with where Mr.  Philbin essentially began. It all comes back to the Dershowitz  principle. What is the point of witnesses if the President can do  whatever he wants under article II? What is the point of calling  witnesses? What is the point of having a trial if the President can do  whatever he wants under article II?   The only constraining principle--and I think that one of the Senators  asked yesterday: What is the limiting principle in the Dershowitz  argument? If a President can corruptly seek foreign interference in his  election because he believes that his election is in the national  interest, then, you cannot impeach him for it, no matter how damaging  it may be to our national security. What is the limiting principle?   And I suppose the limiting principle is only this: It only requires  the President to believe that his reelection is in the national  interest. Well, it would require an extraordinary level of self- reflection and insight for a President of the United States to conclude  that his own reelection was not in the national interest--not  unprecedented, mind you. I think that was the decision that LBJ  ultimately arrived at, but I would not want to consider that a  meaningful limitation on Presidential power, and neither should you.   Finally, counsel expressed some indignance--indignance--that we  should suggest that it is not just the Senate--it is not just the  President, rather, who is on trial here but it is also the Senate; how  dare the House managers suggest that your decision should reflect on  this body. That is just such a calumny.   Well, let me read you a statement made by one of your colleagues.  This is what former U.S. Senator John Warner, a Republican of Virginia,  had to say:         As conscientious citizens from all walks of life are trying       their best to understand the complex impeachment issues now       being deliberated in the U.S. Senate, the rules of evidence       are central to the matter. Should the Senate allow additional       sworn testimony from fact witnesses with firsthand knowledge       and include relevant documents?        As a lifelong Republican and a retired member of the U.S.       Senate, who once served as a juror in a Presidential       impeachment trial, I am mindful of the difficult       responsibilities those currently serving now shoulder. I       believe, as I am sure you do, that not only is the President       on trial, but in many ways, so is the Senate itself. As such,       I am strongly supportive of the efforts of my former       Republican Senate colleagues who are considering that the       Senate accept the introduction of additional evidence that       they deem relevant.        Not long ago Senators of both major parties always worked       to accommodate fellow colleagues with differing points of       view to arrive at outcomes that would best serve the nation's       interests. If witnesses are suppressed in this trial and a       majority of Americans are left believing the trial was a       sham, I can only imagine the lasting damage done to the       Senate, and to our fragile national consensus. The Senate       embraces its legacy and delivers for the American people by       avoiding the risk.        Throughout the long life of our nation, federal and state       judicial systems have largely supported the judicial norms of       evidence, witnesses and relevant documents. I respectfully       urge the Senate to be guided by the rules of evidence and       follow our nation's judicial norms, precedents and       institutions to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law       by welcoming relevant witnesses and documents as part of this       impeachment trial.    That is your colleague, former Senator John Warner.   Senators, there is a storm blowing through this Capitol. Its winds  are strong, and they move us in uncertain and dangerous directions.   Jefferson once said: ``I consider trial by jury as the only anchor .  . . yet imagined by man, by which a government can be held to the  principles of its constitution''--the only anchor yet imagined by man  by which a government can be held to the principles of its  constitution. I would submit to you, remove that anchor, and we are  adrift, but if we hold true, if we have faith that the ship of state  can survive the truth, this storm shall pass.   I yield back.
