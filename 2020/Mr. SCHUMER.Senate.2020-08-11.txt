 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.                            ____________________     Now, Mr. President, America is living through a crisis  that exceeds anything we have seen in generations. Other countries were  able to test their populations, isolate cases, and contain the spread  of the disease, but here the failure of the Trump administration to  develop or implement a national strategy to defeat COVID on the health  front and economically has meant that the disease has raged through our  country for 7 months, is still spreading, and the economy is in very  bad shape.   We have over 5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19. It just took 17  days to go from 4 million Americans with COVID to 5 million.  Unemployment is higher than it ever was during the great recession.  More than 150,000 Americans have died. Small businesses every day are  closing, and those that are still open are struggling. Families can't  afford to feed their children. Americans can't pay the rent and will be  thrown out of their homes. Millions are out of work, and many more  worry that they will be out of work in the month or two to come. This  is a huge crisis.   In this time of national emergency, Democrats believe we must focus  on the health and economic security of the American people. If we don't  address the health crisis, nothing else will matter, but we have to  focus on economic security as well.   We have to keep Americans in their homes, put food on the table,  prevent them from slipping into further hardship and poverty. That is  what animated Democrats to develop a $3.4 trillion plan to finally  crush the virus and rescue American families. It was based on the needs  of our country, both health and economic, the needs of our schools and  businesses and workers and our healthcare system. We Democrats tell  America, We have your back. Unfortunately, our Republican friends do  not.   In our negotiations with the White House, Chief of Staff Meadows and  Secretary Mnuchin were unable to go above $1 trillion, and their $1  trillion was far short of the country's needs. Democrats offered to  come down by $1 trillion. We asked our counterparts--Secretary Mnuchin,  Mr. Meadows--to come up by $1 trillion, meet us in the middle. They  said no.   So last Friday, after our negotiating session with the White House, I  made it clear that the reasons our talks had stalled was that the White  House had basically declared ``my way or the highway.'' They were  unwilling to meet us in the middle. They said that in the room. I guess  imitation is the sincerest form of flattery because now Leader  McConnell is blaming Democrats for the breakdown in negotiations, using  the exact same language. He said Democrats are the ones saying ``my way  or the highway.'' Seriously, that is what the Republican leader, who  wasn't even in the room and will not dare go in the room, claims.   Let's go over the facts--the facts. We said to the White House: We  are willing to come down by $1 trillion. Will you come up by $1  trillion and meet us in the middle? The White House said: No, we are  not budging. So to whom does this logic apply? Who is intransigent? Who  is really saying ``my way or the highway?'' The answer is obvious. This  is not a ``both sides to blame'' situation.   Democrats are willing to compromise. Republicans are being  intransigent and will not move from their position, which is totally  inadequate for the needs of America during the greatest economic crisis  we have had in 75 years and the greatest health crisis in 100. That is  where we are: Democrats willing to move and meet in the middle,  Republicans intransigent. Republicans declared ``my way or the  highway,'' and rather than defend their position, they falsely accuse  Democrats of doing the same.   Now, rather than trying to break the logjam, as a true Presidential  leader should, President Trump sits on the sidelines and just issued a  bunch of weak and unworkable Executive orders. He slashed the enhanced  unemployment benefits, asked the Americans who are out of work, through  no fault of their own, to take a pay cut. He deferred the payroll tax,  which even Republicans admit will do nothing to help our workers and  the economy and would undermine Social Security and Medicare to boot.  And the President's Executive order on evictions is more like an  Executive suggestion. It doesn't  [[Page S5387]]  even guarantee a moratorium on evictions. It merely instructs Federal  agencies to ``review'' or ``consider'' one and does nothing to help  renters actually afford the rent.   Here in Congress, the Senate Republican majority delayed for 4 long  months, failed to come up with a proposal that had the support of their  own caucus, and then gave up and left it for someone else to figure it  out. That is why McConnell is not in the room. Facing the greatest  domestic crisis in the 21st century, where Americans are hurting  healthwise and economically, the Senate Republican majority ran down  the clock, tossed up an air ball, and then subbed themselves out of the  game.   Even now, as Leader McConnell claims that Democrats are blocking  relief, there are 20 Members of the Republican caucus, according to  their own leader, who will not vote for anything--no more relief. A  group of Republican Senators came to the floor last week to warn  America about the national debt, not the health crisis, not the  economic crisis, not the looming housing crisis but the national debt.  It is something that concerned those same Members very little when  adding nearly $2 trillion to the debt in order to give big corporations  a giant tax cut in 2017.   Listen to this one: The Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Johnson, said  yesterday:         From my standpoint, the breakdown in talks is very good       news. I hope the talks remain broke down.    Let me repeat that. Senator Johnson said:         From my standpoint--    Reflecting the views of many Republican Senators--       the breakdown in talks is very good news. I hope the talks       remain broke down.    Why did he say that? Because he doesn't want to spend one more  nickel. Despite the huge health crisis, the huge economic crisis,  people losing their jobs, small businesses closing, we shouldn't spend  a nickel. This is not both sides. This is one side only.   When President Trump called COVID-19 a hoax and told the country to  go take bleach and other quack medicines, some of my friends here made  disappointed noises. But when the President said the virus would just  disappear, it seems the Republican Senate bought it.   After we came together to pass the CARES Act, Republican Senators  pushed all their chips to the middle to bet with President Trump that  the virus was going to miraculously disappear. The Republican leader  said: I am going to put the Senate on ``pause'' and see what happens.  Last week, he actually defended that position, saying that his delay  ``allowed us to learn the coronavirus didn't mysteriously disappear.''  Millions more people out of work, hundreds of thousands of small  businesses closing, many more people getting COVID and some more people  dying, and, now, after all that, the Republican leader says his delay  ``allowed us to learn the coronavirus didn't mysteriously disappear.''   So while President Trump and his aides have certainly been an  impediment--an awful impediment to an agreement, the Republican Senate  is equally culpable, and the American people know it. They know that  Democrats have their back, healthwise and economically. Republicans, so  many of them, are saying: Don't do a thing. Don't do a thing. They are  glad the negotiations have broken down. We are not                            ____________________     Mr. President, one final matter, millions of Americans  rely on the U.S. Postal Service to deliver their mail reliably and on  time. For decades, the hard-working people of the Postal Service have  been doing just that. During this pandemic, USPS has been providing  these critical services day in and day out, up until the new Postmaster  General, Mr. DeJoy, a top Republican donor and Trump ally with no  experience in the Postal Service, was installed at the helm.   Administering a national election is difficult in normal times. In  the time of COVID, it will undoubtedly be an even greater challenge. We  need to institute policies and devote resources to make sure every  American can both safely and confidently vote in person and by mail. By  the way, even just as important, we need to make sure Americans get  their medicines on time, that the elderly and those with preexisting  conditions who are staying in their homes and not going out are able to  get their necessities by mail. Your pills are a week late--I know what  that is like. It has happened to me. Fortunately, I don't have  medicines that my life depends on. It causes you huge anxiety about  your health. This Postmaster is cutting overtime, cutting employees,  when, at a time of COVID, we need more help, not less. But elections  should certainly concern Americans as well.   The current issues of the post office should alarm every American.  The new Postmaster General has instituted policies that have  contributed to inexcusable delays in mail delivery. But now, topping  the cake, the Postal Service has informed some States that they may  need to pay a first-class rate to deliver ballots rather than the  normal rate, nearly tripling the cost. At a time when people will have  to vote by mail in record numbers because they can't or will not go  vote in person, the Postmaster General is saying we should triple the  rate of costs to vote by mail? What a despicable derogation of  democracy.   What is his rationale? It is a small amount of money. Ballots are a  small percentage of the mail that is delivered. It is to discourage  people from voting. He ought to be ashamed of himself to even consider  this, tripling--tripling what it costs to vote by mail at a time when  more people will vote by mail than ever before. If anyone had any  thought that this Postmaster General was on the level, it is now  dispensed.   To triple the cost of voting by mail would be an outrageous and  insidious policy that would make it even harder and more expensive for  States, already struggling with depleted budgets from COVID-19, to  conduct our elections safely. Democrats will fight this policy with  every tool at our disposal. If our Republican colleagues care about a  free and fair election this November, they should as well.   I yield the floor.   The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.
