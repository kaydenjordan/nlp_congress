 Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great Ohioan  and transformational civil rights leader, Marian Spencer. Born in  Gallipolis, OH, as the granddaughter of a slave, Spencer honored her  grandfather by dedicating her life to fighting for a more equal and  inclusive country. Spencer became a member of the NAACP at the young  age of 13 and is best known for leading the fight to integrate Coney  Island and its swimming pools in the 1950s.   After graduating from high school, Spencer attended the University of  Cincinnati, where she made Cincinnati her adopted home and campaigned  to integrate the university's Whites-only college prom. From there, she  chaired the education committee of her local NAACP branch and helped  raise $30,000 to desegregate Cincinnati Public Schools, before becoming  the chapter's first female president in 1981.   Spencer believed in the power of activism as a means of social  change, and her efforts led her to becoming the first African-American  woman elected to Cincinnati City Council. Spencer gave a voice to the  disenfranchised and underrepresented, and she will be remembered as  trailblazer for civil rights, women's rights, LGBTQ rights, and the  environment.   We lost Marian Spencer this July, but her legacy will live on for  generations. Her leadership and progressive ideas had a profound effect  on our city, our State, and our Nation, and her work will remain a  source of great pride for Ohioans. I am proud to honor Marian Spencer  for her contributions to making our country a little freer and a little  more just.                            ____________________
