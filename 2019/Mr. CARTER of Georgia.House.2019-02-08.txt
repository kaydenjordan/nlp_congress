 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Chatham  County Superior Court Judge Michael L. Karpf for 40 years of  exceptional service to our area's justice system.   Judge Karpf has shown an unwavering commitment to fairness and wisdom  during his tenure as a judge.   He has served on the Chatham County State court since 1993, where he  has had an enormous impact. Namely, he created the major crimes  division, rotating judges and significantly increasing the efficiency  in our court system.   His colleagues remember him as a consensus builder who could lead a  bench that works well together, an oftentimes unique accomplishment.   Earlier this month, he retired to senior judge status, meaning that  he will take cases on an as-needed basis.   I wish Judge Karpf the best of luck and know that the court will be  in good hands as his son, Benjamin, takes the role his father had as  superior court judge.                            ____________________
