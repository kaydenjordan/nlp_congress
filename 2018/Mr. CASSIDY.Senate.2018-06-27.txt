 Mr. President, along with Senator Kennedy, I wish to  talk about the Coushatta Tribe. The Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana is  descended from a large, powerful sovereign nation of Coushatta-- Koasati--people who lived prosperously and peaceably for thousands of  years in what is now the southeastern United States. The principal  Coushatta--Koasati--villages were located on islands in the Tennessee  River, in what is now south central Tennessee, which is where the Tribe  was living when they first encountered the European explorer Hernando  DeSoto in 1540.   Koasati oral tradition also holds that they were always the most  northerly of the Muskogean-speaking peoples. Tribal elders say that  their villages were ``abon, fallami-fa'' which literally means ``above,  to the north.'' They believe that their tribal name comes from ``Kowi  iisa-fa aati-ha,'' which is literally translated as ``the people from  [the lands] where the big cats live.'' Some elders believe that the  name Coosa given by the Spanish to the affiliated group of villages,  what is now called the Coosa chiefdom, was actually pronounced  ``Kohosa'' and thus the people were called ``Kohosa Aati,'' literally  translated as the people--of Kohosa. Numerous period maps support these  oral traditions, identifying these islands as ``Cosauda''--Koasati,  Coushatta, or some other spelling of the Tribe's name. These include  the Franquelin map of 1684, the 1711 Crisp et. al. map, and the 1720  Moll map.   When the Coushatta--Koasati--were moving southward from their  villages on the Tennessee River in October 1686, they encountered the  Spanish explorer Marcus Delgado. They explained to him that the two  major reasons for their move were drought and aggression from the  neighboring tribe of ``Chalaques''--Cherokees.   The Coushatta--Koasati--initially settled in villages in the  Guntersville Basin area of what is now northern Alabama, then moved a  little further south to be allied with the political organization that  became known as the Creek Confederacy. The present-day town of Coosada,  AL is named for the Coushatta who lived in nearby villages.   The Coushattas entered into several treaties with the United States,  starting with the Treaty of New York in 1790, signed for the Koasati by  Alexander McGillivray and Chiefs Hopoy, Muthtee, and Stimafutchkee, and  the Creek Treaty of August 9, 1814, which was signed by Nomatlee  Emautla--Captain Isaacs--of Cousoudee--Coushatta, Koasati.   When the Creek chiefs negotiated their boundary lines with the United  States in 1814, they stated that their northernmost boundary should  stretch to ``Cosauda Island in the Tennessee River.'' This is a clear  indication that the Koasati people considered these lands in what is  now Tennessee as their homelands, never renounced them, and that this  claim was widely known and accepted by all of the Tribes. The  transcribed text from the papers of the War Dept. is as follows:         We, the undersigned head men of the Creek nation, convened       [on behalf of] General John Coffee, and the Confederated       nations to adjust the line designated by the Treaty of Fort       Jackson, and all [-] connected treaties [-] etc.--that the       lines between the Cherokee nation and that part of the Creek       nation added to the United States by the aforesaid Treaty       ought, by right, to begin at the junction of the Eastern [-]       with the Hightower [Etowah] river and continue from thence to       the old Cosauda [Coushatta, Koasati] village on Cosauda       Island in the Tennessee river.    In 1797, the great Coushatta Chief Red Shoes is said to have had a  devastating vision of the coming Creek Wars, causing him to encourage  about half of the Coushatta people to begin migrating westward.  Numerous additional groups followed over the next 30 years. By the time  of the Creek removals, the Coushatta--Koasati--people had split into  three major groups: the present-day Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana,  Alabama-Coushatta Tribe of Texas, and Alabama-Quassarte Tribal town in  Oklahoma.   As a result of Red Shoes' leadership, the Coushatta--Koasati-- relocated to Spanish territories in Louisiana and Texas. By careful  diplomacy, they were able to remain culturally, linguistically, and  politically autonomous.   In an 1805 report to Congress, Agent John Sibley, appointed in 1804  as an Indian Agent for the Territory of Orleans, reported that he had  told Red Shoes and ``Pia Mingo''--Grass Chief-- ``the two Conchetta  Chiefs,'' that ``their great Father the President considered all the  Red people as his Children, and he would not suffer any wrong to be  done them without giving them just & legal satisfaction.''   After living in villages along the Trinity River during the Civil War  and Texas fight for statehood, the Coushattas returned to Louisiana to  live in villages near the present-day town of Indian Village, near  Kinder, LA. Existing laws allowed the tribe to get homestead lands  along Bayou Blue, three miles north of Elton, LA.   On February 9, 1898, the United States issued an Indian trust patent  for 160 acres to Sissy Robinson Alabama, a Coushatta woman. The land  patent explicitly provides that the Robinson patent was granted under  the Indian Homestead Act.   In 1933, the trust was divided under bureau supervision and the two  parcels were held in trust for the heirs of Sissy Robinson Alabama  until June 11, 1953, when fee patents were issued to the heirs. Thus,  the Federal Government exercised jurisdiction over Coushatta trust  lands from 1898 through 1953.   In addition, according to a report to the Division of Investigations,  dated March 14, 1941, 38 homesteads were granted by the General Land  Office to members of the ``Koasati Tribe living in the vicinity of  Elton, Louisiana'' between 1862-1941. The report concludes that, of the  38 homesteads, only two were granted in accordance ``with applicable  law,'' i.e., under the Indian Homestead Act. The two correctly issued  patents were, apparently, the Robinson patent, issued under the Indian  Homestead Act, and another patent issued under the same act for the  benefit of another member of the Coushatta Tribe.   On September 2, 1919, an attorney from Alexandria, LA, wrote to the  Commissioner of Indian Affairs on behalf of the Coushatta Tribe, asking  for ``allotted Indian lands.'' The letter reached U.S. Representative  James B. Aswell of Louisiana's Eighth District, who in 1920 asked Mr.  Cato Sells, Commissioner of Indian Affairs, to provide him with the  information sought by the Tribe.   On December 20, 1919, Frank E. Brandon, Special Supervisor of the  United States Indian Service, issued a report to the Commissioner of  Indian Affairs describing the Indian groups in Louisiana. The report  describes the Coushatta Tribe's land predicament as follows:         There is approximately 1050 acres of land owned by the       Indians divided among various families in tracts ranging from       ten to two hundred acres which was acquired by them under the       homestead laws. Originally they were induced to make such       entries by timber companies who later purchased the timber       from the Indians leaving the Indians a title to cut-over land       of little value for agricultural purposes on account of it       being low and flat with a clay soil which is best adapted to       the production of rice.    The report goes on to recommend that the Federal Government purchase  40 acres of land for a farm station, erect a cottage on the land, and  provide a farmer to direct the Tribe's farming efforts. While Brandon's  recommendations do not appear to have been implemented, the fact that  he made them demonstrates the Federal Government's ongoing relationship  with the Tribe.   Over the years, the U.S. Government further engaged with the  Coushattas through agents, kept track of the Tribe's status, and  provided the Tribe with limited financial assistance including funds  for food, supplies, education, a physician, and farming. The government  also conducted a census of the Tribe and explicitly acknowledged that  the Tribe was under the jurisdiction of Federal Indian agencies. In  this way, the government recognized and exercised its government-to- government relationship with the Coushatta Tribe for almost 200 years.  [[Page S4503]]    In 1954, Congress considered legislation that would terminate the  government's recognition of the Coushatta Tribe, but this legislation  was not passed, and the Tribe's recognition continued. However, for  reasons unknown, the Tribe was not included in the well-known Haas  Report of 1947 and was subsequently not included on the Federal  Government's list of federally recognized tribes.   From 1954 to 1971, the Coushatta Tribe was therefore unofficially  ``terminated'' through a series of clerical errors and technicalities.  Despite no longer being unrecognized by the government and losing  assistance, the Coushatta people survived through their hard work and  determination.   However, in 1971, Ernest Stevens, Acting Commissioner at the BIA,  wrote a detailed letter confirming Coushatta's longstanding  relationship with the Federal Government. The Stevens letter confirmed  that the Coushatta Tribe was a historical tribe that had never had its  rights to Federal services terminated. ``In the absence of such  legislation, and in consideration of the possibility of a treaty  relationship, we think that the Louisiana Coushattas are eligible for  some special federal services to Indian people,'' Stevens wrote.   On June 27, 1973, the U.S. Department of the Interior officially  rerecognized their historical relationship with the Coushatta Tribe of  Louisiana, and in 1975, the Secretary of the interior took land into  trust for the Tribe's benefit.   In 1985, the Federal District Court for the Western District of  Louisiana, Lake Charles Division, confirmed that the Coushatta's lands  were ``reservation lands'' and that the State of Louisiana had no  criminal jurisdiction over activities on such lands.   Through the continued efforts of Tribal leaders and community  members, the Coushatta Tribe has steadily grown stronger in the 45  years since receiving rerecognition. From its initial reservation base  of 15 acres, the Tribe now owns more than 6,000 acres in trust and fee- simple lands.   The Coushatta Tribe now operates more than 20 departments to provide  services to members, including a health department and clinic, an  education department, and social services department. The Tribe owns  and operates Coushatta Casino Resort, the largest land-based casino in  the State of Louisiana, and employs more than 3,000 people, making it  one of the largest employers in the State.   Throughout its proud history, the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana has  played an important role in communities across the South. The Tribe  looks forward to its continued growth and positive impact for many  generations to come.                            ____________________
