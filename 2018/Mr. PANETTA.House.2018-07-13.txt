 Madam Speaker, I recognize today the life of Catholic  Bishop Richard Garcia who recently passed at the age of 71. Although  his loss was after a very short battle with Alzheimer's, Bishop Garcia  lived a long life filled with God and God's children.   His parents were immigrants from Mexico who wanted to give their  children a better life. That American Dream was fulfilled when Bishop  Garcia became a priest in 1973, and, fortunately for me and my  constituents, in 2006 he was then named the bishop for the Monterey  Diocese.   When Bishop Garcia would see you, he would grab you, he would hug  you, and he wouldn't look through you, but he would look at you. It was  at that point that you would feel his love and his divine spirit for  every man.   Bishop Garcia welcomed everyone who entered his church, but also  those who entered this country. He didn't care just about people, but  also the future of this planet.   A quote by another eminent priest from the central coast of  California, Saint Junipero Serra, was: ``Always to go forward and never  to turn back.''   As we look back on the life of Richard Garcia, we know that his  spirit, his love, and his guidance provides us with the divinity to  always go forward.                            ____________________
