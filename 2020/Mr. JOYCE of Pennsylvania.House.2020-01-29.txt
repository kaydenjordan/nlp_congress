 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Walden) for yielding and for his support for prompt  consideration of this bill today.   Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of S. 3201, the Temporary  Reauthorization and Study of the Emergency Scheduling of Fentanyl  Analogues Act.   In just a few short days, the DEA temporary ban of deadly fentanyl  will expire. While I am relieved that the House will vote on this  extension of the fentanyl ban today, I remain deeply troubled that this  lifesaving bill was delayed by the political distractions.    Mr. Speaker, in both your and my districts, we have seen the  devastation of fentanyl and fentanyl analogues. As a doctor, I have  witnessed this drug crisis firsthand. Substance abuse and addiction  have devastated individuals in my district of Pennsylvania and in every  one of my colleagues' districts across America.   Fentanyl and its analogues are uniquely dangerous and deadly and have  caused way too many overdose deaths from opioids in the last 2 years.  We must act to protect the people that we represent from these deadly  substances.   Mr. Speaker, just a few days ago, you and I heard from ONDCP Director  James Carroll about the importance of passing this specific piece of  legislation.   It is shameful that we waited until now to act on this lifesaving  legislation.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle  to renew this ban immediately. We cannot afford to wait.
