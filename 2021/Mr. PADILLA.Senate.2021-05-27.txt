 Mr. President, colleagues, this coming Monday is  Memorial Day. Many of us are making our plans to commemorate the  holiday, the weekend, where we honor those who made the ultimate  sacrifice in defense of our Nation and in defense of our democracy-- those brave Americans and so many others who have worked, fought, and  died for more than 200 years to protect our system of government--of  the people, by the people, for the people. Upholding that legacy is our  highest duty, and it is in that spirit that I rise today.   On November 3, 2020, I was serving as California's secretary of  state. It was my privilege for 6 years to serve as the chief elections  officer in our Nation's most populous and most diverse State, and I can  tell you that even in the best of times, election administration is  complex. Elections are consequential operations.   Last year, our elections workers at all levels of government faced  the additional, unprecedented challenge of administering an election  during a global health pandemic. And I am proud to say that they rose  to the occasion to protect the democratic legacy that we hold and  trust. And, as a result, California's election officials administered  an accessible, secure, and safe election, which drew historic voter  turnout. Indeed, by every objective measure, the 2020 elections were a  national success.   But none of this mattered to President Trump, who had spent years  attacking the integrity of our elections by repeatedly lying about  voter fraud and ``rigged elections,'' even the election that he won in  2016.   President Trump was furious at his 2020 loss, and he chose to take a  sledgehammer to the core of our democratic system. He didn't just  refuse to concede the election--breaking a tradition that dates back to  Thomas Jefferson--President Trump attacked the very notion of a  peaceful transition of power.  [[Page S3844]]    Along the way, he filed and lost more than 60 cynical lawsuits  challenging the election. He personally called State elections  officials and pressured them to alter vote tallies--tallies that had  been counted, recounted, and audited.   And he lied to the American people, tweeting out a steady stream of  conspiracy theories and disinformation denying his electoral loss.   Online and around the country, President Trump's Big Lie caught fire.  Sadly, many Republican officials participated in fanning the flames,  spreading fears of voter fraud for political gain. Others stood by  silently as President Trump radicalized his supporters with falsehoods.  They chose loyalty to Trump over the truth, delusion over democracy.   Let me be clear. These allegations of fraud had no basis in fact.  They were rooted in Trump's ego and cemented in White supremacy. And  they led directly to the deadly insurrection of January 6, an  unprecedented attack on our Nation's Capitol by violent extremists  against the U.S. House of Representatives and this Senate, invited and  incited by the President of the United States.   Armed rioters brutally beat Capitol Police officers and stormed this  building. The Confederate flag, the symbol of violent White supremacy,  flew inside this Capitol for the first time in our Nation's history.  Members of militarized hate groups searched these hallways with the  intent to kill elected leaders of both parties. They made their way to  this very floor to try to stop the certification of the Presidential  election, and in so doing, they terrorized our staff, Capitol Police,  the free press, our citizens across the country, and our democracy  itself.   Through their violence, the January 6 rioters disrupted our democracy  at the behest of President Trump, and our Nation lost the right to call  the transition of power peaceful.   Now we gather in the wake of this armed insurrection, the deadly  insurrection. The scars of January 6 can still be seen throughout the  building. Yet many of my Republican colleagues say: We just need to  move on. Let's just move forward.   They say that this deadly attack was simply a group of ``peaceful  protesters'' on a ``normal tourist visit''? They claim that the  proposed Commission to investigate the January 6 insurrection is  unnecessary because we have already increased Capitol security and our  congressional committees are already investigating this attack.   These arguments are outrageous. Of course we need an independent  Commission to fully investigate the causes of the attack. We need to  know the whole truth about January 6. We need and the American people  deserve an independent, bipartisan investigation that will give us the  facts and allow us to begin the hard work of restoring public trust in  our democracy. It is the only way to ensure that an attack like this  does not happen again.   The bipartisan bill we are considering is modeled after the  bipartisan 9/11 Commission. Imagine arguing in the wake of 9/11 that  the only problem that we needed to address was airport security. That  is how ridiculous this counterargument is. To brush aside the January 6  attack on the American people would be the ultimate dereliction of our  duty.   Colleagues, we swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution  of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. So I  call on my Republican colleagues to live up to that oath, live up to  that sacred duty. And if you cannot, if your hand is frozen by fear of  those who were misled to believe that the election was stolen, if your  hand is frozen out of fear of the President who sold that lie, then the  insurrectionists have succeeded.   I urge the Senate to authorize the January 6 Commission on a  bipartisan vote, but if our Republican colleagues refuse to join us,  then we will face another choice: Do we continue to defend our system  of self-government or defend the filibuster? The stakes could not be  higher. The choice could not be clearer. The peaceful transition of  power must be defended.   Colleagues, this is a moment where we must put country over politics,  put the institutions of our democracy over the abuse of the filibuster.  On January 6, our government was attacked, and now the future of our  democracy is on the line. Let's act like it.   I yield the floor   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Access to  Counsel Act.''   This legislation would ensure that all individuals with a legal right  to be in the United States and are detained by Customs and Border  Protection at ports of entry or airports have access to legal counsel.   This legislation would ensure that individuals who have legal status  in the U.S. and are detained by Customs and Border Protection in  secondary inspection at airports or other points of entry for more than  an hour are granted an opportunity to access legal counsel and an  interested party. An interested party is defined as a family member,  sponsor, or organization with a connection to the individual.   The bill provides no obligation for the Federal government to pay for  counsel and allows counsel the ability to advocate on behalf of the  individual by providing information or documentation in support of the  individual.   It also invalidates any effort by CBP to persuade someone to  relinquish their legal status if that person has been denied access to  counsel or voluntarily waives in writing their right to counsel.   The Trump Administration's immigration policies often caused  unnecessary chaos and confusion.   One vivid example of this is when the first Muslim Ban was  implemented, in early 2017, and thousands of U.S. citizens, green card  holders, and others with valid visas were detained at airports for  hours.   They were held by Customs and Border Protection officers without any  ability to call a lawyer, a relative or an advocate. Many members of  Congress rushed to the airports in an attempt to help these individuals  and were barred from speaking to them or connecting them with  attorneys.   In addition, in early 2020, 200 Iranian Americans were held at the  northern border in Blaine, WA for 12 hours without access to counsel.   While President Biden has rescinded the travel bans, it is imperative  that Americans and those with a legal right to be here have access to  representation if they are held at a port of entry.   Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Marshall, Ms.          Stabenow, Mrs. Capito, Mr. King, Mr. Cassidy, Ms. Sinema, Mr.          Menendez, and Ms. Rosen):   S. 1943.
