 So, Mr. President, 3 days ago, President Biden and  Speaker McCarthy announced a bipartisan budget agreement that will  protect the U.S. economy while eliminating the threat of a catastrophic  default.   I support the bipartisan agreement that President Biden has produced  with Speaker McCarthy. Avoiding default is an absolute imperative. The  damage that default would inflict on our country, our economy, and our  families would be enormous and take years from which to recover.   Of course, nobody is getting everything they want. There is give on  both sides. But this agreement is the responsible, prudent, and very  necessary way forward.   Today, the House of Representatives is beginning the process of  moving that legislation through the Chamber. When this bill arrives in  the Senate, it is my plan to bring it to the floor as quickly as  possible for consideration. Senators must be prepared to act with  urgency to send a final product to the President's desk before the June  5 deadline.   I commend President Biden and his team for producing a sensible  compromise under the most difficult of circumstances.   The bipartisan agreement accomplishes two major goals: First and  foremost, it takes default off the table, sparing Americans from  immense economic pain, and, second, it protects key investments that  are essential for growing our economy, for fixing our infrastructure,  and for making the United States more competitive on the world stage.   Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will not be touched. Our  veterans will be cared for. And, again, we are avoiding the single  worst outcome possible--a default on the national debt.   From the start, I have said that the best way forward to avoiding  default is bipartisan cooperation, and that is what this agreement  represents. Again, nobody gets everything they wanted, but this bill is  the responsible, prudent, and necessary way forward.   A default on the national debt would be one of the great disasters in  our Nation's economic history. It would mean another painful recession.  It would mean 8 million fewer jobs, and it would mean soaring costs on  credit card payments, mortgages, small business loans, and diminished  401(k)s. There is no reason to subject the American people to the pain  of default.  [[Page S1778]]    We still have more work to do in Congress, but I am optimistic that  the path has now been paved and our objective is clear. We must pass  this bipartisan agreement avoiding default as soon as we can. I hope  the House moves quickly, and I will make sure the Senate moves quickly  the moment this bipartisan bill is sent to us by the House.    Good evening. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent  that when the Senate completes its business today, it recess until 10  a.m. on Wednesday, May 31; that following the prayer and pledge, the  time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day;  further, that the Senate recess from 12:30 to 2:15 p.m., to allow for  the weekly caucus meetings; further, that at 2:30 p.m., the Senate  proceed to legislative session, the Journal of proceedings be approved  to date, and it be in order to make a motion to proceed to H.J. Res.  45, which was received from the House and is at the desk; finally, that  if the motion to proceed is agreed to, the vote on passage be at a time  to be determined by the majority leader following consultation with the  Republican leader on Thursday, June 1.    If there is no further business to come before the  Senate, I ask that it stand in recess under the previous order.   There being no objection, the Senate, at 6:56 p.m., recessed until  Wednesday, May 31, 2023, at 10 a.m.                            ____________________
