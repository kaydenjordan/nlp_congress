 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of this  bipartisan package brought to the floor today under the leadership of  Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters.   It is not every day the American people get to see bipartisanship in  action, so it is important for Members today to highlight it when it  does occur because it really should be the rule of the people's House,  not the exception.   Technology and finance evolves by the hour in today's world, and this  bipartisan package will update our laws to better adapt to that reality  while also encouraging the American entrepreneur to innovate and solve  the problems of tomorrow.   As a businesswoman, I understand that this package will help create  the businesses of tomorrow and at the same time enhance transparency in  today's public markets while simultaneously combating the scourge of  human trafficking.   I am proud to have worked with my colleague from the other side of  the aisle, Mr. Royce, to include language in this bill that requires  the administration to more closely examine and create solutions for  Congress to consider how human traffickers use emerging technologies  and virtual currencies to launder money through the global banking  system in hope of slowing the fastest growing crime in the world.   My home State of Ohio ranks fourth in the country for human  trafficking cases according to our State Attorney General's office.   Mr. Speaker, I thank our ranking member again for allowing me the  opportunity to push my bill. Working together is the only way we can  end this inhumane practice.
