 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 811, I call up  the bill (H.R. 550) to award a Congressional Gold Medal, collectively,  to the United States Merchant Mariners of World War II, in recognition  of their dedicated and vital service during World War II, with the  Senate amendment thereto, and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the title of the bill.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have  5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and  include extraneous material on the motion to concur.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking Mr. Khanna for his hard work on  this measure. No one has worked harder to reassert Congress'  constitutional authority over war powers, and I have been glad to  partner with him and cosponsor this bill.   Mr. Speaker, this measure passed the House with bipartisan support  last year as part of the National Defense Authorization Act, but the  Senate stripped it out before that legislation made it across the  finish line.   For all my colleagues who supported that amendment, the events of the  past few weeks only underscore the importance of your vote. For anyone  who was not convinced this measure was needed last summer, the present  crisis shows exactly why we must adopt it today.   Now, there is no question that Iran is dangerous. There is no  question that Qasem Soleimani was a hardened terrorist with American  blood on his hands; the world is better off without him.   I am the first to speak out about the grave threats the Iranian  regime poses to our allies and our interests and our way of life, but  we need to address these threats in a way that protects Americans, not  exacerbate the threat.   No one expects Iran to behave responsibly. American leadership means  that we need to keep pressure on Iran while working to avoid an  unnecessary conflict. Instead, the administration seems to be holding a  match to kindling.   Let's be clear: The American people don't want war with Iran, and  Congress has not authorized war with Iran. So the question is whether  escalating tensions with Iran by killing Qasem Soleimani and, according  to media reports, undertaking a strike against another Iranian official  in Yemen were in America's interests and were consistent with the law.   The past few weeks have shown pretty clearly that this action did not  advance America's interests. American citizens want to drop everything  and leave Iraq; thousands more troops are headed to the Middle East,  alienating the Iraqi Government, a valued partner in the fight against  ISIS; Iranian missiles injuring American personnel, even though at  first the administration said there were no injuries, none of this is  in America's interests.   The administration claimed that the goal of the strike against  Soleimani, that the goal of their whole Iran plan, is to restore  deterrence. I see exactly the opposite. I see an emboldened Iran  seeking to kick America out of the region, getting exactly what they  want.   And as we have learned more, it does not appear that the President  followed the law here. The President ignored the requirements of the  War Powers Resolution. He chose not to consult with Congress, as  required by the law. He acted without authorization from Congress. And  I have seen no evidence that there was any imminent threat against  Americans or our Embassies, as the administration has claimed.   The Constitution gives Congress, not the President, the power to  declare war. I feel very strongly about that. We have all marched down  the primrose path for the last two decades, with Congress sitting  there. There has been no declaration of war since World War II,  December 7, 1941, and so it means that we have let the executive of  both parties really run roughshod and do whatever the President wanted.  Congress just sat there and did not reassert its constitutional role.  Well, we are reasserting that role now.   Again, the Constitution gives Congress, not the President, the power  to declare war. With President Trump taking steps toward conflict with  Iran without any consultation with Congress, we need to reassert the  responsibility given to us in Article I, Section 8.   It is simple. If the President wants to go to war, he needs to come  to Congress first. This measure simply enforces the text of current law  as written in the War Powers Resolution. It preserves the President's  constitutional right to act in self-defense, explicitly exempting  defensive action allowed under the War Powers Resolution. But it makes  clear that the President cannot just skip the critical step of coming  to Congress.   I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle can agree on this  matter, as we did last year. Again, this has been done by both  Republican and Democratic Presidents. We should all be united here.   This is about upholding the Constitution. This is about checks and  balances. This is about all the things we learned about the genius of  our Constitution with checks and balances. We have really abrogated our  responsibility, and the time to stop that is now. Now is the time for  Congress to step up and assert our constitutional authority.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment. I  thank Mr. Khanna for raising this, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Khanna), the author of this important amendment who has  worked very hard on these issues for many years.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Let me say, with respect to the gentleman's statement about process,  when our colleagues on the other side of the aisle were in charge, they  struck and replaced language in a Senate-passed bill 15 times in the  last two Congresses, and this is doing the same thing, which is exactly  what they did.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr.  Garamendi).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from California an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Castro), the vice chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee, the  chair of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigation.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Brown).    Mr. Speaker, let me just say that the President always has  a legal right to defend America, U.S. forces and embassies, and this  resolution explicitly exempts the defensive actions described in the  War Powers Resolution.   The War Powers Resolution has been around since 1973, and it has  never prevented the President from defending America.   Again, this amendment just enforces the text of the War Powers  Resolution.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton),  not only a Member of this body, but a combat veteran.   I thank him for his service.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New  Mexico (Ms. Haaland).    Mr. Speaker, let me say that America's Constitution laws  don't really convey weakness. Enforcing those laws is what keeps  America strong. And when any President does not follow the law, this  Congress must act, and that is what we are trying to do now.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Doggett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu).    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Frankel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me say that if killing Soleimani was about  retaliating for past bad acts by Iran, that is exactly when the law  requires the President to work with the Congress for a response, not do  a response on his own.   The President didn't work with us. Instead, he told the American  people there was an imminent threat, with no evidence to support that  claim.   Now, I don't like the Iranian regime. There are lots of things I  don't like about them. But it doesn't mean that we just give any  President a blank check to do whatever he wants to start a war.   We have been through that in the past decades of endless war, with  this body, as far as I am concerned, abrogating its responsibility and  essentially giving the administrations of both parties blank checks.   This is about Congress reasserting what it is supposed to do. This is  about Congress saying only we have the power to declare war; the  President does not have that power to declare war.                                time  1015    Now, the Khanna measure is about enforcing current law as it is  written in the War Powers Resolution. We should not create special  loopholes in current law for any one country, no matter how close our  alliance or partnership is. This is not a question of whether we will  defend our allies and partners. It is a question of which branch of  government is responsible for making that decision.   The War Powers Resolution could not be more clear. It is Congress who  is responsible for authorizing the use of military force. We went  through the entire Cold War without ever creating an exception to the  War Powers Resolution or the Constitution when it comes to Article 5 of  the NATO treaty. We do not need to create a loophole now.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, let me say something that I have been saying a lot  recently. Nobody denies the fact that Iran is a bad actor. No one  denies the fact that Iran is the leading state sponsor of terrorism in  the world. No one is saying that the Iranian regime is a good regime or  a regime that doesn't threaten our interests. They do threaten our  interests.   I am not a naive person. I don't like the regime, and I know what  they do. But we have a way of responding, and it is not to give any  President a blank check to do whatever he or she may want to do.   Congress declares war according to the Constitution; not the  President. Congress declares war. And today we are attempting to take  back the authorization that is given to us in the United States  Constitution and say to this President and to every President that  comes in the future: No blank checks for war.   We gave blank checks for the past 20 years, and we have been involved  in one mistake after another. This is simply saying for Congress to  reassert its authority. I am not saying that in the future there may  not be a different decision, but the decision that should always remain  the same is that Congress has the power to declare war; not the  President. Congress.   I think my friends on the other side of the aisle somehow forget  that. They make some good points. But, again, I say, it comes back to  this Congress to declare a war, and we are today taking that  responsibility, grabbing the bull by the horns and saying: Enough is  enough, where Congress just sits idly by and has no say except to  rubberstamp whatever administration wants to go to war.   That should stop today, and that is why we are moving ahead with this  resolution.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Rhode  Island (Mr. Cicilline).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Rhode Island an  additional 30 seconds.    Madam Speaker, may I ask how much time is remaining?    Madam Speaker, it is now my honor to yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the Speaker of the House.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, for too many years, Congress has allowed  administration after administration after administration to sideline us  in critical foreign policy matters. It is time we said enough is  enough, particularly when it comes to when and where the United States  military is engaged around the world.   As I have said before, if killing Soleimani was about retaliating for  past bad acts by Iran, then that is exactly when the law requires the  President to work with Congress. The President didn't work with us.  Instead, he told the American people there was an imminent threat with  no evidence to support that claim, once again moving ahead and making  Congress irrelevant.   We have seen that done with Chief Executives of both parties, and it  is time we stood up and said: No, enough is enough; only Congress can  declare war.   I know I sound like a broken record, but I think that is the crucial  spot of what we are talking about here. Congress cannot just be swept  along for the ride. Congress has the power to declare war.   The American people are sick of perpetual war. If we don't do  everything in our power to make sure this administration cannot plunge  us into another war that we don't want, then we will have let the  American people down.   Again, for too many years, Congress has allowed administration after  administration after administration to sideline us on critical foreign  policy matters; and, again, it is time to say enough is enough. That is  what we are attempting to do today, and that is why I urge my  colleagues to support this very important bill.   Madam Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, let me start by thanking my friend, Representative Lee  from California, for her hard work on this amendment. As you know, she  is the newest newlywed in the House of Representatives, so we  congratulate her on a great new marriage and wish her and her husband a  long life together.   She is a principled, passionate leader when it comes to standing up  for Congress' role and responsibility in foreign affairs, particularly  war powers. I am proud to be a cosponsor of her legislation. I am glad  we are able to partner on such an important issue.   Madam Speaker, it has been nearly two decades since the House voted  to authorize the war in Iraq. I wish we could have that vote to do over  again knowing what we know now. We were led into war on phony  intelligence and found our brave servicemembers bogged down there for  years at such tragic costs.   The war is over, and it is long past time that the authority Congress  granted to fight that war should be removed from the books--because we  see how it is being misused.   Earlier this month we heard the argument that the Iraq war  authorization would justify military action against Iran. Here is how  the argument goes:   The executive branch says that this authorization can be used to deal  with any threat emanating--I stress the word, ``emanating''--from Iraq.  Yes, you heard it right, emanating from Iraq.   That is just wrong. It is not what the authorization says. It is not  what Congress intended when it passed that resolution. I was here. I  remember it. It dealt with threats coming from Saddam Hussein's Iraq.  Saddam Hussein is dead. His government and regime are long gone.   This war authorization has no relevance to present-day Iraq, and it  should be repealed. It should not be used to launch more military  action.   Now, we will likely hear an argument that repealing the Iraq war  resolution would undermine our ability to combat terrorism around the  world. But let's be clear about something: the Iraq war resolution-- what we are seeking to repeal today--was never intended to authorize  our fight against ISIS or other associated terrorist groups, and it is  not needed as authorization for any of these operations.   There is another existing authorization for the use of military  force, the measure that Congress passed after 9/11 to deal with al- Qaida. I don't agree with the administration's overly expansive  interpretation of the 9/11 AUMF. I think they have stretched it well  beyond what Congress ever intended. But even this administration has  said clearly that they can continue current counterterrorism operation  using the post-9/11 authorization even if we repeal the 2002 Iraq war  authorization.   The only time this administration has pointed to the 2002 Iraq war  authorization as its only source of congressional authority is the  strike against Soleimani, something Congress never intended. We cannot  allow this President or any President to claim Congress has already  authorized him to attack Iranian officials.   If the President wants to use military force against Iran, then he  has to come to Congress, plain and simple. An administration certainly  shouldn't be twisting a decades-old authorization to justify plunging  us into a war the American people don't want and that Congress has not  authorized.   I get back to what I said before: Only Congress can declare war, not  the President, and we have had violation after violation after  violation about this important matter. It is time that Congress  reassert its constitutional role in declaring war or not declaring war,  so it is long past time that we repeal this outdated war authorization.  The House has already voted to do so with bipartisan support.   I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting this measure  and taking these important steps in reclaiming Congress' authority over  war powers.   I thank Ms. Lee, who has the foresight to be courageous and stand all  alone because she believes something is right. That is what we are  trying to do now. We are trying to do what is right, what is right for  our country.   Again, what is right for our country is that Congress needs to grab  the bull by the horns. Congress has the authority to declare war, not  the President, not any President--Congress. We are reclaiming Congress'  authority over war powers the way it was intended.   Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1045     Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), the newlywed and author of this important  amendment.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Connolly), a valued member of the Committee on Foreign  Affairs.    Madam Speaker, let me say that no one on this side needs  to be lectured to about preserving America's role in the world. I just  think that we don't think there should be a blank check for war.   I will mention a couple of things that are relevant here. The 2001  AUMF passed after 9/11 authorizes counterterrorism operations. The 2002  AUMF has nothing to do with counterterrorism operations, al-Qaida, or  ISIS. It specifically says the threat posed by Iraq, not al-Qaida. The  reference to al-Qaida is in the findings, not in the authorization.   It does not need to be replaced because the 2001 AUMF is still in the  books. The administration has been clear with Congress that  counterterrorism operations would not stop if the 2002 AUMF is  repealed.   I would note that it is the President's recent actions in the Middle  East that  [[Page H730]]  have posed challenges to our efforts to defeat ISIS. The United States  has had to cease operations against ISIS because our military is needed  for force protection after the Soleimani strike.   So if there is anything that has posed an obstacle to our fight  against terrorism, it is the recent actions of the administration. I  think a little thing should be put into perspective here.   Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr.  Espaillat), a valued member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Virginia (Ms. Spanberger), a valued member of the Committee on Foreign  Affairs, one of our newer members.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).    Madam Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the  gentlewoman from Ohio.    Madam Speaker, let me just say I would like to briefly  respond to the Republican leader's remarks about the Iranian protest  movement, because I feel very strongly about the Iranian protest  movement and in supporting them.   The leader accused the Democrats of being shamed into passing the  resolution in support of the protestors in Iran. I want to correct the  record because Mr. Deutch, who is a Democrat, introduced this  resolution nearly a month before Mr. McCarthy; the House Foreign  Affairs Committee marked the resolution a couple of weeks later.   So there was no shame, except accusing Democrats of any nefarious  motives. That is shameful.   I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B.  Maloney), the chairwoman of the Committee on Oversight and Reform.    Madam Speaker, let me quickly say that I agree with Mr.  Scalise that the Foreign Affairs Committee should be having hearings on  this. We have tried to get the Secretary of State to come. I am still  hopeful he is coming, but it is a little hard to hold hearings if you  don't get the administration witness to come to the hearings. We are  trying.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Neguse).    Madam Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Colorado an  additional 15 seconds.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Kildee).    Madam Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on each  side.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Ms. Jayapal).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Brown).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Michigan (Ms. Tlaib).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Florida (Mr. Gaetz), our Republican colleague.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the majority leader.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume  for the purpose of closing.   Madam Speaker, in 2002, the House authorized the Bush administration  to go to war the Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq. It makes no sense  that this authorization is still on the books when the original purpose  of it has long passed.   It is dangerous when we see an administration trying to claim that  this decades-old vote gives them a green light to conduct military  actions against Iran.   With this measure today, there is no blank check for war. The  President must come to the Congress.   We want to fill our constitutional role. Only Congress can declare  war, not the President. With this measure today, we can finally reclaim  Congress' constitutional role in war powers and repeal this outdated  authorization that has been misused time and time and time again.   As my friend from Texas knows, the 2001 9/11 AUMF is cited as the  authority for every operation against terrorists in Iraq. This AUMF  needs to be updated and limited. The 2002 Iraq war AUMF does not need  to be updated; it just needs to be repealed.   What we are saying here is that there should be no automatic blank  check for war. If this President or future Presidents want to go to  war, they must come to Congress. Only Congress can declare war.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to  support this, no blank check for war. If war is necessary, it will  happen, but it shouldn't be a blank check for Presidents to go to war.  We want peace; we don't want war; and now is the time to show it.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.    Madam Speaker, last week, I went with Speaker Pelosi and  some other Members of Congress to Jerusalem, where we had the  commemoration of the 75th anniversary of the end of the death camps.  Many of our colleagues went to Auschwitz-Birkenau to look at the  concentration camps.   Some of my colleagues have said this, but I think it is important  that each one of us says it: We have to raise our voices loudly and  clearly and monitor the situation so these types of things don't happen  again to any people.   First of all, anti-Semitism is rearing its ugly head, and certainly  we need to do everything we can to stop the scourge of anti-Semitism.  We cannot treat people the way the Jewish population was treated during  the Second World War, and America must always be in the forefront of  equal rights and standing up against injustice.   I wanted to take the time to say that participating in that  conference was really emotional for me, and I think that we should  always say: Never again will we stand idly by and allow anti-Semitism  to rear its ugly head. Never again will we stand idly by and allow any  group of people to be killed and slaughtered.   So, never again.                            ____________________
