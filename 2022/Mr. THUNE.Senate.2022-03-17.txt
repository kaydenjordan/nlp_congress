 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the Senate Commerce Committee recently  voted on the nomination of Gigi Sohn to be a member of the Federal  Communications Commission. I voted against her nomination for a number  of serious reasons, as did the 13 other Republican committee members.   I was deeply disappointed that not one of my Democratic colleagues on  the committee stepped forward to affirm what should be glaringly  obvious: that Ms. Sohn is not an appropriate candidate for a position  on the Federal Communications Commission.   One substantial concern I have with Ms. Sohn's nomination is her  extreme position on net neutrality.   Back in 2014, the Obama administration decided that the Federal  Government wasn't regulating the internet enough. So in 2015, the Obama  Federal Communications Commission passed what was known as the Open  Internet Order--mislabeled, I would add, but which dramatically  expanded the Federal Government's power over the internet. The  justification for this massive regulatory expansion was net neutrality.   Now, net neutrality is a concept that enjoys broad support in both  parties. I support net neutrality and rules that prevent blocking,  throttling, and the paid prioritization of internet traffic. I don't  think a major service provider should be able to block a small news  startup. But what the Obama FCC did in 2015 went far beyond net  neutrality. The Obama FCC asserted broad, new government powers over  the internet using rules that were designed for telephone monopolies  back during the Great Depression. This opened the door to a whole host  of internet regulations, including price regulations, and  unsurprisingly, broadband investment declined as a result.    That was a problem for Americans generally, who benefit when the  United States is at the forefront of internet growth and expansion, and  it was particularly bad news for Americans in rural States like South  Dakota. Getting broadband to rural communities is already more  challenging than installing broadband in cities or suburbs, and the  possibility of heavier regulations acted as a further disincentive to  expanding access.   Fast-forward to 2017, and the Federal Communications Commission under  Chairman Pai voted to repeal those heavyhanded regulations passed by  the Obama FCC, and here is what happened: Broadband investment  rebounded, and broadband access expanded. Internet speeds increased.  Our Nation positioned itself at the forefront of the 5G revolution.  While European internet providers were slowing internet speeds during  the pandemic, American providers were increasing them. All this despite  the repeal of the heavyhanded internet regulation Democrats claimed we  needed--or more accurately, because of the repeal of the heavyhanded  regulation Democrats claimed we needed.   Why do I go into all this history? Well, because Ms. Sohn not only  wants to bring back the heavyhanded internet regulation of the Obama  administration, but she wants to go further and have the FCC regulate  broadband rates and set data caps.   Just as service providers are working to implement nationwide 5G  networks, Ms. Sohn wants to reinstate rules that will discourage  broadband investment and diminish access opportunities for Americans  outside of major cities and suburban areas. That is a big problem. The  light-touch approach to internet regulation that the Federal Government  has historically taken has resulted in growth and access, both of which  would be threatened by Ms. Sohn's agenda.   Now, while I was very pleased that the FCC under Chairman Pai  repealed  [[Page S1233]]  President Obama's heavyhanded internet regulation, I believe the best  solution for the long term is for Congress to step in and pass  bipartisan net neutrality legislation. Swings in net neutrality policy  from administration to administration do not encourage long-term  broadband investment.   I believe there is bipartisan support for a long-term legislative  solution but not, it would seem, from Ms. Sohn, who has openly  disparaged bipartisan work on this issue. Now, I think Ms. Sohn would  be fine if Congress produces a bill to her liking, but I have serious  concerns that if she thought a bipartisan solution didn't go far  enough, she would ignore the will of Congress and use her position at  the FCC to impose the heavyhanded regulatory regime she favors.   As a resident of a rural State, I am also concerned about Ms. Sohn's  position on expanding broadband access to rural communities--an issue  every Member of this body cares deeply about. She has been publicly  hostile to the efforts of rural broadband companies in expanding  reliable internet access to rural areas, while at the same time  supporting the use of scarce government dollars to build new internet  networks in already well-served urban areas.   As someone who has worked long and hard to expand internet access for  unserved Americans, I find her hostility to rural broadband companies  very troubling. The vast majority of these companies have spent years  building out reliable networks to some of the most remote parts of the  country, allowing more rural areas, like those in South Dakota, to reap  the benefits of advanced services in healthcare, education, and  economic development.   It is not only Republicans who have taken note of her hostility to  the needs of rural Americans. Our former Democratic colleague from  North Dakota has also questioned how one could support rural broadband  and Ms. Sohn.   Ms. Sohn's policy positions alone would lead me to oppose her  nomination, but there are other even more troubling factors that should  be leading Members of both parties to oppose her nomination.   To start with, Ms. Sohn was not forthcoming to the Commerce Committee  about her past history on the board of a company that was ordered to  cease operations after being found in violation of copyright laws. This  raises serious concerns about her fitness to sit on the FCC.   After questions were raised about her involvement with this company's  settlement with broadcasters, she did volunteer to recuse herself, if  she is confirmed, on a variety of issues related to broadcasting and  copyright violations. But why on Earth--why on Earth should we choose a  Commissioner who would have to recuse herself from participating in  substantial parts of the FCC's work? How does it serve Americans to  have an FCC Commissioner who can't fully do her job? Surely, there are  other qualified nominees who don't have Ms. Sohn's conflict of  interest.   But my objections don't end there. While I am concerned about Ms.  Sohn having to recuse herself from doing parts of her job, I am most  concerned about whether or not Ms. Sohn can do any part of her job in a  fair and impartial manner.   Ms. Sohn has a history of virulent partisanship and far-left  activism, including support for such far-left initiatives as defunding  the police. She has publicly expressed her disdain for Republicans, and  she has a record of outspoken criticism of the very same conservative  media outlets that she would be responsible for regulating. Perhaps the  most notable example is her hostility towards FOX News, which she has  referred to as ``state-sponsored propaganda'' and accused of playing a  role in ``destroying democracy.''   ``Destroying democracy.''   And yet we are supposed to believe that she would approach cases  involving the FOX corporation impartially? I think it is pretty clear  that would not be the case.   I don't expect a Democrat nominee to the FCC to agree with  Republicans on all the issues--far from it. But I do expect a Democrat  nominee to do his or her job and do it in an impartial and unbiased  manner.   In the case of Ms. Sohn, President Biden has nominated someone who  cannot fulfill part of the responsibilities of FCC Commissioner and  whose record strongly suggests that she cannot be relied upon to  fulfill any of her responsibilities in an impartial manner.   Americans deserve an FCC nominee who can do her job impartially, no  matter what the matter before the Commission. And I hope that if Ms.  Sohn's nomination comes to the floor, at least some of my Democrat  colleagues will join Republicans in opposing her nomination.   We should all be able to agree that virulent partisanship and an  inability to fulfill the responsibilities of one's job are  disqualifying characteristics for a role on the FCC.   I yield the floor.    The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator  from North Carolina (Mr. Tillis).
