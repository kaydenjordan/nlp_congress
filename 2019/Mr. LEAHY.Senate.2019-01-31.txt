 Mr. President, the McConnell amendment expresses the sense  of the Senate regarding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria and  Afghanistan, an action I have long supported. Many Senators, including  several of the cosponsors of the amendment, have supported the exact  opposite position and would prefer to send more U.S. troops to both  countries.   I believe that our military and diplomatic presence in Syria and  Afghanistan should be determined by strategy and not by Presidential  whims. I believe that our strategy should be developed with the  thoughtful input of experts, both in executive agencies and in  Congress. I believe that strategy should be consulted and coordinated  with allies and partners and that it should be debated thoroughly in  Congress. I believe that our commitments should not be open-ended and  should have realistic and achievable goals that bring them to  completion.   As the new Congress convened, amidst a government shutdown, the  majority leader sought to bring S. 1, this so-called Middle East  security bill, to the floor. Now, he has brought a hastily drafted  amendment to the table, one that on its face seems to rebuke the  President's impulsive announcement earlier this month that he was  precipitously withdrawing troops from Syria. Congress should debate  this issue. I support bringing our troops home from Syria and  Afghanistan, and the manner and pace in which that occurs should be the  subject of a full debate here in the Senate. We should have a debate  about the scope of authorities under current authorizations for the use  of military force, AUMFs, and whether new AUMFs are warranted. This  amendment may be designed to put Members on the record opposing the  President's announcement, but in Congress, we should have more  meaningful debates that influence policy and practice rather than fuel  headlines.   I hope the majority leader will soon schedule that debate.
