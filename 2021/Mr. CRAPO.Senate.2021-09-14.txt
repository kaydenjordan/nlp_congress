 Mr. President, in honor of the observation of National  POW/MIA Recognition Day this September 17, 2021, I join in raising  awareness about the more than 81,600 Americans the Defense POW/MIA  Accounting Agency, DPAA, reports remain missing from World War II, the  Korean war, the Vietnam war, the Cold war, the gulf wars, and other  conflicts. Thank you to the members of the POW*MIA Awareness Rally  Corp. of Pocatello, ID, and other similar groups for their unwavering  commitment to keeping the need to bring all missing American  servicemembers home at the forefront of our national focus.   Etched on the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National  Cemetery are the words, ``Here Rests In Honored Glory An American  Soldier Known But To God.'' The tribute prompts reflection on the  American servicemembers, many also in graves known but to God, who have  not yet been identified or returned home. This year marks 100 years  since the first unknown soldier, a World War I veteran, was interred at  the tomb. Over the century since, a World War II, a Korean war, and a  Vietnam war veteran were also laid to rest in the tomb. Following the  identification and exhumation of the interred Vietnam veteran Air Force  First Lieutenant Michael Joseph Blassie, the empty crypt was  rededicated to honor American servicemembers who remain missing in  Southeast Asia.   The DPAA reports 75 percent of lost Americans are located in the  Indo-Pacific, and more than 41,000 of the missing are presumed lost at  sea. My heart remains with the families of the missing and those  working tirelessly, often through significant challenges to get needed  answers, to bring them home. Despite the difficulty, the DPAA has  reported accounting for more than 100 of America's missing since the  start of this year. This includes Navy Fireman 2nd Class Carl M.  Bradley who was  [[Page S6495]]  killed in action aboard the USS Oklahoma on December 7, 1941. He was  returned to rest in his hometown of Shelley, ID, earlier this year.   To support these efforts, work continues toward reintroducing the  Bring Our Heroes Home Act to provide a more efficient process for  accessing records needed for recovery efforts of missing  servicemembers. We can never let up in bringing home all our Nation's  heroes, including the 358 Idahoans, who have yet to be returned. Our  country's dedication to bringing our lost servicemembers home must  mirror the precision, stamina, formality and respect with which The Old  Guard unwaveringly protects the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. They  resolutely honor our Nation's unidentified and missing servicemembers,  as we must in steadily pressing forward to get answers for the families  who await their return.                            ____________________
