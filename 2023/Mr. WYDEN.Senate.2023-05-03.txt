 Madam President, as the second week of May is Public  Service Recognition Week, I wish to recognize the honorable public  employees who work tirelessly to provide outstanding service to  Oregonians. These men and women, who serve our Nation as Federal,  State, Tribal, county, and local government employees work hard to  support Oregonians and make our State and our country a great place to  live. I would like to acknowledge the important work that public  servants do, and I will give just a few examples to illustrate how  valuable public service work is.   The Oregon Farm Service Agency is dedicated to helping local Oregon  farmers with assistance when they face financial risk or a natural  disaster, as well as providing funding for conservation programs.  Thanks to the efforts of employees at the Oregon Farm Service Agency,  countless farmers and their families have been able to sustain their  livelihoods through hard times. Oregonians are fortunate to have such  committed public servants in the Oregon Farm Service Agency.   I would also like to honor the many public service employees that  work at the Oregon Social Security offices. Their professionalism and  courtesy in serving Oregonians is commendable. Without this work,  numerous families could miss out on vital benefits. My staff and I also  appreciate these offices' assistance in answering our inquiries on  behalf of constituents. The replies we receive have helped me help  hundreds of people across Oregon.   Turning to another Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration--NOAA--Office for Coastal Management is making a  difference in Oregon in countless ways. For example, NOAA's program on  Oregon coastal and estuarine land conservation is vital for the  preservation of Oregon's famous beaches. NOAA also helps with research  on environmental challenges that Oregon communities might soon face and  has partnerships with Oregon's Confederated Tribes to create  opportunities for environmental education.   Public employees at the NOAA Fisheries office in Oregon also work  tirelessly to ensure the conservation of fishery resources, eliminate  overfishing, and maintain healthy commercial and recreational  fisheries. For Oregon, the NOAA Fisheries office is vital to keeping  ecosystems like the Willamette River healthy.   To give one more example, for over 100 years, public employees have  worked for the National Park Service in order to maintain national  parks, like the beautiful Crater Lake in Oregon, and to preserve local  history and celebrate local heritage. National Park Service employees  also work to provide funding for conservation projects throughout  Oregon, making sure that Oregonians and people from all over the  country are able to enjoy our State's natural beauty.   It is an honor during Public Service Recognition Week to recognize  the wonderful public employees that work day in and day out to help  Oregonians. Again, I thank public service employees for their  dedication and their service.                            ____________________
