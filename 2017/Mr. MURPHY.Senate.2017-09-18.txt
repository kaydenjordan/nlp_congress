 Madam President, before the Senator leaves the floor, I  just want to probe him for a moment on this question of process.   Listen, this is an affront to the Senate--a bill that reorders one- fifth of the U.S. economy and that is being delivered to us days or  weeks before we are to vote on it.   The Senator may have covered this, and if he did, he may just  reiterate it for me.   My understanding is that there is not going to be a CBO score before  this bill is before us. For the folks who do not know what that means,  that means that everyone who votes on this bill will have no clue as to  how many people will lose insurance, how high premiums will go, or how  much money their States will lose. I do not think that we have ever,  ever voted on a bill of this scope and size without having an analysis  from the CBO. My understanding is that, today, when you list or rank  the affronts on the process involved in the debate over Graham-Cassidy,  at the top of that list will be the fact that we are not going to see a  CBO score.    Madam President, if I may ask the Senator a follow-up  question, we are in a different position today because, when we were  taking these votes a month ago, there was only the faint talk of a  bipartisan process to try to keep what works in the Affordable Care Act  and fix what is not working.   It is another assault on the process, in my mind, and I ask for the  Senator's thoughts on it. Literally, as we speak, Republicans and  Democrats are talking to each other about the bipartisan bill that  Americans in every State are begging for. Apparently, if this bill is  going to be brought before the Senate, then that whole process was a  fraud. It was a ruse to distract Democrats into thinking that there  might be a bipartisan fix. It was pulling one over on the American  public to give the impression that, maybe, Republicans were interested  in a bipartisan compromise.   Right now, there is a process playing out, and if this bill comes up  for debate with no CBO score, then, that bipartisan process, which was  really hopeful for a lot of Americans, I assume just falls apart;  right?    Madam President, I thank the Senator. I know it is late,  and I thank him for staying on the floor for a few moments.   You do not know what it is going to do to your own constituents. We  do not have a CBO score telling us how many people will lose coverage,  how high rates will go, what will happen to Medicaid. It is also  another bill that has been written behind closed doors. Senator Cassidy  and Senator Graham may have spent some time in thinking about what this  legislation does, but virtually no one else has been let into the room.  Patients have not been in that room. Doctors have not been in that  room. Hospitals have not been in that room. Do you know why I am pretty  confident of that? It is because all of the groups that represent those  populations oppose this legislation.   Potentially, we are going to vote next week on a healthcare bill that  massively, massively reorders the American healthcare system and that  is opposed by the American Academy of Family Physicians, the American  Academy of Pediatrics, the American College of Physicians, the American  College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Osteopathic  Association, and the American Psychiatric Association. Those are the  physician groups.   By the way, it is kind of hard to know for these groups whether they  are for it or against it, as there is no CBO analysis of this, but the  patient groups have weighed in. Basically, every group that represents  patients who are sick in this country is begging this Congress not to  pass this bill.   Also included is the ALS Association, the Cancer Society, the  American Diabetes Association, the Heart Association, the Lung  Association, the Arthritis Foundation, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation,  the Juvenile Diagnosis Research Fund, the Lutheran Services of America,  the March of Dimes, the National Health Council, the National Multiple  Sclerosis Society, the National Organization of Rare Diseases.   How do you pass a bill that has no CBO score, that has had no  hearings, that is opposed by every single group that Republicans  welcome into their office every year representing people with serious  diseases?   There have been some really mean healthcare proposals, but Graham- Cassidy is the meanest version of TrumpCare yet. Let me walk you  through why I say that.   Again, we don't have the numbers so we don't have a CBO analysis of  how many million people are going to lose access to healthcare, but let  me guarantee you it will be in the millions, likely in the tens of  millions.   The bill radically--radically--trims the amount of money States will  get in order to insure the population that has been insured by the  Affordable Care Act. What this bill does is shrink the amount of money  we are spending, then redistributes it out to States, and it will  simply not be enough--not nearly enough money--in order to cover the 20  million people who have insurance today because of the Affordable Care  Act; many of those through Medicaid, others through the healthcare  exchanges.   An early analysis by an outside group that is trying to help us  understand what this means suggests that for my little State of  Connecticut, it will be a $4 billion reduction in healthcare dollars  from the Federal Government to  [[Page S5822]]  the State of Connecticut. We are a State that doesn't have a $20  billion annual budget. Four billion dollars means that we will either  have to kick hundreds of thousands of people off of healthcare or we  will have to dramatically raise people's taxes.   So all of the reductions in insurance are in this bill. We will just  have millions of people losing access to health insurance under this  bill.   The specific, targeted harm to women is in this bill. Planned  Parenthood is one of the country's biggest providers of primary care  and preventive healthcare services to women. I get that many  Republicans have a problem with Planned Parenthood because they also  provide abortion services, but the majority of their work is, in fact,  providing basic preventive healthcare to women in this country.   My wife, when she was a low-income twenty-something, could only  afford to get her healthcare through Planned Parenthood. That is where  she went for her preventive healthcare, for her wellness checkups, and  there are millions of women just like her. This bill is particularly  cruel and particularly mean to all of the women in this country who,  without access to a Planned Parenthood clinic, may not be able to get  quality, affordable, preventive healthcare.   This bill is perhaps the meanest, though, to individuals who are sick  or individuals who have been sick because at least in prior versions of  TrumpCare that came before this body, there was at least a meager  attempt to try to preserve protections for people with preexisting  conditions. It wasn't workable, but at least there was a face-saving  gesture by Republicans and by the Trump administration to try to at  least claim there was language to protect people with preexisting  conditions.   Senator Cruz stood on this floor a few years ago during his long  overnight filibuster. I sat in the chair listening to him explain how  everyone knows, including him, that you cannot protect people with  preexisting conditions without requiring, in some way, shape, or form,  that healthy people buy coverage. Why is that? Let me walk you through  it for a minute because it is not hard to understand, but it is really  important to understand because people don't like the individual  mandate. They are not going to understand that. Nobody likes to be  required to do something, but you cannot protect people with  preexisting conditions if you don't require people to buy insurance.   The logic goes like this. If you say to insurance companies that you  cannot charge people who are sick more than people who are not sick, if  you say to an insurance company that you cannot charge someone with  cancer more than someone who is healthy and you don't require that  healthy people buy insurance, then what does the rational individual  do? The rational individual, in that case, says: Why would I buy health  insurance while I am healthy? If I will not be charged anything more  for it when I become sick, then there is no rational economic reason  for me to be covered when I am healthy.   So what insurance companies tell you--what every insurance expert  tells you is, if you require insurance companies to charge the same  between sick people and healthy people, then healthy people will not  buy insurance. If I were advising someone, I am not sure I would tell  them to buy insurance if they didn't have to until they were sick. So  the pools get so skewed with sick people and no healthy people that  rates dramatically rise for everyone. Some estimates suggest that the  rate increases would be 20 percent per year, compounding year after  year after year.   In the last version of this bill, Republicans knew that so they  included a version of the individual mandate in their bill. Now, it  wasn't the same mandate, but it was a mandate nonetheless. The mandate  under the Affordable Care Act says that if you don't buy insurance, you  will pay a fee on your taxes.   What the Republican bill said--the version of TrumpCare that came  very close to getting a vote on this floor--is that if you go without  insurance, you will pay a penalty when you try to get back on. The  timing of the penalty was just different. Under the Affordable Care  Act, you pay it when you lose insurance. Under the first version of  TrumpCare, you would pay the penalty when you try to get back on  insurance. It is a mandate. It is a penalty. It is just in a different  place.   Republicans did that because they knew that was the only way to  require States or give States the option to continue to require  insurance companies to treat sick people the same as healthy people.   So why am I talking about this? Because in Graham-Cassidy, the  individual mandate is totally gone--gone--replaced with nothing. Thus,  even though it says that States, if they wanted to, could preserve  protections for people with preexisting conditions, States did not do  that because the Federal Government does not require healthy people to  have insurance. If you think that States are going to reimpose an  individual mandate, A, there will be some real question as to whether  they can do that, and, B, they will not. They will not because that  issue has become, thanks to my Republican friends, so politically toxic  around the country.   You will be left with massive discriminatory treatment of people with  preexisting conditions, and nowhere for them to go because Medicaid is  obliterated under this bill. Medicaid dollars get lumped into all the  rest of the money. It gets sent to States, and then Medicaid dollars  are capped going forward--intentionally capped--at a number that is  well below what the general rate of increase in the Medicaid Program  is. There is intentionality to the underfunding of Medicaid here.   Now, the old bill would have taken, I think, 15 million people off of  the rolls of Medicaid. I think I am getting that number right, and we  will never know what this number is before the vote happens. It is  likely around the same number because this bill treats Medicaid in  roughly the same way, in terms of capping the amount of money States  get.   The formula by which States get this money is so wildly complicated  that no one could understand it between now and next week. I would  challenge any Republican, other than Bill Cassidy and Lindsey Graham,  to come down and give us an explanation as to how this formula works.  It is the most bizarre Rube Goldberg scheme you could ever imagine, but  in it is a dramatic reduction in Medicaid payments to the State over  time.   So think about this little boy Deacon. Deacon is 10 years old, and he  lives in Ohio. I am just looking here at a picture of him clutching a  Pokemon character. I know what Pokemon character this is. It is  Pikachu. I know that because I have a 9-year-old who is the same age as  Deacon, but, for the grace of God, my 9-year-old is not going through  what Deacon the 10-year-old is going through.   I will just read a little bit about Deacon. He loves playing  baseball, playing video games, volunteering at animal shelters. He  loves being a patient champion for children's hospitals, spending time  with his friends and family, being a big brother, raising money and  awareness for heart disease and defects.   Now, my 9-year-old doesn't enjoy raising awareness for heart disease  and defects. The reason Deacon enjoys doing that is because he has a  condition called hypoplastic left heart syndrome. That is combined with  asthma and acid reflux. It essentially means Deacon has half a heart.  We have whole hearts. Deacon has half a heart.   Right now, everything is controlled for Deacon by medications. He has  had six heart surgeries to get to the point of stability. His heart  will fail--not may fail. His heart will fail. He will go into heart  failure, requiring a heart transplant. That is Deacon's future. The  heart cannot last on the two-chamber system that Deacon's surgeons put  into place.   Affordable, quality insurance means everything to Deacon. Strep  throat could be a death sentence for him. Any little virus that gets  into him and goes into his bloodstream, that is it--game over for 10- year-old Deacon.   His parent writes:         My child is alive because he has Medicaid. That allowed for       him to have the doctors, the surgeons, and the care he has       always needed. Deacon had 6 heart surgeries before 3 years of       age. He has continued medications as well as regular doctors       checkups as he needs them. Because of his diagnosis, he even       has a specialist for simple things like dental care. If he       had not had Medicaid coverage, there is no way I could have       afforded his care. By his first surgery at 10 days, he was  [[Page S5823]]       over the million dollar mark. I would have lost our house       easily, quickly. I am a single mom. Medicaid helps keep my       son alive and healthy, and it has given me my best friend to       love and watch grow up.    Medicaid helps a boy live a normal life. Where we would have never  thought that it would be possible, Medicaid lets a boy with half a  heart be on a baseball team with his friends, a best friend.   This is not hyperbole. This isn't a game. It is not about scoring  political points just because you made a promise that you were going to  repeal the Affordable Care Act in the first year that you had control  of this body. This is about this little boy who lives in a State that  had the wisdom, on a bipartisan basis, to expand Medicaid.   Ohio would be one of the biggest losers under this bill--a massive  withdrawal of billions of dollars away from Ohio's healthcare system,  simply to fulfill a political promise Republicans made.   We are not making this up. We are not trying to tug your heartstrings  just for our own political purposes. Kids are going to die if they  don't have access to healthcare. If 20 million people lose insurance,  as may be the case under this legislation, thousands of people will not  be able to survive. That is $1 million of care. I can guarantee you  that this single parent's home is not worth $1 million. At some point  you just stop being able to provide the care necessary to keep people  alive.    Republicans are treating this like it is a game, talking about taking  a vote next week when no one in this country has looked at this  legislation. Not a single townhall has been held in which your  constituents can weigh in. No Member of this body will have looked at  an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office to know what its impact  is. This bill will be rammed through in the dead of night, I guarantee  you, without any input from people like Deacon and his family.   This is the meanest version of TrumpCare yet, in part because of what  is in it, in part because of the butchered process, but in part because  Deacon's family will not get to come down here and talk to you about it  because you are going to rush it through next week, if reports are to  be believed.   What a great trick Republicans will have pulled on this country.  Everyone said that the repeal bill was dead, that we were going to move  on to a bipartisan process in the HELP Committee, that the Senate was  going to move on to another issue of tax reform. What a great head fake  that would be if it were all a lie, if it were all a ruse just to be  able to give cover for Republicans to quietly muster support for  another devastating assault on America's healthcare while Democrats  were looking hopefully at a bipartisan process playing out in the HELP  Committee that was never intended to result in an outcome.   I hope that is not the case. I really do. I have put enormous faith  and trust in Senator Alexander. Admittedly, I gave him a very hard time  over the course of the first 6 months of this year because I could not  understand what the point was of being on the HELP Committee if we  weren't going to debate a reordering of one-fifth of the economy: the  healthcare system. Why be a member of the HELP Committee if the biggest  reform to the healthcare system during my tenure in the Senate wasn't  going to be debated in the HELP Committee? I thought that was an  abomination.   I have been very pleased that in the last 2 weeks Senator Alexander  has convened a bipartisan process, which I have invested in. I have  shown up to all of those hearings. I have talked to him over and over  again on the floor of the Senate and in these committee meetings. I  have offered constructive suggestions about how we can come up with a  bipartisan fix to the parts of the Affordable Care Act that aren't  working as well, while maintaining the parts that are working. As I sit  here today, I hope and I pray this wasn't all one big ruse to distract  me and the Democratic Members of the Senate while Republicans quietly  worked on building support for the meanest version of TrumpCare yet.  That would be a deceit, and I hope it is not going to be the case.   This isn't a game. People are going to be really, terribly, badly  hurt if this bill becomes law. I don't even know what the effects will  be because we don't have the analysis. We don't have a score. I can  guess. But I have never been part of anything like this in my 20 years  of public service. I have never seen a group of public officials so  hell-bent on achieving a political goal as to throw out decades of  precedent on how this body has normally worked on major pieces of  legislation, shown such casual disregard for good, old-fashioned  nonpartisan analysis as is happening if this bill comes to the floor  without a CBO score.   We can do something together. We can continue the work of the HELP  Committee to pass a truly bipartisan product that admittedly would just  be a start, that could involve real compromise on both sides.  Republicans could compromise by saying: We know we need to have some  stability in these healthcare exchanges, and, thus, we are going to  make sure that President Trump can't take away payments from insurers  or threaten to take them away on a month-to-month basis. Democrats can  recognize that Republicans want flexibility in these exchanges--want  the ability for States to do a little bit more innovation, whether it  be with benefit design or reinsurance pools. We can both give, and we  can get a product that would build trust between both sides, that might  allow us to do something bigger later on.   I have no idea whether Deacon's family is Republican or Democrat. I  have no idea whether his single mother--who is so deeply fearful today  of what Republicans are about to do to her and her child, her best  friend, her 10-year-old son--voted for Donald Trump or voted for  Hillary Clinton. When it hits you--when that heart defect or that  schizophrenia or that heroin addiction or that lung cancer strikes you,  it doesn't discriminate as to whether you are a Democrat or Republican.  It hits you hard no matter who you voted for.   That is why, when we go back home--I know what Republicans hear  because I hear it in Connecticut. They want us to work together. They  are sick and tired of healthcare being a political football that just  gets tossed from one party to the other. We used it to bludgeon  Republicans, and Republicans used it to bludgeon us, and we used it to  bludgeon you, back and forth, and back and forth.   We are on the verge of passing a bill, getting a bill out of the HELP  Committee that might begin to end the use of healthcare as a simple  political bludgeon. That is what our constituents want. We are not  going to have time to get any public polling on this because no one is  going to be able to understand it by next week, but I will guarantee  you, it will poll at the same rate that previous versions of TrumpCare  have polled--in the teens and the twenties, with base Trump voters  being the only folks who support it. That is because people have gotten  hip to what is in here. They don't actually think it is a good idea to  take healthcare away from tens of millions of Americans, but they also  don't like the fact that this has been done behind closed doors. This  has been done with Republicans only. They want this debate to occur in  the open.   Whether they are Republican or Democrat, they want both sides to be a  part of it, and we are closer to that reality than ever before. Pulling  the rug out from under the bipartisan process is not the meanest or  cruelest part, but it is pretty high on the list.   Think about Deacon. Think about the tens of thousands of little boys  and girls like Deacon who live in your State. Don't do this to the  people of America. Don't do this to the U.S. Senate. Don't break this  place beyond recognition by ramming this through without any process or  without any CBO score next week. Let this bipartisan process play out.  Let us build some good faith together. That is what the American people  want, and that is what the American healthcare system needs.   I yield the floor.                            ____________________
