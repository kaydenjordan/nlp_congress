 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my appreciation  for the men and women at the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency.   These Americans work tirelessly to provide the fullest possible  accounting for the 81,000 servicemembers who remain missing from past  conflicts.   Earlier this year, scientists from the DPAA used dental and  anthropological analysis, as well as chest radiograph comparisons, to  positively identify the remains of United States Army Air Forces Staff  Sergeant Wesley ``Bub'' Leon Jones.   Staff Sergeant Jones was killed in action during Operation Tidal Wave  when his B-24 bomber was shot down by enemy forces over Romania in  1943. His remains have been unidentified for more than 80 years.   Thanks to the DPAA, World War II veteran and proud Kansan Wesley  Jones has finally returned home to Wichita and was laid to rest on  Saturday.   I am grateful for the historians, anthropologists, technicians,  doctors, and scientists at the DPAA who are fighting every day to bring  our heroes home.                            leading with strength     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the greatest  threat currently facing the United States of America: the Chinese  Communist Party.   Communist China, led by President Xi, is buying up American farmland,  stealing our intellectual property, investing in our educational  institutions, and spying on our most critical military installations.  Make no mistake, the time of trusting and welcoming China into the  global system is over.   Pushing back against CCP aggression is not partisan. I am proud that  my colleagues on both sides of the aisle came together to create the  bipartisan Select Committee on the Strategic Competition Between the  United States and the Chinese Communist Party to counter President Xi's  efforts to undermine American leadership.   It is vital that we put forward solutions to end our economic  dependence on China, bring our jobs and supply chains back home to the  United States, and make certain that our military is equipped to defend  American interests and sovereignty.   The Chinese Communist Party is knocking at our doorstep, and this  threat is becoming more urgent every single day.   It is crucial that President Biden starts leading with strength on  the world stage to ensure the United States of America remains a beacon  of freedom and hope for millions of people around the world.                paying tribute to kansan miners and big brutus     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of southeast  Kansas' most treasured monuments, Big Brutus.   Standing 16 stories tall and weighing 11 million pounds, Big Brutus  is the largest electric shovel of its kind. The colossal machine is a  towering landmark on the otherwise flatland of West Mineral, Kansas.  Here is a handmade wooden replica constructed by John Johnson.   From 1963 to 1974, Big Brutus was in use for coal strip mining. In a  day's work, Big Brutus could work at a speed of 0.22 miles per hour and  lift 150 tons of coal in a bucket. This efficiency was revolutionary  for its time and dramatically increased the success of coal mining in  the region.   The immortalization of this monument emphasizes the significance of  Big Brutus in the development of engineering, but most importantly, it  stands as a testament to southeast Kansas and the strength and  fortitude of the people who live there.   As Big Brutus celebrates its 60th year, I commemorate the generations  of miners in southeast Kansas for their hard work and dedication.           celebrating the chase county courthouse sesquicentennial     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the  sesquicentennial year of the Chase County Courthouse, the oldest  operational courthouse in Kansas.   The courthouse's construction began in 1871 and was completed in  1873. Each  [[Page H4412]]  year, visitors from across the country visit the Chase County  Courthouse to admire its architectural design, stonework, and spiral  staircase.   Standing 113 feet tall, this iconic structure can be seen from many  vantage points across the county and most prominently in the heart of  downtown Cottonwood Falls.   Unmatched in durability and design, the courthouse remains a living  tribute to its builders and the Flint Hills pioneers who envisioned a  courthouse that would stand and be of service to its residents for well  over a century.   Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the county commissioners, members of the  committee, and the entire Chase County community as they prepare to  celebrate 150 years of their historic courthouse.                            ____________________
