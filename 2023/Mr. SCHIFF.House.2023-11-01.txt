 Madam Speaker, due to a cancelled flight and another  flight with mechanical issues, I was unable to cast my vote for  legislation considered on the House floor today. Had I been able to be  present, I would have voted ``yea'' on rollcall 559--Motion to Table H.  Res. 829, ``yea'' on rollcall 560--H. Res. 559, ``yea'' on rollcall  561--H.R. 340, ``yea'' on rollcall 562--Motion to recommit to H.R.  4364, ``nay'' on rollcall 563--Final Passage of H.R. 4364, and ``yea''  on rollcall 564--Adoption of H. Res. 773.                            ____________________
