 Madam Speaker, I rise today to say how pleased I am that  Congress has reauthorized the National Earthquake Hazards Reduction  Program, or NEHRP.   I am grateful to Senator Feinstein, as well as my colleagues in the  House--Representatives Rohrabacher, Knight, and Lamar Smith--for their  leadership in bringing this forward. This has been an important issue  to me since I was in the State senate, given my State's--Washington  State's--geography and the serious threats that we face from  earthquakes.   NEHRP reauthorization is the very first step to ensure that our  States have the resources they need to prepare for earthquakes, States  like mine that have been anticipating a catastrophic earthquake for  many years.   As we have watched tragedies unfold around the world, it is clear  that we have to do everything we can to build resilience so that when  earthquakes inevitably strike, our communities are as prepared as they  can be. This reauthorization will ensure that all of our communities  are able to improve their building standards, have early warning  systems, and have better monitoring for seismic activity.   I hope this bill will be one of many, and that we continue to build  on this progress to ensure ample investment to build resilience, in  particular for schools and hospitals. I look forward to working with my  colleagues to push this forward in the next Congress.                            ____________________
