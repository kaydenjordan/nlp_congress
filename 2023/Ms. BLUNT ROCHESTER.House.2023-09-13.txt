 Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend, the leader,  for organizing this Special Order hour and especially for his steadfast  leadership of the Regional Leadership Council.   What I love about Steny is that his whole focus on this is about  implementation, but it is also about informing people about all the  things that have been done to support the American people.   I thank Mr. Hoyer and Leader Hakeem Jeffries for creating and  organizing our group, and I am honored to represent my colleagues of  Region 9, which includes the States of New Jersey, Maryland, Virginia,  the District of Columbia, and my home State of Delaware.   Our region, like the entire Regional Leadership Council, has been  focused on the implementation of the historic legislation passed in the  117th Congress and signed into law by President Joe Biden and Vice  President Kamala Harris when Democrats put people over politics and  delivered transformational change.   Leaders like Representative Jennifer McClellan in Virginia's Fourth  Congressional District have delivered results for her constituents,  funding to reconnect Richmond's historic Jackson Ward neighborhood that  was split in half during the construction of the interstate highway  system. This funding was delivered through the bipartisan  infrastructure law and is reconnecting communities.   Chairman  Bobby Scott was able to secure over $400 million for the  city of Norfolk in Virginia's Third Congressional District to help  create more climate-resilient infrastructure in the face of increased  flooding.   Representatives Kweisi Mfume,   John Sarbanes, and Dutch  Ruppersberger also celebrated the launch of a new workforce hub in  Baltimore that came as a direct result of the Chips and Science Act.  The hub will help train workers to step into good-paying jobs and build  the region's skilled workforce all while catalyzing investments in  clean energy.

After decades of effort, with families waiting  and struggling when nobody believed them, our veterans in this country  started a movement for better healthcare. We, under Democratic  leadership, not only believed them but fought for them and were able to  turn that into action with the passage of the PACT Act.   Before you here is the result of a resource fair that we did in  Delaware. My office did a constituent resource fair where we had  hundreds of Delawareans come out to learn about resources from dozens  of Federal, State, and nonprofit agencies. On the spot, 30 veterans  were able to sign up and be screened for the PACT Act. Those were  benefits that now those families will be able to have.   I am going to tell a story that is personal and goes back over 20  years of a small town in Delaware called Ellendale, a rural community  reliant on well water. Residents of Ellendale had been forced to bathe,  cook with, and drink dirty water. They had fought for decades to secure  a local connection to clean and reliable drinking water.   Here they are holding the water in their hands.   With the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the  historic investments made through the Inflation Reduction Act, small,  rural towns like Ellendale will finally be able to open their taps and  know that clean, drinkable water will be flowing from them, meaning  that they will be healthier and able to thrive. I am so proud of the  work that we have been able to do.   Lastly, I would just say this: All of our work has expanded drinking  water across this country. Drinking Water State Revolving Funds have  gotten $14 billion, provided over $500 million directly to small and  disadvantaged communities and over $500 million to remediate lead  contamination. Included was a provision that I authored for the first- of-its-kind, low-income water bill assistance program.   I will end with this: We came out of a pandemic as a country. Don't  forget where we came from. The 117th Congress, with President Joe  Biden, passed historic legislation that will provide for the American  people clean drinking water, clean air, access to the internet, cheaper  healthcare, newer roads and bridges, and more jobs.   The bottom line is, we put politics to the side, and we supported the  people. We didn't just do it with words. We did it with action. We  delivered for Delaware, and we delivered for the American people.
