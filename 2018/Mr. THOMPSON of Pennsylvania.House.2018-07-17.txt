 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on Made in  America Day to speak about American craftsmanship, specifically in the  Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.   American entrepreneurs, workers, farmers, and innovators have built  this country and drive our economy. They are the heart of this Nation,  and they ensure that the Made in the USA label means quality and value,  which is something we treasure.   Pennsylvania has a rich history of being a manufacturing leader,  especially our storied Pennsylvania steel. The Commonwealth has been an  important cog in the wheel of this country's Industrial Revolution,  thanks to industries like iron, coal, and lumber, in addition to steel.  Our Pennsylvania farmers have fed, and continue to feed, generations of  Americans, providing safe, nutritious food for all our neighbors.   This rich history continues today. The Pennsylvania Fifth  Congressional District is home to numerous producers that have made  vital contributions to our prosperity. They have employed American  workers, produced American products, and grown American crops. From  heritage companies to newer, rising stars, we have a wide cross-section  of products produced in Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District.   Brookville Equipment Corporation in Jefferson County is the leading  manufacturer of diesel locomotive engines, street trolleys, and mining  machinery. Brookville's mass transit resume includes fully refurbishing  streetcars for cities including New Orleans, Philadelphia, and San  Francisco.   Since 1889, W.R. Case & Sons Cutlery Company has been fashioning  handcrafted pocketknives and sporting knives in McKean County,  Pennsylvania.   Zippo Manufacturing Company, makers of the world-famous Zippo  windproof lighter, owns Case Knives today. Zippo is another family- owned business based in Bradford, McKean County, since 1936.   Clarion Industries has two divisions in Clarion County: Clarion  Boards, which produces high-quality fiberboard used to manufacture  products such as laminate flooring, furniture, fixtures, cabinetry, and  moldings; and Clarion Laminates, the only Made in the USA laminate  flooring manufacturer of its kind.   Emporium Powdered Metal, Inc. in Cameron County is a powdered metal  manufacturer staffed with more than 120 years of combined experience.   Welch's in Erie County is particularly known for its grape juices,  jams, and jellies made from dark Concord grapes and its white Niagara  grape juice.   Clearfield Machine Company has been producing custom machining since  1868 in Clearfield County.   Since 1830, the Woolrich name has stood for the best in sportswear  for men and women, and it continues to make outerwear that combines  comfort and function in Woolrich, Pennsylvania, in Clinton County.   Major leaguers have been swinging our fine Pennsylvania hardwoods,  thanks to Jefferson County's BWP Bats. BWP's slogan is ``Built With  Pride.''   Huntingdon County's Bonney Forge has a state-of-the-art forge  facility capable of manufacturing our entire line of forged steel  fitting and forged steel valve products since 1875.   Diamond Back Truck Covers is a company two Penn State students  started in their garage in 2003. They made heavy-duty, utility-oriented  diamond plate aluminum truck bed covers for pickup trucks in  Philipsburg, Pennsylvania, in Centre County.   Domtar Paper Company in Elk County is the largest integrated producer  of uncoated free-sheet paper in North America and the second largest in  the world, based on production capacity.   Pull-A-Pump in Potter County manufactures portable pump pulling  machines for those in need of water well technology, with a unique dual  traction belt design that is second to none.   Whirley Industries Incorporated in Warren County designs, develops,  and produces products for the food and beverage industry.   Centre County also boasts many new rising stars in high-tech  industries, including KCF Technologies, a dynamic technology company  that develops and commercializes products for industry and the  military.   Mr. Speaker, this is just a sample of the manufacturers who employ  our friends and neighbors in Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional  District. These companies and many others produce quality, American- made products, and we cannot be more proud to celebrate them during  Made in America Week.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule  I, I demand a vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the  Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on  the ground that a quorum is not present and make the point of order  that a quorum is not present.    Mr. Speaker, I recently introduced the  Skills Investment Act of 2018 with Congressman Derek Kilmer to allow  American workers to invest in their own futures.   This bill would create lifelong learning accounts workers could use  to pay for skills-based education, career-related learning, and  professional development. In an ever-changing economy, I know that such  accounts would be put to good use.   As co-chair of the bipartisan House Career and Technical Education  Caucus, I fully support expanding access to skills-based educational  opportunities and professional development.   The tax treatment of these savings accounts would be similar to a  health savings account. Mid-career workers could contribute up to  $4,000 tax free each year, with a maximum contribution limit of  $10,000. Employers would receive a 25 percent tax credit for  contributions to a worker's account. Workers of all ages can use the  account at any time to learn skills to make them more competitive as  the economy changes.   This bill is a commonsense approach to investing in the American  worker. I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor it today.                            ____________________
