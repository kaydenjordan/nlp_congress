 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my good friend, the  former and I hope future chairman of the Education and the Workforce  Committee, for yielding.   Why are my friends on the other side of the aisle trying to punish  those who show basic decency? The so-called Schools Not Shelters Act  targets one thing--compassion.   Let me tell you a story. In September 2011, my community faced a  sudden weather emergency with flooding. The combination of blocked  culverts and relentless rainfall created a flood that swept through a  very vulnerable mobile home community called Holly Acres in Woodbridge,  Virginia.   The damage to Holly Acres was swift and severe. Sixty percent of the  homes in that community were left wholly condemned and uninhabitable.  People were put out of their homes immediately.   Thankfully, our local emergency personnel sprung into action. They  conducted swift water rescues to save the lives of women and children  who lived in this predominantly Hispanic community, largely  undocumented, and evacuated them to our local high school for shelter.   Immediately, my team and I descended on the scene. The instincts  [[Page H3677]]  from my experience in local government kicked in. We coordinated  provisions of toys, of which there were none, and clothes. All they had  were the wet clothes on their bodies. They couldn't access warm clothes  on their own. Hot meals from the Red Cross, none of which had been  planned, were distributed to this dislocated community, many of whom  were still in wet clothes from their evacuation.   If the Republicans have their way, this kind of tragedy would have  been compounded by robbing the school system of desperately needed  funding because they were undocumented. Well, from my point of view,  they were human beings in need, emergent need. My values said that we  had to reach out, that we had to help. Their status was immaterial.  Their need, their compelling need in front of our faces, is what drove  our actions.   Thank God the school was able to shelter them. Subsequently, they  were able to get housing.                                time  1645    These kinds of things happen all over the place, and my community  wants to express its values in offering a helping hand irrespective of  one's legal status in this country.   Human beings are human beings.   This legislation punishes those who show kindness in the face of such  an emergency, and it does nothing to benefit our students or children.  All it does is take away from our schools the crime of caring for  others.
