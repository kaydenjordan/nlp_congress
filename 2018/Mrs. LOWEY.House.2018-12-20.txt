 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, last night, the Senate unanimously passed legislation  that would fund our government through February 8. Democrats are  disappointed that Congress would kick the can down the road once again;  yet, we remain willing to pass that bill to keep the government open.   Unfortunately, even that simple, stopgap measure is apparently  unacceptable to a President hell-bent on shutting down the government  over his wasteful wall. And instead of showing leadership and moving  forward with the Senate legislation, despite the President's tweets,  House Republicans have caved once again to Trump's political whims.   They now have put up this grab bag of legislation that wastes  taxpayer dollars, fails to meet the urgent needs of disaster victims,  and, frankly, is dead on arrival in the Senate.   With all the challenges facing our country, from soaring healthcare  costs to crumbling infrastructure, it is inconceivable that Republicans  want to spend $5.7 billion on an unnecessary wall that President Trump  himself promised Mexico would pay for.   Moreover, the disaster supplemental attached to this bill  shortchanges nutrition needs in Puerto Rico, needs that were apparent  16 months ago. Republicans have continued their pattern of denying  science by grossly underfunding mitigation and resilience against  future disasters caused by climate change.   Mr. Speaker, this bill is nothing but another attempt by lameduck  Republicans to appease President Trump. It is a fitting final act for  the most chaotic and dysfunctional Congress in modern history.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose this reckless and irresponsible bill. I urge my  colleagues to reject this legislation, and, instead, pass the Senate's  clean CR. Keep our government open, and prevent a Trump shutdown. I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the ranking member of the Energy  and Water Development, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from New York (Mr. Serrano),  [[Page H10494]]  the ranking member of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related  Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price), the ranking member of the  Transportation, House and Urban Development, and Related Agencies  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Roybal-Allard), who is the ranking member of the  Homeland Security Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), who is a senior member of the Appropriations  Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished  gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who is the Democratic whip.  [[Page H10496]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman from Maryland an  additional 1 minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the ranking member of the Labor, Health and  Human Services, and Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I want to make it clear that most of the  opioids,  [[Page H10497]]  the drugs, are coming through the ports of entry.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr.  Bishop), the ranking member of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food  and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on the  Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio  (Mr. Ryan), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Legislative  Branch.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the ranking member of the Subcommittee  on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Quigley), the ranking member of the Financial Services  Subcommittee.                                time  1930     Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, Democrats support strong, smart border security, but we  will not allow Republicans to fleece American taxpayers by making them  pay $5.7 billion for Trump's ineffective wall. I remind my friends that  88 percent of opioids seized come through the port of entry. Let's get  the facts on the table.   I will say my other comment includes praising Chairman Frelinghuysen  for his distinguished career in public service, for the debates on a  bill that has an actual chance at becoming law.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
