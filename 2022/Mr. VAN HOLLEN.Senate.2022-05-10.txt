 Madam President, first, I want to thank my friend and  colleague, the Senator from Michigan, for coming to the floor to share  his own powerful and personal story and the stories of his constituents  about why so many of us are here on the Senate floor this evening, and  it is because 8 days ago, our country received a terrible wake-up call.  A leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court of the United States  indicated that a majority of five Justices may be on the verge of  overturning the constitutional protections of reproductive freedom set  forth in Roe v. Wade.   We don't know if this draft opinion will be the final decision, but  we do know there is a very high chance that the Supreme Court of the  United States will soon blow up 50 years of precedent and strip women  of their constitutional right to make choices about their own body and  their own self-determination.   And while the content of this opinion is shocking, it is not totally  surprising. This is the premeditated outcome of years--years--of  plotting and planning by the rightwing legal movement and the  Republican Party.   Candidate Donald Trump promised the Nation he would handpick Justices  who would overturn Roe v. Wade. On the campaign trail, he even claimed  that Roe would be overturned ``immediately'' once he assumed office.  And he stated on national television that women who receive abortions  should be punished. Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans made up  their own rules and then broke their own rules in order to play their  part in this scheme.   First, Senate Republicans refused to even hold a hearing on President  Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland, on the grounds that it  was a Presidential election year.   Four years later, Senate Republicans rushed through one of President  Trump's own Supreme Court nominees just weeks before the 2020 election.   And in between, Senate Republicans carved out an exception to the  Senate filibuster rule so they could push through all three of Trump's  anti-choice Supreme Court picks: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy  Coney Barrett.   Each of these nominees raised their right hand before the Senate  Judiciary Committee and swore under oath that they respected the weight  of judicial precedent. In fact, when Brett Kavanaugh was asked about  Roe v.  [[Page S2410]]  Wade, he pointed to Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which affirmed the  core holding in Roe establishing a constitutional right to abortion,  and he called the decision in Casey ``precedent on precedent,'' a  double precedent.   But let's be very clear, this draft opinion has no respect for  judicial precedent. If the draft holds, all three of President Trump's  nominees to the Supreme Court, along with some others already on the  Bench, will have deliberately deceived and defrauded the American  public.   Rightwing ideologues set out to stack the Court with Justices ready  and willing to overturn Roe v. Wade.   Now, this rightwing establishment, this machinery, is on the verge of  achieving their goal, even though their win will be a horrible loss for  the reputation of the Supreme Court, a horrible loss for the integrity  of our Constitution, and most of all, a horrible loss for the American  people.   More than half of the women and girls of reproductive age in our  country live in States that would likely ban or severely restrict  abortion if the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade.   Thirteen States have so-called trigger laws that will kick into  effect automatically the day Roe is overturned. Nine States have passed  laws that were struck down in the past because they violated the  protections of Roe, but those laws could come back if Roe v. Wade is  overturned.   Many of these laws we are talking about are extreme. One trigger law  in Kentucky would ban all abortions at any point in pregnancy, with no  exceptions for rape, no exceptions for incest, or a situation in which  a child could be born with a fatal birth defect.    Another trigger law in Idaho would make providing an abortion at any  point in pregnancy and under almost any circumstances a felony crime  punishable by 5 years in prison. A Texas law that is on the books right  now would put doctors in jail or fine them up to $10,000 for  prescribing pills for medication abortions through telehealth or the  mail for women who are more than 7 weeks pregnant.   And a law that has been on the books since 1931 in Michigan would  snap back into effect, making nearly all abortions at any point in  pregnancy a felony. And women who undergo medication abortions would be  made felons, even in the case of rape and incest.   Just last week, State legislators in the Louisiana House advanced a  bill through committee that would allow women who obtain abortions at  any time in pregnancy to be prosecuted for murder--for murder.   Experts say that this extreme law could also be used to restrict  emergency contraception and in vitro fertilization, which is a critical  process that helps customers with infertility build their families.   Like many of our colleagues, I have been hearing from my  constituents, my constituents in the State of Maryland, who have  learned just how dangerous this situation is for women and families  across the country. One constituent named Connie shared her story of  taking emergency contraception after she was attacked and raped by a  stranger at the age of 18.   She told me about the importance of being able to make that choice  about her body and her future instead of potentially becoming pregnant  because of a rape. Today, Connie is a social worker, a therapist, and  has a wonderful son.   I have received other testimonials from constituents across the State  of Maryland who have shared their stories and expressed their deep  concern and fear about the Court striking down Roe v. Wade.   If Roe was overturned, women living in States where safe and legal  abortion is banned will have to travel away from their homes, away from  their communities, away from their families simply to exercise control  over their own bodies.   Those who lack the money or the time will either be forced to carry  an unwanted pregnancy to term or find somebody performing abortions in  the shadows in their States, a throwback to the dangerous back-alley  abortions.   In 1965, 8 years before the Roe v. Wade decision, illegal abortion  accounted for 17 percent--17 percent--of all deaths attributed to  pregnancy and childbirth. That past could soon be our present.   So, you see, this Supreme Court decision doesn't just turn back the  clock on precedent, it turns back the clock on public health as it  strips women of their reproductive freedoms.   And in a world where Roe has been overturned, as you drive across our  great country, your rights will change from State to State as you cross  each State border. That is the result of taking away a constitutional  right, and that is why polling shows the great majority of the American  people do not want the Supreme Court to take away the rights under Roe  v. Wade.   Now, I am proud to represent a State that has codified a woman's  right to reproductive choice. In fact, during my very first campaign  for public office, the right to reproductive choice was the defining  issue in my election to the Maryland General Assembly. It was another  time when there was great fear that a Supreme Court might overturn Roe  v. Wade.   And so I ran on the pro-choice ticket, and after I was sworn in, in a  matter of months, my colleagues and I passed a bill in 1991 codifying  Roe v. Wade as a matter of Maryland State law.   But here is the thing, laws like the one we have in Maryland, laws  like the one we passed back in 1991, will be on the chopping block if  this decades-long, rightwing project continues to go according to plan  because the Republicans' ultimate objective isn't just to overturn Roe  v. Wade; it is to enact a Federal law passed in this Senate and in the  House banning abortion nationwide.   Last week, Leader McConnell acknowledged that a national ban on  abortion was a real possibility during an interview with USA TODAY.  That should sound alarm bells all over America.   This has been a two-step process. Step No. 1, strike down the  constitutional protections of Roe v. Wade that prohibit elected  officials, whether it is State legislatures or in Congress, from  enacting laws that prohibit or restrict unnecessarily the right to  choose. That is step No. 1. It seems we are on the verge of that  happening.   Once you clear the way, step No. 2, enact a Federal law in Congress  banning abortion everywhere in the country, and we have seen exactly  how extreme those laws can be from the State examples I cited earlier.  That could happen here if this Republican, rightwing project sees its  logical end; that Federal law would supersede Maryland's law. If  Congress passed that law and it was enacted, State laws like those in  Maryland protecting the right to choose in Maryland would be knocked  off the books. That is true of other State laws, statutes, that protect  a woman's right to choose.   No woman in America would be safe to obtain a safe and legal abortion  if such a national law were enacted.   Now, everyone should also understand another huge danger posed by the  draft. Its flawed logic not only would dismantle the right to an  abortion, it could also be used to strip away other rights protected by  the Constitution.   I have read Justice Alito's draft opinion. I have read all 98 pages  of it.   In this opinion, Justice Alito tries to distinguish this case on  abortion from other cases involving other individual rights. Alito  claims that this case is special because it involves abortion and the  State's interest in protecting life, while other cases do not. Well,  that is obvious on its face, but it misses the bigger danger in Alito's  opinion.   Because it doesn't change the fact that Justice Alito's reasoning for  dismantling the right to obtain an abortion can be used to dismantle  many other rights that we currently take for granted as well. Justice  Alito claims that, even as you look at the entire Constitution, you  cannot find a right to choose for women; that you cannot derive that  from the Constitution.   In fact, on page 5 of the draft opinion, Justice Alito writes:         The Constitution makes no reference to abortion, and no       such right is implicitly protected by any constitutional       provision.    And if we follow Justice Alito's flawed logic, the same could be said  of a host of other rights that are not specifically named in the  Constitution. The Constitution doesn't have the word ``contraception''  in it. The Constitution doesn't talk about consenting adults engaged in  sexual relations.  [[Page S2411]]    Look, this is the thing: Over time, the Supreme Court has recognized  components of liberty through a close analysis of the Bill of Rights  and the 14th Amendment, and that includes the right to use  contraception, the right of consenting adults to have sexual relations  with who they choose, and the right to marry who you love.   These are rights the American people don't want elected officials to  take away, whether they are State legislatures or Members of the Senate  or the House. But they are all at peril too if the logic of Alito's  reasoning is played out. And the terrible irony--the terrible irony-- here is those who most claim to oppose government regulations of any  kind are now the ones rushing to regulate the most intimate, personal,  and private aspects of American life. They say they don't want  government having any role in their life--get out of my way--except for  when it comes to them taking away this right and planning to pass laws  that would ban abortion nationally, and as I said, open the door to  going after other liberties as well.   So those are the stakes that we are facing as we gather here this  evening in anticipation of tomorrow's vote. And that is why we are  taking this vote tomorrow. That is why we need to pass the Women's  Health Protection Act, but even if we fall short this time, having a  vote now is important. It is important to the country. Democracy  requires accountability, and it is important that the American people  know where each of the Senators stands on this issue. It is a  fundamental question.   So as we move into November toward the midterm elections, the  American people will be watching closely how Members of this body vote  on this fundamental constitutional question. And they will look to see  who voted to strip away constitutional rights and who rose to protect  them. And I believe that the majority of this country--the overwhelming  majority of this country--wants to stand up to protect fundamental  liberties in the Constitution of the United States.   I yield the floor.
