 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for  yielding on such an important topic.   I am glad to be here tonight because I think it is important that we  go out and make our case to the American people and tell the truth,  which is not what you are going to hear in the media or from our  Democratic colleagues, as we have heard earlier today.   The government now has been shut down for 25 days, breaking the  record for the longest partial government shutdown in history. We would  like to express our empathy and concern for those affected, and may  this be resolved sooner than later.   Why has this been so long? Because Democrats refuse to come to the  table to negotiate a solution. Instead, they would rather bring up  messaging bills that don't fund vital programs. Also, they can say they  didn't support President Trump's border wall.    In fact, today, we passed a bill that passed in the House that we  passed last Congress. It was on hatred and hate speech and all that.  They won't address this issue. They want to walk away from this.   They don't want to support President Trump's border wall so they can  go to their constituents and say they won. This is all about the 2020  Presidential election. They aren't concerned about border security or  the security of the American people.   This is not a game. We are not talking about a game. We are talking  about the rule of law, security for the American people and our Nation.   This President has been confronted with an unprecedented degree of  obstruction from the Democratic Party. President Trump has asked the  Democratic leadership if they would negotiate over the wall if the  government was reopened. Speaker Pelosi said no. She has said over and  over again that walls are immoral and not one penny for a wall.   Ms. Pelosi, I am asking you, and the American people are asking you,  to do what is right: negotiate border security and pay our patriotic  workers who aren't getting paid.   This obstruction is unnecessary and hypocritical. How is funding for  border security unreasonable? The answer is that it isn't.                                time  1745    Democrats have supported fences at the border in the past. In 2006,  over half the Democratic Senators, including Hillary Clinton, Chuck  Schumer, and Barack Obama, voted to build 700 miles of security fence;  138 Democratic House Members voted for that bill.   Democrats must realize the importance of border security but would  rather sacrifice security for political gamesmanship. This is a matter  of national security and can no longer be ignored.   On average, 2,000 inadmissible, illegal migrants arrive at our  southern border daily. That means, in the last 25 days, approximately  50,000 illegal migrants have sought entry at our border without going  through the proper channels. And there are proper channels.   I remain a strong supporter of border security and will continue to  defend the need for this essential funding. Our porous border and weak  enforcement laws have allowed for illegal immigrants to go unchecked.  Liberal cities and liberal States with liberal policies supported by  our liberal colleagues continually put Americans in jeopardy.   Just last night, three MS-13 gang members were picked up and arrested  for assault on a 16-year-old. Their ages were 20, 19, and 17. All three  were gang members of MS-13. Two of them had been previously released by  a Federal judge, and all confirmed that they came into this country in  2016 under President Obama's illegal DACA program.   If you talk to the Democrats, they tell you that $5.7 billion is too  much to  [[Page H594]]  pay for protection at our southern border; but what they won't tell you  is, if the U.S. were to grant amnesty or a path to citizenships for all  illegal aliens currently living in our country, it would cost an  estimated $2.6 trillion. That is an easy choice from the perspective of  $5.7 billion as the price to pay for our national security.   We are facing unprecedented obstructionism from the Democrats, and we  can't reward them by backing down. We can and will win if we continue  to fight.   When I talk to people in my district, when you can break down why are  we here, what our cause is, and what our principles are, they support  us. People on the border that are border security guards support us.   That is why I believe the Democrats will have to come to their senses  and negotiate as more and more Americans support our view from what you  have heard here today. I appreciate the Freedom Caucus for standing up  and pointing these things out.   Meanwhile, this shutdown wore on through the weekend, and I along  with my Republican colleagues stayed in town to end it, but the  Democrats chose, instead, to go to Puerto Rico to party with over 100  D.C. lobbyists while calling on non-U.S. citizens to be able to have  the right to vote, and they watched the play, ``Hamilton.''   It is no wonder we haven't been able to negotiate a deal with the  Democrats. They won't deal. In the face of their refusal to negotiate,  we don't have any choice. I and my colleagues are prepared to be here  through the weekend, every weekend, until we can put enough pressure on  the other party to be reasonable and come to a solution.   The right thing to do is to negotiate.    Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my colleague and great  friend, Mr. Rice, for allowing me this opportunity. The gentleman is  truly a man of the people.   Madam Speaker, 25 days, 25 days the government has been shut down--25  days--making this the longest shutdown in U.S. history.   Why has this been so long? It is because the Democrats refuse to come  to the table and negotiate a solution. Instead, they would rather bring  up messaging bills that don't fund vital programs, all so that they can  say they didn't support increased border security.   Well, let's take a look at the last 25 days.   On the average, 2,000 inadmissible migrants arrive at our southern  border daily. That means, in the last 25 days, approximately 50,000  illegal migrants have sought entry at our border without going through  the proper channels. And there are proper channels.   Additionally, in December, 27,518 family unit aliens were apprehended  for crossing the border illegally. If those numbers remain consistent,  that means over 21,429 family unit aliens have been apprehended for  illegally crossing in the last 25 days.   In fiscal 2018, 2,028 illegal aliens arrested had homicide charges.  If this number remains consistent, that means 139 homicide charges for  illegal aliens in the last 25 days.   Further, on an average, 300 Americans die per week from heroin, and  90 percent of that heroin in the U.S. comes through our southern  border. That means, in the last 25 days, approximately 1,000 Americans  have died  [[Page H598]]  because of heroin illegally crossing our border.   This doesn't even include the amount of fentanyl that crossed our  southern border in fiscal year 2017, which was enough to kill every  single American via overdose.   If you talk to the Democrats, they will tell you $5.7 billion is too  much to pay for protection at our southern border, but what they won't  tell you is how much more it costs the Federal Government and American  citizens by not securing our border.   The argument the Democrats want you to believe is that this argument  is strictly about the border wall. Therefore, they fear, if President  Trump gets any funding for the wall, they lose, like this is some kind  of game that we are playing to win.   This is about them wanting power and winning the White House in  2020--shameful.   This is about border security, period.   Democrats, I ask you to do what is right: Come to the negotiating  table to end this shutdown. You don't lose, but America wins.
