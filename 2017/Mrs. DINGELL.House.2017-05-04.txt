 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this  misguided legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act.   This vote might be the single most important issue our Congress deals  with. It literally means life or death for too many people in our  country.   What we vote on today is ultimately a reflection of our values as a  nation. I believe that we have a moral responsibility to take care of  the most vulnerable among us. The nuns taught me that. The Bible  teaches us that. They are the sick, the poor, the elderly. This  dangerous bill does nothing to protect them. In fact, it will do more  harm to our most vulnerable.   There are 129 million Americans who suffer from a preexisting  condition. They are our neighbors, our friends, and, for some, our  family. They are the people attending their townhall meetings.   For me, I am a caregiver. I spend more time at the hospital and with  the doctors than I want to. Person after person comes up to me and  tells me their story and begs me not to lose their insurance. Healthy  Michigan let them go to the doctor for the first time.   The Affordable Care Act made a guarantee that someone with a  preexisting condition could not be charged more than healthy people and  that coverage would be available to all.   Please vote against this shameful bill.
