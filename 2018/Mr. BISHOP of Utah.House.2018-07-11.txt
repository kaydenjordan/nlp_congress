 Mr. Chair, this bill is the result of more than 6  years of work with commercial and recreational fishing groups, the  seafood industry, coastal communities, and both sides of the aisle. It  is a bipartisan bill that codifies the Obama-era guidelines and  provides flexibility for fishery managers.   It is a good bill, but I do want to address some of the  inconsistencies that have been circulated by Members or NGOs. At least  let me hit some of the most gross inaccuracies. In dissenting views, it  was written that:         Don Young agreed to work with Democratic Members and the       staff to develop a bipartisan bill. Unfortunately, Chairman       Bishop pulled the plug on promising negotiations and rushed       to markup with a half-baked mash-up of bad ideas.    This bill was a year in negotiation. Our efforts of trying to put  numerous provisions on the table and accepting additional Democratic  provisions were simply labeled as nonstarters. Every time Mr. Young  agreed to a change, another issue came up. It is a perfect example of  Lucy pulling the ball out from under Charlie Brown. Mr. Young is  Charlie Brown.   Mr. Chair, I am appreciative, though, of certain off-committee  Democrats who jumped at the opportunity to compromise. I especially  want to thank Mr. Veasey and Mr. Green for their willingness to work  across the aisle and assist with cosponsoring this particular bill.   Opponents of this bill said there is no science; that it is being  taken out of the management decisions. Science and data appear 34 times  throughout the bill. Sections 207, 208, 301, 303, and 306, all require  the Secretary to use science, which means, if Mr. Young were trying to  remove science from his bill and the process, he really did a crappy  job at it.   This bill is also coming with the old canard that we are going to  start overfishing. There is nothing in this bill that removes basic  requirements that prevent overfishing, and it is consistent with  guidelines for fishery management that were put forth in the Obama  administration.   Another dissenting point that was made says that this bill is nothing  more than a partisan measure. It is a cute idea, but something that is  simply not there. Letters from scientists, many of them--in fact, most  of them--do not conduct the type of research that underpins fisheries  management. All have said that all of these agencies, the ESA, NEPA,  and the Antiquities Act, whatever, are going to be destroyed because of  this bill.   There was one specifically from the Seafood Harvesters of America  that was brought to my attention because in that particular letter that  was dated in June of this year, the group claimed that section 12  repealed sections of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. That is really cute  because there is no section 12 in this act.   Section 12 hasn't been a part of this bill since November of 2017. In  the opposition letters to this particular bill, there have always been  references to previous versions of the bill, or they failed to  recognize significant changes that were added, compromises that were  added by both Mr. Young and Mr. Graves in their manager's amendment.   The kind of rhetoric that is opposed to this particular bill that we  are seeing, in the past from NGOs, embodies what is wrong with  Washington. I hope that everyone can see these kind of glaring  inaccuracies   I am proud to support this bill. This bill does provide science. This  bill does go through the process. This bill does move us forward. This  bill does help commercial fishing and recreational fishing and the  communities that are involved there. It is a good step forward. It has  been 6 years in the coming. It has been 1 year of heavy work right now.  It needs to go forward.   Mr. Chair, I appreciate the opportunity of speaking and supporting  this bill.
