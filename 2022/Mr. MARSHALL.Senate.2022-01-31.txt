 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize VADM  Paul Frederick Foster, USN, of Wichita, KS, on the 50th anniversary of  his passing. Foster was the first Naval Officer to receive the  Congressional Medal of Honor. Moreover, he earned the Navy Cross, the  Distinguished Service Award, and Navy Merit Commendation. VADM Paul  Frederick Foster was a true American hero.   Paul Foster was in Wichita, KS, in 1889. He was the son of a  traveling minister and thus grew up in Kansas, Utah, Oklahoma, and  finally Idaho. There, he would attend the University of Idaho for 1  year before earning an appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy in  Annapolis, MD, from Senator Fred Dubois of Idaho in 1907. In June 1911,  Foster exited the Naval Academy as a passed midshipman with a bachelor  of science. He was commissioned as ensign in July 1911. After  graduation he would be attached to the USS Washington, but by December  was quickly transferred to the USS Utah, a battleship in the Atlantic  Fleet.   In the beginning of 1914, the United States chose to intercede in the  Mexican Revolution. While on its way to Mexico, the USS Utah was  instructed to intercept a German ship carrying arms intended for the  Mexican dictator Victoriano Huerta. The German ship arrived in Veracruz  before the Utah, which resulted in the American occupation of the city.  During the fighting on April 21 and 22, Foster led his company ashore.  For distinguished conduct in battle, he was awarded the Medal of Honor.   Paul Frederick Foster would go on to serve as commanding officer of  multiple submarines during World War I. During his service a  submariner, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant commander and was  decorated with the Navy Distinguished Service Medal for the sinking  enemy submarine. At the outset of U.S involvement in World War II,  Foster was called for Active Duty at the rank of commander. He was  tasked with naval inspections. The highest rank he would achieve was  vice admiral at the time of his second retirement from the Navy. After  the war, Paul Frederick Foster was appointed to the Atomic Energy  Commission in Vienna, Austria, by President Eisenhower.   It is my honor to commemorate VADM Paul Frederick Foster for his  [[Page S413]]  heroic military service. Today, I send my best wishes to his son, Rear  Admiral Paul L. Foster SC, USN-Ret.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a truly  incredible, and historic performance on the basketball court from K- State's own, Ayoka Lee.   Ayoka is the starting center for the Kansas State Women's Basketball  Team and recently set the NCAA all-time record on January 23 in  Bramlage Coliseum for most points in a single game, scoring an  astounding 61 points against the 14th-ranked Oklahoma Sooners. To put  into perspective just how extraordinary this is, the entire Oklahoma  roster only scored 65 points against the Wildcats in that game. There  is not much more I enjoy than seeing my alma mater win, so this record  performance truly brings immense pride to myself and every other K- State alumni.   It is also no surprise that Ayoka was able to achieve this, given her  resume. She came to Manhattan as a top 50 national recruit out of high  school, then went on to be Big 12 freshman of the year, and First Team  All Big-12 her freshman and sophomore year. Not to mention, she has  also been on the Big 12 Commissioner's Honor Roll four times. Now in  her junior year, Ayoka will surely be First-Team All Big-12 again and  is even in the Wooden Award Top-25 Watch List. If this 61-point  performance doesn't earn her the Wooden award, it has at least won her  a spot in every K-Stater's heart, and we are all thrilled to hear about  her plans to come back and play in her final year of NCAA eligibility  as she completes her master's degree in the Little Apple.   I ask my colleagues now to join me in recognizing this outstanding  achievement by Ayoka Lee. She has made the K-State community proud, and  we are all rooting for her to succeed in her career and can't wait to  see her and the team bring home a national championship. ``Go  Cats!''                            ____________________
