 Madam Speaker, thanks to my chairman in exile.   Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1425, the slow  coronavirus cures act.   There are many problematic provisions in this bill, but, ultimately,  it is yet another political ploy that will not be considered in the  Senate or become law, and we don't want it to be because it is not  good.   This bill is a step toward nationalizing the drug industry and  opening the door to one-size-fits-all, government-controlled rationing  of prescription drugs.   Governments don't negotiate; they dictate.   The radical approach taken by H.R. 1425 includes troubling and  unprecedented government interference in private, market negotiations,  which will eliminate choice and competition and jeopardizes innovation  and access to future cures.   Countries that have adopted drug pricing systems like the one  proposed in this bill face decreased access to innovative new  medicines, increased wait times for treatment, and supply shortages for  in-demand drugs. The bill will negatively impact investment and  research and development of future treatments, putting breakthrough  cures for diseases like Alzheimer's, cancer, and sickle cell disease at  risk.   At a time when we have the best minds urgently working on a vaccine  for COVID-19, why would we want to slow down the development of  lifesaving medications? Congress should be putting in place policies to  incentivize difficult research and development for these rare and  devastating diseases, not discouraging it.   I stand ready to work with my Democrat colleagues and advance  bipartisan legislation that would lower healthcare and drug costs  without sacrificing innovation.   But that is not the bill before us today. Sadly, like last week's  police reform bill, the majority is once again focused on messaging,  not legislating, and that is too bad.
