 Madam Speaker, how does one define a traitor?   According to Merriam Webster, a traitor is one who betrays another's  trust or is false to an obligation or duty.   How does one define a traitor to a Nation?   By this definition, the Trump administration and some of its minions  have some explaining to do. While snubbing--and even offending--key  U.S. allies, the President and several of his crew have cozied up with  Russia time after time.   This certainly doesn't strike me as dutiful.   Well, look at Paul Manafort, his campaign manager, or Michael Flynn,  who have chosen to serve their Nation now in Federal prison because of  violating the trust of the American people.   This blatant disregard of duty has reached new lows. President  Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, recently announced a visit to  Ukraine to chase conspiracy theories.   This is a dangerous time for Ukraine. Following a historic election,  the Nation is now undergoing a transition of power in the face of  Russian invasion.   The House of Representatives is watching. The American people are  watching. Pay attention to traitors.
