 Mr. Speaker, our country is in crisis. We  are broken by generations of systemic racial injustice, and it is clear  that only real change in action will allow us to begin putting the  fragments back together.   Millions of Americans across the country and in my district are  demanding accountability and reform to a structure that has allowed  police brutality and injustice against people of color for far too  long.   As we continue hearing new names of those who have lost their lives  to this system, it is clear: Thoughts and prayers have never been  enough, and they are not enough now.   We can no longer stand idly by, failing to act on behalf of our Black  American communities in pain. The Justice in Policing Act will help  bring about the long overdue changes that we need, to strengthen  transparency and accountability in our law enforcement.   We need to ban unnecessary and excessive uses of force, including  chokeholds, and we need to end the militarization of local police  departments. That is why we must pass the Justice in Policing Act today  and begin the first of many steps towards a more just system, ensuring  that George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and countless others are not  forgotten.
