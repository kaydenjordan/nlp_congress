 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize this  week, May 12 through 18, as National Police Week 2019.   It is a privilege to take time this week to remember and honor our  Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers who courageously  defend American citizens and protect our communities.   They selflessly put their lives on the line to ensure that this  Nation is one of safety and order.   Just this past week, in the First Congressional District of Georgia,  this reality hit home when Sergeant Kelvin Ansari passed away in the  line of duty while investigating a robbery.   Overall last year, 158 police officers died in the line of duty  across the country.   As tens of thousands of police officers gather this week in  Washington, D.C., and other cities throughout America, I hope that  everyone will take some time to thank these individuals who work to  keep us all safe.   To all of our police officers, thank you for your service to our  communities. God bless you.                            ____________________
