 Madam Speaker, I thank Chairman Upton for yielding.   Well, Madam Speaker, here we go again: another partisan bill that  leadership contends will save the environment. But last week, experts  testified that it will not prevent wildfires on the West Coast,  droughts in the Midwest, or hurricanes on the East Coast. This is just  another effort to gin up the liberal base and divide the House before  the election.   But what the bill does do is it creates uncertainty, increases  consumer costs, and jeopardizes national security.   Madam Speaker, I thought we were here to find solutions for the  environment, but apparently not.   The majority is deliberately misleading the American public with this  legislation. Have they no shame? Remember, this bill will not prevent  wildfires, droughts, or hurricanes.   Madam Speaker, Congress can do better. America deserves better.                                time  1700
