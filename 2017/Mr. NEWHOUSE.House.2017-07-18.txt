 Mr. Speaker, my legislation would provide a much-needed  ``commencement of construction'' extension to the FERC permit for the  Enloe Dam Hydroelectric Project located in my Central Washington  district.   The Enloe Project is located at the existing Enloe Dam in the  Similkameen River Valley, which is situated approximately four miles  upriver of the City of Oroville. The original dam was constructed by  BLM in 1920 for power generation but operations ceased in 1958 when the  Bonneville Power Administration extended a high-voltage transmission  line into the Okanogan Valley.   However, since 1958 the dam and its related power-generating  facilities have sat dormant and the Okanogan Public Utility District  (``District'') is now working on the proposed project to re-energize  this infrastructure for hydropower development, as well as to relocate  the site to the opposite bank, which offers numerous environmental and  construction advantages.   The proposed 9 megawatt hydropower facility has faced several  setbacks and regulatory hurdles, which have been addressed but have  also delayed progress. However, despite these challenges the District  has made considerable progress in fulfilling all of the pre- construction obligations contained in its FERC license.   H.R. 2828 would ensure this critical hydropower project can move  forward and provide important renewable energy generation to the  region. The Enloe Project makes economic and environmental sense, as it  will convert currently untapped energy in existing flow releases into  clean, carbon-neutral energy. Additionally, the Project will have a  footprint that is roughly half the size of the existing facility but  will provide approximately three times the generating capacity of the  decommissioned plant.   Completion of the Project will provide Washingtonians and the Pacific  Northwest region with a clean, renewable energy resource that generates  an estimated 45,000 megawatt hours per year of carbon-free, renewable  power. Further, the proposed project will create jobs and needed  employment opportunities in a region with an unemployment rate that far  exceeds the national average, underscoring the many positive benefits  this project will have for the local community, state, and region.   This important legislation will allow for development of this  critical hydropower facility to move forward under a realistic  regulatory timeline and in a manner consistent with prior congressional  actions on similar projects.   By passing this measure and extending the ``commencement of  construction'' deadline for the Enloe Project, Congress can help spur  hydropower development in Central Washington and ensure the Project's  many benefits are realized, which will have a lasting impact on the  region's energy supply and economic viability.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the  gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Upton) that the House suspend the rules  and pass the bill, H.R. 2828.   The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the  rules were suspended and the bill was passed.   A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.                            ____________________
