 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman, my friend, for  yielding the time.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2, the Moving Forward  Act.   My overarching mission in Congress is to make America's greatness  accessible and affordable for all Americans, and the primary means by  which we connect all Americans to our country's greatness is our  infrastructure. The Moving Forward Act will do just that.   For too long, many American communities have been left behind. As we  invest in infrastructure, we must restructure our priorities to fulfill  our Nation's vision of liberty and justice for all.   My 10-20-30 initiative targets investment in these persistent poverty  areas. I am pleased that this legislation includes several provisions  to accomplish this goal, including prioritizing areas of persistent  poverty in awarding funds for transportation projects of national and  regional significance.   These funds will help connect persistent poverty areas to economic  opportunities. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman DeFazio for including  these important provisions.   Federally qualified community health centers are essential for the  success of rural and high-poverty communities, and I am pleased that  H.R. 2 includes $10 billion for community health center capital project  grants.   H.R. 2 includes significant investments to make long-overdue repairs  and upgrades to public housing.   Mr. Speaker, I commend Chairwoman Maxine Waters for her determined  advocacy for these measures.   The bill also recognizes the essential link between housing and  transportation. If you can't afford to live anywhere near economic  opportunity, the best highways and transit systems in the world won't  meet your needs.   Recognizing this reality, this bill includes language from a bill  that I introduced with Senator Booker, the HOME Act, directing State  and local transportation planners to consider projects and strategies  that will support inclusive zoning and land-use planning practices.   H.R. 2 includes $100 billion for the Accessible, Affordable Internet  for All Act, legislation I introduced last week with the Rural  Broadband Task Force and members of the Energy and Commerce Committee  led by Chairman Pallone.   Mr. Speaker, the Moving America Forward Act won't simply connect  Americans to opportunities through the infrastructure it builds; it  will connect Americans to opportunities through the jobs created to  build it.   I strongly support the extension of the Disadvantaged Business  Enterprise program at the Department of Transportation.   Our country is facing difficult circumstances. The burden is falling  disproportionately on those for whom America's greatness has not always  been accessible and affordable even in better times.   I urge the passage of the Moving Forward Act.                                time  1445
