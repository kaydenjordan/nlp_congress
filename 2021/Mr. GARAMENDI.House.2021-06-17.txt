 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the resolution.   The United States Congress has the sole constitutional power to  declare war and, therefore, a constitutional duty to consider, debate,  and, if necessary, repeal an Authorization for Use of Military Force.   The very title of this AUMF shows how much it has strayed from its  original purpose. The 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force  Against Iraq was designed to address the threat posed by an Iraq run by  Saddam Hussein. He has been dead for many years.   We have the responsibility to members of the Armed Forces who risk  their lives, and the American public who fund these seemingly endless  conflicts, to terminate the current 2002 Authorization for Use of  Military Force. Since 2009, I voted consistently to revoke this open- ended authorization and to reassert Congress' role.   For too long, we have failed this responsibility. Congress must act  now to repeal the 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against  Iraq.
