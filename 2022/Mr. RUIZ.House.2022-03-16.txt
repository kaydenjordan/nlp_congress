 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor a local leader in  public health, an exceptional community advocate, my constituent, and  my friend, Rosa Lucas.   I first met Rosa during my freshman year at UCLA in 1991 while I was  working at a farmworker health clinic. Ever since, I have admired her  integrity, humility, selflessness, and passion for justice.   Rosa's story begins in Los Angeles, California, December 7, 1945. She  spent her childhood in Beverly Hills before studying at UCLA-Berkeley  and UCLA. In 1968, she graduated UCLA with her bachelor's in Spanish  languages and literature. Shortly after, Rosa launched her career as a  charge nurse of neurosurgical intensive care at the UCLA Health  Sciences Center, eventually leading her to become a certified nurse  practitioner in 1975.   Ten years later, she settled in our desert and began her work in the  Coachella Valley.   Throughout her career, Rosa has worked to serve the poor, the  marginalized, and the underserved. She has provided care to those most  in need at rural and farmworker clinics like El Progreso del Desierto,  Santa Rosa Del Valle Medical Group, Desert Hot Springs Arthritis and  Medical Clinic, and the Borrego Springs Community Health Foundation.  Now she works for Eisenhower Health Urgent Care Centers.   Rosa truly embodies what it means to think globally and act locally.  She has devoted her life to addressing health disparities in our valley  and has made it her goal to expand access to healthcare for our most  vulnerable.  [[Page H3749]]    As a physician, I have seen her dedication to this mission firsthand.  In the summer of 1996 during a summer fellowship as a medical student,  Rosa taught me the well-child exam. I will never forget her passion to  care for at-risk newborns, and I knew then that she would be a great  partner in the fight for health and social justice.   Sure enough, in 2007 when I returned home from medical school, we saw  patients together and provided free medical care to the poorest  farmworker communities with the Flying Doctors.   Together, we joined the founding board of directors for a new  nonprofit called Coachella Valley Volunteers in Medicine which is the  only free clinic in the Coachella Valley that provides free healthcare  to the medically underserved. In fact, we started the street medicine  program and launched that in order to take care to the people and to  the homeless under bridges, at the parks, and in the homeless camps.  Wherever they find themselves, we took care to them, and she still does  that.                                time  1015    In fact, Volunteers in Medicine was the first in the valley to  implement the street medicine model during the pandemic. We took tests  directly to our most vulnerable populations, including farmworkers and  the homeless. This model later grew into a collaborative approach to  vaccinating at-risk populations at work sites, schools, churches, and  local trailer parks.   On top of that, Rosa feeds the hungry. She battled food insecurity  throughout the pandemic, partnering with local organizations to  coordinate food delivery for the hungry and the food insecure,  partnering with local promotora organizations.   Rosa's compassion and incredible service have touched every corner of  our communities. She has transformed care delivery in our desert and  opened doors for many.   As a member of the clinical faculty at CSU San Bernardino, Palm  Desert, and the UCR School of Medicine, Rosa has helped shape a new  generation of healthcare providers. She has inspired our communities'  young people on the advisory boards for the Head Start programs at  Desert Sands Unified School District and Coachella Valley Unified  School District.   For her outstanding service, Rosa has received numerous accolades,  including the 2019 Senior Inspiration Award from Riverside County, and  most recently, the 2021 Hometown Heroes Award from the city of  Coachella.   Rosa is relentless in her advocacy and never takes no for an answer  when advocating for the medically underserved and her patients.   Rosa has been an incredible adviser to me and has had a profound  impact on the entire Coachella Valley. In fact, I respect Rosa because  she delivers. She delivers her heart, she delivers her mind, and she  delivers food. She delivers tests, she delivers vaccines, and she  delivers healthcare with every inch of her soul and body. Rosa delivers  herself for the people.   We are all indebted to Rosa because she is the person who has led the  charge for so many years and has been a consistent voice. When there  was none, there was Rosa. When there was none, she provided care and  delivery.   On behalf of California's 36th Congressional District, I thank Rosa  for her incredible service. I am so privileged to have her in my life,  and I am honored to call her a friend.                            ____________________
