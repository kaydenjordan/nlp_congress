 Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to  remember the life and the legacy of Stuart Epperson, Sr., who passed  away this week.   Stu was a native of Winston-Salem, NC, and he was a giant in the  world of Christian broadcasting.   In 1972, he cofounded Salem Communications and then expanded it to  include Christian radio stations across the country. He served on the  board of directors of the National Religious Broadcasters Association,  and he was named one of the 25 most influential evangelicals in America  by Time magazine in 2005.   He dedicated his life to sharing the good news of Jesus Christ to as  many people as possible, whether it be through the mediums of mass  communication or in person or as a father to the fatherless in tough  neighborhoods. He was a pioneer, an innovator.   He was a dear friend to our family. We share our deepest condolences  with his wife Nancy, his family, and his friends. He will be dearly  missed. But because of his family's faithful Christian witness to our  family, I personally look forward to seeing Big Stu again in Heaven.
