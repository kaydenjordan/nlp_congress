 Madam President, one of the top goals for the Senate  this year was to recover a regular appropriations process. It has been  a long time since the system worked as intended.   The spending agreement we passed in March achieved several critical  objectives. It broke the arbitrary limits on funding for our Armed  Forces. It delivered the largest year-on-year increase in resources for  our troops in more than a decade. It provided record levels of veterans  funding, with increased oversight and modernization. It secured major  resources for infrastructure improvements. It took steps to prevent  school violence. It scaled up research, treatment, and prevention  funding to fight opioid addiction. It was a product of bipartisan,  bicameral negotiations with the White House.   But while the spending agreement achieved a lot, it wasn't anybody's  best case scenario. No Senator on either side of the aisle was thrilled  with the process, nor was the President, nor were the American people.   We all agreed that we owe Americans a more functional process for  allocating their hard-earned money. So here in the Senate, we made it a  top bipartisan priority to bring some regular order back into the  process.   Led by Chairman Shelby, Ranking Member Leahy, and all the  subcommittee leadership, our Appropriations Committee has engaged in  precisely the kind of thorough, considered committee work that ought to  define the appropriations process. Thanks to their hard work, the full  Senate can now take up this package, which includes appropriations for  Energy and Water Development, Military Construction and Veterans  Affairs, and the legislative branch. We will be considering it on the  floor this week.   Keeping families and communities safe, defending our Nation, and  upgrading our economic foundation, the Energy and Water components in  this legislation address each of these national priorities. For  example, they provide for critical improvements in the safety,  security, and readiness of our Nation's nuclear arsenal. Today, as the  Nation enters a period of renewed global competition among great  powers, it is vital that we maintain a robust and well-maintained  nuclear deterrent. This legislation puts forward the funds to continue  safeguarding our stockpile and prepare the Nation for existing and  future nuclear threats.   It also includes record funding for the Department of Energy's Office  of Science for research into subjects like new energy technologies and  advanced computing. There are also funds for fossil fuel research,  particularly for coal carbon capture.   In addition to our energy future, the legislation bolsters  infrastructure initiatives. It provides ample support for the future of  America's water resources. It directs nearly $7 billion to the Army  Corps of Engineers for maintaining our ports and inland waterways,  protecting our shores, and reducing the damage caused by flooding.   These funds will keep us on track to meet national priorities, but I  can also testify to the impact this legislation will have on  communities across the country, including in my home State of Kentucky.  Earlier this year I asked Secretary Perry to take a visit with me to  the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in western Kentucky. I was glad he  took me up on the offer. At the plant, Secretary Perry noted that we  ``have a moral responsibility'' to properly decommission the site. The  legislation before us is an important step to fulfill that  responsibility to the community and to the thousand-plus workers  dedicated to environmental cleanup.   This legislation also provides funding for the Appalachian Regional  Commission to help deliver infrastructure improvements to distressed  counties in Kentucky and the region. It funds important civil works  projects like the Olmsted Locks and Dam and the Kentucky Lock. These  are critical to the free flow of commerce along Kentucky's 1,900-plus  miles of inland waterways and the 13,000 maritime jobs they support.  [[Page S4012]]    These are just a few examples from my State. The reality is that this  legislation supplies needed support to communities all across our  country.   Energy matters to all Americans. Water infrastructure matters to all  Americans. I urge everyone to join me in supporting this bill.                            ____________________     On another matter, Madam President, yesterday Gallup  reported that the percentage of Americans who are satisfied with the  way things are going in our country is as high as it has been since  2005. That is a nearly 13-year high. It is no wonder, with an ongoing  economic expansion creating jobs across the Nation and our unemployment  rate at its lowest level since the year 2000. Consumers are confident.  Manufacturers are confident. Small businesses are optimistic.   As I have said many times, Washington doesn't deserve all the credit  for this. The government does not create prosperity. American workers  and job creators do. But public policy does set the stage. Bad policy  can make job creation, wage growth, and capital investment much more  difficult. Good policy can make these things easier. Take the historic  tax reform that Republicans passed just last year.   In addition to immediate tax relief for middle-class families and  small businesses, we also sought to improve our long-term foundation by  making America a more attractive place to start a business, expand a  business, and invest for the future. That is why tax reform allowed for  full and immediate expensing of capital investments and made corporate  rates more competitive. We are starting to see signs that businesses,  large and small, are taking notice.   A few weeks ago, the Wall Street Journal reported that ``U.S.  companies are ramping up spending on their businesses at the fastest  pace in years.'' One recent analysis projected that the S&P 500  businesses' spending on new factories, equipment, and other capital  investments in the first quarter of 2018 would be nearly 25 percent  more than they spent in the first quarter of just last year.   What about small business? Just a few weeks ago, a leading industry  survey showed 62 percent of owners reporting recent capital outlays, on  the heels of the most positive sales trends since 1995.   Major, business-changing equipment is being purchased. Ribbons are  being cut on new facilities. The long-term foundations for a stronger  economy are literally being poured. Republicans are proud that we  helped make this happen. We are getting Washington out of the way so  American prosperity can take flight.                            ____________________     Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that H.R.  5515, as amended, be printed as passed.
