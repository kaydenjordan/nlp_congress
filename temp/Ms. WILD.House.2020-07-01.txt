 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Bud Cook, the  northeast Pennsylvania program director for the Nature Conservancy.   For more than 40 years, Bud has been one of the foremost advocates  for conservation and environmental protection in my community and in  Pennsylvania.   For decades, Bud has led efforts to conserve and protect nature in  the Greater Lehigh Valley and beyond. He established Monroe County  Citizens for Open Space and led a pioneering fundraising campaign in  support of land protection, and he has mentored generations of  conservation advocates who have gone on to spearhead successful  campaigns of their own.   Bud's quick wit and passion for his work have endeared him to many  and helped create opportunities for collaboration in communities that  might otherwise be divided, bringing together citizens united by their  mutual desire to protect their beloved natural environment.   Bud's legacy can be experienced in the Hauser Nature Center in Long  Pond, in the Cherry Valley National Wildlife Refuge, and innumerable  places across my community where natural beauty is protected and  preserved in our time and for generations to come.   As Bud prepares to retire and start a new chapter, I want to  recognize his exceptional contributions.   Madam Speaker, on behalf of a grateful community, we thank and  congratulate him for all he has done.                            ____________________
