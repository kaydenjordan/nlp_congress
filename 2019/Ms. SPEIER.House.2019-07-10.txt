 Mr. Chairman, I am proud to speak in support of this  bipartisan bill that contains the priorities of both parties. And while  it wasn't unanimous, it does nothing to change our responsibilities to  give military members and families bipartisan support. We did that in  the Military Personnel Subcommittee, and I thank Ranking Member Kelly  for his work.   This bill contains two landmark achievements for our servicemembers  and their families. It institutes a comprehensive fix to the festering  problem of the so-called widow's tax, ensuring that surviving widows or  widowers won't have their DOD and VA benefits offset.   I was once a widow. I know the pain and the emptiness. We must take  care of the spouses who sacrifice so much for our Nation.   This bill rectifies a grievous denial of rights to servicemembers who  are victims of malpractice at military medical facilities by allowing  Active-Duty servicemembers to sue the Department for malpractice. For  more than a half century, those who put their lives on the line have  had fewer legal rights to sue for malpractice than prisoners in Federal  prisons.   This bill moves the ball forward on other personnel priorities by  funding a 3.1 percent pay raise; shortening childcare backlogs;  improving sexual assault prevention and response, including at the  service academies; promoting spousal employment; creating a housing  ombudsman; and giving TRICARE beneficiaries the same contraception  coverage benefits as all other Americans.   The bill also provides a historic 12 weeks of family and medical  leave to Federal employees and congressional staff.   Mr. Chairman, we owe servicemembers and their families. We owe them  this important set of benefits.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, I yield myself 2 minutes.   I rise today in support of my amendment to affirm the right of all  people, regardless of race, religion, national origin, or sex,  including sexual orientation or gender identity, to serve openly in our  Armed Forces, so long as they meet gender-neutral standards.   This debate affects real servicemembers who have served courageously.  I want you to hear their stories.   Navy Lieutenant Commander Blake Dremann, a trans man, has served for  over 15 years and received the prestigious Navy Batchelder Award.   Captain Jennifer Peace is a trans woman who has served for over 15  years and has deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq multiple times.   Army Captain Alivia Stehlik, a trans woman, commissioned out of West  Point over 10 years ago and received the Bronze Star Medal.   Hospital Corpsman Third Class Akira Wyatt, a trans woman, has been in  the Navy for over 7 years and has deployed across the globe.   Finally, Staff Sergeant Patricia King is a trans woman who is  retiring after 20 years, 20 years, and has led combat infantry units  over three deployments in Afghanistan.   Over the last 3 years, 14,000 transgender servicemembers have served  openly and successfully. All five service chiefs affirmed they do not  hamper lethality or cohesion.   Malice and ignorance cannot stop us from giving medically necessary  care to individuals brave enough to serve. We know what transgender  servicemembers bring to the fight. Let them bring it.   Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs.  Davis), who has aptly represented this committee many times over.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 45 seconds to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Brown), my great colleague.    Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have  remaining.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to my colleague from  Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy).    Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from  New Mexico (Ms. Haaland), my great colleague.    Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close. How much time do I  have left, Mr. Chairman?    Mr. Chairman, these are servicemembers who deserve our  support. These are servicemembers who have already identified as trans  members in our military. They provide no issues in terms of lethality  or cohesion. They serve with distinction, with honor, and it is time  for us to repeal this ill-advised amendment.   I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Madam Chair, we withdrew this particular amendment during  the committee's disposition on the NDAA at the request of Mr. Kelly  because I recognized that he had some important points to make. I think  this addresses his concern.   This particular amendment ensures access to high-quality education on  family planning across military branches to give our servicemembers the  tools they need to make the best healthcare decisions for themselves  and their families.   According to DOD estimates, the vast majority--some 95 percent--of  all women serving in our military are of reproductive age, yet data  from the Department of Defense survey shows insufficient access to  comprehensive family planning education among our servicemembers.  Inadequate family planning education puts servicemembers at high risk  of unplanned pregnancies and creates uncertainty in the retention of  critical personnel.   Not surprisingly, research shows that Active-Duty servicemembers of  reproductive age have a rate of unplanned pregnancies that is 60  percent--I repeat, 60 percent--higher than that of comparable women in  the general population.   Education on family planning is not just about contraception or  pregnancy; it is also about preventing sexually transmitted infections,  including HIV, and staying healthy and informed.   This amendment would create a uniform education program across all  branches of the military so that servicemembers receive current and  medically accurate information. The education would be mandatory within  the first year of service, and additional education may be offered at  the discretion of each service branch.   This is an issue of basic healthcare, but it is also a matter of  military readiness and national security. Our troops deserve the very  best, regardless of which branch of the military they serve.   Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from California  (Mrs. Davis).    Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New  Mexico (Ms. Haaland).    Madam Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Missouri for  yielding.   Let me be clear, we are already providing this service in the  branches. They are not uniform. This would make it uniform. So whatever  is being provided now would continue to be provided, but it would be  consistent and uniform.    Madam Chair, I really object to my good friend and  colleague's definition of what this is actually doing. We are already  providing this kind of training, this kind of education to our  servicemembers in all our branches. We do know that the Navy and  Marines are considered to do it best, while the Army and Air Force have  room for improvement.   A recent study found that female Army soldiers have more children in  their first 2 years of enlistment and miss more work than do females in  other military branches, in part due to the differences in policies on  birth control education.   The Navy's approach is much more comprehensive, and it is on that  basis that we want to have all of the services providing the same level  of education as the Navy and Air Force.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1915     Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.
