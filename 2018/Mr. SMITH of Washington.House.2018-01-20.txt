 Mr. Speaker, I have an enormous amount of  respect for the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, but I would  remind everybody that, back in September, he and a majority of the  Armed Services Committee Republicans voted against the CR, in  September, 4 months ago. Why? Because at the time, he said: A CR is  devastating for our military. It is the worst possible thing to do to  our military.   Four months ago, he said that, and now he says that we should vote  for a CR.   Think about it. Unless that vote, back in September, was simply  hollow and hypocritical, he was prepared to shut down the government in  September rather than continue to fund our military, and, by the way,  the rest of the government, with a CR.   He was right in September, but it took Democrats to actually have the  courage of that conviction to say: No, we are not going to continue to  gut the military drip by drip by drip, CR by CR. We are going to stand  up and say, no. Pass appropriations bills.   That is why we are doing this.   I would also point out that five Republican Senators voted against  the House bill. It is not a filibuster. They don't have 50 votes in the  Senate for what you guys want to do.   Mac Thornberry was right, back in September. A CR is terrible for the  military. Don't support a CR. Fund the military.
