 I didn't hear that, Mr. President.         Thank you very much, Mr. President. I appreciate that. I       appreciate your kindness and the respect you give the great Garden       State.                                    Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 3771               Mr. President, I would like to talk a bit and then ask       for unanimous consent on the South Asian Heart Awareness and Research       Act. I am really proud of this work and the bipartisan effort.        In general, heart disease is widely prevalent. There is an alarming       statistic that I want to reveal to everyone: that every 36 seconds, a       person in the United States dies of cardiovascular disease. This is a       national crisis. But when you break down the data by racial and ethnic       group, it is the South Asian Americans who have the highest death rate       from heart disease. Almost two-thirds of middle-aged South Asian       Americans are at either immediate or high risk for heart failure within       the next 10 years. Compared to the general population, South Asians are       four times more likely to have heart disease and have a much greater       chance of having a heart attack before the age of 50.        The prevalence of type 2 diabetes, a leading cause of heart disease,       is the highest in America amongst South Asians. Some of these       heightened risks are connected to social determinants of health, the       conditions that people have to face every day of their lives.        For some South Asian Americans, language barriers even make visits to       the doctor more difficult. Others are immigrants who are adjusting to       this Nation, trying to make a living working multiple jobs, and often       neglecting their personal health experience as well.        That makes it all the more important that Congress step in and act to       promote better understanding, awareness, and research of heart disease.       Because of that reason, I am proud to lead the Senate version of the       South Asian Heart Health Awareness and Research Act.        For each year between 2023 and 2027, this bill would authorize       additional funding and grant money to promote awareness of the       increasing prevalence of heart disease in disproportionately affected       communities. It authorizes the Centers for Disease Control to develop       culturally appropriate materials to promote health, support community       groups involved in heart health promotion, and support conferences and       research workshops dedicated to the issue.        Finally, it establishes a central source of information on heart       health to help patients access resources quickly, if need be.        This bill, again, is a bipartisan bill. It is a bipartisan approach.       It is a bicameral approach to address a clear heart health and research       gap. With the leadership of Representatives Jayapal and Wilson in the       House of Representatives, this legislation has already passed one       Chamber of Congress twice--twice, already. It is now up to the Senate       to pass this commonsense bill and take a step toward addressing the       disproportionate impact that heart disease has on South Asian       Americans.        As a representative of New Jersey, one of the States with the largest       South Asian communities in the country, I have the chance to interact       often with constituents from Pakistan,            [[Page S9727]]            India, Bangladesh, and other South Asian countries. They are such       critical aspects of the American story, the American fabric, and I urge       us all today to not let this opportunity slip by. And I now ask for       unanimous consent to pass the South Asian Heart Health Awareness and       Research Act.        Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Health,       Education, Labor, and Pensions be discharged from further consideration       of H.R. 3771 and that the Senate proceed to its immediate       consideration.        I ask unanimous consent that the Booker amendment, which is at the       desk, be considered and agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be       considered read a third time and passed; that the title amendment at       the desk be considered and agreed to; and that the motion to reconsider       be considered made and laid upon the table.         To the Senator from California, the Presiding Officer, it       is good to see you there. I wish you a very merry Christmas.                                    Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 5768              Mr. President, from 2019 to 2020, we have seen a rise in homicide       rates in all corners of our Nation, by 30 percent in urban areas and 25       percent in our rural areas. Much of this increase can be traced to the       gun violence epidemic that plagues America. But today I rise to ask my       colleagues to join me in passing a bill that will address violent crime       and bring perpetrators to justice at a time when our assistance is so       desperately needed.        Each instance of violence and each death is especially painful for       family, friends, and for the loved ones of victims. Nothing can ever       replace losing a loved one, but some semblance of closure can be       provided to victims' families when the perpetrators of these crimes are       brought to justice.        It is time to do more. The data indicates that these crimes are       committed repeatedly by the same individuals. Less than 1 percent of       the population is responsible for over 60 percent of gun crimes in this       country. A 2017 analysis of shootings in Oakland revealed that just 0.1       percent of the city's population was responsible for most of the       homicides.        Yet the homicide clearance rate, defined as the percentage of those       crimes that are solved, has dramatically declined recently, falling 7       percent from 2019 to 2020.        Currently, about half of the murders in the United States--half--are       ultimately solved. For every murder and nonfatal shooting that goes       unsolved, the public is put at greater danger. The pattern of dismal       clearance rates in this country are disproportionately impacting       minority communities.        It is a tragedy that we can solve. Police need the resources to solve       homicides and crimes of gun violence nationwide. Police need the       resources that the evidence demonstrates, if they had, they can vastly       improve their clearance rates.        This past July, the House passed a bipartisan bill, the bill I       introduced in June, the Violent Incident Clearance and Technological       Investigation Methods Act, or the VICTIM Act. This bill would establish       a new grant program through the Department of Justice to help State,       local, and Tribal law enforcement agencies improve their clearance       rates for homicides and nonfatal shootings.        At a time of this wrongful, erroneous language about anybody in this       body wanting to defund the police, this is a chance to apply police       resources, to give the police more resources to ultimately solve the       crimes that are most savaging and hurting our neighborhoods.        This is a critical bill. It is a bipartisan bill. It is a bicameral       bill, and it would provide the kind of grants that we have seen that       help dramatically solve violent homicides.        The VICTIM Act has been endorsed by the largest police groups in the       country: the Fraternal Order of Police, the International Association       of Chiefs of Police, the Major Cities Chiefs Association, and others.       They are telling us they need these additional resources to help make       our communities safer.        It is unacceptable that we have this level of murder in our country.       Communities are being shattered, and law enforcement agencies don't       have the resources necessary to bring the victims and their families       the justice they deserve. This is an issue that cuts at the heart of       criminal and racial justice.        So, today, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the       immediate consideration of H.R. 5768, which has been received from the       House and is at the desk; further, that the bill be considered read a       third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be considered made       and laid upon the table with no intervening debate.         Mr. President, this might be seen as a Christmas miracle,       but I am grateful for that suggestion from the Senator from Kentucky. I       am disappointed that he does not accept this bill, which does not       impose anything on local law enforcement but gives them opportunities       for resources that they can apply for. It is going to help us actually       lower the cost for local communities because one murder in one       community causes such economic damage. You can't put a price on human       life.        But I do feel a sense of gratitude that the Senator from Kentucky       might be willing to work with me on finding a way forward and that       there is some area of common ground.        So I don't accept his amendment now, but I look forward, in the new       year, in the next Congress, to finding a way to perhaps work together       to some accord.        So, no. I object to the modification.         Mr. President, today, right now, Christopher Bass sits in       a            [[Page S9728]]            jail cell in Jesup, GA. He will sleep there tonight, and he has spent       19 years in that jail cell. Terrance Stanton sits in a jail cell in       Wildwood, FL. He has spent the last 8 years in that jail cell.        Across our country, 8,000 people sit in jail cells who should have       left a long time ago. Many have been there for years and will be there       for years to come.        Christopher and Terrance are just two of the people languishing       behind bars because of a mistake that Congress made 36 years ago. Their       families are two of the thousands of families who are not reconnected       with their families during the holiday season, who are not reunited       with their children because of this mistake.        In 1986, Congress passed a law which created a 100-to-1 sentencing       disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine offenses. The       decision to enact this legislation was not based on science or data.       Crack cocaine and powder cocaine are pharmacologically the same       substance. They have the same effects. They are identical. That is       science. But the one which was more prevalent in poor communities, in       Black and Brown communities, was punished 100 times more harshly.        It was only in 2010 that Congress reduced but not eliminated this       disparity to 18 to 1--better, yes, but why 18 to 1? Again, there is no       reason behind this ratio for the same scientifically and       pharmacologically exact substance. And this disparity continues to ruin       the lives of hundreds of people convicted for nonviolent crack offenses       because they received punishments 18 times longer than those with the       powder.        Those of you who know me will understand that this is an urgency I       feel because we are a nation that believes that liberty is one of the       most sacrosanct ideals, and to unjustly take a person's liberty is an       affront to our constitutional principles that we swear an oath to when       we say we are one Nation under God with liberty and justice for all.        I believe we must deal with this. We know that this is an urgency. We       know that this is wrong. In fact, the bill--the EQUAL Act--which was       passed overwhelmingly in the House of Representatives, passed with a       vote of 361 to 66. Republicans and Democrats joined together all across       the political spectrum to say that this was wrong, that we should make       these pharmacologically identical substances have the same punishment.              Here in the U.S. Senate, 11 Republicans have joined as cosponsors of       the EQUAL Act legislation. This is supported bicamerally and in a       bipartisan way. Yet we can't get this done. This bill gathers momentum.       It is advocated for from police groups and all the way to think tanks       on both sides of the aisle.        I believe now is the time, as we approach the holidays, to end this       injustice, to restore more truth behind the ideals of liberty in this       Nation.        So, Mr. President, therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the       Committee on the Judiciary be discharged from further consideration of       H.R. 1693 and that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration;       further, that the bill be considered read a third time and passed and       the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.         Reserving the right to object, I question some of the       comments that were made that--over a generation ago when Congress acted       wrongly, the Senators whom he named--from the President of the United       States, a former Senator; to Dick Durbin; to members of the       Congressional Black Caucus--have all said publicly that they think it       was a mistake. There are things this body has done before, generations       ago, like this that future Congresses said: Enough is enough. This       Congress passed laws on gender, on LGBTQ Americans, and later       Congresses said that was a mistake.        Now, the beautiful thing about this is it is not a partisan group of       people saying it was a mistake. In the House of Representatives, you       have dozens of Republicans and Democrats who were there a generation       ago, over 30 years, who said it was a mistake. You now have this loud       chorus of conviction that says this was wrong.        The Senator from Arkansas--I respect him deeply and consider him       somebody who has helped to make me a better Senator, but if you look at       what we call recidivism rates, the data my colleague from Arkansas       cites counts arrests for minor violations of parole or other technical       violations as recidivism. Often, it is people returning to low-income       communities who            [[Page S9729]]            are more heavily policed. We know we have more interactions with police       and more likelihood for rearrest.        This doesn't take away from the ideal that I talked about, an ideal       to which my colleague and I both have this fierce fealty to, which is       liberty. Right now, in prisons all over America, there are people who       have been in jail for a decade or two decades for nonviolent crack       cocaine offenses while people with more cocaine, with weightier drugs       that affect more people, have come in and out of jail. The people who       are in jail for crack cocaine happen to be disproportionately African       American.        At the time Congress made this mistake, which Republicans and       Democrats in both Houses say was a mistake, there was a terrible fear       that was gripping this country with a new drug coming along. It was       that fear that drove us to do something that has now had people in       prison for years and years and years.        So I do object to what my colleague and friend proposes, and I know       that this will be corrected. Mark my words. The arc of the moral       universe is long. We will get to one to one; I am confident of that.       But why should people have to languish in prison for yet another year       to 2 years--another Congress--separated from families, separated from       their children? God, at this time of the holidays, where so many people       are being reunited, this is not only an act of justice, it would be an       act of mercy.        I object to my colleague's unanimous consent request.         I yield the floor to the great Senator from Louisiana.
