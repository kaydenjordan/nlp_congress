 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Resolution  934, the combined rule for my legislation, H.R. 5735, the Transitional  Housing for Recovery in Viable Environments, or THRIVE, Act.  [[Page H5112]]    I want to thank Chairman Hensarling, Chairman Duffy, and my  colleagues on the House Financial Services Committee for their support  and feedback on this legislation, as well as Chairman Sessions and  Ranking Member McGovern on the House Committee on Rules for their  consideration of my manager's amendment to make improvements to this  bill.   This week the House is considering several important pieces of  legislation to address the opioid epidemic that takes the lives of 116  Americans every day. My home State of Kentucky has the third highest  overdose mortality rate in the country.   In order to achieve meaningful progress in the fight against opioid  addiction in our Nation, Congress can no longer simply focus on  prevention, enforcement, and treatment. We must also begin to implement  policies that focus on long-term recovery. Our Federal housing programs  are an underutilized resource in these efforts.   The THRIVE Act would make supportive housing more accessible to those  in need by allocating a limited number of Section 8 housing choice  vouchers to nonprofits that provide housing, workforce development, job  placement, financial literacy, and continued addiction recovery support  for individuals who are transitioning out of rehab and back into the  workforce.   Rather than allocating the vouchers through public housing  authorities, this demonstration would give vouchers directly to housing  nonprofits that meet evidence-based metrics of success on a competitive  basis. The vouchers would also be distributed with a focus on regions  of the country with the highest rates of opioid-related deaths.   This legislation would only allocate either 10,000 or 0.5 percent of  total housing vouchers, whichever is less, to people who are literally  dying every day of opioid addiction and other substance abuse  disorders. The demonstration is limited to 5 years.   No one would have a voucher taken away from them to create this  demonstration program. This is an important point that I would like to  emphasize to my friend from Colorado, who is concerned that there might  be a cannibalizing effect of existing vouchers.   An estimated 198,000 Section 8 vouchers are turned over each year and  returned to HUD. It is from this amount that the demonstration would  set aside only 10,000 to address a deadly national public health  crisis.   The goal of this demonstration is not to take away vouchers from  those who need them but, rather, to open up other housing options to  people coming out of rehab who would otherwise be forced to use Section  8 vouchers to live in a housing situation where they would be  surrounded by individuals who are still in active addiction.   If our goal is to help people coming out of rehab or medication- assisted treatment to stay off of opioids and gain job skills and find  employment, our government programs should give people the option to  live in transitional housing with housing choice vouchers.   Additionally, and I would also invite my friend from Colorado to  consider this: I have made a commitment to working with my Democratic  colleagues in requesting additional funds from the Appropriations  Committee for the purpose of supporting this demonstration. I would  invite my friend from Colorado to sign this letter requesting those  additional funds, perhaps to earn his support and the support of the  ranking member.   I would like to thank my Democratic colleague, Ms. Sinema, as well as  the Department of Housing and Urban Development for their suggested  changes that have been incorporated in the manager's amendment I offer  today. I also thank Mr. Rohrabacher for his amendment that further  ensures eligible entities have been effectively vetted to support  recovery in local communities.   This legislation has received endorsements from over 140 housing,  addiction support, and recovery organizations across the country,  including Addiction Policy Forum, American Academy of Addiction  Psychiatry, National Association of Social Workers, Faces and Voices of  Recovery, and over 100 others on the front lines of addiction recovery.   Secretary Carson from HUD also visited my district in Kentucky  earlier this year and witnessed firsthand the success of nonprofits in  helping individuals rise above addiction.   I urge support for this rule so we can continue to work together in a  bipartisan manner to improve housing options for individuals recovering  from opioid addiction and other substance abuse disorders.   It is time for us to allow for innovation, allow for us to focus on  what happens after treatment, and allow people to access transitional  housing addiction recovery services that focus on work, self-esteem,  financial literacy, and stable housing in order to ultimately move into  a life of permanent recovery, hope, and nonsubsidized housing  scenarios.                                time  1300
