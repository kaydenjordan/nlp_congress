 Mr. President, as the 117th Congress winds down, I would  like to offer some reflections on some of our departing colleagues: Roy  Blunt, Richard Burr, Rob Portman, Ben Sasse, Richard Shelby, and  Patrick Toomey. Too often, the Senate is viewed through a partisan  lens, but the truth is that we all work together to serve the American  people. We all swore the same oath to uphold and defend the  Constitution. Although we may have differing views, we certainly have  common values.   It has been my honor to serve with these outstanding senators, as  well as my good friends, Senator Jim Inhofe and Senator Patrick Leahy,  whose service I spoke about earlier.                             Tribute to Roy Blunt    Roy Blunt knows how to get things done. Because of his efforts as the  top Republican on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health, and  Human Services, and Education, we have been able to make extraordinary  investments in healthcare research at the National Institutes of Health  and the Centers for Disease Control. I am grateful for the role he has  played in helping to raise funding for key programs like the Pell  grant, adult education, the Library Services and Technology Act, and  the Childhood Cancer STAR Act. Additionally, I have had the privilege  of teaming up with Senator Blunt for many years on legislation to  increase our healthcare workforce with the Building a Health Care  Workforce for the Future Act, which would help incentivize people to go  into the primary care field.   He has been a champion for children. We have worked together on the  Ensuring Children's Access to Specialty Care Act, to improve access to  pediatric subspecialists, including children's mental health workers.   I greatly admire his advocacy and success when it comes to  strengthening mental health services and access to care. That was  reflected in the nationwide expansion of the Certified Community  Behavioral Health Clinics program, which he worked so hard to  accomplish.   Finally, as the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Committee  on Rules, Senator Blunt has worked to safeguard the Senate community,  and in partnership with Senator Klobuchar, he has worked to craft the  bipartisan Electoral Count Act to eliminate any doubts about the  process for tabulating electoral votes in Congress. This legislation  will help eliminate the perceived ambiguities in current law that  President Trump sought to exploit on January 6, 2021. And it is yet  another example of Senator Blunt's principled, bipartisan leadership.   We will miss him in the Senate and wish his wife Abigail and their  children and grandchildren all the best.                           Tribute to Richard Burr    I thought I drove the most beat up car in the Senate until I saw  Senator Burr's 1973 Volkswagen Thing, which I can't believe didn't  fully retire before he did.   As a Member of the House and the Senate, Richard Burr has become an  expert on healthcare policy, helping shepherd countless public health  and research bills into law. This includes important reauthorizations  of the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug  Administration. I have appreciated his help in clearing important  legislation I have introduced, including measures to address childhood  cancer, mental health, and suicide prevention.   In the Senate, Senator Burr became an ardent and outspoken leader in  preserving our public lands, parks, refuges, and recreational areas.  His quest to permanently reauthorize and fund the Land and Water  Conservation Fund--LWCF--ultimately led to the passage of the Great  American Outdoors Act, which permanently funds the LWCF at $900 million  per year and provides dedicated funding to address maintenance backlogs  at our major land management agencies. This was a huge accomplishment  that will benefit future generations of Americans.   Finally, as the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee,  Senator Burr was unflappable and even-handed in investigating and  assessing the threats against this country posed by Russia and other  malicious actors.   After a career of landmark legislative achievements, I wish Richard  well as he drives his signature Volkswagen Thing back home to North  Carolina.                            Tribute to Rob Portman    Senator Rob Portman is one of the most prolific public servants in  the Republican party, serving in the Senate, the House, and senior  posts as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and as the  U.S. Trade Representative. He certainly has had a varied and  distinguished career.   Early in his Senate tenure, as the U.S. economy struggled in the wake  of the Great Recession, Senator Portman and I teamed up to try to  extend enhanced unemployment benefits for the millions of Americans who  had been forced out of work. We made great progress in the Senate,  bringing together a core group of 10 Senators to shape a package of  assistance. While that package passed the Senate with a strong  bipartisan vote, we could not overcome opposition in the House.  Nonetheless, that pattern of working with bipartisan groups of like- minded Senators became the hallmark of Senator Portman's legislative  career, paying off in this Congress with the enactment of the  Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act,  and the Respect for Marriage Act.  [[Page S10088]]    On issues like addiction treatment, retirement security, and marriage  equality, he became the maestro of orchestrating bipartisan agreement.   Senator Portman has also become a leading voice in supporting U.S.  efforts to assist Ukraine, helping to ensure that we bring the  resources that President Zelenskyy and the Ukrainian people need in  order to secure their freedom.   While Senator Portman will be leaving this Chamber, I expect he will  remain engaged in policy debates and serving the community. And I hope  that his bipartisan leadership and efforts to bring people together to  find common ground will endure.                         Tribute to Richard C. Shelby    Richard Shelby has been at the center of addressing some of the most  consequential events that have faced the country during his tenure. He  was the top Republican on the Select Committee on Intelligence in the  immediate aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001. He served as  the chairman and later ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee  during the Wall Street financial collapse and Great Recession. And as  chair and vice chair of the Appropriations Committee, he helped guide  us through the challenges of the Budget Control Act and the COVID-19  pandemic.   Always faithful to his conservative views, Richard has never been a  partisan firebrand. He has been a person committed to getting things  done on behalf of all Americans and particularly the people of Alabama.  When I was ranking member of the Banking Subcommittee on Housing,  Transportation, and Community Development, I was privileged to work  closely with Chairman Shelby to reauthorize our Nation's transit  programs under the SAFETEA Act. In the midst of the Great Recession, we  worked together on the Banking Committee to pass the Housing and  Economic Recovery Act, which helped homeowners with subprime mortgages  avoid foreclosure. Important for today's supply constrained housing  market, that law created the Housing Trust Fund to increase and  preserve the supply of housing for people with the lowest incomes,  including families experiencing homelessness.   And during his tenure at the top of the Appropriations Committee and  the Subcommittee on Defense, Richard has worked with Chairman Leahy and  Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski to fund our national defense, invest wisely  in public infrastructure, and address the challenges of the COVID-19  pandemic. It is fitting that Senator Shelby, working with Senator  Leahy, is capping his career by passing an omnibus appropriations bill,  which bears the mark of his work.   Finally, let me add this, Richard, in a very understated way, has  been a true champion in promoting women to positions of authority in  the Senate, including naming the first woman to serve as staff director  of the Senate Appropriations Committee. And it is fitting now that his  former chief of staff, Senator-elect Katie Britt, will be his successor  in the Senate.   In wishing him well in his retirement, I also want to pay tribute to  his wife Annette, who has been a partner in his service to the country.                             Tribute to Ben Sasse    During his tenure in the Senate, Ben Sasse has been a leader in  addressing the threat of cyber attacks. With my House colleague,  Congressman  Jim Langevin, Senator Sasse worked to create the  Cybersecurity Solarium Commission in 2019. The goal of the commission  was to develop a strategic approach to defending the United States  against cyber attacks of significant consequences. As a member of the  commission, Senator Sasse helped craft a thoughtful report and  important legislative recommendations that will guide our policy on  cybersecurity for years to come.                         Tribute to Patrick J. Toomey    Most States have two Senators, but for the last 12 years, there have  been three Rhode Islanders serving in the Senate: Senator Whitehouse,  myself, and Senator Pat Toomey--Republican from East Providence.   Growing up in a large working-class family with parents of Irish and  Portuguese ancestry, Senator Toomey's background is familiar and shared  by many Rhode Islanders, but his success has been uncommon and evident  almost from the start. In fact, Senator Toomey and I went to the same  high school--the legendary LaSalle Academy. We were a few years-- actually several years--apart. I was a good student. Pat was the  valedictorian. He went on to Harvard and Wall Street and served in the  House before coming to the Senate.   As a member of the Senate Banking Committee and eventually serving as  the top Republican on the panel, he was well-versed and well-prepared  to debate the issues. As we worked to craft the CARES Act and other  COVID-19 pandemic legislation, Pat was rigorous and relentless in  asking tough questions as we worked to develop this legislation to keep  the economy moving.   Closer to home and his Portuguese roots, Pat was a champion for  improving U.S. relations with Portugal. Working with my colleagues  Sheldon Whitehouse and   David Cicilline, he pushed for the passage of  the AMIGOS Act--a bill to improve trade and investment ties between the  U.S. and Portugal. I am pleased that thanks to Pat's efforts we were  able to include this legislation in this year's National Defense  Authorization Act.   With Pat's retirement, Rhode Island will have to make do with just  two Senators, but I hope that we will continue to see him and his wife  Kris and their children from time to time both in Washington and in the  Ocean State.   Again I want to thank these extraordinary colleagues for their hard  work over the years and for their service to the American people and  the people of their States.                            ____________________
