 Mr. President, Samya Stumo, a University of  Massachusetts Amherst graduate and resident of Sheffield, MA, was  tragically killed aboard Ethiopian Airlines flight 302. Samya, just 24  years old, was a champion of social justice, with a goal of  revolutionizing global health. Her undergraduate fieldwork in Peru  challenged unjust social services; her master's work in Europe gave a  voice to marginalized patient groups living with viral hepatitis; and,  most recently, she was working to disrupt the status quo in global  health systems to help countries achieve universal healthcare coverage.  She strove for all people and patients to be treated as human beings,  particularly in context of their culture, family, and individuality.  She was a beacon of hope for Massachusetts, the Nation, and all of the  lives she has touched.                            ____________________
