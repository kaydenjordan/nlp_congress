 Madam Speaker, we have to be clear about  what is happening here.   Congress passed the Voting Rights Act in 1965 to overcome shameful  State resistance and barriers that prevented minorities from exercising  their right.   But in 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court held that continuing to require  States to preclear election law changes based upon conduct from a half  century ago was an unconstitutional invasion of State sovereignty.   The truth is, as Jim said a moment ago, it is easier today for  Americans to vote than it has ever been before in our Nation's history.  The VRA worked. Thank the Lord that it did. We overcame those problems.   In fact, voter registration disparities between minority and  nonminority voters in States like Texas, Florida, North Carolina,  Mississippi, and my home State of Louisiana, all previously covered  under the old VRA provisions, are now below the national average and,  get this, they are lower than Democrat-run States like New York,  California, and President Biden's home State of Delaware.   H.R. 4 is a radical, unprecedented Federal power grab by  unaccountable bureaucrats in Washington that every conscientious  American ought to oppose. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time once more.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Tenney).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the  gentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Fitzgerald).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Bishop).    I yield an additional 30 seconds to the  gentleman from North Carolina.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).    Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may  consume to the gentleman from Illinois (Rodney Davis).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.                                time  1745     Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to  the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Arrington).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the  gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).    Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance  of my time.   The American people can see clearly what is happening here. Democrats  in the Congress are more focused on taking Federal control over the  election processes in Republican-led States than addressing the ongoing  catastrophe that the Biden administration has created in Afghanistan,  at our southern border, with inflation, and the ongoing pandemic. There  are so many things that should be occupying our time and, yet, they are  using it for this.   The cry of voter suppression is not only untrue, but as Mr. Arrington  said so well here just a few moments ago, it is also divisive and  dangerous. We need to speak truth, as Mr. Hoyer said a little while  ago, and we are.   We had six hearings in the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil  Liberties Subcommittee since January on this. I am the ranking  Republican there. Not a scintilla of evidence was presented that said  that voters are being suppressed, that the election integrity laws that  are being passed by the States, pursuant to their constitutional  authority, are in any way inappropriate. To the contrary, they are  expanding access to the ballot. As we have said so many times, as I  close, it has never been easier in America to vote.   I yield back the balance of my time.
