 Madam Speaker, this week the Nation has seen this  Congress deal with the questions of the rule of law and the  Constitution. But this Congress believes that our work is for the  people and, at the same time, our oversight on issues of national  security are immense and important.   Yesterday, I raised a question of military presence off the shores of  Iran; for no explanation has been given to the United States Congress  on the need for that presence.   And having been a Member of Congress during the Iraq war and,  certainly, during the war in Afghanistan, committed to the men and  women of the United States military, only Congress can declare war.  This administration must advise and seek consent of Congress. But those  of us who are concerned about national security, with the  jurisdictional committees, must be briefed, and must be made aware to  protect the American people.   So I stand here today to say the rule of law is important, but the  national security of this country is important. No war without the  involvement and engagement of the United States Congress.   We believe in peace and diplomacy.  [[Page H3510]]                                ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida  for yielding, and I thank her for her leadership.   Madam Speaker, the American people will insist that this legislation  passes. My Republican friends, since my time in helping to pass the  Affordable Care Act, have never offered a plan to ensure that America's  wonderful citizens have good healthcare and that those with preexisting  conditions, such as many of us, including myself and many of my  constituents in Houston, Texas, are able to access healthcare.   Let me be clear on what this legislation does, as I thank  Representative Kuster for her leadership.   H.R. 986, of which I am strongly in support of, is a saving grace.  What it does is it stops the Trump administration in their tracks from  watering down an opportunity of flexibility, section 1332.   Here is what is going to happen if we do not pass this legislation:   We will stop the coverage of preexisting conditions, period;   There will be no protections;   You will see a rise in costs in healthcare;   Short-term plans will be thrown to the people and other plans that  will destabilize the risk pool;   It will limit access to comprehensive coverage because the Trump  guidance says: Just give access and don't worry about if the plan even  allows you to be admitted into a hospital;   And finally, it will reduce benefits like maternity coverage, mental  healthcare, and coverage of prescription drugs.   Is that what Americans want?   Every day, in my district, I am seeing people desperate for  healthcare. There has been not one proposal coming here.   I rise as well to support the supplemental appropriations, because I  have been to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. We need these  resources.   But I have also seen the devastation of victims impacted by Hurricane  Michael in Alabama, Florida, and Georgia; the damage in Nebraska,  Missouri, South Dakota, Iowa, Kansas, and now in Houston, 10 inches of  rain and flooding and more rain coming. I know that people who were  impacted by Hurricane Harvey are still suffering.  [[Page H3513]]    This particular legislation, appropriations, is important. It is  important, in particular, to ensure that we add more funding and that  we shore up the infrastructure.   I submitted amendments that covered the idea of improving FEMA so  that it would stay longer and it would have oversight to know whether  it is helping people; to increase energy services so that we don't  black out so that people are suffering; and to make sure we have the  right kind of water.   There are many other elements to the appropriations bill which I hope  to debate at a later time, but this rule should be supported.   Let me additionally go back to the H.R. 986 legislation and indicate  that preexisting diseases cover things like sickle cell, which 1 in 13  African American babies are born with; triple negative breast cancer,  which is the most deadly and causes immediate or short-term life to  White women, Black women, Asian Pacific Islander, American Indian, and  Alaska Native women; diabetes; and HIV/AIDS.   This is why H.R. 986 is important, Madam Speaker, and why the  appropriations bill is important.   Madam Speaker, I rise in strong and unequivocal support for the rule  governing debate on H.R. 986, the ``Protecting Americans With Pre- Existing Conditions Act of 2019'' as well as the underlying legislation  and ask all Members to join me in supporting these legislative  initiatives that combat the Trump Administration's ongoing efforts to  take away health care from more than 100 million Americans and to make  health care dramatically less affordable for those fortunate enough to  be insured.   Another reason I strongly support this rule is that it makes in order  H.R. 2157, the ``Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2019,'' which  provides much needed and long overdue relief to Americans in Puerto  Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands still suffering from the ravages of  Hurricanes Maria and Irma, as well as relief to victims of Hurricane  Michael which struck Alabama, Florida, and Georgia in October 2018 and  to the victims of the Midwestern floods that have caused so much damage  in Nebraska, Missouri, South Dakota, Iowa, and Kansas.   H.R. 986, rescinds this damaging, dangerous guidance immediately, and  reinforces the ACA's vital protections for people with pre-existing  conditions.   It also prevents the Secretaries of HHS and Treasury from  promulgating any substantially similar guidance or rule in the future.   Section 1332 of the State Innovation Waivers included in the ACA has  a clear statutory directive that states must maintain the level of  benefits, affordability, and coverage provided to state residents by  the ACA.   This Administration's 2018 Guidance allows states to simply  demonstrate that a comparable number of residents will have access to  comprehensive and affordable coverage, regardless of whether they  actually enroll in that coverage, thereby allowing the Secretaries of  HHS and Treasury to approve waivers that do not provide coverage that  is as affordable or as comprehensive as under the ACA.   The ``Protecting Americans with Pre-Existing Conditions Act'' is a  vital legislative measure that emphasizes the importance of not  limiting coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions or  imposing lifetime limits on access to care.   Predatory practices such as this will prove to be devastating to  communities across the nation, many of which, who will be affected are  disproportionately communities of color.   The people receiving the life-sustaining medical protections under  this provision will be cast aside and left with no way to cover the  exorbitant healthcare costs that would otherwise be covered in through  the Affordable Care Act.   Relenting on this protection will put a great number of my  constituents and various communities across the nation at terrible  risk.   Specifically, in the 18th Congressional District many of my  constituents are disproportionally affected by several pre-existing  conditions such as:   Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) affects approximately 100,000 Americans and  occurs among about 1 out of every 365 Black or African-American births.   SCD occurs among about 1 out of every 16,300 Hispanic-American  births.   And 1 in 13 Black or African-American babies is born with sickle cell  trait (SCT).   During 2005, medical expenditures for children with SCD averaged  $11,702 for children with Medicaid coverage and $14,772 for children  with employer-sponsored insurance.   About 40 percent of both groups had at least one hospital stay.   The most common cancer in women, no matter your race or ethnicity.   The most common cause of death from cancer among Hispanic women.   The second most common cause of death from cancer among white, Black,  Asian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native women.   Diabetes is at an all-time high in the U.S. and continues to increase  exponentially every year.   The CDC's Division of Diabetes Translation states that over 30  million Americans are living with Diabetes, over a quarter undiagnosed.   This trend continues in the state of Texas, where Diabetes is the 6th  leading cause of death.   Nearly 12 percent of Texas is living with diagnosed Diabetes.   According to a collaboration report between the nonprofit Texas  Health Institute, the State Demographer's Office and Methodist  Healthcare Ministries of South Texas, one in three adult Texans are  either diagnosed with diabetes, have diabetes but have not yet been  diagnosed, or are at high risk for developing the disease within a  decade.   Approximately 1.1 million people in the U.S. are living with HIV  today.   About 15 percent of them (1 in 7) are unaware they are infected.   The Center for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that the decline in  HIV infections has plateaued because effective HIV prevention and  treatment are not adequately reaching those who could most benefit from  them.   These gaps remain particularly troublesome in rural areas and in the  South and among disproportionately affected populations like blacks/ African Americans and Hispanics/Latinos.   The overall prevalence of CKD in the general population is  approximately 14 percent.   High blood pressure and diabetes are the main causes of CKD.   Almost half of individuals with CKD also have diabetes and/or self- reported cardiovascular disease (CVD).   More than 661,000 Americans have kidney failure. Of these, 468,000  individuals are on dialysis, and roughly 193,000 live with a  functioning kidney transplant.   Kidney disease often has no symptoms in its early stages and can go  undetected until it is very advanced.   For this reason, kidney disease is often referred to as a ``silent  disease.''   What is also concerning is the overwhelming number of constituents  plagued by these diseases, are people of color, African American,  Latino, and Native American.   H.R. 986 stopped the Trump Administration in its tracks from taking  away health care from vulnerable Americans.   Madam Speaker, the Trump administration cannot be trusted to act in  the best interests of the American people that is why I offered two  amendments to H.R. 986, which would extend the prohibitions of the bill  to (1) ban lifetime limits with respect to persons with preexisting  conditions and (2) prevent the Secretaries from taking any action that  would reduce the affordability of comprehensive coverage for children  under 26 with pre-existing conditions who are covered under their  parents' policies.   I will soon be introducing legislation that will achieve these  important objectives and protect vulnerable Americans from an uncaring  Administration that is unceasing in its efforts to take away health  care from vulnerable Americans.   Madam Speaker, H.R. 2157, the ``Supplemental Appropriations Act of  2019,'' provides much needed and long overdue relief to Americans in  Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands still suffering from the  ravages of Hurricanes Maria and Irma, as well as relief to victims of  Hurricane Michael which struck Alabama, Florida, and Georgia in October  2018 and to the victims of the Midwestern floods.   I support this legislation and offered an amendment that would have  provided additional funding for electricity delivery and necessary  expenses related to the consequences of Hurricanes Harvey, Maria, Irma,  and Super Typhoon Yutu including technical assistance related to  electric grids.   As the representative of the Eighteenth Congressional District of  Texas, which was ground zero for Hurricane Harvey, I regularly hear  from constituents expressing their concern with ineffective and  inadequate FEMA mechanisms put in place to help rectify the damage  caused by natural disasters.   That is why I also offered an amendment to H.R. 2157 that would  prohibit funds in the bill from being used to prevent the FEMA  Administrator from monitoring the response given to disaster victims in  order to ensure quality control or becoming aware of complaints  regarding the response given to disaster victims and having in place a  mechanism to address such complaints.   A third Jackson Lee amendment to H.R. 2157 would have provided a  minimum of $1 million for wastewater and drinking water treatment works  and facilities impacted by Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria.   Hurricane Sandy inflicted more than $70 billion in damages in 2012,  and Matthew cost  [[Page H3514]]  the U.S. about $10.3 billion in 2016. With Harvey, an estimated 13  million people were affected, nearly 135,000 homes damaged or destroyed  in the historic flooding, and up to a million cars were wrecked.   Hurricane Harvey ranks as the second-most costly hurricane to hit the  U.S. mainland since 1900, causing more than $125 billion in damage.   Our residents need more money than for single-family home repairs,  whether it is disaster recovery or general housing dollars and I will  continue to stride on behalf of the neighborhoods and on behalf of  hard-working homeowners who deserve these funds, so they can continue  on with their lives and return to their homes.   Victims of natural disasters are entitled to know who to contact when  issues related to FEMA arise and to be assured that their questions are  answered, and complaints addressed.   Allocating funding for measures such as Electricity Delivery for  necessary expenses related to the consequences of Hurricanes Harvey,  Maria, Irma, and Super Typhoon Yutu, is vital to negate the effects of  these catastrophic events from significantly worsening.   Hospitals, first-responders, and a number of other vital institutions  that help our communities recover from the after-effects of natural  disasters need access to electricity.   Moreover, with the severity of natural disasters and the ranging of  their locations we must be proactive in our preparation for recovery.   Alternatively, water is the most essential recourse known to man.   A human can go for more than three weeks without food--Mahatma Gandhi  survived 21 days of complete starvation--but water is a different  story.   At least 60 percent of the adult body is made of it and every living  cell in the body needs it to keep functioning.   Under extreme conditions an adult can lose 1 to 1.5 liters of sweat  per hour and if that lost water is not replaced, the total volume of  body fluid can fall quickly and, most dangerously, blood volume may  drop.   We do not have the luxury of not preparing for hurricanes, floods,  earthquakes, mudslides, tornados or other natural disasters.   With these events it is not a question of if, but when.   For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the  underlying legislation.    Madam Speaker, I happen to live and be in the area  of the Texas Children's Hospital. I have obviously supported the  legislation of   Danny Davis.   The point is that people with preexisting conditions, including  sickle cell, will not have access to healthcare under the Trump  guidance.   I am standing here not about the research, which is certainly  beneficial, but about the fact that I am standing for those with sickle  cell, which is a preexisting condition, to not be blocked from having  good healthcare. That is why I rise to support H.R. 986, in order to  ensure access to healthcare and not stopping preexisting conditions  from being covered.    Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman very much for  yielding.   Just a second on memory lane, for those of us who were here for the  Affordable Care Act, dozens of our committees, including the Judiciary  Committee, heard the pain of people whose family members had died  because they had no access to healthcare and/or they had junk policies.   Mr. Chair, I rise today with the strongest of support for H.R. 986. I  thank my good friend, Ann Kuster, for her great leadership and indicate  that since the Affordable Care Act--and I know that we are now looking  at Medicare for All and many others. My view of it is yes, so that we  all can have access to healthcare.   It is, in fact, sure that this bill that we now have, which is being  attacked by the Trump administration in the Fifth Circuit right now  because of my attorney general attacking the Affordable Care Act, Texas  saw a national decrease of the uninsured from 14.8 to 8.8.   Now this legislation, which is to turn back the Trump guidance on the  issue of waivers, is vital because we have lower costs for health  insurance because of the ability for people to access and be taken care  of with the Affordable Care Act when they have preexisting conditions.   Sickle cell, triple negative breast cancer, and diabetes all plague  my constituency. Insulin costs are going through the roof. With this  guidance that Trump has put in place, it will be worse. It will be  compounded.   Rates will go up, and people suffering from preexisting conditions,  including pregnancy, will not get policies at a low cost. They will not  have comprehensive coverage that will include mental health. Certainly,  they will see a reverse of them being able to have coverage for  preexisting conditions.  [[Page H3526]]    That is the civil rights of healthcare. Preexisting conditions must  be protected.   I rise to enthusiastically support H.R. 986, and I demand that the  Trump administration stop taking away constitutional rights in  everything and denying people their right to good healthcare. Enough is  enough. Let us support this legislation.   Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 986, the ``Protecting  Americans With Pre-Existing Conditions Act of 2019,'' which blocks the  Trump Administration's efforts to give states the ability to weaken the  Affordable Care Act's critical protections for Americans with pre- existing conditions.   On October 22, 2018, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS), HHS, and Treasury issued a guidance on Section 1332 of the ACA,  which authorizes states to waive certain requirements of the law and  experiment with health insurance reforms that could improve the well- being and health of their residents.   The ACA has a clear statutory directive that states must maintain the  level of benefits, affordability, and coverage provided to state  residents by the ACA.   Section 1332 requires states to meet four statutory ``guardrails''  simultaneously and demonstrate that the proposed waiver will provide  comprehensive, affordable coverage to a comparable number of residents  as under the ACA, without increasing the federal deficit.   But in the 2018 guidance, HHS and Treasury revised the agencies'  interpretation of the statutory requirements, and significantly  loosened the standards that states must meet in order to receive waiver  approval, setting forth weaker requirements that must be met for the  affordability and comprehensiveness guardrails and adopted a new  definition of what classifies as coverage.   The 2018 guidance provided by the Trump Administration would allow  states to simply demonstrate that a comparable number of residents will  have access to comprehensive and affordable coverage, regardless of  whether they actually enroll in that coverage, thereby allowing the  Secretaries of HHS and Treasury to approve waivers that do not provide  coverage that is as affordable or as comprehensive as under the ACA.   The 2018 guidance also allows states to receive waiver approval for  proposals that direct the ACA's tax credit subsidies towards STLDI  plans and other types of health insurance plans that do not provide  protections for pre-existing conditions.   H.R. 986 revokes and rescinds the October 2018 Section 1332 guidance  and prohibits the Secretaries of HHS and Treasury from promulgating any  substantially similar guidance or rule.   These improper waivers leave consumers with less comprehensive plans  that do not cover needed services, such as prescription drugs,  maternity care and substance use disorder treatment.   Another way the ``Protecting Pre-Existing Conditions and Making  Health Care More Affordable Act of 2019,'' protects consumers is by  prohibiting insurance companies from selling junk health insurance  plans that do not provide coverage for essential medical treatments and  drugs or cover people with pre-existing medical conditions.   As a member of Congress who voted against each of the dozens of  Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, I know first-hand  how important and critical access to affordable, high quality,  accessible health care available to everyone, including those with pre- existing conditions, to the well-being of American families.   Because of the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the national  uninsured rate has been slashed from 14.8 in 2012 to 8.8 percent in  2018. Texas has long led the nation in rate of uninsured so the  comparable rates are 24.6 and 15 percent, respectively.   Mr. Chair, I distinctly recall a candidate for the highest public  office in the land saying ``Obamacare is a disaster'' and appealing for  voters to support him with this question: ``What have you got to  lose?''   The question deserves a response so I hope that person, who occupies  the Oval Office, is listening to my answer.   The Affordable Care Act, or ``Obamacare,'' has been an unmitigated  success to the more than 20 million Americans who for the first time  now have the security and peace of mind that comes with affordable,  accessible, high quality health care.   Mr. Chair, Tip O'Neill used to say that ``all politics is local'' so  let me share with you how Obamacare has dramatically changed lives for  the better for the people in my home state of Texas.   1.874 million Texans who have gained coverage since the ACA was  implemented could lose their coverage if the ACA is entirely or  partially repealed or invalidated.   1.1 million Texans who purchased high quality Marketplace coverage  now stand to lose their coverage if Texas v. United States, No. 4:18- cv-00167-0 (N.D. Tex.), the lawsuit brought by Republican Governors,  and now whole-heartedly supported and aided by the Trump Administration  were to succeed.   508,000 kids in Texas who have gained coverage since the ACA was  implemented are also at risk of having their coverage rolled back.   205,000 young adult Texans who were able to stay on a parent's health  insurance plan thanks to the ACA now stand to lose coverage if the  Republican Congress eliminates the requirement that insurers allow  children to stay on their parents' plans until age 26.   646,415 Texans who received cost-sharing reductions to lower out-of- pocket costs such as deductibles, co-pays, and coinsurance are now at  risk of having healthcare become unaffordable if the Republican  Congress eliminates costsharing reductions.   10.28 million Texans who now have private health insurance that  covers preventive services without any co-pays, coinsurance, or  deductibles stand to lose this access if the Republican Congress  eliminates ACA provisions requiring health insurers to cover important  preventive services without cost-sharing.   913,177 individuals Texans who received financial assistance to  purchase Marketplace coverage in 2016, averaging $271 per individual,  are at risk of having coverage become unaffordable if the Republican  Congress eliminates the premium tax credits.   1.1 million Texans could have insurance if all states adopted the  ACA's Medicaid expansion; these individuals will not be able to gain  coverage if the Republican Congress eliminates the Medicaid expansion.   Women in Texas who can now purchase insurance for the same price as  men are at risk of being charged more for insurance if the ACA's ban on  gender rating in the individual and small group markets is invalidated.   Before the ACA, women paid up to 56 percent more than men for their  health insurance.   Roughly 4.5 million Texans who have pre-existing health conditions  are at risk of having their coverage rescinded, being denied coverage,  or being charged significantly more for coverage if the ACA's ban on  pre-existing conditions is struck down.   346,750 Texas seniors who have saved an average of $1,057 each as a  result of closing the Medicare prescription drug ``donut hole'' gap in  coverage stand to lose this critical help going forward.   1.75 million Texas seniors who have received free preventive care  services thanks to ACA provisions requiring coverage of annual wellness  visits and eliminating cost-sharing for many recommended preventive  services covered by Medicare Part B, such as cancer screenings, are at  risk of losing access to these services if congressional Republicans go  forward with their plan to repeal the ACA.   The Affordable Care Act works and has made a life-affirming  difference in the lives of millions of Americans, in Texas and across  the country.   This is what happens when a visionary president cares enough to work  with a committed and empathetic Congress to address the real issues  facing the American people.   You want to know why the American people have Obamacare?   It is because Obama cared.   The same cannot be said about this Republican president and  congressional Republicans who have made careers of attacking and  undermining the Affordable Care Act's protections and benefits for the  American people.   I urge all Members to vote for H.R. 986 and send a powerful message  to the President and the American people that this House will not stand  idly by as this Administration tries to take away health care from more  than 130 million persons.   Instead, this House will resist by all constitutional and appropriate  means, including opposing this Administration in the courts and by  passing H.R. 986, the ``Protecting Pre-Existing Conditions and Making  Health Care More Affordable Act of 2019.''    Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.   I want to join both Congresswoman Jayapal and Congresswoman Lee on  just reinforcing the devastation and the dastardliness of child  separation from their parents. I would just like to very briefly say  that this sad commemoration should equate to a commitment of zero  tolerance for separating children from their families.   We should end the migrant policy that includes child separation, the  position of remaining in Mexico as you seek asylum, the losing of your  space, or your bed, if you are in a shelter and have to be sent back to  Mexico when you actually apply for asylum. All of these migrant  policies, which included child separation, clearly can devastate the  families.   So I want to emphasize just one point that included my many trips to  the border, including the time we had the opportunity to travel  together, and I want to focus on the psychological and maybe  irreparable damage that is being done particularly to children in the  understandable period. That is not a technical term. I am not a  sociologist or a psychologist, but in that period where the child may  be somewhere between 4 and 15, or 4 and 12. Those are really years  when, whether it is a boy or girl, they are bonding with mom. People  must realize that those children traveled thousands of miles or 1,000- plus miles with that parent and mostly that mother, and it has been a  dad.                                time  2030    So that mother made a sacrifice, either out of lack of understanding  of the language or signing a paper that she did not understand or  thinking that she needed to separate because of the housing situation,  and many of us saw the housing situation and the metallic blankets and  the lack of space.   Let me just say this for the personnel on the border. We found some  very empathetic personnel on the border, men and women who do their  job. But the resources of the facilities are absolutely inadequate and  disgraceful, and they have been like that on the border of Texas for a  very long time.   So I am grateful for Congresswoman Lee and Congresswoman Lucille  Roybal-Allard, those who realize we have to really overhaul those  facilities, that will include healthcare facilities and otherwise.   But in that reunion, you might say--and there were good staff people  who thought they were doing the right thing, and they were excited with  the expectation. They had brought the children.   I remember two little boys. First of all, there wasn't a dry eye in  the room of those of us who had come. It was just unspeakable. It was  overwhelming. It brought back memories. You thought about your children  or your extended family members.   So two little boys, crisp little white shirts on over at a table  playing with the best red fire truck and truck that they could find. In  walk mothers who went to different corners. But in walks this mother  with her belongings, as I recollect, like in a pillowcase, not even a  suitcase. Obviously, you have traveled 1,000 miles plus, and then you  have been detained somewhere and your child went off some other place.   She comes with those welled-up eyes of expectation. She stood by that  table for the longest period of time.   We all know there is no way you don't know someone is standing behind  you or there is no way you don't recognize your mom even in the sight  of your eye who was walking in. We know how mom and children are, mom  and dad. They break that big grin, and they run like they have never  run before to get into the arms of that mom and dad.   This mom stood there with her pillowcase belongings for the longest  period of time, and those little boys continued to play and ignore and  play and ignore and play and ignore. I almost wanted to reach out and  turn that little face back here.   There was no way they did not know mom was standing there, but the  detachment was so devastating. When that mom put her arms around  precious little boy, he was so stiff that I knew this was going to take  a very long time.   What I was fearful of was, where they would be destined, there would  be no resources for his treatment, for his ability to understand what  happened.   How callous this policy is, to date, that there are still some  separated children; and with the leadership we have now, we don't know  whether they will do it again.   So I thank the gentlewoman for doing this because, even now, my eyes  well up because children are children, and we will never repair the  damage, but we must stop this policy. It must be zero tolerance. We  must not have this policy ever again. It is truly inhumane, and it is  not representative of the values of this Nation, in spite of some of  the history we have had as a country.   This is a nation where people believe in that sense of dignity and  equality. Our values say that. We need to act on that and, certainly,  humanity, which is so very important.    Madam Speaker, first of all, let me thank  Congresswoman Alma Adams for gathering us a couple of weeks ago to  stand and be counted as members of the Black Maternal Mortality Caucus;  and to continue her recognition that if we don't become problem solvers  the problems will continue.   So I want to join with my colleagues, and, in particular,  Congresswoman Adams and Congresswoman Lee, both of whom I knew in the  time that they were going through the loss of their moms.   A mom and a mother are always a mom and a mother, so let me, in the  name of my late mother, who I continue to remember, Ivalita Bennett  Jackson, indicate that we stand here in your name and in the names of  young mothers around the Nation and young mothers-to-be.   I don't believe we could be doing a more important task than what we  are doing, to not only bring relevance and substance to this question  of why Black women, African American women, suffer more with maternal  mortality and infant mortality; because we know what happens when that  bond is broken by death or sickness, particularly in the infant stages  of a young child's life.   So I want to remind us of the beauty of pregnancy, and particularly,  those pregnancies that these young women are certainly evidencing, just  the beauty of the spirit, the softness of their faces and the contours  of their body, excitement. If you have been around a pregnant expectant  mother, meaning expectant of joy and excitement, then you understand.   Should they not live? Should they not live, and should their  children, their babies not live?   We have come to find out that Black women are three to four times as  likely than White women to die of pregnancy-related causes. A Black  baby born today is twice as likely as a White baby born the same day,  in the same California city--and I will mention the fact that  California has made great strides--to perish before she can take her  first steps or experience her first birthday.    One in seven babies are born too soon or too small. We have  euphemisms that mask the real impact of the maternal healthcare crisis.  Good prenatal and maternity care is critically important for healthy  pregnancies and healthy children.   Congresswoman Adams knows that we have been on the floor discussing  access to healthcare. We know that pregnancy has been described as a  preexisting condition, which means that women, even if they could,  could not access good healthcare.   Collectively, we need to make greater efforts to arm the next  generation with the right mix of robustness and agility and, I would  say, righteousness; that we are righteously indignant that we live in  the greatest Nation in the world, and here we are talking about the  death of mothers and the death of their infant child.   As I listened to Congresswoman Adams speak of her beautiful, taller- than-her grandchild, imagine that she says the healthcare that her  daughter had, in spite of the horrific challenges--just think if she  did not, or no one had listened to her about the pain in her body or  how she felt.   That is one the things that we find with Black women, that, in fact,  they are not paid attention to as relates to the pain and medical  symptoms that are represented by them. They are dismissed or taken less  seriously.   Let me quickly say that, as the senior member on the Crime  Subcommittee, I have had the privilege of knowing that crime impacts  humanity in many different ways. And so I introduced legislation called  H.R. 5130, the Stop Infant Mortality and Recidivism Reduction Act of  2016.   I am very glad, as I wrote the Violence Against Women Act, that I was  able to include the SIMARRA Act in the 115th Congress, but it was  proudly passed in H.R. 1585, the Violence Against Women Reauthorization  Act of 2019.   The SIMARRA Act permits the Bureau of Prisons to improve the  effectiveness and efficiency of Federal prison systems for pregnant  offenders, many of whom are African American, by establishing a pilot  program, a critical stage, and developmental nurseries in Federal  prisons for children born to inmates.   The SIMARRA Act helps decrease, unprecedentedly high current infant  mortality rates by allowing inmate mothers to provide healthy and safe  gestation for their unborn, as well as providing a space for bonding  with infants during their first 30 months of life.   It is important to administer effective services for pregnant,  incarcerated women and transcend our divide, to protect families and  continue sheltering the lives of our most vulnerable children, babies  born to mothers in prison.   And although males account for 96 percent of the deaths, according to  the U.S. Department of Justice, in 2014, the number of female prisoners  who died was 154.   I use this example to simply say, we found a problem in incarcerated  women, many of them African American, and we sought to get in the way  of that problem by finding a solution, to be able to help those mothers  have a healthy pregnancy and those babies be born.   So let me just simply say that I am glad to be on the floor to be  with my sisters. I am unhappy to be on the floor because, as we stand  here today, some African American mother is losing her life in birth or  losing the life of her child. That is how devastating maternal  mortality is.   I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership, and I am here to stand  with her and fight with her, and this caucus is going to help save  lives. We are saving lives tonight.
