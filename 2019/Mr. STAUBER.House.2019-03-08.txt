 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of Coach Mike  Guzzo of Silver Bay, Minnesota, for impacting the lives of countless  young athletes across the great State of northern Minnesota.   When Mike and his wife moved back to his hometown of Silver Bay in  1984, they thought the move might be temporary. However, not long after  his return, Mike began to coach youth hockey. Arguably it was his most  important role as a coach and mentor that caused him to stay in Silver  Bay for the long term.   Mike spent over 30 years coaching the great game of hockey in the  great  [[Page H2609]]  State of hockey. At the end of this season, Mike hung up his skates and  whistle and retired. When asked what he would miss most, Mike said it  would be his players.   Growing up playing the sport of ice hockey myself, I will always  remember the coaches for whom I played. I have carried the lessons that  they taught me throughout my adult life.   Coach Guzzo, I thank you for serving as a role model to these  athletes both on and off the ice. I know from my experience as a player  that they will always appreciate everything that you have given to the  hockey community.   I also want to thank Coach Guzzo for his dedication to the Silver Bay  community and rural Minnesota. This community of Silver Bay matters,  and Coach Guzzo, your life made it better.   Coach Guzzo, to you and your wife, I wish you a happy, healthy, and  long retirement.                            ____________________
