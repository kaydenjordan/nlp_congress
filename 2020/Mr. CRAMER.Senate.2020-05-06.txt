 Mr. President, I want to recognize the 50th  anniversary this month of FirstLink, a vital North Dakota organization  which provides free and confidential mental health, suicide prevention,  and other services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.   FirstLink offers listening and support, resource referrals and crisis  intervention. Across the entire State of North Dakota and parts of  Minnesota, FirstLink answers calls for 17 agencies, notably the 211  helpline and the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Those reaching  out for help now have the ability to also communicate by text messaging  at 898-211.   Last year, FirstLink answered 60,148 calls. Of those, 13,446 were  related to suicide. Its Caring Contacts service receives referrals from  hospitals and clinics across North Dakota in addition to the phone  calls that come in. Caring Contacts offers informal resources and  coping strategies, encourages mental health treatment, and provides  nonjudgmental listening and support. These calls are offered around the  schedules of the individuals in need. Additional training is also  offered to staff and volunteers from other State organizations working  with people of all ages.   FirstLink began as a grassroots volunteer organization in the Fargo  area, first taking calls 6 hours a day. It has grown in hours and  scope, thanks to private and public support, a staff of 20, a 12-member  board, and many volunteers.   The profound impact of the work FirstLink has done over these past 50  years can never be adequately measured. On behalf of all North  Dakotans, I congratulate and sincerely thank executive director Cindy  Miller and all staff and volunteers for the difference their commitment  has made to the quality of life in our State. May your next 50 years be  just as meaningful.                            ____________________
