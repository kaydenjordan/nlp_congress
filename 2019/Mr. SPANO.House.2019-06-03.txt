 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize three schools  that recently finished excellent high school baseball seasons.   First, I want to congratulate Lakeland Christian, who capped off a  24-win season by winning the Florida Class 3A State championship on  June 1. It was no small feat to knock off a three-time defending State  champion, but under the leadership of Coach Blane Fox, they won 3 to 1.  This was the first Polk County team to win a baseball State title in 24  years.   Second, it should come as no surprise to those who know Florida  baseball that it was two Hillsborough County schools, Plant City and  Strawberry Crest, that faced off in the Class 8A championship on May  30.   Plant City, under the leadership of Coach Michael Fryrear got off to  a quick start and never looked back, winning 3 to 1 over Coach Eric  Beattie's Strawberry Crest team and finishing the season with 30 wins.   I congratulate Florida Class 3A State champions, Lakeland Christian;  Class 8A State champions, Plant City; and Class 8A runner-up,  Strawberry Crest. Madam Speaker, all three teams should be proud of  their accomplishments over this past season.                            ____________________
