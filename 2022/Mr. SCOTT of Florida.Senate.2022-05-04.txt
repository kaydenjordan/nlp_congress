 I call up my motion, which is at the desk.    Mr. President, this government is $30 trillion  in debt, and Congress is working every day to spend money like it is  burning a hole in our pocket. This bill has billions of spending,  billions of taxpayer dollars, and zero mandates for return on  investment. That is crazy. It is crazy and illogical. No American would  make a deal like this for their business or their family. Congress  shouldn't do it with your tax dollars either.   The conferees must ensure this bill makes all taxpayer funds subject  to a comprehensive return-on-investment analysis with clawback  provisions and mandate a report on how every dollar is spent.   We used taxpayer dollars to incentivize private sector growth when I  was Governor of Florida. It helped bring businesses to my State and  create jobs. But we always had return-on-investment metrics and  clawbacks for when those metrics weren't met. We should be demanding  the same here, and I urge my colleagues to join me and support  accountability to the taxpayer.    Madam President, if there had been a recorded  roll call vote on the Menendez motion to instruct conferees in relation  to H.R. 4521, USICA, I would have voted no.   If there had been a recorded roll call vote on the Kelly motion to  instruct conferees in relation to H.R. 4521, USICA, I would have voted  no.                            ____________________
