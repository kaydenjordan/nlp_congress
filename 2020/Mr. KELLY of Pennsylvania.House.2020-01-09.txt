 Mr. Speaker, I was sitting in my office  watching this debate, and I began to wonder who it is that we are  actually debating against or what it is that we are debating against.   I think back to the killing of Osama bin Laden when we stood together  as the United States in saying this was the right thing to do at the  right time because it would save lives; the only thing we regretted was  that we didn't do it sooner when we had the chance to take him out, but  we delayed because we weren't sure.  [[Page H111]]                                     time  1715    I have gone back and read what President Obama said and he said, ``I  made this decision on my own.'' Yet, today, we stand in the people's  House, and we are worried more about the loss of an election in 2020  than the loss of American lives and the continued loss of lives around  the world by one of the worst terrorists of all time.   We sit here and try to pretend this charade is what we are concerned  about. But what we are really concerned about is giving too much power  to this President. This is a President who acted boldly. This is a  President who carried out a strike that was so precise, so strategic,  nothing else was hurt except the car in which that terrorist was riding  in.   Yet, we sit here today and say: Our problem in America isn't  terrorists around the world. Our problem in America is that we have a  President who is too damn strong. The rest of the world knows today  that our enemies certainly do fear us, because they know there is a  deterrent in the White House.   Our friends and allies know that America will always be there, will  always be there if we say we are going to be there, and we will always  stand up for the values that this country has always stood for.   To have this debate tonight and this resolution is not about securing  America or making America safer. This is about taking powers away from  the President of the United States. We can call this anything we want  and say, not just this President but any President in the future.   My God, are you kidding me? Are you kidding me? This is the people's  House and our biggest responsibility is protecting our American  citizens, and we are having this debate tonight? Please, do not tell me  this is about taking away the Authorization for the Use of Military  Force. This is about taking away powers from the President.
