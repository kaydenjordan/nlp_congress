 Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the  desk.    Madam Chair, since 1980, we have had about  220  [[Page H653]]  disasters that have caused over $1 billion in damages. In fact, when  you add all that money up, we have spent about $1.5 trillion in  disaster recovery, nearly all of that being emergency spending, adding  to our deficit.   Now, the thing that we do here in the Federal Government to help  bring an offense to the table, to help address resiliency, is largely  the mission of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers: projects for flood  protection, for water management, for ecosystem restoration that can  help improve the resiliency of our communities, hurricane protection in  my home State of Louisiana.   Yet we have a $100 billion backlog in Corps of Engineer projects  across the United States. This Congress provides between $1 billion and  $2 billion a year in construction.   Madam Chair, you can do the math. You have $100 billion in authorized  projects. You get $1 billion to $2 billion a year in construction, you  will finish that backlog approximately never. You are not going to  finish it.   And so what we did in the Disaster Recovery and Reform Act in  October, that was signed into law in October and passed through this  body three times, is we did a provision that says that FEMA's Hazard  Mitigation Grant Program funds can be used to build a Corps of  Engineers' project if your State, if your community determines that is  the highest priority.   Right now, under Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery  Funds, there is a prohibition--and this is largely boilerplate  language--that prohibits these funds from being used for a Corps of  Engineers' project.   What this amendment does is it simply removes that if a State, if  your community determines that that is the highest priority, addressing  resiliency, telling your community that it is okay to build back here  because we are going to make it safer, we are going to reduce the risk,  prevent you from having future disaster, future damages.   Madam Chair, right now, sitting in the gallery is a group of students  from Ed White High School in my home State of Louisiana. They have a  project in their community that has been in the study phase since 1992,  and the Corps of Engineers has spent $80 million studying it. That is  ridiculous. It has caused billions of dollars in flood damages in this  area. This project has not moved forward.   We have got to make sure that we are advancing these projects as  quickly as we can, improving the resilience of our communities. So this  amendment, again, makes the CDBG-DR funds eligible if your State, if  your community determines that is the highest and best value, the best  investments of the funds.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's  question, and certainly there is no intention under the provision as  written to appropriate or provide more funds than are authorized under  the existing act or allocated to that State or county or parish or what  have you.                                time  1615    In addition, obviously, there would be no intention under the  provision to spend more money than the project is actually authorized  for because you couldn't build a project more than once.   I hope that was responsive to the gentleman's question.    Madam Chair, the chairman brings up a good  point in that is the authorized amount the full authorized amount that  the Federal law for a Corps of Engineers project provides? For example,  if Congress authorized a flood protection project for $100 million,  could they possibly get more than $100 million? The answer to that  question is no.   The second question to attempt to clarify would be, if a community is  allocated $50 million through the CDBG-DR program, would it be possible  for them to spend more than $50 million on the project? Once again, to  the chairman's question, the answer would be no. This would not intend  to obligate or in any way spend more money that is allocated to them  under CDBG-DR or under the authorized project in Federal law.    Yes. Absolutely. That is the intention that  we would not exceed the authorized amount of the project authorized by  the Corps or by FEMA. As I indicated, we couldn't build a project more  than once, so whatever that authorized level is in existing Federal  law, that would apply.    Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from  North Carolina and thank the Rules Committee for making this in order.   Madam Chair, I urge adoption, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition,  but I don't intend to oppose the amendment.    Madam Chair, I want to thank my colleague  from Louisiana (Mr. Richmond) and the chairman from North Carolina for  their help in getting these amendments put together, both the last one  and this one.   As my good friend from Louisiana indicated, this is the result of  lessons learned, unfortunately, from countless disasters in our home  State.   What this does is it assures conformity between this appropriations  bill and law, as indicated, the Disaster Recovery Reform Act that was  signed into law in October, to ensure--and let me be clear, Madam  Chair. That bill passed the House of Representatives three times, the  last time by voice vote; and I think the second to last time it passed  with maybe 12 opposing votes in this entire body, but not because of  this provision. None of those opposing votes had anything to do with  this provision.   What it does is it simply says, in the aftermath of a disaster, if  you applied for a loan, that doesn't make you ineligible for grants  that anyone else can apply for. We shouldn't penalize people for  leaning forward, being proactive, and seeking loans, and then tell them  later they can't be eligible for a grant. The alternative is they stay  in a FEMA-supplied hotel room, incurring taxpayers more cost, and it  delays recovery.   So what Mr. Richmond's provision does is it ensures conformity to the  changes in law that occurred in October in this appropriations bill,  the duplication of benefits as applied in a consistent manner. I want  to thank him for his continued leadership on this issue and working  together.   Madam Chair, I urge adoption of the amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
