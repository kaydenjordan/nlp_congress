 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, last week, the Senate confirmed President  Trump's 150th judge. That is a significant milestone and one that has  been harder to achieve than it normally would be thanks to the  Democrats' determination to delay judicial confirmations. Again and  again, the Democrats have used the time-consuming cloture vote process  to delay the confirmations of President Trump's nominees--even of  nominees they ultimately chose to vote for.   By this point in President Obama's first term, the Republicans had  required cloture votes on just three of President Obama's judicial  nominees--three. Compare that to today. As of September 12, the  Democrats had required cloture votes on a staggering 71.7 percent of  President Trump's picks for the bench--71 percent. Basically, for more  than two out of every three judges, the Democrats have required cloture  votes. That simply means they have filibustered that particular  nominee. The way you end the filibuster is by invoking cloture.   When the Republicans were in the minority when President Obama was in  the White House, at this point in President Obama's first term, the  Democratic majority had invoked cloture just three times for three  judges whom the Republicans had tried to block. As I said, right now,  at the same point in President Trump's first term, we are talking about  almost 72 percent of all of the nominations combined having been  filibustered. If you think about that and if you add it up totally,  cumulatively, it is about 100 now compared to 3 during President  Obama's first term at the same time in office.   As I have said, many of these were nominees the Democrats ultimately  went on to vote to confirm. In other words, it was not that President  Trump nominated scores of extreme nominees whom the Democrats felt they  couldn't support. Again and again, the Democrats have delayed a  nominee, then turned around and voted in favor of him or her.   In one particularly memorable example, in January of 2018, the  Democrats forced the Senate to spend more than a week considering four  district court judges even though not one single Democrat voted against  their confirmations--not one single Democrat. These judges could have  been confirmed in a matter of minutes by voice votes. Instead, the  Democrats forced the Senate to spend more than a week on their  considerations--time that could have been spent on genuinely  controversial nominees or on some of the many important issues that  face our country.   So far this September, the Senate has confirmed six district court  judges. The Democrats forced cloture votes on four of them despite the  fact that all four were eventually confirmed by huge bipartisan  margins. In fact, one was confirmed by a unanimous vote of 94 to 0.   If the Democrats had had a serious reason for their obstruction of  the President's judicial nominees, they would not have been repeatedly  turning around and voting for them. Their obstruction isn't based on  principle; it is based on partisanship. They don't like this President,  so they are obstructing his nominees even when they agree they are well  qualified for their positions. As a result, we are forced to spend  hours upon hours of Senate floor time on uncontroversial nominations-- time we could be using for other priorities.   Democratic delays are also not helping the judicial vacancy rate,  which is still high despite the Republicans' efforts to get judges  confirmed. High numbers of vacancies result in there being long waits  to get cases heard, which serves nobody.   While Democratic obstruction is bad enough, unfortunately, we have a  lot more to worry about. In recent months, the Democrats have moved  beyond obstruction and into directly threatening the independence of  the judiciary. Court-packing--an idea that pretty much everybody  thought had been consigned to the dustbin of history almost a century  ago--is enjoying a revival among members of the Democratic Party.   For anyone who needs a refresher on this concept, the theory of  court-packing is quite simple. If the Supreme Court is not deciding  cases to your liking, add more judges to the Court until you start  getting the decisions you want. It is not hard to see why this is a  terrible idea, but that hasn't stopped it from gaining traction in the  Democratic Party. In fact, five prominent Democrats--including a  Democratic Presidential candidate and the second-  [[Page S5585]]  ranking Democrat in the Senate--recently filed an amicus brief with the  Supreme Court that threatened the Court if it failed to rule according  to the Democrats' preference.   They wrote:         The Supreme Court is not well, and the people know it.       Perhaps the Court can heal itself before the public demands       it be restructured in order to reduce the influence of       politics.    Translation: If you don't rule the way we want you to, you will not  like the consequences.    Threatening members of the judiciary is within the domain of  dictators and despots, not Members of the U.S. Congress, and it is  deeply disturbing that prominent Democrats apparently now see nothing  wrong with trying to intimidate the Supreme Court.   Unfortunately, it is becoming apparent that there are few lengths to  which the Democrats will not go in their increasingly desperate  partisanship. Just this week, we saw the Democrats leap on the  opportunity to drag Justice Kavanaugh's name through the mud again  based on yet another vague and unsubstantiated rumor.   More than one Democratic Presidential candidate instantly cried that  he should be impeached. What was the basis for such a drastic  suggestion? It was a New York Times article that was, as the leader  pointed out, so short on reporting that it ran on the opinion page of  the New York Times instead of in the news section, not to mention that  after running this piece, the Times had to quickly issue a correction  and note a glaring omission in the original story. What was the  omission? It was the fact that the supposed victim of Justice  Kavanaugh's supposed behavior declined to be interviewed and that her  friends said she had no memory of the alleged incident.   It is not hard to see what is behind the Democrats' relentless  campaign to smear Justice Kavanaugh's name. They are furious that it  was a Republican and not a Democratic President who had the opportunity  to choose a Justice to replace a perceived swing vote on the Supreme  Court, and they are afraid that Justice Kavanaugh will not issue the  rulings they want.   Here we get to the heart of the problem with the Democrats'  increasingly unhinged leftism and attacks on the judiciary. The  Democrats aren't looking for judges or a judiciary that will rule  according to the law; they are looking for a judiciary that will rule  in accordance with the Democrats' preferred policies whether they have  anything to do with the law or not, and that is a very dangerous goal.   Sure, it might seem nice when an activist judge who shares your  political opinions reaches outside the meaning of the statute and rules  for your preferred outcome. Yet what happens when that same judge  reaches beyond the law to your detriment? What protection do you have  if the judge and not the law becomes the highest authority? The only  way to ensure the protection of individuals' rights is to ensure the  rule of law, and that means having judges who will make decisions  according to the law, not according to their personal preferences or  the principles of a particular political party's.   In the wake of the Democrats' threat to the Supreme Court, all 53  Republican Senators sent a letter to the Justices that underscored our  commitment to protecting the independence of the judiciary. We noted in  the letter:         There is no greater example of the genius of our       Constitution than its creation of an independent judiciary. .       . . Time and again, our independent federal courts have       protected the constitutional rights of Americans from       government overreach even when that overreach was politically       popular.    If we want our courts to continue protecting Americans'  constitutional rights, then we need to ensure they remain independent.   The Democrats' interest in having judges who will rule according to  their preferred outcomes is not new, but in the past, their interest  has not led them to attempt to bully judges into voting their way. I  hope the Democrats will think better of their repressive tactics before  our independent judiciary becomes the victim of their political agenda.   I yield the floor.
