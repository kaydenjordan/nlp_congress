 Mr. Speaker, as a Member of the House Energy Action Team,  I am proud to rise here this evening to shed some light on our theme of  the week, nuclear energy.   Georgia's 12th District is home to two nuclear power plants, Plant  Vogtle and Plant Hatch. We are leading the way in the expansion of our  Nation's nuclear resources with the first two nuclear reactors being  built in 30 years currently under construction at Plant Vogtle.   After visiting Vogtle in March and witnessing the placement of the  top of the unit 3 containment vessel, I can tell you that construction  is full steam ahead. I look forward to units 3 and 4 coming online as  soon as possible.   However, we currently have thousands of spent fuel rods being held in  spent fuel pools and dry cask storage containers on these sites and  around the country. We must have a permanent geological site, like  Yucca Mountain, to manage our nuclear waste.   I cosponsored the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act, which provides  a solution to this problem, and I urge Congress to act upon this bill  as soon as possible.                            ____________________
