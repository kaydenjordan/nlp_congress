 Mr. President, pursuant to the Arms Export Control Act of  1976, I move to discharge the Foreign Relations Committee from further  consideration of S.J. Res. 42, relating to the disapproval of the  proposed foreign military sale to the Government of Saudi Arabia.    Mr. President, today is an extraordinary day. Today is an  auspicious day, for we will be discussing issues of war and peace.   Believe it or not, we rarely discuss such important issues. We have  been at war for 15 years. There have been a handful of debates--most of  them indirect, most of them forced only under duress, and most of them  would have been avoided if the leadership of both parties could avoid  them, but today they cannot avoid this debate because this is what is  called a privileged motion.   Today we will discuss the involvement of the United States in the  Middle East, and we will also discuss whether we should engage in a new  war in Yemen. Today we will discuss an arms sale to Saudi Arabia that  threatens the lives of millions of Yemenis, but we will discuss  something even more important than an arms sale, we will discuss  whether we should be actively involved. Should the United States be  actively involved with refueling the Saudi planes, with picking  targets, with having advisers on the ground? Should we be at war in  Yemen?   If you remember your Constitution, it says no President has that  authority--only to repel imminent attack--but no President alone has  the unilateral authority to take us to war. Yet here we are on the  verge of war.   What will war mean for Yemen? Seventeen million folks in Yemen live  on the brink of starvation. I think to myself, is there ever anything  important that can happen in Washington? Is there anything I can do to  save some of the millions of children who are dying in Yemen? This is  it. This is this debate today.   It isn't about an arms sale, it is about children like Ali, who died.  Why are they dying? Because the Soviets have blockaded the ports.  Ninety percent of Yemen's food comes in from the ocean and they can get  no food and they are starving and dying of cholera because of war. We  think of famine being related to the weather. Sometimes it is, but more  often than not famine is related to man, is manmade, and the most  common cause is war.   How bad is it in Yemen? Seventeen million people live on the edge of  starvation. Some, like Ali, have already died. What are people saying  about it? They say that the humanitarian crisis in Yemen may be worse  than Syria.   Let me repeat that because nobody in America is listening to this.  Everybody is paying attention to some silly show trials and silly stuff  going on in committees. Nobody is talking about this at all. They say  it is worse than Syria. Millions of people have fled Syria. Hundreds of  thousands have died, and people are now predicting Yemen may be worse.   One refugee group said this: The impending famine in Yemen may reach  Biblical proportions. Think about that. It is astounding what is going  on there, and it is being done without your permission but with your  weapons.   Today I will force a vote with the help of Senator Murphy, who has  been a prime mover in this, to tell you the truth, and has done a great  job in bringing people together, but we will force this vote for these  children in Yemen because we have a chance today to stop the carnage.  We have a chance to tell Saudi Arabia we have had enough.   The question is, Should we give money or arms to Saudi Arabia at all?  What has Saudi Arabia done over the last 30 years? They have been the  No. 1 exporter of jihadist philosophy, the No. 1 exporter of let's hate  America, let's hate the Judeo-Christian ethic, let's hate the Judeo- Christian tradition. It is coming from Saudi Arabia. They teach it in  the schools in our country. They teach it in the schools in Indonesia.  They corrupt the religion of Islam throughout the world, and we are  going to give them weapons? I think it is a huge, huge mistake.   If you say: Well, I doubt that. There is no way they are that bad.  Don't they share intelligence with us? Don't they help us in the war on  terror?   Yes, every time they help us, they hurt us twofold worse. I will give  you an example directly from Hillary Clinton. When she is writing  honestly and not talking to the public, she sends an email to John  Podesta. This is one that was leaked through WikiLeaks. Writing to John  Podesta, Hillary Clinton said: We must put pressure on Saudi Arabia and  Qatar because they are supplying logistical and financial support to  ISIL.   ISIS is the group we are fighting in the Middle East again, and Saudi  Arabia was supplying them. This is according to Hillary Clinton, not  indirectly but directly.   Who in their right mind would give money, arms, or share our  technology with a country that has been supporting ISIS? Who would do  that? Who would think that is a good idea? Yet they will come here and  say that it is about Iran, and we have to combat Iran everywhere.   Guess what. This may make the situation with Iran worse. What do you  think Iran thinks when Saudi Arabia gets weapons? They think to  themselves, well, if the Saudis are getting more, we need more.   What do you think Israel thinks? If the Saudis get more, we need  more.   Have you ever heard of an arms race? That is what this is. We are  fueling an arms race in the Middle East. Every side wants more. You  say: Well, we have to do this. We have to combat Iran.   Do you know how much the Gulf sheikhdoms, Saudi Arabia, and all their  allies--the ones who are bombing the hell out of Yemen--do you know how  their military spending compares to that of Iran? It is 8 to 1. All of  the money is in the Gulf h. All of the power, all of the weapons are in  the Gulf sheikhdoms. They have more weapons and spend more on weapons-- 8 to 1--than Iran.   We are going to vote on Iran sanctions this week, and they say that  they don't want ballistic missiles Iran. Well, I don't either. The best  way to do that is to put pressure on Saudi Arabia.   How would you put pressure on Saudi Arabia? Maybe we wouldn't sell  them arms. Maybe we would withhold the sale of arms until they come to  the table and we get a ballistic agreement with Iran. It is a naive and  foolish notion to think that Iran is going to give up on their  ballistic weapons. They are never giving up on their ballistic weapons  unless Saudi Arabia did the same thing.   People don't talk about this, but Saudi Arabia has ballistic  missiles. They have Chinese missiles. They are called the Dongfeng-21  N-3. They have dozens of these. Do you know where they are pointed?  Tehran and Tel Aviv.   Saudi Arabia is no friend of Israel. Do they cooperate with Israel  some? Yes, but their missiles are pointed at Tel Aviv, Israel. Saudi  Arabia's other missiles are pointed at Tehran. Are these missiles  nuclear capable? Yes.  [[Page S3417]]  They are not thought to be nuclear tipped, meaning they haven't been  armed with nuclear missiles, but everyone who is in the arms community  acknowledges that these missiles could carry a nuclear payload if they  were altered. They have the ability to do it.   Should we send arms to Saudi Arabia? Here is another quote from Bob  Graham, and this is a paraphrase. He says that there is an abundance of  evidence that the Saudis were complicit in 9/11.   Have we forgotten that 15 out of the 19 hijackers were from Saudi  Arabia? Have we forgotten the missing 28 pages that they kept from the  American public for over a decade? When you read those missing 28  pages, which have now been released, they tend to implicate Saudi  Arabia. They tend to indicate that the attackers, particularly in San  Diego, were befriended by a government agent for Saudi Arabia.   There is an abundance of information that implicates Saudi Arabia in  9/11. In fact, less than a year ago, this very Congress voted  unanimously or virtually unanimously to let American citizens--the  victims of 9/11, their families--sue Saudi Arabia. This is an  extraordinary thing. We almost never let people sue governments,  particularly foreign governments, but we voted nearly unanimously. Why?  Because people still have sympathy for the 9/11 victims and their  families and because people obviously believe there is some information  that may implicate Saudi Arabia.    You say: Oh, no, they have changed. Well, how much could they have  changed? It was only a year or two ago Hillary Clinton was writing that  email saying that the Saudis are giving financial and logistical  support to ISIL. Who in their right mind would sell arms to Saudi  Arabia under those circumstances?   If it doesn't persuade you that the Saudis are supporting ISIL and  terrorism and may have been part of 9/11, perhaps we should look not  only at the humanitarian disaster in Yemen--what they are doing to the  public and that their goal basically is famine, to bring them to  submission--but perhaps we should also look at Saudi Arabia as a  country. Perhaps we should look at the human rights record of Saudi  Arabia.   I will give you a couple of instances of what it is like to live in  Saudi Arabia. There was a young girl who was 19 years old. They haven't  named her because her story is so traumatic. She was 19 years old. They  call her the Girl of Qatif. She was 19 years old, and she was raped by  7 men.   The men were punished, a couple of years in prison. You know what  happened? They arrested the victim because, you see, in Saudi Arabia it  is your fault if you are raped. In Saudi Arabia, rape victims are  arrested, put in prison, and publicly whipped. She was given 6 months  in prison and 200 lashes. That was her sentence.   Ultimately, it did not come to the fore. Do you know why? Partly  because the United States stood up and said it was wrong and partly  because, perhaps behind the scenes, we said: Maybe we are not going to  sell you weapons if you behave like a bunch of barbarians.   I will tell you another story about Ali al Nimr, a Shiite. The Middle  East is somewhat divided between Sunni and Shia. He is a Shiite. They  are about 10 percent of the public in Saudi Arabia. They are the  minority. They are treated like dirt. His uncle was a sheikh. And by  all accounts, he was one who called for peaceful elections, who wasn't  an advocate of violence. He never was known or seen to have a weapon  but was executed by the Saudis for leading protests. He was executed  for standing up in front of people and saying: We should have  elections. We should not have this authoritarian government that lords  it over us and does not allow us even to practice our religion in  public.   Ali's uncle was beheaded. Ali was 17 at the time. It was the  beginning of the Arab Spring, and Ali got excited and motivated. If you  see the pictures of him, it is heartbreaking. You see pictures of him  in western clothing. He liked poetry. He liked music. He was, by all  means, the kind of person that we wish would come to leadership in  Saudi Arabia.   At 17, he went to a rally and he chose to be part of the Arab Spring  to say: We don't want authoritarianism. We don't want despots. We don't  want Kings and all of their lording over us. We want elections.   For that, he was arrested and put on death row. Death row in Saudi  Arabia, being Saudi Arabia, includes beheading and crucifixion. That  will be his sentence--beheading and crucifixion.   This is the regime that you are being asked to send weapons to.  People say: Oh, they are buying them.   The technology is ours. It is American technology that was developed  for the defense of this country, and the companies would never have the  technology had we not paid them to have it. The American taxpayer has a  right to that technology, and while for almost every other good in the  marketplace the government has no right to tell you how who to sell it  to, arms are different because they are all developed by the U.S.  taxpayer.   I do believe there should be rules about who gets our arms. I don't  think we should sell them to Saudi Arabia if they might wind up in the  hands of ISIS. I don't think we should sell them to Saudi Arabia if  they punish people for protests, if they punish people for speaking out  by beheading them and crucifying them.   I am not for selling them a rifle, much less precision-guided  missiles. Some will say: Oh if we give them more accurate missiles,  they will kill civilians. That presumes they are not targeting  civilians.   Do you think it was a mistake? Do you think they accidently bombed a  funeral procession? Do you think their intelligence was so bad they  didn't know it was a funeral procession? They killed 125 people at a  funeral. They wounded 500. We wonder about why we have so much  terrorism. Yes, maybe some hate us inherently, but some of it is  blowback to policy.   Do you think the people who died or the people who survived or the  relatives of those who died in that funeral procession will ever forget  it? They will remember it 100 years from now.   The problem we face is that terrorism goes on and on as long as we  keep supporting despots who treat their people like crap, who sentence  them to beheading and crucifixion, who are starving their neighboring  country, which is one of the poorest nations on the planet Earth.   We are not getting better. We are not getting any closer to peace by  supporting the Saudis. It is a huge mistake. The Girl of Qatif, a rape  victim, was sentenced to prison and 70 lashes. Ali al Nimr, still on  death row, was sentenced to beheading and crucifixion. Raif Badawi, who  is he? I don't know much about him, but he is an outspoken blogger. He  is somebody who writes his opinion and may have opinions that may not  be orthodox. For that, the Saudis arrested him, and he is in jail for  10 years, and he is sentenced to a thousand lashes.   I don't think you can survive a thousand lashes, so the Saudis--in  their great humanity--are dividing his treatment into 10 doses. He has  already had 100 publicly applied. He has 900 more to go.   Shouldn't we think a little bit about supplying arms to this country?  If the human rights aspect of this is not enough, I think we should  probably think about the region. There is a problem in the Middle East.  There is conflict. Some of it goes very deep.   Those who live in the Middle East member the Battle of Karbala in 680  A.D., when a grandson of Muhammad and Khalifa came together and had a  battle. They still remember, and they are still unhappy about a battle  from 680 A.D.; they have long memories.   I am reminded of what one Afghan told a reporter or a soldier  recently. He said: You have all the watches, but we have all the time.  They live there and have for centuries and will be there when we are  gone. They have to fix their own problems. We can occasionally say that  we are going to help some people destroy an evil empire or an evil  group like ISIS, yes, but the people fighting--the people on the  ground--need to be the people who live there. It cannot be foreigners,  and it cannot be people whom they consider to be pagans or it is never  going to work. Yet we are foolish if we do not look at the  repercussions of what it means to sell arms to Saudi Arabia.    How will Iran react?   I was in a committee hearing the other day, and one of the Senators  said: We do not care how Iran reacts. We do not care what it thinks.  [[Page S3418]]    By golly, we ought to if we are going to put sanctions on them.  Doesn't that mean we care enough that we are trying to modulate and  change their behavior? The whole idea of sanctions means that we do  care about what Iran thinks. It does not mean we agree with it, it does  not mean we condone it, and it does not mean we say Iran is right. But,  certainly, we do care about what it thinks. What do you think Iran  thinks about supplying arms to Saudi Arabia? It thinks: We need more.   Saudi arms alone are the third biggest in the world now. It is the  United States, which is as big as the next 10 combined. Then, it is  China. Then, it is Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia has these other gulf  sheikhdoms, despots. They are all allies of ours. There are about five  or six of them, and, altogether, they have eight times more weapons  than Iran. So we are complaining--I think, justifiably so--because we  worry about the mischief of Iran in the Middle East. We are complaining  about that, and we want them to change their behavior.   What do you think is the prime reason they create weapons and are  creating the ballistic missiles?   Some of it is because they fear our invasion, like in Iraq, but I  think a great deal of why Iran develops weapons is its fear of Saudi  Arabia. In fact, when you look back at Iraq and the whole weapons of  mass destruction that never existed, one of the interesting stories is  that--it may be a theory, but I think it has some evidence--Saddam  Hussein pretended, valiantly, that he had weapons of mass destruction  not to deter us but to deter Iran. Here is Saddam Hussein, sending all  of these smoke signals up that he has weapons of mass destruction  because he wants to keep Iran at bay.   We think everything is about us, and we never acknowledge that maybe  some of it is about the regional politics. When we give weapons or sell  weapons to Saudi Arabia, there will be, for every action, a reaction.  There will be significantly more pressure for Iran to come forward and  have more weapons.   What does it do to our ally Israel?   There have been at least a few reports that say Israel believes that,  every time we give a dollar to Saudi Arabia, they need to respond with  a dollar and a half. There was a quote from one of their government  ministers on this, which reads that he worries about their qualitative  edge.   I have a quote here from a colleague of mine--a friend of mine--who  is a rabbi and a friend of the Constitution.   Rabbi Nate Segal writes:         While I understand the President's intentions, we must       proceed with great caution due to the challenges and the       history of the region. At this time, I don't see the benefits       of the arms deal for the United States or Israel.    This is coming from someone who believes, with every fiber of his  being, that Israel should be defended. He is worried that, by giving  weapons to Saudi Arabia, it detracts from the qualitative edge that  Israel currently has.   Imagine what would happen if the Government of Saudi Arabia were  overthrown. They have billions and billions of dollars of weapons. Many  of these weapons are the most sophisticated weapons we have. Is there a  chance that they could be overthrown? I don't know. They behead their  citizens and crucify them. Do you think anybody who lives in Saudi  Arabia might have some pent-up anger for the regime?   William Wilberforce once said of slavery: ``In having heard all this,  you can choose to look the other way, but you can never say that you  didn't know.''   I love that statement because so many people at the time of slavery  looked away. They just said: It is something we do. It is part of our  time. It is part of our age.   So many people knew the horror of slavery. So many people knew the  horror of what was happening to a people, and they looked away.   I think, in having heard of the impending famine in Yemen, in having  seen Ali, and in having heard of the impending famine, you can choose  to look away. Many in this body will, today, choose to look away.   They will say: Do you know what? Saudi Arabia gives us some benefit  sometime, and we hate Iran more. So let's just give some more weapons  to Saudi Arabia.   They will be looking away from the human rights tragedy that is  central to Saudi Arabia's whole being. They will be looking away from  the fact that Saudi Arabia was supporting ISIS in the Syrian civil war.  They will be looking away from the fact that the Saudi blockade is  starving Yemeni children.   Do you know what? I choose not to look away. Today I stand up for the  thousands of civilians who are being killed in Yemen. Today I stand up  for the millions of voiceless children in Yemen who will be killed by  the Saudi blockade. Today I stand up for saying that we, the United  States, should no longer be fueling the arms race in the Middle East.  It has come to no good. The wars and the rage and the anger are  thousands of years old. We will never get to the bottom of it. We  should defend ourselves at all costs. We should be very careful as to  whom is admitted into the country, and we should not get involved in  every civil war in every misbegotten part of the planet.   It is my hope and my prayer that enough Americans will wake up and  say that we are tired of war, that we are tired of funding every war on  the globe, and that we are tired of sacrificing our young in every  civil war.   Today this will be a bipartisan vote. There will be a large  contingent from the other side of the aisle and a small contingent from  this side. This is important. This is a rare day in Senate history,  when we actually have the chance to stop an evil, but we will stop this  evil by sending a loud message to the President and a loud message to  Saudi Arabia that we are not going to blindly support the arms race.   We are not going to be blind to your human rights transgressions, and  we are not going to blindly give you weapons in the face of beheading  your citizens and crucifying them.   Today I take a stand for those who do not have a voice, and I hope  the Senate will think long and hard and will vote against this arms  sale to Saudi Arabia.    Mr. President, the question is, Should we sell arms to  Saudi Arabia--a country that many suspect was involved in 9/11; a  country that many suspect gave weapons to ISIS, the people we are  fighting in the Middle East; a country that imprisons the victims of  rape because it is apparently or presumably the fault of the woman who  is raped in Saudi Arabia?   One woman, the girl of Qatif, was given a sentence of 70 lashes and 6  months in jail. They increased her penalty to 200 lashes, and finally,  only when we protested, was it reversed.   They sentenced a poet to 1,000 lashes. Sometimes you don't survive  1,000 lashes. So they gave him 100 at a time. He is going to be  imprisoned for 10 years.   They are not the kind of persons we should be sending your weapons  to. These weapons were funded and supported by the American taxpayer,  and we should not be willy-nilly giving them to people who imprison  their people for protesting.   Currently, a young man, 17 years old, named Ali al-Nimr is on death  row. But it is not enough just to kill him for protesting for free  speech and free press. They will behead him and crucify him.   This barbaric nation should not be getting our weapons. We should not  sell them weapons.   Currently, there is a blockade of Yemen, and 17 million people risk  starvation. We should not be supporting this effort.   There is probably no greater purveyor of hatred for Christianity and  Judaism than Saudi Arabia. We should not be giving them weapons. They  have madrassas across the world teaching hatred of us, preaching hatred  of the West, hatred of Christianity, hatred of Judaism, and these  people want to give them weapons. I don't get it. It makes no sense.   Some will argue that it is a jobs program. Well, isn't that swell. We  are  [[Page S3428]]  going to give money to people who behead you and crucify you to create  jobs. That should never be the way we make a decision about arms sales  in our country.   A famous Republican and general, General Dwight Eisenhower, said he  worried that someday we would make decisions not based on our defense  but based on the military industrial complex.   I am embarrassed that people are out here talking about making us  some money and making a buck, while 17 million people live on a  starvation diet and are threatened with famine. I am embarrassed that  people would bring up trying to feather the nest of corporations in  order to sell these weapons. This should be made, pure and simple, on  our national defense.   Saudi Arabia is not a reliable ally. Saudi Arabia should not get  these weapons. For every supposed good thing they do, they do five  things that are bad for America. They are the biggest purveyor of  hatred of Christianity and Judaism.   I request a ``no'' vote, and I reserve the remainder of my time.    Mr. President, Saudi Arabia bombed a funeral procession.  There was no mistake here. There was no cloud cover. There was no  growth or coppice of trees and they accidentally bombed a funeral  procession. They bombed them and killed 125 civilians in a funeral.  They wounded 500. This was no mistake. This was no error. This was  them, pointedly dropping bombs on civilians.   They put protestors in jail. They have a 17-year-old--he is now 20-- who has been in jail for 3 years. He will be beheaded and then  crucified. We should not be giving these people weapons. They supported  ISIS. They are on the wrong side of the war. They are the greatest  purveyor of hatred for Christianity and Judaism. They do not deserve  your weapons. They are going to give your weapons. They belong to the  American people. They are going to give them to people who behead and  crucify protesters.   You can't take a Bible into Saudi Arabia. You can't visit their major  cities.   We can't make them be like us, but we don't have to encourage their  behavior by giving them weapons that may well fall into the hands of  people who are our enemies.   I urge a ``no'' vote. I think we should not be selling arms to Saudi  Arabia.
