 Mr. Speaker, Biden border policies  jeopardize national security and endanger all American families  everywhere from terrorist attacks by illegal aliens.   According to The Washington Times editorial of April 4, ``The effects  of the President's policies have been glaringly apparent, particularly  to citizens residing along the northbound thoroughfares into the  Southwest.''   U.S. Customs and Border Protection reports 212,266 border encounters  in February, bringing the figure thus far in fiscal year 2023 to 1.3  million illegal aliens.   The cause of the border chaos can clearly be traced to Biden  administration policies. Title 42, a Trump-era policy allowing rapid  deportation of border crossers, expires May 11, today. There is every  reason to anticipate a larger surge of eager recipients.   For Mr. Biden, immigration reform is to be achieved without the  bother of congressional approval. Rather than lifting civilizations to  new heights, he is splintering its foundations.   In conclusion, God bless our troops who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America.   In the real world, if guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns.                            ____________________
