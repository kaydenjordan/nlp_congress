 Mr. Speaker, I had planned remarks here, but I have to  respond to my colleague. His words are simply too much to bear.   The gentleman talks a lot about the mob and culpability. Who summoned  the mob? Who encouraged the mob? Who incited the mob? You know as well  as I do that the President did. I stood here 6 days ago in this exact  same spot, and I quoted Lincoln's admonition that ``we shall nobly  save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of Earth.''   Less than 10 minutes later, a violent mob breached the Capitol, the  first breach of this hallowed building, the citadel of liberty, since  the War of 1812.   Congress must respond. Our undertaking here is not about politics. It  is a matter of conscience. I support the distinguished gentleman from  Maryland's resolution. I pray the Vice President will honor his oath  and reconsider and invoke the provisions of the 25th Amendment.
