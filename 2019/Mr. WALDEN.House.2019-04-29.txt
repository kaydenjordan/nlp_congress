 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate  Rudy Dory who is a great Oregonian and this year's recipient of the  National Grocers Association's Clarence G. Adamy Great American Award.   Established in 1982, this award is presented to an individual or a  company whose leadership in the food industry best exemplifies active  and effective participation in government relations as a citizen and  industry representative.   Rudy Dory is the executive chairman of Newport Avenue Market, which  is an employee-owned, independent grocery store in Bend, Oregon, in my  district, and I had the pleasure to get a full tour from Rudy of  Newport Avenue Market in Bend just last August.   He has been in the grocery industry for 40 years. He has helped  Newport Avenue Market through its migration from a traditional store to  the award-winning, employee-owned, specialty grocery store it is today.   Rudy is a tireless advocate of the independent supermarket industry  and advocates in support of a public policy agenda that benefits Main  Street grocers throughout the Nation.   Local grocers like Rudy help job growth, support Oregon's producers,  and help feed our communities.   So please join me in congratulating Rudy Dory on receiving this  prestigious award, and working on behalf of not only Newport Avenue  Market, but for all businesses and independent grocers across the  country.                            ____________________
