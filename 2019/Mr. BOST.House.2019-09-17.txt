 Mr. Speaker, I thank the ranking member for yielding.   As a marine, it is one of my greatest honors to serve on the  Veterans' Affairs Committee. It is vitally important that our  government fulfill its promises to our Nation's military members that  they will be taken care of once they return.   The Department of Veterans Affairs is tasked with ensuring that they  receive the care they need and have earned. This bill ensures that the  VA can continue to support some of our Nation's most vulnerable  veterans. It extends funding for programs that help very low-income  veterans and those who must travel long distances to vet centers in  order to receive their care.   That is why I am proud to cosponsor and introduce this legislation  with my friend, Congressman Brindisi, and I urge my colleagues to  support it as well.
