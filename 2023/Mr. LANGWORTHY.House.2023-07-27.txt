 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor and celebrate the  extraordinary life of Monsignor Dino Lorenzetti.   Monsignor Dino Lorenzetti, the eldest priest of the Buffalo Catholic  Diocese, whose priesthood spanned 70 years and at least a dozen  parishes and who headed the Office of Family Life for 20 years, died  July 12, 2023, just 11 days short of his 102nd birthday.   In the monsignor's powerful voice, he would famously start each Mass  he celebrated with: ``Good morning, all you beautiful people of faith.  You are loved.''                                time  1015    Dino served an incredible 70-year priesthood and undoubtedly impacted  the lives of thousands of people across western New York with his  warmth, his enthusiasm, and his upbeat personality.   When you met him, you immediately realized you had just been in the  presence of a very special and holy person.   Monsignor Lorenzetti co-officiated my wife, Erin, and my wedding, as  well as officiating my mother-in-law and father-in-law's wedding, and  he baptized all their children. Many, many western New York families  can say the same thing across multiple generations.   Dino Lorenzetti served as a priest under 9 different Popes and 10  Bishops of Buffalo during his lifetime. He was born in Buffalo to  Italian immigrants.   Dino Lorenzetti's life of service and faith began with courage and  dedication. As a young man he answered the call of duty during World  War II, serving in the U.S. Army Air Corps in Africa and Italy from  1941 to 1945. His bravery and commitment during those challenging times  foreshadowed the depth of character that would define his entire life.   Monsignor Lorenzetti was a longtime pastor of Our Lady of Sacred  Heart church in Orchard Park. He led efforts to purchase a former West  Seneca school building to establish the parish school. It thrived to  rank among the largest grade schools in the entire diocese.   His influence extended globally when Pope Paul VI appointed him as a  spiritual adviser to the National Federation of Catholic Physicians'  Guilds. In 1978, he was honored to address the World Conference of  Physicians in India alongside Mother Teresa where they both received  prestigious awards.   Until shortly before his passing, he faithfully celebrated weekly  masses at St. John the Baptist Church in Kenmore and St. Martha's in  Depew.   In memory of Monsignor Lorenzetti, we celebrate a life well-lived, a  life of profound service, and a life that will forever shine as an  example of God's love.   May he rest in eternal peace knowing that his impact will continue to  touch hearts and transform lives for generations to come.

School nutrition programs play a vital role in providing our students  with healthy meals that contribute to their growth and well-being.  Flavored and unflavored milk options have been an essential part of  these programs, and research has consistently shown that flavored milk  is a powerful tool for successfully delivering essential nutrients to  our school-aged children.   Dairy products are the cornerstone of a balanced diet and are an  unparalleled source of calcium, protein, potassium, phosphorus, and  vitamin D for kids of all ages. These nutrients are crucial for bone  growth, immune health, and optimal brain development during their  school years.   Numerous studies have demonstrated that removing flavored milk from  schools leads to a decrease in overall milk consumption. Our children  are more likely to enjoy and consume milk when they have flavorful  options available to them. By preserving the allowance of nonfat and  low-fat flavored milks at all grade levels, we encourage higher milk  consumption and promote healthier habits among our youth.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and by  doing so we show our commitment to the well-being of our Nation's  children and their access to nutrition options in our schools.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4366, the  Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies  appropriations bill for fiscal year 2024, in particular, the allocation  of $6.61 million for the Department of Defense Family Housing  Improvement Fund.   This crucial legislation aims to ensure that the brave families of  our servicemembers receive the dignified and safe housing they truly  deserve.   Our military families sacrifice so much for the security and  prosperity of our country. They endure the long deployments, frequent  relocations, and the emotional toll that comes with having a loved one  in harm's way. The least we can do is provide them with housing that  meets the standards that they deserve.   Regrettably, we have heard from many of these families that their  current housing situation is inadequate, and in some cases, unsafe and  unsuitable for raising a family. This is unacceptable.   The Department of Defense Family Housing Improvement Fund will bring  about much-needed changes and improvements to the lives of those that  selflessly serve our Nation. We cannot afford to fail them any longer.   Investing in our military families is not a matter of gratitude, it  is a matter of national security and readiness. Our servicemembers  perform at their very best.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Roy) for yielding to me.   Mr. Speaker, as we go through our appropriations process, as we  started here today, we must ensure that the United States is prepared  to combat China. While the left wants us to focus on the latest  partisan pet project, China's actions demand comprehensive and  strategic response to safeguard our national security, economic  competitiveness, and democratic values.   Internationally, China's aggressive military buildup poses a direct  challenge to the United States. With the largest Navy in the world and  efforts to rival our capabilities, it is crucial that we prioritize  investments in our defense to deter any potential aggression and to  protect our interests in the Indo-Pacific region. Additionally, the PLA  Rocket Force's efforts to build a significant stockpile suggests that  China is preparing for long-term competition and conflict.   China's global infrastructure projects further solidify its position  as a trade and economic power. While economic cooperation is important,  we must be cautious of the potential debt-trap diplomacy where China  leverages loans to seize assets and influence the policies of indebted  countries. This undermines the sovereignty of nations and challenges  the rules-based international system, and directly counters democratic  values.   Closer to our own borders, China's ambitions in South and Central  America and its plans to establish a listening station, as they call  it, in Cuba to monitor U.S. bases are clear signs of their growing  assertiveness and aggression. We must not underestimate their  determination to expand their influence and challenge our homeland  security.   We are also engaged in a tech race with China. While we currently  hold an edge in innovation and technology, complacency could lead to  China overtaking our sector. We must invest in research, education, and  technological advancements to maintain our lead and secure our national  interests, not to mention the use of social media like TikTok to gather  data on our citizens.   Furthermore, the influx of cheap goods from China into the United  States has had more adverse consequences, well beyond the surface that  people understand. It cuts the incentive for American manufacturing and  promotes China's use of forced labor, which goes against our values as  a Nation that upholds human rights and fair labor practices.   We cannot afford to ignore the challenges posed by China's rise and  assertiveness. We must be prepared to take a comprehensive approach  that combines strengthening our defense capabilities, upholding  democratic values, investing in our economy and technology, and  safeguarding our citizens' interests in data.   This is not about escalating tensions or seeking confrontation, but  rather about responsibly protecting our great Nation's interests and  encouraging global peace and stability through American strengths.
