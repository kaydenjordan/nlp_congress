 Madam Speaker, as America continues to battle the  coronavirus, many of us in Congress have worked to protect both lives  and livelihoods. Now, we must focus our efforts on supporting the safe  reopening of our schools.   Every child deserves to receive an in-person education, if they so  choose. Schools in Pennsylvania's Ninth District, for instance, Lake  Lehman Township, are preparing in a smart, innovative, and safe manner.   As the American Academy of Pediatrics has said: ``All policy  considerations for the coming school year should start with a goal of  having students physically present in school.''   Congress must work with school districts to provide support for  social distancing, PPEs, temperature checks, any equipment necessary  for those who choose to learn remotely, and even perhaps an on-site  health and safety coordinator. We must also pass legislation to create  liability protection for schools to reopen without the threat of  predatory lawsuits.   Let's put politics aside, follow the science, follow the  recommendations of AAOP and the President's task force and open schools  safely for the millions of American families who want their children  safely back in the classroom this fall.                            ____________________
