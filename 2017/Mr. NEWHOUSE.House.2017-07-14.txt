 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate a region in my  district, the Yakima Valley, for being recognized as the winner of the  World Food Travel Association's FoodTrekking Award for Best Beer  Experience.   John Cooper, president and CEO of Yakima Valley Tourism, nominated  the region for the award, and this is just one example of the efforts  John and his group are making to promote the budding beer and  hospitality industries of the Yakima Valley.   The FoodTrekking Awards recognize excellent food and beverage tourism  experiences all over the world, and it is an honor for Yakima to be  selected as  [[Page H5872]]  the winner for the Best Beer Experience among the international  applicants. Central Washington's beer industry is thriving and has  greatly contributed to the increase in tourism as well as the overall  economic development of the area.   As a third-generation hops farmer from the Yakima Valley, I am proud  that our fellow growers and our local craft brewers are receiving  recognition for their efforts in making our region a unique travel  destination.   Please join me in congratulating John, his team, and the entire  industry for helping bring such a prestigious award to Washington's  Fourth District.                            ____________________
