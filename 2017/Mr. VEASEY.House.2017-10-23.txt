 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may  have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include  extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the  gentleman from Texas?   There was no objection.    Mr. Speaker, it is with great honor that I rise today to  coanchor this CBC Special Order hour. Also, I want to acknowledge the  chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Mr. Cedric Richmond, from the  State of Louisiana, and other Members who are here to participate. For  the next 60 minutes, we have a chance to speak directly to the American  people on issues of great importance to the Congressional Black Caucus,  the constituents that we all represent in our various districts.   For this particular Special Order hour, I am going to open it up and  begin to talk about something that is very important and has been  widely discussed within the Congressional Black Caucus, and that is  civil rights and some of the things that we are worried about that are  going on within the Justice Department.   We have several important Members here to speak on these. Before I go  any further, I want to go ahead and recognize them. The first speaker  we have is from the State of South Carolina, representing that State's  Sixth Congressional District, and also our caucus' assistant leader.  That is Mr. Jim Clyburn.   I thank Representative Clyburn for joining and being a part of this  Special Order hour to talk about this subject matter that is very  important to so many members of the Black Caucus.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr.  Clyburn).   (Mr. CLYBURN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South Carolina  (Mr. Clyburn) very much for his timely and very serious comments. I  hope that all of the Members who are here on both sides of the aisle  realize the seriousness of the comments. There is nothing humorous  about them all, nothing to be smiling or laughing about. It is very  timely in light of the unfortunate incident that happened with our  colleague. I thank the gentleman very much for bringing that to light.   Mr. Speaker, I now yield to my fellow Texan from the 18th  Congressional District in Houston. I thank very much  [[Page H8067]]  Representative Sheila Jackson Lee for joining us this evening. We look  forward to the gentlewoman's words.   Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the manager, Mr. Veasey, for  his leadership, his sensitivities, his sensibilities, and his empathy,  knowing his distinguished wife and the leadership she gives to the  Congressional Black Caucus Foundation. I am sure that there are many  women in the gentleman's family, and I know that he has a great honor  and respect for them.   It is appropriate to follow the leader, Mr. Clyburn, who is vested in  the storied history of African Americans from the East to the West,  North to the South. He often diminishes his status by saying that he  was raised in a parish house, but when he eloquently rises to the floor  to defend, all eyes and all ears are tuned to him.   Now, I want to adhere to our discussion today because it is extremely  important, and to also acknowledge my colleagues. So let me hurry  through my comments. I do want to acknowledge the chair of the  Congressional Black Caucus, Cedric Richmond. I thank the women of the  caucus for their eloquent and pointed statement regarding the series of  events that has occurred.   Let me, first of all, say that our topic today deals with a retracing  of the horrible history that was perpetrated under FBI Director Hoover  for the decades that he served in that capacity. So as I label what it  is, let me just for a moment deviate to what happened this weekend. I  believe that the FBI personnel, through much of its history, were  mostly men--fine men--who wanted to protect this Nation. But you see,  Mr. Speaker, I have firsthand knowledge of the devastation of FBI  surveillance way before the word ``terrorism'' became part of our  normal discussion or language.   So I want to put a pause there and say that in the history of African  Americans, we have been subjected to name-calling. That is what happens  to you when, in the Constitution, you are not a complete human being.  That is what happens to you even after the Emancipation Proclamation  and the short-lived Reconstruction, the Nation rushed toward the  hanging fruit, Jim Crowism, and the rampant murder of African Americans  in the Deep South, some of the very States in which the President stood  and called young African-American men sons of Bs.   There is another name-calling. So it seems that even as we have gone  through the transition of freedom and we came through the 20th century  with civil rights, and then affirmative action, that name-calling seems  to be the welcomed and accepted tactic to use with people of color and,  in this instance, African Americans.   What would be the explanation for the unseemly events that occurred  around a grieving mother, aunt, uncle, and a grieving widow with  beautiful children who no longer have their dad?   I offer my sympathy to Sergeants Wright, Black, La David Johnson, and  Jeremiah Johnson.   So how their loss, through no fault of their own, in the battle for  this Nation turned into an ugly name-calling, I am baffled, except for  the fact that it is easy to call African Americans names. It is easy  for some White Americans to call African Americans names.    When we are on the floor of the House and we say things that are  untoward in some segments of the population, our phones ring off the  hook with the N word, N word, N word. I don't know how many of my  friends who are not people of color--I am sure we all say things that  people disagree with, and I don't know whether they call up and call  them White, White, White.   You see, race is something that we are fearful of discussing, and  that is because the thought would be: Here she goes again.   But there is a great love--my interaction, my life's history is with  the diversity of this world, from White Caucasians, Anglos in Texas, to  Hispanics, African Americans, Asians, and beyond in various religious.  I feel comfortable in my soul.   But this weekend was the most difficult time for African-American  women who are--in the category of casting, the caste system--at the  bottom of the totem pole. Even today, the likes of Harriet Tubman,  Sojourner Truth, Mae Jemison, Shirley Chisholm, Barbara Jordan,  doctors, lawyers, and others, we are at the bottom.   So there was much latitude--uncontrolled latitude--in name-calling.  Forty-five mentioning untoward words about our colleague, Congresswoman  Wilson: name-calling. Nobody--there is no retribution or reprimand.  None of his constituents would give a hoot. But it was name-calling.   Mr. Speaker, you don't know how many people stop me in airports,  along the road, hurt and appalled. Let me just come to a close on that.   First of all, Congressman Clyburn has already given the attributes of  Congresswoman Wilson. I do want to add that she is a principal. She is  an old-fashioned principal, though she is a young woman.                                time  1945    She loved her students. She implemented the 5000 Role Models. She  took the children as family, and Sergeant David Johnson was one of  those. So if people don't understand the cultural distinctions in the  African-American community, we are aunts and uncles without bloodline.  We are Godparents. We are family.   Her presence in that car was not as an interloper. She didn't break  the door down. She was in there as family. She was not eavesdropping.  The phone was on. As indicated by Mrs. Johnson's interview, she asked  the phone to be put on speaker.   It seems that her offense in breaking down moved the Representative  to articulate, probably seeking some humanity, to say: Can you just, if  you hear my words, apologize?   That never happened. The untruth spread all over. You see, as an  African-American woman, you don't have to worry about saying the truth  about us. We are various names--sons of Bs--and we have got all kinds  of disturbing situations going on with names that we can be called. And  that is what this White House did.   My dear friend, who I knew in the Southern Command, that is what  happens when you are here for just a few years. He had great leadership  and loss. I was here when that happened. And I don't want to spend a  moment to diminish his status as a Gold Star parent. He has a right to  mourn and to speak of his loss.   But then, when you are forced to step from that humble position over  to an untruth, you can do it to a Black woman. They have no power. I  can talk something that doesn't have any truth, because I have to  defend--and this is said lovingly--a White man who happens to be in the  Oval Office.   We don't count. We are the largest group of active, civic women in  all kinds of organizations. If there is something being done--first of  all, it is women overall, I love them all, but you will see the  African-American woman--she is in there scrubbing, she is in there  teaching, she is in there handling the religious institutions, she is  standing by babies, and she is standing by young people.   She is a civil rights activist, she is a scientist, she is a doctor.  She is president of various organizations. She is just in there.   That is what happened that has brought me to this point that what we  have now is so dangerous. I hope before the end of the week--maybe  before the end of tomorrow--my good friend, General Kelly, seeks to  apologize for the distortion. He didn't have to defend a person who  does it in his own way and besmirch all of the Gold Star families and  this young mother who has not been able to see her son.   Mr. Speaker, I know there are many of us who served in this Congress  who have seen their brethren fall. They have been injured. What is it  like for their family not to be able to see the body? What is it like  to know that the person's body was not found for 48 hours?   I am going to get to an end for my colleagues. I just want to say  this. There are those of us who know about the African Command. There  are those of us who know the soldiers there. The Congressional Black  Caucus was instrumental when George Bush said that an African Command  needs to stand up when Charles Taylor was killing his citizens in  Liberia.   I know it firsthand. I have been to all those countries. I know ISIL  was connected with Boko Haram. We have been trying to say it, but  people have deaf ears, maybe because it is Africa.  [[Page H8068]]    Now, all of a sudden we are awake. Congresswoman Wilson knew that.  She has been there. We have been there. Why don't people listen to  Black women who know what they are talking about, along with our  distinguished colleagues?   This document that I hold in my hand, ``Black Identity Extremists  Likely Motivated to Target Law Enforcement Officers,'' I have a lot to  say on, but I am going to summarize.   As a member of the Judiciary Committee, this is name-calling. We just  got through a reckless weekend of name-calling of a distinguished  Member of Congress.   This is name-calling. This is the FBI defining BIEs as individuals  who seek, through unlawful acts of force or violence, a response to  perceived racism and injustice.   But do you know what will happen, Mr. Speaker? This will be a big  fishnet: the high school student who is getting his fists up; the  college student who is rallying around in opposition to racism; the  students down in Charlottesville who may believe they should stand up  and be counted.   I know this, Mr. Speaker, because, with a little bit of humor, I am  young, going backwards, but I served on the Select Committee on  Assassinations that investigated the assassination of Martin Luther  King--the reopening of the investigation--along with John F. Kennedy.   I was immersed in the files of COINTELPRO. I saw how the FBI dogged a  modern-day prophet, a man who only wanted peace and believed in the  beloved community. Yes, he was human. When you dog someone, you can  find them throwing gum on a sidewalk.   Dr. Martin Luther King was subjected to the COINTEL program. It was  dastardly and devastating, and may have been the basis of the loss of  his life. If he was subjected to the COINTEL program, we always  wondered why he couldn't have been in another hotel.   So the danger of this document that has come under Donald Trump and  not under any other President--not Bill Clinton, not George Bush, not  President Obama--as I understand it, but it came in August of this  year, under President Trump, the same President who could find nothing  distinctive between the alt-right and racist vileness talking about  Jews and Blacks and everybody else in Charlottesville. There were good  people on both sides.   Now we have this document. Lo and behold, what other names of Black  activists and African Americans still fighting the war of civil rights  peacefully may be caught up in this large net?   Again, I want to be able to say my respect for the service of FBI  agents. They are friends of mine. I am on the Judiciary Committee. They  are friends to all of us. We continue to salute their service. But this  document is a riotous document.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I include in the Record: ``The History of  Surveillance and the Black Community.'' It goes into the discussion.        [From the Electronic Frontier Foundation, February 13, 2014]            The History of Surveillance and the Black Community                              (By Dia Kayyali)         February is Black History Month and that history is       intimately linked with surveillance by the federal government       in the name of ``national security.'' Indeed, the history of       surveillance in the African-American community plays an       important role in the debate around spying today and in the       calls for a congressional investigation into that       surveillance. Days after the first NSA leaks emerged last       June, EFF called for a new Church Committee. We mentioned       that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., was one of the targets of       the very surveillance that eventually led to the formation of       the first Church Committee. This Black History Month, we       should remember the many African-American activists who were       targeted by intelligence agencies. Their stories serve as       cautionary tales for the expanding surveillance state.        The latest revelations about surveillance are only the most       recent in a string of periodic public debates around domestic       spying perpetrated by the NSA, FBI, and CIA. This spying has       often targeted politically unpopular groups or vulnerable       communities, including anarchists, anti-war activists,       communists, and civil rights leaders.        60s. COINTELPRO, short for Counter Intelligence Program,       was started in 1956 by the FBI and continued until 1971. The       program was a systemic attempt to infiltrate, spy on, and       disrupt activists in the name of ``national security.'' While       it initially focused on the Communist Party, in the 1960s its       focus expanded to include a wide swathe of activists, with a       strong focus on the Black Panther Party and civil rights       leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.        FBI papers show that in 1962 ``the FBI started and rapidly       continued to gravitate toward Dr. King.'' This was ostensibly       because the FBI believed black organizing was being       influenced by communism. In 1963 FBI Assistant Director       William Sullivan recommended ``increased coverage of       communist influence on the Negro.'' However, the FBI's goal       in targeting Dr. King was clear: to find ``avenues of       approach aimed at neutralizing King as an effective Negro       leader,'' because the FBI was concerned that he might become       a ``messiah.''        The FBI subjected Dr. King to a variety of tactics,       including bugging his hotel rooms, photographic surveillance,       and physical observation of King's movements by FBI agents.       The FBI's actions went beyond spying on Dr. King, however.       Using information gained from that surveillance, the FBI sent       him anonymous letters attempting to ``blackmail him into       suicide.'' The agency also attempted to break up his marriage       by sending selectively edited ``personal moments he shared       with friends and women'' to his wife.        The FBI also specifically targeted the Black Panther Party       with the intention of destroying it. They infiltrated the       Party with informants and subjected members to repeated       interviews. Agents sent anonymous letters encouraging       violence between street gangs and the Panthers in various       cities, which resulted in ``the killings of four BPP members       and numerous beatings and shootings,'' as well as letters       sowing internal dissension in the Panther Party. The agency       also worked with police departments to Department that aided       in a raid on BPP leader Fred Hampton's apartment. The raid       ended with the Chicago Police shooting Hampton dead.        The FBI was not alone in targeting civil rights leaders.       The NSA also engaged in domestic spying that included Dr.       King. In an eerily prescient statement, Senator Walter       Mondale said he was concerned that the NSA ``could be used by       President `A' in the future to spy upon the American people,       to chill and interrupt political dissent.''        The Church Committee was created in response to these and       other public scandals, and was charged with getting to the       bottom of the government's surveillance overreach. In       response to its findings, Congress passed new laws to provide       privacy safeguards, including the Foreign Intelligence       Surveillance Act. But ever since these safeguards were put in       place, the intelligence community has tried to weaken or       operate around them. The NSA revelations show the urgent need       to reform the laws governing surveillance and to rein in the       intelligence community.        Today we're responding to those domestic surveillance       abuses by an unrestrained intelligence branch. The overreach       we've seen in the past underscores the need for reform.       Especially during Black History Month, let's not forget the       speech-stifling history of US government spying that has       targeted communities of color.    Ms. JACKSON LEE. It says: ``We mentioned that Dr. Martin Luther King,  Jr., was one of the targets of the very surveillance that eventually  led to the formation of the first Church Committee. This Black History  Month, we should remember the many African-American activists who were  targeted by intelligence agencies. Their stories serve as cautionary  tales for the expanding surveillance state.''   Where are the conservatives to stand up against this document? We can  be safe, we can have the First Amendment, and we speak our different  issues, but now we are going to entrap African Americans--young men who  are kneeling because of their concern for police reform and violence  that has taken the lives of African-American young men.   There are so many law enforcement officers who agree with me on the  idea of police reform to help all of us work together. We are not  divided, but we will stay divided with a document that is going to  label us.   Where is the document for the alt-right, the religious right, the  White supremacists? Where is that?   When are we going to understand that the calling of names--in our  community, we call it calling me out of my name--by the majority  community is a carryover from slavery and Jim Crow.   I am saddened by the last couple of days of steering away from the  mourning of those wonderful heroes who reflected the greatness of  America. They reflected what young men and women do who are willing to  sacrifice their lives. They go without a recognition of what color  their fellow soldier is. We honor them with no distinction.   That is what the last couple of days should have been about, as well  as the loving care of that widow and the families of the other young  men. Yet, in the  [[Page H8069]]  spirit of the FBI COINTEL program, that may be the downfall, again, of  those of us trying to heal and not reflecting on how the best way to  deal with those who would do us harm violently, of which I stand  against, we are now in the midst of name-calling.   I go to my seat mourning. When is America going to change?   On August 3, 2017, the FBI released their new ``Intelligence  Assessment'' report entitled: Black Identity Extremists (BIE) Likely  Motivated to Target Law Enforcement Officers''.   The FBI defines BIE as individuals who seek, through unlawful acts of  force or violence, a response to ``perceived'' racism and injustice in  American society.   The FBI also indicates, there is a desire for black physical or  psychological separation based on religious or political beliefs  grounded in racial superiority or supremacy.   Blacks fought for America long before it was a country,  prerevolutionary period, where during the first 100 years of conflict  we stepped up; and will continue, for equality and justice.   Blacks led civil rights movement winning double victories in both  World War II and the Jim Crow era, forcing our then President Truman,  to announced that ``there are no justifiable reasons for discrimination  because of one's ancestry, or religion, or race, or color of his  skin.''   Today, Trump's FBI believes that the African American community's  reality is a mere perception as it relates to the racism and injustice  that plague our communities. Why?   The FBI has consistently relied upon a flawed system to determine the  number of people killed by officers. This flawed system is shaped by  ``voluntary law enforcement compliance''--in other words, police  departments need not report this stat.   ``The Counted'' launched by the Guardian, is a public-service project  tallying deaths of unarmed persons by law enforcement. They reached a  tally of 1,068 at the start of 2015.   Former FBI Director Comey said, this was embarrassing and  unacceptable that a Guardian U.S. investigative unit had a better tally  than his agency's near 35,000 employees.   There is no reliable mechanism to accurately depict the true  dimensions of an epidemic of lethal violence, force, and shootings  committed by police across this country on unarmed civilians.   The reality is Sandra Bland died while in the custody of law  enforcement; Michael Brown was gunned down in the street by law  enforcement; Eric Garner died from a chokehold at the hands of law  enforcement; Freddie Gray died while being transported in the custody  of law enforcement; Tamir Rice was shot dead by a law enforcement  officer previously deemed an emotionally unstable recruit and unfit for  duty; and Laquan McDonald shot in the back and killed by law  enforcement officers.   These are just a few of the innocent lives robbed and thus, gone too  soon. These are the realities not perceptions that young activists in  their own modern ways represent, whether it's marching, protesting with  passion, or even taking a knee.   They are protesting unapologetically with great passion and hunger  for justice, but nonetheless, peacefully.   They are not killing others who do not agree with them; nor are they  inflicting violence due to religion, nationality and race.   Therefore, it is highly insensitive, offensive and blatantly  discriminative and unconstitutional to mount a counter intelligence  program, now COINTELPRO 2.0, to once again, aggressively target a race  that merely seeks justice and equality it is entitled under our  Constitution.   According to sources close to the FBI, the term ``Black Identity  Extremists'' did not exist before the Trump administration. The FBI  named BIE, a major threat to national security and public safety,  thereby, criminalizing black activism.   The newly coined term, black identity extremists (BIE) is such a  vague terminology that it invites alarming abuse of a specific race's  constitutional rights based solely on an Administration's disturbed and  visceral approach to race relations.   Under FBI Director Edgar Hoover's leadership, the Counter  Intelligence Program (COINTELPRO), a covert, often illegal, campaign  was mounted to break up the civil rights movement and ``neutralize''  activists they perceived as threatening.   COINTELPRO was used to surveil and discredit civil rights activists,  members of the Black Panther Party and any major advocates for the  rights of black people in our nation's history.   COINTELPRO allowed the FBI to falsify letters in an effort to  blackmail Martin Luther King Jr. into silence.   This was such a disgraceful period in our nation's history that our  recent FBI Director, James Comey, kept a copy of a 1963 order  authorizing Hoover to conduct round-the-clock surveillance of Martin  Luther King Jr. on his desk as a reminder of Hoover's abuses.   The FBI's dedicated surveillance of black activists follows a long  history of the U.S. government aggressively monitoring protest  movements and working to disrupt civil rights groups, but the scrutiny  of African Americans by a domestic terrorism unit was particularly  alarming to some free speech campaigners.   This administration continues the same vile tactics used in well- documented stories of civil rights leaders who were profiled, targeted  and killed for insisting that black people receive equitable treatment  under the law in a country whose Constitution guarantees it.   Today the FBI continues its once intrusive, abhorrent and illegal  targeting of black activists by labeling the Black Lives Matter  movement as BIE.   We know that the Department of Homeland Security has been surveilling  Black Lives Matter activists since 2014, but there's no way to know  what's next.   With this recent report, the FBI has legitimized the idea that black  activism is a threat and should be treated accordingly, with violent  force.   Despite Charlottesville and all the other harms inflicted by  emboldened white nationalists, the FBI has instead, chosen to target a  group of American citizens whom merely decry the injustice seen and  felt throughout their communities.   Despite numerous unarmed black individuals, particularly, young black  men that are disproportionately the victims of police shootings, the  FBI would like us to believe this is not a reality.   Instead, the FBI's report claims there is a danger in black activism  by asserting that violence inflicted on black people at the hands of  police is ``perceived'' or ``alleged,'' not real.   This month the Congressional Black Caucus has written to the FBI  Director, Christopher Wray, to express our concern over the recent  ``Intelligence Assessment'' report.   We have requested a briefing on both the origins of its research and  the FBI's next intended step based on its findings. No response as of  date.   We should be allowed to exercise our constitutional and fundamental  rights of free speech.   We should not be restricted and criminalized when we demand that  those we elect to office exercise justice and fairness.   This FBI report will further inflame an already damaged police/ community relation under the leadership of Attorney General Jeff  Sessions.   Sessions has dismantled all the safeguards installed under Attorney  General Holder's leadership, thus, returning our justice system to the  broken system under Ashcroft.   Session has unleashed a merciless approach to ``all'' crimes  including low level drug-related cases, and demands that his attorneys  prosecute every case to the fullest extent of the law.   In doing so, Session has taken away any prosecutorial discretion once  available to prosecutors throughout our justice system under U.S. law.   The FBI in this Trump Administration has returned to the era of  Director Edgar Hoover, in their unleashing of this damaging,  discriminative, and unconstitutional COINTELPRO 2.0.   With these lethal forms of attacks on the African American community  from both the DOJ and the FBI, where is justice?    I thank my colleague from the 18th Congressional District  for her comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne), my  friend and classmate who represents the 10th Congressional District.    I thank my colleague from the 18th Congressional District  for her comments.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne), my  friend and classmate who represents the 10th Congressional District.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from  Newark, New Jersey, for his comments, and also to talk about the fact  that I am glad that he mentioned Facebook, because one of the things  that really surprised me was the fact that some of those ads were  purchased in rubles, and no one seemed to notice that, seems absolutely  amazing to me. And we need to, again, just continue to have this  discussion and talk about these things, so I thank the gentleman very  much for his comments tonight.   I yield to my friend and colleague from the great State of Michigan,  representing the State's 14th Congressional District, Brenda Lawrence.  Again, I want to thank Brenda for participating. She participates often  in this hour, and I just really appreciate her comments. Her district  appreciates the comments, her State, and our country, and I appreciate  her joining us this evening.    Mr. Speaker, I thank Mrs. Lawrence for her comments,  which are very timely in light of everything that is happening right  now.   Mr. Speaker, before I close out, the one thing that I would like to  make note of is that I think, with this COINTELPRO 2.0 that is going on  right now, we should take this very seriously. And I just want to  remind everybody that may be out here listening right now, we talk a  lot about extremist groups. We talk a lot about alt-right and KKK and  White supremacist groups, but one thing that we have to keep in mind is  that, in the 1960s, when Dr. Martin Luther King came to town, he was  not treated like he is now.   I hear so many people--conservatives, liberals, Democrats, and  Republicans--talk about how much they admire and respect Dr. King, and  rightfully so, because he earned the respect and the admiration that he  has now, posthumously, in this country. I don't think that anyone would  argue that. But if we could travel back in time to the 1960s, we will  find that he was not that welcomed.   And let's just put aside the White supremacists. Let's put aside the  alt-right. Let's put aside these hateful forces that, again, all of us  agree on are bad people. But remember, when Dr. King came to some of  these Southern towns in the 1960s, he was not welcomed. He was not  welcomed by people at the Lions Club, people at the Elks Club, people  at the First Baptist Church, people at the Methodist Church. People  thought that Dr. King was bad, that he was stirring up trouble, that he  was not ``keeping his place,'' and that he had come into these  communities to stir up a lot of trouble.   And because regular, everyday people--again, not the Klan, not the  White supremacists, just regular, everyday, tax-paying shopkeepers in  these little Southern towns--these conservative individuals who  represented all segments of our society thought that Dr. King was out  of place for doing what he was doing, because of that, the Nation  reacted. And one of those people who reacted against Dr. King, against  Malcolm X, and against other organizations like the Southern Christian  Leadership Conference, SNCC, which was the Student Nonviolent  Coordinating Committee, and many, many others, they ran the domestic  counterintelligence program that you have heard about tonight, this  COINTELPRO, and it became a weapon that was used to spy on individuals.   We heard mentioned earlier that our colleague, Barbara Lee, was one  of these people who was monitored. But this was happening to everyday  African Americans who were just out there trying to make sure that we  can vote and that our water fountains and our schools weren't  segregated. And these regular town folk--again, the ones that weren't  in the Klan, that were just good old folks that went to Sunday  [[Page H8072]]  school and went to church every Sunday--were trying to prevent this  from happening, and J. Edgar Hoover stepped in and decided that he was  going to discredit, disrupt, and neutralize these organizations, again,  that were just trying to make sure that African Americans were no  longer second-class citizens.   I think these groups and these organizations and these individuals  that I mentioned earlier within the Black community that were willing  to be part of that circle, I know that I would not be here serving had  it not been for that surveillance that they endured, and I know that I  would not be here today were it not for them putting their lives on the  line, quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, because of that.   So what I would just like to say is it is important that we monitor  everything that is coming out of the Justice Department in relation to  any announcements that they are going to make about investigating these  organizations that they disagree with politically because it is  dangerous, and we don't want to go back to those times. We don't want  to end up in a situation where the organization is doing any sort of  domestic spying on people who are practicing their First Amendment  rights of free speech.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to inquire how much time is remaining on  the clock.   The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 7 minutes  remaining.    Mr. Speaker, let me also, again, talk about, very  briefly, some of the things that people are concerned about in regards  to civil liberties during the Cold War. That is when the FBI started  running a lot of these counterintelligence programs, and Dr. King was  always very high on the list. That is what people are concerned about.  Their concerns are concerns that are very warranted because of what  happened.   I know that people always say: Well, those things happened a long,  long time ago. But, in reality, there are people who serve with us in  this body who, sadly, remember those days. So it didn't happen that  long ago because they are still here, and they are still active, very  healthy members of society. They weren't Members of Congress back then,  but they are now, and they saw this up front. They saw this in a very  personal way, and that is important.   Also, one of the things that was mentioned earlier by Representative  Payne from Newark, New Jersey, was the fact about social media. Social  media has been very convenient. It has helped spawn new wealth in this  country. It has brought us together like never before, but it can also  tear us apart if we let it.   We have to be very serious when we have a foreign entity, a foreign  country that doesn't like America, that doesn't like our values, and  they have been very open and blatant in saying that you can't have a  multicultural society that exists. We need to take that threat very  seriously.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee) so  she can tell her story, and I thank her for joining us this evening.    I yield back the balance of my time.    I yield back the balance of my time.    I yield back the balance of my time.    I yield back the balance of my time.    I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 8 o'clock and 32 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Tuesday, October 24, 2017, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
