 Mr. Speaker, Riverside County supervisor John J. Benoit  served his community with duty, honor, and integrity.   Last year, Supervisor Benoit passed away in December 2016 after  battling pancreatic cancer. His legacy of service to his constituents  lives on throughout my district.   Supervisor Benoit dedicated his life to the safety of our community  as a police officer for the Corona Police Department, and then as a  commander in the California Highway Patrol. He served as a board member  for the Desert Sands Unified School District, as a California  assemblyman and State senator, and most recently as supervisor of  Riverside County.   I was honored to work with Supervisor Benoit. His dedication,  respect, and devotion to his constituents is exemplary and admirable.   My thoughts and prayers remain with his wife, Sheryl, and to their  two children, Ben and Sarah.   On behalf of the people of California's 36th Congressional District,  my wife, Monica, and my family, thank you sincerely for your service.                            ____________________
