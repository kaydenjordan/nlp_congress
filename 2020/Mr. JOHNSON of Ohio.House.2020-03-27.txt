 Mr. Speaker, we are here today debating a  massive stimulus bill, not by choice but by duty.   The coronavirus is an unseen enemy that threatens countless American  lives, a nuclear bomb to our economy. Yesterday, we learned a record 3- plus million Americans have filed for unemployment.   Workers are hurting. Small businesses are hurting. Thousands of  Americans are sick. Health experts tell us we have several more weeks  of this collective suffering ahead.   But there is good news, lots of it. Americans from coast to coast are  pitching in to help the cause. Businesses are changing production lines  to make ventilators and hand sanitizer. Surgical masks are being  donated by the millions. We are lining up to give blood. Healthcare  workers are being cheered like rock stars during shift changes.  Americans are pulling together.   Everyday heroes are emerging, the teachers teaching their classes  over the internet and the doctors and nurses working superhuman shifts  while friends and neighbors step up to provide childcare for them.   We are seeing the best of America. Now the House must do its part.  Vote ``yes.''
