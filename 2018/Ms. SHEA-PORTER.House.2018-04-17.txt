 Thank you, Congressman Tonko, for yielding. I know  how close you were to Louise and how much she loved you and you loved  her.   I offer my condolences not only to Louise's family, but also to Paul  and to the entire Chamber, and to me, because I loved Louise, also. You  hear people using the word ``love'' here. It was very genuine.   When I arrived in January of 2007, I saw the fire in Louise and I saw  the honey in Louise. She was a mixture of both. That is what made her  so absolutely delightful. I saw her as the new chairman of the Rules  Committee take on our friends across the aisle about so many issues  here, and she had that fire in her. But then I saw her with the honey  and the sweetness, and that is why people use the word ``love'' when  they talk about Louise.   So I want to tell just a very short story about my first real close  encounter with Louise Slaughter.   I had a dear friend in New Hampshire who very much admired Louise and  wanted to meet her. I said: She is busy. She has just taken over this  new position. And I am new, but okay, I will ask her.   So we were walking there, and I called Louise over, and I said:  Louise, I would like to introduce you to somebody who just has always  admired you.   Louise said: Honey, have her come into my office.   So we did. And Louise sat down on the couch like she didn't have a  thing to do that day except to entertain us with tea and small talk and  just her warmth and her vibrancy. My friend never forgot that. I never  forgot that either. That was Louise, absolutely full of love and, as I  said, full of honey and also full of fire.   We miss her very much here. We always will.   Condolences to her staff, who loved her as well, and I know that she  loved them. And to the people of western New York, thank you for  sharing her with us for so long.
