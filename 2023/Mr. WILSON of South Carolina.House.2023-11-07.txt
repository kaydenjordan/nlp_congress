 Madam Speaker, last month the Committee  for a Responsible Federal Budget reported on the final Monthly Treasury  Statement for 2023 by the Department of the Treasury.   The U.S. deficit totaled $2 trillion. This figure is double the  deficit of 2022 and higher than the Congressional Budget Office  projected in June.   Officially, the deficit grew $320 billion from 2022. As a share of  the economy, the deficit was 7.5 percent of the gross domestic product.  This is larger than at any time in American history outside of war,  recession, or national emergency.   Republicans, led by Speaker   Mike Johnson, will continue to fight to  pass legislation to reduce the deficit helping American families.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, who successfully protected  America for 20 years, as the global war on terrorism continues moving  from the Afghanistan safe haven to America with Biden open borders.   The New York Post this week warns a 9/11 attack in America is  imminent.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of  Congressman Rich McCormick's resolution of censure.   Enemies of civilization are gruesomely bold and clear on their  murderous intentions. A heinously revealing declaration of their  barbaric intentions by the Iranian puppet Hamas is detailed in the  Hamas Covenant of August 18, 1988. In the midst of insane provisions is  article 7: ``The Day of Judgment will not come about until Muslims  fight the Jews and kill them. Then, the Jews will hide behind rocks and  trees, and the rocks and trees will cry out: `O Muslim, there is a Jew  hiding behind me, come and kill him.'''   They are very clear. What they are talking about is death to Israel  and then death to America.   The New York Post is correct in warning last week that we in America  are subject to another 9/11 attack being imminent by such people.   The goal of Hamas puppets of Iran is to murder the Jews worldwide. It  is fake news about caring for the Palestinian people. This is not about  territory. Suffering by the Hamas-oppressed people of Gaza is solely  Hamas dictated.   We know the duplicitous wording of ``from the river to the sea'' is  nothing more than a call of mass murder to Jewish people and will then  lead to mass murder in America.   Hamas, Houthis, and also Hezbollah are puppets of Iran with their  intent, and we are actually in a war we did not choose between  dictators with rule of gun attacking democracies with rule of law. This  began with the war criminal Putin's invasion of Ukraine on February 24,  2022, and led to the Hamas invasion of Israel on Putin's birthday,  October 7.   Over 30 missile attacks have already seriously injured American  troops who are serving in this war.   Bold and clear are the dictators with Putin's treatise of July 2021  that Ukraine does not exist; that the Chinese Communist Party that  threatens the 24 million people of Taiwan, they don't exist; and Iran  chants in English, ``death to Israel, death to America.''   It is sad to hear how the Iranian propaganda is being promoted by our  media and colleges.   As the grateful father of four sons who have served in Iraq, Egypt,  and Afghanistan, I appreciate the Israeli and Ukrainian troops for  their courage.   Democracies will prevail by building peace through strength.    Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent  that when the House adjourns today, it adjourn to meet at 9 a.m.  tomorrow.
