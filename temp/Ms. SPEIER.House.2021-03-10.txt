 Madam Speaker, the gun violence epidemic has robbed us of  our loved ones; our safety in schools, our places of worship and public  spaces; and our children. It has ravaged our communities across America  and touched the Halls of Congress.   It is also very personal to me. I am one of the few Members on this  floor who has been a victim of gun violence, and we know what this is  all about.   This is all about making sure felons don't get guns. It is making  sure that those who are mentally ill don't get guns. And it is making  sure that those who have committed domestic violence don't get guns.  That is all this bill is doing.   But what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are doing is  bowing to the NRA that contributes to their campaigns and kissing the  rings of those who are the gun manufacturers who contribute to the NRA  anywhere from $10 to $60 million over the course of 5 years. That is  what this is all about.   The American people want to be safe, and we are going to make them  safe.
