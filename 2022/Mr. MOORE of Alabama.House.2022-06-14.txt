 Madam Speaker, last year alone fentanyl killed  more Americans than any weapon of mass destruction in our Nation's  history.   Fentanyl is now the number one cause of death for Americans between  the ages of 18 and 45. It is not guns. It is not COVID-19. It is not  even car accidents. It is fentanyl.   CDC numbers show more total drug overdose deaths last year in the  U.S. than those killed by the atomic bomb blast that ended World War  II.   The direct cause of so many American deaths from fentanyl is the  Biden administration's surrender on our southern border. In 2021 alone,  more than 11,000 pounds of fentanyl was seized at our southern border.  So just imagine how much fentanyl got across the border and into our  communities.   Fentanyl is a drug so deadly poisonous that the Russian military has  reportedly weaponized it. Countless families who have lost loved ones  to fentanyl deserve better than what we are getting from this  administration.   That is why I cosponsored Congresswoman Boebert's Fentanyl is a WMD  Act, a designation that follows the 2019 proposal from the Trump  administration that would enable our government to treat the fentanyl  crisis with the urgency that it deserves.   We can't turn the other way as the Mexican drug cartels kill  thousands of young Americans. We must take the fentanyl threat  seriously, and we must secure our border.                            ____________________
