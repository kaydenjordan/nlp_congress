 Madam President, for the past several weeks I have had  the opportunity to be able to travel around the great State of  Oklahoma. I have literally been from Guymon to Talihina, to  Bartlesville, to Lawton to cover as much space as I could and talk to  as many people as I could.   Obviously, we were in smaller groups, with masks and social  distancing and doing all the things we could to take care of each  other, but taking the moment to meet with school superintendents,  parents, teachers, healthcare providers and hospital administrators,  small business owners and employees of large and small businesses, not- for-profits and their volunteers, law enforcement individuals, city  managers, mayors, city councilmen, State leadership.   I wanted to hear what was happening on the ground in my State in  order to know what needs to be addressed because there has been a lot  of noise in Washington, DC, about what needs to be done on COVID.   There are many people in the national press who are struck by the  fact that $3 trillion has already been allocated to deal with COVID-19  and a tremendous number of changes have already occurred. But in this  town there are a significant number of people who say: We just spent $3  trillion. That was fun. Let's do it all over again and see how we can  spend even more.   My focus has been very simple: What is needed to be able to beat the  virus? What I heard all over Oklahoma wasn't ``Go do more; just spend  more and create new programs'' but ``How can we beat this virus back so  that we can actually get to a moment where we can function again  economically as a nation?''   People are returning to work, but they are asking very basic  questions. The first of those is ``This is a health crisis. What do we  do?''   The bill that has just been released, which we are voting on in the  Senate tomorrow, has a whole series of issues tailored to actually work  on beating the virus back and getting our economy going and helping to  protect our families. That is the design of this. It is not just doing  something; it is trying to do the right things to actually help us get  through this and get to the other side, starting with money for  testing--not just additional testing but new types of testing to make  sure that we have even faster tests out there and that we have more  testing that actually addresses the issue of how we can do it on-site,  get an accurate result, and not wait weeks. While we literally have  millions of tests that have been done, we have some tests that take a  long time to get back. In March, we were dealing with ``Let's get a  test,''  [[Page S5489]]  and now we are dealing with ``Let's get a faster test.'' That is a lot  of the focus of the funding here: faster testing.   On vaccines, there are six vaccines right now that are in human  trials or that are approaching human trials, which is remarkable,  thinking about the history of vaccines and how long it has taken. But  there was a significant amount of money invested in this in February  and March in previous bills to be able to fast-track the research, and  that has made a difference. Now it is a matter of moving it from the  research phase to trials to actually implementing it nationwide. So  there is significant money for testing, for vaccines, and for  treatments.   Secondly, how do we get our schools open again? I heard over and over  again from parents, administrators, and teachers: We want to get our  schools open again--public, private, charter, online, whatever it may  be. Those parents who are taxpayers and individuals--regardless of  where they choose to send their child to school or if they choose to  keep their child at home for school--want to know what is going to be  done to help our kids get educated. While the vast majority of funding  and authority for education is in the States, there is a Federal  connection here that we should be able to help, especially kids with  special needs. They have unique challenges during this time of COVID- 19, and we need to be able to get those kids back in school and get  them the additional care they need during this time period.   What all parents are saying to me is this: I want the best possible  moment. I do not want my kid being written off for the future because  someone didn't choose to invest in them now.   This bill has $105 billion toward education--public, private,  charter, homeschool. It has tax credits built in to assist parents to  be able to choose where they want their kids to go. It has the ability  for more schools to go online to help through this season. It has  additional dollars to be used for transportation because many school  districts are doing multiple bus routes to keep down the number of  people on individual buses. All of those things are helpful. We want to  help get our kids back in school and make sure that this is successful.   During this moment, it has been interesting. As I talked to many  superintendents and educators, they all said to me the same thing: We  are working hard to get our kids back to class and to do the things  they need to do.   Then they would pause and say: For years we have talked about  innovation in education, but we have been stuck doing the same thing  over and over again and have been frustrated with the results. This  pandemic has forced us to innovate in education in ways that we only  dreamed about years ago. We need to be prepared during this season not  only to continue to educate our kids in the best way possible but to  take notes on the best innovations across the country in education  because we have said as a nation that we need to be stronger in how we  are educating our kids and the end product of that and how we are  preparing them for the workforce. This is that moment we should pay  attention to, as well, in the education innovations that are actually  going on in my State and in many States around the country.   There is money in this, as well, for childcare. This has been an  interesting challenge. Childcare facilities have fewer people who are  actually allowed to be there--the children who are able to be there-- but the profit margin doesn't work for them to have all those employees  and fewer children. We want them to be able to be there and be  successful and survive this, so we added additional dollars for  childcare.   We have additional dollars for ag because in some areas of  agriculture across the country, they have done very well, but some have  really struggled. If we all want to be able to eat at the end of this,  we better make sure that ag survives and thrives through this.   I met with a lot of small business leaders and heard a lot of  different conversations. They were very appreciative of the Paycheck  Protection Program. In my State, 61,000 small businesses and not-for- profits took advantage of the Paycheck Protection Program, and many of  them told me that they would not be open today if it weren't for that.  They are grateful this body came together to deal with the Paycheck  Protection Program because it made a difference in my State and many  other States around the country.   The bill we are putting on the floor on Thursday deals specifically  with the next round of paycheck protection, limiting it to the hardest  hit small businesses and nonprofits, those that have had the largest  amount of revenue loss and that are the smallest of businesses. We need  them to be able to survive through this. Nothing is going to make them  whole, and the goal of this shouldn't be to make every business  whole. We can't financially sustain that as a country, but we can try  to get people through this and get to the other side of it.    We are all going to have to innovate. Most of the small businesses  that I talked to told me about the innovations they were doing and how  they used to do business one way, and, within 36 hours, they figured  out a way to do it a different way. That is the American system. That  is free market and capitalism at their best--that at the moment of  struggle, you can go innovate and do things different and be successful  with that. That is what we have to continue to protect--not too much  government oversight and control of everything that, in the days and  moments where we have to innovate, people can't innovate because they  have so much government mandates on them.   I was grateful to the Trump administration for how much flexibility  they gave to the process, not only to waivers for child lunches through  the schools and flexibility there, but flexibility for businesses to be  able to innovate in a very difficult moment.   We will need another round--a smaller round, but another round--for  the hardest hit businesses for the Paycheck Protection Program. Our  not-for-profits told me over and over how much work they are doing  during this time period. We need to make sure those not-for-profits not  only survive it but thrive.   As I have said to this body before, we have three safety nets in  America: the family; churches, not-for-profits, and faith-based  institutions; and then government is third. A lot of people look at our  safety net as being all the government programs, but that is the last  in this cycle. If our families aren't strong, then individuals  struggle. If our faith-based entities and our not-for-profits that take  care of so much human need are not strong and thriving and those  volunteers aren't engaged, there is no way the government can keep up  with the issues.   So just keeping not-for-profits open can't be the goal for this. We  have to keep them thriving. Those not-for-profits around the country  are taking care of the homeless, the hungry, and the hurting, and we  need to find ways to strengthen them. The best way to do that is not to  have some government program to establish the best way to identify good  not-for-profits. The best way to do that is to allow the American  people to look at what is working in their neighborhoods and their  communities, because they will invest their own dollars to do that.   In the CARES Act, I pushed for and we got a $300 write-off on your  taxes if every American will give $300 to the not-for-profit of their  choice. In this proposal, that doubles for the individuals and  quadruples for the family. This is a $600 tax write-off for an  individual or a $1,200 tax write-off for a family if they will donate  to a not-for-profit.   Why do we choose to do that? Because not-for-profits are way more  efficient at taking care of human need than the government is and  because they have a face. They are interacting with a family. They are  interacting with an individual directly. They are not dealing with  someone on the phone or online. It is not a check that you receive or a  form that you fill out. It is a person that you meet with face to face  who says: How can I help you? And it is a volunteer that will walk  through life with you.   Those faith-based ministries and those secular and other not-for- profits out there are making an enormous difference, and the best thing  that we can do to make sure they thrive in this moment is to make sure  that we incentivize individuals that give to them by saying: You can  give this to Uncle Sam or you can give this to a local charity of your  choice. Either  [[Page S5490]]  way, it is going to strengthen individuals. Go engage with that.   That is in this bill, and it is important that we continue to walk  alongside them and all of those not-for-profits to make sure they  thrive because we need them thriving, not just surviving in this  moment.   There is one other thing that I want to identify. There are a lot of  things that are in this bill. It is liability protections. Businesses  and universities in my State said: We desperately need the Federal  Government to clarify liability protections.   Now, there have been individuals on the other side of the aisle that  have said: We don't want to do that. We want to just leave that up to  the lawyers in the days ahead who have lawsuits. What is occurring is  there are many businesses in my State that are holding back and many  schools in my State that are holding back trying to figure out what  happens next for fear of what could be a series of lawsuits. They just  want clarity. They want to do business where they can protect their  employees, protect the customers or individuals or students that are  there that are around them, but they also want to be able to operate  and function again, and they don't feel like they can do that without  basic liability protections and liability definitions. This bill  provides that.   Now, I have heard some in the media and some even in this building  who have said this is a pared-down skinny bill. Only in Washington, DC,  is a $300 billion piece of legislation considered skinny--only here.  Over and over again at home, when I talk to people across the State of  Oklahoma and I would present what has already been done in the previous  acts--the $3 trillion that have already been spent on COVID in the  months before and the proposals that we have now--they would quietly  pull me aside at the end of the meeting and they would say almost  exactly the same thing: Where is this money coming from?   People are worried about the virus, but they are also worried about  what is coming next. People are used to taking out a loan if there is a  major storm or a major life event, knowing I have to take this loan out  to get through it, but they also realize that for every loan they take  out, they have to pay that back. The people in my State are saying the  same thing: Where is this money coming from? How are we ever going to  pay it back? And they are shocked that the House of Representatives and  many in this room are pushing a bill that is $3.5 trillion in spending  on top of the $3 trillion that was already spent earlier this year, and  they just gasp when they think about an additional $6.5 trillion of  deficit in a single year. They wonder what happens with that, and I  respond to them: So do I. That is why we are trying to be as tailored  and as focused as we can possibly be to meet the needs that need to be  done but to not just throw a big number out and to say we have to go  big. We already have gone big earlier this year.   Now, it is not just ``can we throw money out the door from  Washington, DC,'' but it is ``what do we have to do to get to the other  side of this for our health, for our students, for the basic operations  of our economy and survival to be able to get on the other side of  this,'' because on the other side of this is a bill that has to be paid   We, in this body, should pay attention to that because, certainly,  the people in Oklahoma are paying attention to that and so should we.  There are things that need to be done, and I look forward to bringing  this up to be able to focus on the essential things that need to be  done for our economy right now and be able to keep moving from there.
