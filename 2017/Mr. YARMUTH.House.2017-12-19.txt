 Mr. Speaker, this morning I saw a dramatic bit of  evidence as to why the American people overwhelmingly reject the  Republican donor relief bill known as the tax reform bill.   Chairman Brady of the Ways and Means Committee, the author of this  bill, was asked why he didn't do anything in the bill to change the  carried interest deduction, that provision which allows billionaire  hedge fund managers to pay a lower income tax rate than tens of  millions of regular Americans.   He said the middle class Americans don't care about that, working  families don't. I understand why he didn't want to try to defend the  protection of carried interest. There is no defense for it.   But here is why every American ought to care: Because every dollar of  lost revenue that goes back to those billionaire hedge fund managers  will result in cut services for the vast majority of Americans, for  Medicare, for Medicaid, for Social Security, and for many others. It  will add to the debt that their children and grandchildren will have to  pay for.   Mr. Speaker, that is a good reason why everyone should care about  this bill, why it is a scam on middle class Americans, and why it ought  to be rejected.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I thank my fellow Kentucky native for  yielding.   Mr. Speaker, today, my Republican colleagues will vote to approve a  historically unpopular bill.   The American people don't buy Republican claims that the bill will  help middle class families. In fact, in several years, more than 83  million middle class families will see a tax hike.   The people see that Republicans have sold their souls and principles  to give tax cuts to wealthy corporations and to pay back their  billionaire donors. They know the Republicans have abandoned any claim  to fiscal responsibility. After all, nonpartisan analyses conclude this  bill will add more than $1 trillion to the debt.   But the Republican leadership has a plan to make up the difference,  and it is something else. They are already working on legislation to  make massive cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs families  need.   This isn't tax reform. This isn't help for the middle class. It is a  scam, it is fraud, and it will have dangerous, long-lasting  consequences for the American people.   I urge my colleagues to defeat the rule and to reject this scandalous  Republican donor payback legislation.
