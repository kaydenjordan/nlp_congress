 Mr. President, today I wish to honor the men and  women of the USS Billings Commissioning Committee and their notable  contributions to our State and Nation. The USS Billings Commissioning  Committee is a group of volunteers from Montana's largest city, who  have dedicated themselves to promoting awareness and fostering support  for the future commissioning of the USS Billings and all those who will  sail aboard her in defense of our Nation.   Upon commissioning, the USS Billings will be the first U.S. Navy  warship to bear the city's namesake, a historic moment for our State.  Montana has a proud heritage of military service. Some 3,500 Active  Duty servicemembers currently serve at Malmstrom Air Force Base in  Great Falls, and another 4,500 citizen-soldiers serve in the National  Guard and Reserve at various locations across the State. Beyond the  borders of our landlocked home, more than 2,200 U.S. Navy sailors  currently call Montana home, adding 134 new Montanans to their ranks in  the past 12 months. Montana also proudly boasts the highest percentage  of veterans per capita in the contiguous United States.   A Freedom Class littoral combat ship, the USS Billings will be among  the fastest, most technologically advanced, and agile efficient ships  in our naval fleet. The USS Billings will project power near the  shoreline and conduct a wide range of missions, including mine  countermeasures, antisubmarine warfare, and surface warfare missions.  We wait with great anticipation as her August 3 commissioning quickly  approaches.   In keeping with time-honored naval traditions, the USS Billings  Commissioning Committee on behalf of the city of Billings is making  preparations to host the commission ceremony and a series of  celebrations. Determined to accomplish this ambitious goal, the  committee has made great strides in rallying support across the State.  The city has had the honor and privilege of hosting the crew of the USS  Billings at the of the committee, and we look forward to their return  in the weeks ahead. These efforts have made great strides in fostering  a strong and enduring relationship between the city of Billings, the  State of Montana, and the U.S. Navy.   In recognition of these and other notable accomplishments, I ask that  the following names who have volunteered for the USS Billings  Commissioning Committee be entered into the Record: Mayor Bill Cole,  Chairman; Councilman Mike Yakawich, Co-Vice Chair; Commissioner Denis  Pitman, Co-Vice Chair; Ron Spence, Committee Coordinator; Councilman  Larry Brewster; Brent Brooks; Dan Brooks; Councilman Dick Clark; Sue  Davidson; Katy Easton; Mike Jennings; Al Swanson; and Nancy  Swanson.                            ____________________
