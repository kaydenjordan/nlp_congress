 Mr. President, this week I have the honor of  recognizing four Montana school teachers for their passion and  dedication to teaching math and science to young Montanans.   Beth Walsh from East Valley Middle School, Claire Pichette from  Helena High School, Thomas Redmon from Daly Elementary, and Justine  Hurley from White Sulphur Springs Elementary School have all been  awarded the Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and  Science Teaching between 2017 and 2018.   The Presidential Award for Excellence in Mathematics and Science  Teaching is an incredibly high honor for school teachers across the  country and no easy task to receive. A committee of Montana math and  science teachers select finalists from a collection of statewide  applications followed by a national panel of distinguished scientists,  mathematician, and educators who select four national award winners  from those finalists.   These teachers won the Presidential Award for their superior  abilities to educate young Montanans on mathematics and science ranging  from kindergarten children to seniors in high school. They show passion  for their profession daily. and this award is a symbol of that passion.  We are lucky to have such highly qualified teachers educating Montana  students.   It is my honor to recognize Beth Walsh, Claire Pichette, Thomas  Redmon, and Justine Hurley for their exemplary work educating Montana  students. They are a true testament to the incredible education system  we have throughout Big Sky Country.                            ____________________
