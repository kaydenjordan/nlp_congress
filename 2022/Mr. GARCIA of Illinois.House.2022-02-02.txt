 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the  America COMPETES Act. We have heard a lot about competing with China on  the global stage, and I strongly agree that we have to invest in  American innovation.   But what does innovation mean if technological development and  economic growth leaves everyday people behind? To truly compete, we  must take a hard look inward.   Our economy is built on the backs of many low-wage workers, many of  them being Latino, Black, and immigrant, like my neighbors in Chicago.   How can we compete globally as inequality rises, our healthcare  system crumbles, and the middle class remains out of reach for  millions?   I support the America COMPETES Act because it puts our focus on where  it needs to be, on investing in communities. The bill strengthens our  supply chains, builds sustainable technologies, includes people from  diverse backgrounds in the STEM field, and protects and expands living- wage jobs.   It is about real access to opportunity, so more Americans can share  in our country's wealth because our people are our strength.
