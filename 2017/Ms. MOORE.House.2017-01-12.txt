 I thank the chairman. I really appreciate the gentleman,  Mr. DeSaulnier, for bringing forth this amendment.   Disclosures of and divestment in conflicts are becoming increasingly  important in this administration coming up. The conflicts that we know  about and the conflicts that we suspect exist with President-elect  Trump and his nominees have become a tremendous source of concern as  not only do they undermine the faith and fairness of U.S. financial  markets, as has been pointed out, but, quite frankly, they have become  a matter of national security concern.   The amendments that were rejected by Ranking Member Waters and this  amendment by Representative DeSaulnier together restore confidence that  the U.S. financial system is not being manipulated for the gain of a  few government officials.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues to support this amendment.
