 Mr. Speaker, let's start with the beginning of the  Constitution: ``We the people of the United States, in order to form a  more perfect Union, establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility,  provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare . . .''   That is how our Constitution starts, to uphold the premise of the  Declaration of Independence, of freedom to life, liberty, and the  pursuit of happiness.   This bill helps us move forward because it helps us with life,  liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.   My friend complains about the red flag rule. It helps us with those  individuals who suffer from domestic violence and who have suicidal  ideation, but it also helps the families destroyed at Columbine in my  area and at the Aurora movie theater.   This bill that I am so happy to advance today is pro-Constitution,  pro-freedom, and pro-liberty.
