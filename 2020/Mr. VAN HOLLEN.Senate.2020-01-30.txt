 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Maryland.    Mr. Chief Justice, on behalf of myself and Senator  Klobuchar, I send a question to the desk directed to both parties.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Van Hollen is to both parties. The  President's counsel will go first:         In his response to an earlier question this evening, Mr.       Sekulow cited individuals like the Bidens as being ``not       irrelevant to our case.'' Are you opposed to having the Chief       Justice make the initial determinations regarding the       relevance of documents and witnesses, particularly as the       Senate could disagree with the Chief Justice's ruling by a       majority vote?    The President's counsel is first.   Mr. Counsel SEKULOW. Mr. Chief Justice, again, to make our position  clear, we think, constitutionally, that would not be the appropriate  way to go.   Again, no disrespect to the Chief Justice at all, who is presiding  here as the Presiding Officer, but our view is that, if there are  issues that have to be resolved on constitutional matters, that it  should be done in the appropriate way.   You have Senate rules that govern that, as to what you would do, and  then there is--you know, if litigation were to be necessary for a  particular issue, that would have to be looked at. But this idea that  we can short circuit the system, which is what they have been doing for  3 months, is not something we are willing to go with.   I have said that. I said it all day yesterday. And, again, no  disrespect to the Senator's question, but we are just--that is not a  position that we will accept as far as moving these proceedings  forward.   Thank you.   Mr. Manager SCHIFF. Senators, counsel for the President says that  would not be constitutionally appropriate. Why not? Where is it  prohibited in the Constitution that in an impeachment trial, upon the  agreement of the parties, the Chief Justice cannot resolve issues of  materiality of the witnesses? Of course that is permitted by the  Constitution.   Now, counsel earlier said that the House managers want to decide on  which witnesses the President should be able to call; we want them to  call our witnesses. Well, you would think that Mick Mulvaney, the White  House Chief of Staff, would be their witness. If indeed he supports  what the President is claiming, if indeed he is willing to say under  oath what he is willing to say in a press statement, you would think he  would be their witness.   But I am not saying that we get to decide. That is not the proposal  here. The proposal is we take a week; the Senate goes about its  business; we do depositions. The witnesses are not witnesses on the  President's behalf that we get a decision on as House managers; but,  rather, that we entrust the Chief Justice of the United States to make  a fair and impartial decision as to whether a witness is material or  not, whether a witness has relevant facts or not, or whether a witness  is simply being brought before this body for the purposes of  retribution--in the case of the whistleblower--or to smear the Bidens  without material purpose relevant to these proceedings.   We are not asking that you accept our judgment on that. We are  proposing that the Chief Justice make that decision. And I think the  reason, of course, that they don't want the Chief Justice to make that  decision, as I indicated the other night, is not because they don't  trust the Chief Justice to be fair. It is because they fear the Chief  Justice will be fair. And I think that tells you everything you need to  know about the lack of good faith when it comes to the arguments they  make about why they went to court, why they refused to comply with any  subpoenas, why they refused to provide any documents, why they are here  before you saying that the House managers must sue to get witnesses and  they are in court on the same day saying you can't sue to get  witnesses.   This is why they don't want the Chief Justice to make that decision,  because they know the witnesses they are requesting are for purposes of  retribution or distraction.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from North Carolina.
