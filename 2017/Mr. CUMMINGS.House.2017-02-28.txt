 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may  consume.   Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this legislation. The  SCRUB Act would establish a $30 million commission of unelected--and I  emphasize that, unelected--bureaucrats to duplicate work that agencies  are already supposed to be doing. The bill would focus on the costs of  regulations while disregarding their benefits and protecting the most  vulnerable populations in our country, like the children in Flint,  Michigan.                                time  1430    If there is any doubt about this, one need look no further than the  so-called CutGo provision in this bill. That provision would require  that, when an agency makes a new rule, it must offset the cost of that  new rule for the repeal of an existing rule. This applies even if the  new rule is in response to an imminent health or safety threat.   Agency compliance with this CutGo provision would also be subject to  judicial review, which prolongs the process even more. This would  inevitably result in lengthy delays, as both industry and nonprofit  groups routinely file challenges to agency decisions.   President Obama has already issued two executive orders to eliminate  unnecessary regulations. On January 18, 2011, he issued Executive Order  13563, requiring each agency to implement plans for reviewing existing  rules. That executive order requires each agency to: ``periodically  review its existing significant regulations to determine whether any  such regulations should be modified, streamlined, expanded, or  repealed.''   In addition, President Obama issued Executive Order No. 13610 on May  10, 2012, requiring agencies to report twice a year to the Office of  Information and Regulatory Affairs on the status of their review  efforts. In November 2014, a report prepared for the Administrative  Conference of the United States highlighted the impact of these  mandated reviews, concluding: ``Implementing President Obama's  executive orders on retrospective review of regulations, agencies  identified tens of billions of dollars of cost savings and tens of  millions of hours of reduced paperwork and reporting requirements  through modifications of existing regulations.''   Congress has the authority and certainly the responsibility to  conduct oversight to review existing agency rules and to recommend or  mandate reforms, yet this bill would create a new commission, a new  commission that would cost taxpayers $30 million to do what agencies  and Congress are already supposed to be doing.   In addition, the commission's report to Congress on the rules it  recommends repealing would be subject to an up-or-down vote by the  Congress. Congress would not be allowed to vote on each regulation  individually, and this would usurp the authority of Congress.   One of the most troubling aspects of this bill is that it would  entrust this unelected commission with extraordinary and virtually  unlimited authority to subpoena witnesses or documents. Section 101(c)  of the bill states: ``The commission may issue subpoenas requiring the  attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of any  evidence relating to the duties of the commission. The attendance of  witnesses and the production of evidence may be required from any place  within the United States at any designated place of hearing within the  United States.''   Most agency inspectors general do not have such broad authority to  compel witness testimony. Yet this unelected commission would have this  authority. This means that it could compel an individual to testify on  any subject. For example, a schoolteacher could be compelled to testify  about education rules or a senior citizen could be compelled to testify  about Medicare or Social Security rules. This extraordinary subpoena  power is especially troubling because the commission's jurisdiction is  limitless.   There is no restriction on what regulations the commission can  review. Three prominent law professors with the Center for Progressive  Reform sent a letter opposing an identical bill in the last Congress.  The letter said this proposal would: ``create a convoluted,  [[Page H1372]]  complex, and potentially very expensive new bureaucracy to review  existing agency rules and make recommendations for the repeal or  weakening of those rules with little meaningful oversight,  transparency, or public accountability to ensure that these  recommendations do not subvert the public interest.''   In addition, Citizens for Sensible Safeguards, a coalition of more  than 150 consumer, labor, and good-government groups, also oppose the  bill.   This bill could have dangerous consequences for the health and safety  of the American public; therefore, I strongly urge every Member to  oppose it.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman), a very distinguished member of  our committee.    Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member.   Mr. Chairman, there are many troubling aspects of this bill, but most  pressing is that this legislation, without clear policy rationale,  caters to demands of my Republican colleagues to slash existing  regulations and muddy the process of passing new ones.   Congress already has a responsibility of reviewing existing rules and  mandating reform. Why delegate that to those not elected to do so?   This unsettling bill spends millions of taxpayer dollars to create a  hand-picked commission to do the job of Congress without  accountability. No, thank you.   This unelected and unaccountable commission, appointed by the  President and Congress, would submit regulatory changes without the  opportunity to amend the measure, taking regulatory review out of the  hands of the agency experts. This is counterproductive and an insult to  the democratic process.   To add insult to injury, this bill makes the regulatory process  transactional.   By forcing agencies to repeal regulations in order to adopt a new  one, we risk public health and safety.   Why have they prioritized costs over benefit? Why are American lives  on the chopping block?   I urge my colleagues to vote no against this bill.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 3\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman  from California (Ms. Speier).    Madam Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.   The SCRUB Act poses real and significant dangers to the health and  welfare of the American public. By focusing predominantly on the cost  of the rules, the SCRUB Act's CutGo provision will repeal rules with  little regard for how they benefit and protect the American people.   The commission's virtually unlimited authority to subpoena witnesses  or documents, combined with its uncircumscribed ability to review and  recommend repeal of any current rules, is an extraordinary grant of  power that could have tragic repercussions for the health and safety of  the American people.   The SCRUB Act is a waste of $30 million of hard-earned taxpayer money  for work that is already being done by Federal agencies.   I strongly urge every Member to oppose this act.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, as the designee of the gentleman from  Virginia (Mr. Beyer), I offer amendment No. 1.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 5, line 16, insert after ``reviews.'' the following:       ``During the two-year period prior  [[Page H1377]]       to the inclusion of an individual on a list of candidates       under this subparagraph, the individual may not have been a       registered lobbyist under the Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995       (2 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.).''.        Page 6, after line 6, insert the following new paragraph:        (4) Financial disclosure reports of members.--Each member       of the Commission shall file the financial disclosure reports       required under title I of the Ethics in Government Act of       1978 (5 U.S.C. App.) in accordance with the requirements of       such title.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 150, the gentleman  from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland.    Madam Chair, I am very pleased to yield such time as he  may consume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer), the maker of  the amendment.    Madam Chair, I have no further comments. I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I have no further comments. I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Maryland is recognized for 5  minutes.    Madam Chair, again I claim the time in opposition, but  I will not oppose this amendment even though it does nothing to change  the substance of the SCRUB Act or reduce the danger that it poses to  the health and safety of the American public.   This amendment would add another criterion to identify which rules  the commission would recommend for repeal, specifically, whether an  agency has complied with the requirements of title 5 U.S.C., section  801(a)(1)(A).   That section requires agencies, prior to promulgating a rule, to  submit to each House of Congress and the Comptroller General a report  containing a copy of the rule; a concise general statement relating to  the rule, including whether it is a major rule; and the proposed  effective date of the rule.   So this amendment would require this unelected commission to report  to Congress on what information Congress has or has not received. This  just underscores the point that Congress should do its own job rather  than passing this bill to set up a commission to do our job for us.   Like the other criteria in the bill, Representative McSally's  amendment does nothing to address the SCRUB Act's focus on the costs of  the rules. The amendment fails to make sense of the CutGo provision,  which would result in the repeal of rules with little regard for how  these rules have benefited and protected the American public.   The amendment fails to address the fact that agencies are already  doing a retrospective review of regulations.   This amendment fails to reduce the $30 million price tag that the  American public would be responsible for paying to create the unelected  commission under this bill.   The amendment fails to reduce the commission's virtually unlimited  authority to subpoena witnesses or documents.   This amendment is nothing more than a window dressing, and it is  nice. It does not address any of the SCRUB Act's failings and dangers  that it poses to the health and safety of all Americans.   I yield back the balance of my time.   Ms. McSALLY. Madam Chair, may I ask how much time I have remaining.   The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Arizona has 2\1/2\ minutes  remaining.   Ms. McSALLY. Madam Chair, again, my amendment is simple under the  SCRUB Act. Right now, these agencies are not complying with the law.  They have not submitted necessary reports to Congress and the GAO. So  this amendment is simply asking, among other things that are being  reviewed in this act, that we take a look at which reports have not  been submitted, therefore, which are not in compliance with the  Congressional Review Act so that we can decide whether any of those  would be appropriate for disapproval resolutions or, quite frankly,  whether the rule is even one that should be enforced because it hasn't  complied with the law.    This is a good amendment. I appreciate our colleagues supporting it.   I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Arrington).
