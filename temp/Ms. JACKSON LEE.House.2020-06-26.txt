 Mr. Speaker, I want to give all acknowledgment to  the outstanding gentlewoman, Eleanor Holmes Norton.   President Washington said: ``The Constitution is the guide which I  will never abandon.'' Nothing in the Constitution says that we cannot  make the Washington State the Douglass Commonwealth. Frederick Douglass  said there is no power without struggle.   The sons and daughters of Washington, D.C., laid down their lives for  this country in World Wars. They stand for this country in service to  this government. Why are we denying them their rights?   Alaska has 700,000-plus people. There is no population requirement.  Make Washington, D.C., a State now.   Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Committee on the Judiciary, as  an original cosponsor of the legislation, I rise in strong and  enthusiastic support of H.R. 51, the ``Washington, D.C. Admission  Act,'' which declares the State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth,  to be a State of the United States of America, and declares its  admission into the Union on an equal footing with the other States in  all respects whatsoever.   George Washington, the nation's first Chief Executive, and the  President of the Constitutional Convention which met in Philadelphia,  said: ``The Constitution is a guide which I will never abandon.''   The action we are taking today to admit the State of Washington,  Douglass Commonwealth, as the 51st state of the Union is consistent  with the authority vested in the Congress by the Constitution in  Article IV, section 3, clause 1.   The Constitution does not specify a minimum population or acreage  test that a state must meet to gain admission to the Union, rather  leave the determination to be made in the sound judgment of the  Congress, which admitted Wyoming which has more than 200,000 fewer  persons than the District of Columbia, and Alaska, which had only  224,000 persons when it was admitted as a state in 1959.   Mr. Speaker, in doing passing this legislation, we remove a stain  that has blighted our nation for more than 200 years.   I thank Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, my colleague and the  representative of the 706,000 residents of the District of Columbia,  for her tireless and relentless efforts in shepherding this legislation  to the floor today.   Mr. Speaker, in his famous 1857 oration in Candaigua, New York, the  great abolitionist, Frederick Douglass, said: ``If there is no struggle  there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom and yet  deprecate agitation are men who want crops without plowing up the  ground; they want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the  ocean without the awful roar of its many waters.''   The vote we are about to cast today is long time in coming but shows  that struggle can lead to progress, that truth crushed to earth shall  rise again, that justice cannot be denied.   Today, we vote to end two centuries of shame and correct an injustice  to the citizens of the District of Columbia.   Mr. Speaker, let us not lose sight of one indisputable and shameful  fact: over 700,000 people living in the District of Columbia lack  direct voting representation in the House of Representatives and  Senate.   Specifically, the citizens of the District of Columbia pay more in  federal taxes than 22 states and pay more in federal taxes per capita  than any state.   The District of Columbia's population (705,000) is larger than the  populations of Wyoming and Vermont, and seven states had populations  under one million in the last census.   The District of Columbia's annual budget ($15.5 billion) is larger  than the budgets of 14 states.   The District of Columbia has a higher per capita personal income and  gross domestic product than any state.   District of Columbia residents have fought and died in every American  war, including the Revolution itself, and almost 200,000 District  residents have served in the military since World War I alone.   Approximately 30,000 veterans live in the District of Columbia, and  it should be noted that during the Vietnam War, 243 District residents  were casualties of war, a casualty figure greater than that observed by  10 different states.   So, Mr. Speaker, it is undisputable that residents of the District of  Columbia serve in the military, pay billions of dollars in federal  taxes each year, and assume other responsibilities of U.S. citizenship.   But for over 200 years, the District of Columbia has been denied  voting representation  [[Page H2541]]  in Congress--the entity that has ultimate authority over all aspects of  the city's legislative, executive, and judicial functions.   Mr. Speaker, if a person can be called upon to pay federal taxes and  serve in the armed forces of the United States, then he or she should  at least have the opportunity to vote for a representative who could at  least cast a symbolic vote in this chamber on critical matters facing  our nation.   Issues like war and peace, equality and justice.   And tear-gassing peaceful protestors in Lafayette Square exercising  their First Amendment rights.   Mr. Speaker, taxation with representation is tyranny.   H.R. 51 would create a state from essentially the eight hometown  wards of the District of Columbia and provides that the new state would  be equal to the other 50 states in all respects, and that the residents  of the State of Washington, D.C. would have all the rights of  statehood, including voting representation in Congress and full local  self-government.   Under the legislation this new state would have no jurisdiction over  the reduced federal district, which would consist of the area that  Members of Congress and visitors associate with the capital of our  country: the U.S. Capitol, the U.S. Supreme Court, the White House, the  principal federal monuments, and the federal buildings and grounds  adjacent to the National Mall and the U.S. Capitol.   It is unconscionable that 700,000 Americans are being unconscionably  denied a vote and a voice in the most important legislative body in the  world.   As a supporter of freedom, democracy, and equality, I believe that it  is long overdue for the citizens of the District of Columbia to have  representation in the House and the Senate to advocate for their  interests on vital matters coming before the Congress of the United  States.   Mr. Speaker, it is wrong that we must be reminded daily by license  plates in the District of Columbia that ``Taxation without  representation is tyranny.''   The people in Boston felt so strongly about this in 1775 that they  rebelled in Boston Harbor, launching the ``Boston Tea Party.''   The principle that political authority derives from the consent of  the government is no less applicable when it comes to the District of  Columbia.   Let us be clear, there is no dispute that hundreds of thousands of  American citizens reside in the District of Columbia.   We all agree that universal suffrage is the hallmark of a democratic  regime, of which the United States is the world's leading exemplar.   None of us believes it is fair that citizens of the District of  Columbia pay federal taxes, risk life and limb fighting wars abroad to  protect American democracy and extend the blessings of liberty to  people living in foreign lands.   In short, there is no moral reason to deny the citizens of the  District of Columbia admission as a state in the United States and the  right to full representation in Congress.   The only question is whether Congress has the will and the  constitutional authority to do so.   Congress has always had the constitutional authority but for much of  the last 200 years, it has not had the will.   Let us change that, beginning today with our vote to pass H.R. 51,  the Washington, D.C. Admission Act.                                time  1045     Madam Speaker, this is a somber moment, and I thank  the gentleman from Florida for not only his passion but his recognition  that America should never forget.   I thank the Speaker pro tempore for letting us remember all the faces  and  [[Page H2547]]  families and loved ones that were impacted. Forty-nine lives, I  believe, were taken in one moment, with an act of violence by a crazed  gunman, with a gun.   We have been trying to stand in the gap, with background checks  passed the very first moment under the leadership of Speaker Pelosi,  gun violence legislation that has no impact on the Second Amendment but  seeks to derail the kind of crazed gunman that was able to take these  lives before first responders could come.   I remember hearing the stories of families waiting outside of the  Pulse nightclub, saying they heard from their loved one but had not  seen them because they were making their last-minute cries for help.   This memorial would say to America that we are not a nation of  bigots, of xenophobia, racism, hatred. We are a nation of respect and  dignity.   I know the families of those who died at the Pulse nightclub are  still in pain and will never forget.   But it is the duty of the United States Congress, with our voices  raised, to say that the book that I have been holding on to over the  last 2 days, to fight for justice in policing, to talk about D.C.  statehood, this book, this Constitution, which George Washington said  he would use as a guide, that he would never abandon, everyone has the  right to decency and life and due process.   I enthusiastically support this legislation to give dignity to the  lives, and for America never to forget those lives, at the Pulse  nightclub.   Madam Speaker, as a senior member of the House of Representatives, I  rise in strong support of H.R. 3094, ``To designate the National Pulse  Memorial located at 1912 South Orange Avenue, Orlando, Florida, 32806,  and for other purposes.''   I am voting for H.R. 3094 because it not only memorializes and honors  the 49 people who tragically lost their lives from this horrific act of  violence, but it also stands as a symbol to the LGBTQ+ community, to  our Latino community, to our nation, and to the world, that we will not  stand for or tolerate acts of hatred against marginalized persons.   Madam Speaker, you will remember that the Pulse nightclub shooting  took place on June 12th, 2016 in Orlando, Florida when a gunman shot  and killed 49 people and injured 53 others.   It was the single deadliest known violent attack on both the LGBTQ+  community and our Latino community.   The Pulse nightclub was a haven for the LGBTQ community to live,  love, and dance.   They came for music, celebration and fellowship.   Over four dozen would leave the Pulse Nightclub with their names  added to a list of fatal victims of gun violence .   In the aftermath, we saw communities come together and support one  another.   We saw doctors, first responders, and friends rush to save the  wounded.   Others donated funds, supplies, and even their blood.   There were countless murals and other artworks, gifts, and letters  left at impromptu memorial sites, paying tribute to the victims and  survivors.   Our nation refused to let hate win.   We came together in the form of thousands of candlelight vigils to  grieve, remember, and heal.   By passing H.R. 3094 today, we seek to create a permanent reminder  that this act of violence and other heinous instances of bigotry are  not emblematic of America or its true values.   It will also remind us that it is our duty as a society to be better  and do better in terms of standing up against hate in all its forms.   I ask all members to join me in voting for H.R. 3094, ``To designate  the National Pulse Memorial located at 1912 South Orange Avenue,  Orlando, Florida, 32806, and for other purposes.''
