 Mr. President, I notice my distinguished friend was  indignant over the Supreme Court debate. I think each of us has a right  to have his own opinion. Here is mine.   There is such a thing called the Thurmond-Leahy rule. It has been in  place for a while. I think it reads that after June of a Presidential  election year, the Senate will not confirm a  [[Page S2090]]  President's nominees. That is a bipartisan rule that has been enforced  by the Senate for several years. Senator McConnell moved it up three  months, from June to March--that is true--even though Democratic  leaders said that is exactly what they would have done if the shoe had  been on the other foot.   Democrats are saying that as a result of that--the 3-month change-- which is what they said they would have done anyway, they are going to  do something that has never been done before: They are going to deny a  Supreme Court Justice a nomination by not allowing a majority vote.  That has never happened in 230 years. Our nominations have always been  decided by a majority vote. There was a little incident in 1968 with  Abe Fortas when President Johnson sought to elevate him to Chief  Justice, but that has been the tradition in the Senate. We have always  approved Presidential nominees by a majority vote, and we have always  approved Cabinet members by a majority vote, even controversial ones.  We have never required them to get 60 votes--ever--and the same with  Federal district judges. And the same was true with Federal circuit  judges until the Democrats started using the filibuster to require 60  votes, as has been well documented here. So I think people need to know  the facts.   What the Democrats are proposing to do next week--quite apart from  the fact that Judge Gorsuch is one of the most eminently qualified  people we have seen come around in a long time--flies in the face of  230 years of tradition in the Senate by insisting that a Presidential  nominee to the Supreme Court requires more than 51 votes to be  confirmed.   I looked very quickly back at my own votes. None of us are perfect,  and I am not asking for any merit badges, but I wonder where the  Democrats are who are trying to do at least what I was trying to do  when President Obama was there. I found at least 10 times that I voted  for cloture--voted to cut off debate--on controversial nominees with  whom I disagreed, and then I voted against them when the vote was 51.   With Secretary of Labor Perez, cloture was invoked 60 to 40. If I had  voted no, that would have denied him his Cabinet position. He is now  the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. I cannot think of  any Cabinet member I disagreed more with, other than perhaps the one I  am about to mention next, but I thought the President deserved to have  his own nominee, and I thought we ought to respect the tradition of  never having denied a Cabinet member a position because of a 60-vote  requirement.   Another one was John King, the Education Secretary. I asked President  Obama to appoint him or somebody of his choosing. I thought we needed  an Education Secretary for a year even though I have great differences  with John King. I respect him greatly, but I have differences with him.   So I got him confirmed as chairman--I don't want to say it that way.  I asked the President to do it, as chairman of the committee. I saw  that he had a prompt confirmation, and then I made sure he had enough  votes to be confirmed--not by much. When it came to cloture, I may have  even voted for him when it came to it, just because I thought the  President deserved to have his own appointment.   Then there was Attorney General Lynch. Cloture was invoked with only  66 votes. I voted to end debate and have a vote on her.   Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel--there was opposition to him. I  voted no there on confirmation, but I voted to make sure that there was  a vote. I voted for cloture.   For two National Labor Relations Board members and a National Labor  Relations Board General Counsel, cloture was invoked by 64, 65, and 62  votes--very close. I voted against all three of them for confirmation,  just as I did Secretary Perez, because I disagreed with them so much.  But I thought that we ought to respect the fact that we confirm  Presidential appointees by 51 votes.   There are three or four others, but I want to mention only one more  specifically: District Court Judge John McConnell, Jr., from Rhode  Island. There was an effort on this side of the aisle to deny him a  cloture vote. I resisted that. I talked to some other Republicans. I  voted for him for cloture. He got it 63 to 33. Then I voted against him  for judge.   The importance of that was if he had had his nomination blocked by  the cloture vote, he would have been the first Federal istrict judge in  the history of the court to not have been allowed to have an up-or-down  vote, majority vote. So I resisted that in that instance. I resisted  that for Perez. I may have been the deciding vote; there were only 60  votes.   While I said I am not looking for merit badges, where are the  Democrats who are willing to vote like that--to preserve the Senate's  230-year tradition of approving Presidential nominees by a majority  vote? I think this is a terrible precedent, not justified, and I am  sorry to see things heading in this direction.   Now I wish to make some remarks on another matter.   (The remarks of Mr. Alexander pertaining to the introduction of S.  761 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced  Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')    Mr. President, the Health Care Options Act of 2017,  introduced by Senator Corker and me, would address the emergency in the  health insurance exchanges in Tennessee and in other States. This  legislation would allow any American who receives a subsidy and has no  insurance available on their exchange next year to use that subsidy to  buy any State-approved insurance off the exchange.   Second, the legislation would waive the Affordable Care Act  requirement that these Americans--who, remember, have zero insurance  options for their subsidies--have to pay a penalty for not purchasing  the insurance.   Third, the legislation would bring peace of mind between now and the  beginning of 2018 to millions of Americans--some of the most vulnerable  people in our country--who face having zero options of health insurance  to purchase with their subsidy in the year 2018 because of the  collapsing ObamaCare exchange markets.   Here is why urgent action is needed. There are 11 million Americans  who buy individual insurance now on the Affordable Care Act exchanges.  Approximately 85 percent of them receive a subsidy to help them buy  insurance. For those who don't like subsidies for people buying  insurance, I would remind us that about 60 percent of insured Americans  get insurance on the job, and the average tax break for people with  employer sponsored insurance is about $5,000. What we are talking about  is the 4 percent of insured people who don't get insurance on the job,  who don't get it from the government and Medicare and Medicaid, and  this subsidy gives them some money to help them buy insurance if they  are mostly low income.   While these 11 million make up only 4 percent of the total insured  population in this country, this 4 percent is where much of today's  political turmoil rests.   In the Knoxville area where I live, the one remaining insurance  company on the Affordable Care Act exchange has pulled out for the year  2018. So it is a near certainty that there will be zero insurance  options for 40,000 Tennesseans who live there and buy their insurance  on the exchange. In other words, for approximately 34,000 Tennesseans  living in Knoxville who rely on an Affordable Care Act subsidy to buy  health insurance, their subsidies will be worth as much as a bus ticket  in a town with no buses running.   There is a real prospect that the same thing may happen to all  230,000 Tennesseans who buy insurance on the exchange. As I said, 85  percent of them rely on a subsidy to afford insurance; they just will  not have any insurance policies to buy.   The decision Friday by the House of Representatives to not vote on  the health care bill changes nothing about the urgency of rescuing  these 230,000 Tennesseans who buy insurance on the ObamaCare exchanges  that our State insurance commissioner has told us are ``very near  collapse.''   While Congress continues its work to enact long-term structural  health reforms, we must take immediate action to help these 230,000  Tennesseans and millions of Americans in other States facing the same  dire consequences.   This is not just a problem for Tennesseans. Last year, 7 percent of  counties in the country had just one insurer offering plans on their  Affordable Care Act exchange. This year, that 7 percent has risen to 32  percent of the counties in this country having just one insurer  offering plans on the Affordable Care Act exchange. There are five  States this year that have only a single insurer offering ACA plans in  their entire State--Alabama, Alaska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and  Wyoming. And in nine States, there is only one insurer offering ACA  plans in a majority of the  [[Page S2101]]  counties in the States: Tennessee, North Carolina, West Virginia, Utah,  Nevada, Arizona, Mississippi, Missouri, and Florida.   Next year, in 2018, we know the problem will be much worse. As more  insurance companies announce their plans for the 2018 plan year, it is  very likely that more counties across the Nation will face challenges  similar to those in the Knoxville, Tennessee, area, where, again,  having an ObamaCare subsidy will be as useful as having a bus ticket in  a town with no buses running.   Now, there is a solution to this. As I mentioned, the legislation  that Senator Corker and I are introducing will do three things: First,  it will allow Americans to use their Affordable Care Act subsidy--the  money they are getting now--to purchase any health insurance plan  outside of the exchange, as long as the insurance is approved by the  State for sale in the individual market. That means Americans on the  exchanges will have options to purchase insurance where the Affordable  Care Act has left them with none. This option will be given to  individuals who live in the counties where the Secretary of Health and  Human Services certifies that there are zero options on the ACA  exchange.   Second, when the Secretary certifies that there are zero insurance  options on the exchange, the legislation will waive the Affordable Care  Act's requirement to buy a specific health plan or pay a fine of as  much as $2,000 for a family of four. The law's individual mandate, in  other words, will not apply to these individuals. And, of course, it  shouldn't. They shouldn't be penalized for not buying insurance when  there is no insurance to buy.   The legislation's temporary authority would be in place only through  the end of the 2019 plan year.   Third, I hope that this legislation will provide some peace of mind  for those Knoxville area residents and Americans in counties across the  country trapped in collapsing exchanges.   This is not a permanent solution. Congress has a responsibility to  continue its work to solve this problem and to give more Americans more  choices of lower cost health insurance.   Long term, Americans should have the freedom to make their own  choices about their family's health care needs. But in the short term,  we must act on behalf of 230,000 Tennesseans, some of the most  vulnerable citizens in our State, and millions of other Americans in  other States who are likely to have zero choices of insurance in 2018.   Earlier this afternoon, the Tennessee insurance commissioner, Julie  Mix McPeak, who has testified before the Senate and made public  statements that the Tennessee Affordable Care Act exchanges were in  virtual collapse--what she means by that is no one will be selling  insurance in them--issued this statement in support of the bill that  Senator Corker and I have introduced. She said:         This bill ``would definitely be helpful for Tennessee       consumers. We are in favor of any legislation that improves       consumer choice and provides access for Tennesseans. It is       completely unacceptable for our consumers to have a subsidy       but no ability to purchase insurance on the exchange. We       support any option that avoids that result.''    I yield the floor.                                  ______                                         By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Wyden):   S. 762.
