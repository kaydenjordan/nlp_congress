 Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Trump administration released  its budget proposal for fiscal year 2021. It was titled ``A Budget for  America's Future,'' but its vision for that future is bleak.   Its vision of the future is the true American carnage that President  Trump described in his inaugural address. It envisions an America that  is less than it can or should be.   It envisions an America where working families are left to struggle  while the wealthy continue to prosper. Rather than expanding economic  opportunity to all, it would force families to choose between food and  other essentials by cutting nutrition assistance by $182 billion so  more children and more people would go hungry in America, the richest  nation on the face of the Earth.   It would completely eliminate the Community Development Block Grant,  which helps local communities keep millions out of poverty.   Rather than ensuring healthcare is accessible to all, this budget  cuts Medicaid by $900 billion and slashes Medicare by half a trillion  dollars, even though the President promised he would never touch the  program's funding from that podium just a few days ago.   It would also cut research into lifesaving cures at the National  Institutes of Health by $3.3 billion--penny-wise, pound-foolish. It  cuts the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by more than half a  billion dollars, at a moment when we need to protect our people against  the coronavirus and other public health threats.   Mr. Speaker, a true budget for America's future wouldn't increase the  cost of attending college, as this budget does, by cutting student loan  programs by $170 billion. The education of our young people is our  greatest investment in a successful future.   This budget discourages those who want to serve their communities by  eliminating the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. It would slash  the Department of Education's budget by $5.6 billion this year alone,  while eliminating after-school programs for kids. Kids would be less  safe, less educated.   Ignoring another of his pledges, this time on infrastructure,  President Trump's budget proposes cutting the Department of  Transportation by 13 percent this year and reducing funding for the  Army Corps of Engineers by 22 percent, both agencies that deal with  infrastructure.   It proposes a future devoid of innovation, as well, eliminating  several programs that fund and promote research and innovation to  support advanced manufacturing, new energy technologies, and  entrepreneurship. On all of those, the President's budget sounds the  trumpet of retreat.   This budget promotes a future that is less secure by reducing funding  for public diplomacy and foreign aid. For 3 years now, and in our  fourth year, our public diplomacy has been put at risk.   Moreover, this budget extends the 2017 tax cuts for the wealthy,  while once again asserting the debunked and discredited theory that the  tax cuts pay for themselves. They didn't do it in 1981; they didn't do  it in 2001 and 2003; and they haven't done it now.   The evidence is clear: The President's tax cuts for the wealthy did  not provide the trickle-down benefits that he promised or give our  economy the kind of boost he said that it would. Yet, the  administration is back again, promoting the notion that if we give tax  cuts for the wealthy one more try, they will produce growth well above  what every mainstream economist projects, period.    This budget is not a serious proposal, nor is it fiscally  sustainable. Budgets are about priorities. The priorities in this  budget, giving tax cuts to the wealthy while cutting the programs that  help working Americans get ahead, are the wrong priorities for our  Nation.   Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of talk about who is going to offer a  budget. The President has offered a budget, and we have offered a  budget. And that budget, Mr. Speaker, was incorporated in the  appropriations bills signed by the President of the United States.   We now have an agreement on what the level of discretionary  expenditures will be. So I want to tell my friends not only on the  Republican side of the aisle, but I want to tell everybody in America  that we have a budget. We have set forth our priorities, and those  priorities were in the bills that we passed last year and the President  signed.   The marginal increase in those is very, very small this year. That  was the deal that was made between Secretary Mnuchin and Speaker  Pelosi. We will pass our appropriations bills consistent with those  priorities that we have already articulated at the numbers agreed upon,  unlike the President of the United States who sent us a budget that  completely abandoned the agreement we made in July, just 8 months ago,  7 months ago.   What is the point of making an agreement if it is looked at as a  ceiling? It is like going and bargaining on a house and saying, ``I  will pay you $100,000,'' and then coming to the settlement table, and  saying, ``Well, I am really going to pay you $90,000. That $100,000 was  just a ceiling.''   Mr. Speaker, we are going to pass through this House and send to the  Senate appropriations bills that will represent the priorities of the  American people, and that budget will be for the people. I am hopeful  that, one more time, we can adopt those priorities, have them signed by  the President, and have no drama about shutting down government, as we  did not this past year. That is our responsibility. That is our duty to  the American people.                            ____________________
