 Mr. President, with all due respect to my colleague,  I strongly urge a ``no'' vote.   This amendment would create catastrophic damage throughout the  Federal economy, with spending cuts as much as 37 percent by 2028,  putting Federal programs like Medicare, Medicaid, border security, and  transportation into extremely difficult circumstances. This is not the  America that Americans expect, and we should not allow this vote to  pass.                          Vote on Amendment No. 107
