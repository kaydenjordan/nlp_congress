 Madam Speaker, I thank my friend from Washington  State.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle's efforts to create a  national policy that allows for terminating a pregnancy at any stage,  for any reason is not only extreme and outside of the mainstream of  America, it is wholly inconsistent with our values and the founding  principles of our great Nation.   This abortion on demand legislation taken together will put us in the  dubious company of the likes of China, North Korea, and only five other  countries that I guarantee you, Madam Speaker, do not have America's  values.   I commend the Supreme Court for restoring the integrity of the  Constitution and returning power back to the States and We the People.   God bless America, and God bless our fellow Americans both born and  unborn.                                time  1200
