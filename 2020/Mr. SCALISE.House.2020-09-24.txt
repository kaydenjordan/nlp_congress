 Mr. Speaker, normally, we would do the colloquy with the  majority leader. He and I will not be doing that this week, but I know  we do still have real concerns about those families and businesses that  are struggling today through these difficult times. Many of those  businesses were able to get relief through the Paycheck Protection  Program, a program that we all came together to get agreement on, to  help millions of small businesses. Over 50 million jobs were saved by  that program.   We also know there is about $138 billion still remaining in that  fund, but the fund has expired. So I want to bring attention to things  we can do together to alleviate that, to help those small businesses  with that remaining money, and to talk about that more.   Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Washington (Ms. Herrera  Beutler).    Request to Discharge Committee from Further Consideration of H.R. 8265     Mr. Speaker, we will still push the majority to put that  bill on the suspension calendar. We have no doubt it would pass  overwhelmingly. We will continue to fight for those small businesses.                            ____________________
