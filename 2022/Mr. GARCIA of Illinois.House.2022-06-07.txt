 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life  of Paulino Villarreal, Sr.   Paulino was a longtime city worker, community volunteer, loving  father, and a longtime Pilsen resident. He saw the children of his  neighborhood as an extension of his own, holding toy and school supply  drives to help them.   Paulino represented what the southwest side of Chicago is all about;  hard work, humility, and service to family and community.   Paulino left us with an important lesson: The people we help, the  helping hand we extend, is the legacy we leave behind.   Family and friends will remember him for his cheerful outlook on  life, his love for the Cowboys, and Tejano music. Above all, Paulino  will be remembered for his generosity and his love of service.   I express my deepest condolences to the Villarreal family.   Rest in peace, my friend.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I thank Representative  Spanberger for organizing this Special Order.   I, like the previous speakers, rise in support of the 340B drug  pricing program. This little-known program represents only about 3  percent of the total drug sales in our country, but it is one of the  most far-reaching health programs, especially for folks in my district.   Let me share a story of an elderly patient at Erie Family Health  Centers, which is based in my district. She had no insurance and  struggled to afford her diabetes medication. Sadly, this is far too  common in my district. The price jumped to $200, and she could not  access her pharmacy during the COVID-19 crisis. But thanks to the 340B  program, this patient now pays $9 for her medication, and it is  delivered for free, straight to her home.   This patient is not alone. Many Erie patients would not be able to  obtain their insulin without the 340B discount. Unfortunately, this  program is currently under assault on several fronts. We have to stand  up. And we must protect it.   Community health centers are under tremendous pressure to keep their  doors open while caring for the most impacted. The timing could not be  worse for pharmaceutical manufacturers to undermine such a critical  program. The 340B program provides lifesaving medication for nearly 1.5  million patients of Illinois community health centers as well as  housing, transportation, care management, and more.   We must defend this crucial program. It is literally a lifeline for  communities like mine.
