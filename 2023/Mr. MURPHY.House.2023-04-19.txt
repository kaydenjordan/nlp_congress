 Mr. Speaker, this evening, I will be talking on the  Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act.   I have been a physician now for over 30 years and have dealt with a  lot of different types of individuals, and there is a difference  medically between men and women. There is a difference biologically  between men and women. There is a difference chromosomally between men  and women. There is a difference genetically between men and women.   At age 5, it is an absolutely normal thing for young children to  question who they are. It is absolutely normal. We all go through that  phase. Sadly enough, our left colleagues now want to put pressure,  either from teachers, counselors, or whatever, that they may be  disillusioned, that they may not understand who they are, to try to  push them in one direction.   What has happened? We now have this huge conglomeration of  individuals who don't understand their biological sex. We have been  preached to by the left for 3 years, ``Follow the science. Follow the  science,'' even though the science was wrong.   Right now, they don't want to follow the science. It comes down to  the science of gender, and they refuse to allow that truth to be told.  They don't want to hear about the true biological and genetic  differences between XY and XX chromosomes.   As a physician, I can say there is an absolute genetic difference in  mitochondria, spindle cell formation, and everything else in a genetic  XY male from an XX female. It is how they develop.   Regardless of any type of hormonal manipulation, an XY male has a  competitive advantage over an XX female--period, point blank. It is  fact. It cannot be refuted.   Sadly enough, the left doesn't want to hear that. They want to push  the fact that the choice of a gender will get to decide a competitive  advantage. They want to trample over the rights of women and allow men  to compete in women's sports. It is an absolute absurdity.   I honestly cannot believe that this is an actual issue that we are  debating in the United States of America. It is common sense.   I won't point out any specifics, but what would happen if a male from  the NBA decided he wanted to compete in the WNBA? Would that be fair?  Absolutely not.   What would happen if somebody like Michael Phelps wanted to compete  in women's athletic sports, in swimming? It would be absolutely unfair,  but the left is not horrified if something like that would happen in  high school or college.  [[Page H1882]]    Ten years ago, I would say Democrats and Republicans would never have  dreamed we would be going down this path of lunacy, trying to erase  women's sports, that a young girl who at the age of 5 or 10 would be  competing so hard for her dream at age 18 or 22 to compete in the  Olympics for a gold medal or any other medal might have that taken away  by a biological male.   However, here we are. It is a sad state. It is time for the adults in  the room to bring common sense back to this country.   Now, I am not downgrading or denigrating the desire for those  individuals to compete in sports. I understand that, but what is fair  is fair. It is absolutely unfair for a biological male to compete  against a biological female in high school or any other type of sports.                                time  1830    We are bringing common sense and a sense of normalcy back to women's  sports and women's rights against the unscientific madness of the left.   Mr. Speaker, I would ask my colleagues to vote for the Protection of  Women and Girls in Sports Act.
