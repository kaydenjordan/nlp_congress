 Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Madam Speaker, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, is  a critical tool for thwarting terrorist plots and collecting vital  intelligence on actors who are hostile to U.S. interests.   During the FBI's 2016 Russia collusion investigation, however, FBI  officials grossly abused FISA to spy on an associate of a Presidential  campaign they opposed.   The purpose of the bill before us today is to reauthorize expiring  FISA authorities while ensuring that other  [[Page H1633]]  FISA tools can never again be turned against the American people for  political purposes.   In 2017, in the course of our own investigation on Russia, House  Intelligence Committee Republicans received strong indications that  FISA had been severely abused in order to spy on Carter Page, a former  associate of the Trump campaign.   As we investigated the matter, we were stonewalled at nearly every  juncture by top officials of the FBI and the Department of Justice.  Their denials of any wrongdoing were uniformly repeated by the media  and by political figures, who were spreading the false accusation that  Trump campaign officials colluded with the Russian Government to  interfere in the 2016 Presidential election.    Madam Speaker, I want to thank my Republican colleagues and staff on  the committee who persisted amid the most determined obstruction of any  investigation this House has seen in a long time.   I also want to thank our Republican colleagues on the House Oversight  and Judiciary Committees who worked hard to uncover the full extent of  this malfeasance.   The full scope of the abuse was eventually detailed by Inspector  General Michael Horowitz, whose December 2019 report revealed 17 major  mistakes and omissions, along with many lesser abuses.   Among many other abuses the Inspector General found, is that the FBI  had used unverified allegations from the Steele dossier to get a FISA  warrant on Carter Page; had misrepresented the reliability of those  allegations to the court; had omitted exculpatory information from  their submission; and had doctored an email to hide Page's prior  cooperation with a U.S. intelligence agency.   H.R. 6172 is the first step in imposing reforms to address these  gross abuses and restore accountability in the FISA process. These  reforms include but are not limited to:   Requiring the Attorney General's approval in order to obtain a FISA  warrant for any candidate for Federal office;   Imposing stronger penalties for those who conceal information from  the FISA court or leak FISA-derived information; and   Providing clear authorization for Congress to access FISA materials  so that elected officials can better oversee FISA cases without  obstruction.   This legislation makes strong reforms that will protect the American  people from government overreach while continuing to protect the  homeland from terrorist threats.   Close Congressional oversight of the FISA process, which will be  enhanced significantly by this bill, must continue in order to prevent  future abuses. What happened to the Trump campaign in 2016 can never be  allowed to happen again, not to a political campaign and not to an  American citizen.   I believe I speak for all Republicans when I say that our work is not  finished. We will continue to look for further ways to improve both  privacy protections as well as FISA's effectiveness in defusing  national security threats to our country.   Madam Speaker, I urge support of H.R. 6172, and I reserve the balance  of my time.    Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from  California (Mr. McCarthy), the Republican leader.    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Texas (Mr. Gohmert).    Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Utah (Mr. Stewart).    Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arkansas (Mr. Crawford).    Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Just a couple of comments for some of my colleagues who I know are  concerned that this doesn't go far enough.   One of the concerns they have is that there is an ongoing  investigation led by the U.S. attorney out of Connecticut, and there is  a lot of consternation on our side of the aisle that nothing has been  done yet.   I want to assure my colleagues that even if that gets to a point  where people are held accountable for what we believe to be criminal  activity, these reforms in this new piece of legislation where we  opened up title I, we believe that we have all the reforms that are  necessary to prevent this malfeasance from happening again in the  future.                                time  1615    If this doesn't work and if this does happen again, I think then you  will have what some people want, which is a complete elimination of the  court and this entire system.   I hope that we don't get to that point in this country, because these  tools have worked well as long as the people who are conducting and  using these surveillance capabilities don't decide to turn them on  political opponents.   So I want to, you know, assure my colleagues on this side of the  aisle that we feel like these reforms are as far as we need to go at  this time, no matter what the ultimate conclusion is of the U.S.  attorney out of Connecticut on whether or not to bring charges against  those who perpetrated these crimes and criminal activity.   Madam Speaker, I am prepared to close at this time.   In closing, the weaponization of FISA, as exhibited in 2016, should  never have happened, and this bill aims to prevent future gross abuses  from occurring again.   I would like to thank my staff, particularly Allen Souza, Laura  Casulli, Meghan Green, Andrew House, and Betsy Hulme, for all their  efforts to reach this bipartisan compromise. They worked many, many  hours with Members of both parties and colleagues of both parties,  staff of both parties, from the Judiciary Committee and the Republican  and Democratic leadership, to reach this bipartisan compromise.   I am also fairly confident, with the remarks that have been made on  the Senate side, that this will be a rare opportunity where we actually  pass a bill, and it appears like the Senate is prepared to accept a  complete House-produced product, which I think means a lot to everyone  involved in this process, that that rarely happens, especially in this  day and age.   Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of H.R. 6172, and I yield back the  balance of my time.
