 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge support  for H.R. 4684, the Ensuring Access to Quality Sober Living Act.   As we work to address our Nation's opioid crisis, it is important  that we address recovery, in addition to treatment and prevention.  Addiction is a lifelong condition. After seeking treatment, individuals  suffering from addiction need stable living environments, mental health  services, and peer support to maintain their sobriety. Recovery is what  this bill seeks to address.   I introduced this bill because of my constituent, Ryan Hampton. Ryan  was once a promising White House intern who was succeeding in college  and who had his whole life ahead of him. But in his early twenties, he  broke his knee hiking and was prescribed opiates for the pain. He soon  became dependent on prescription drugs. He was labeled a drug seeker  and was discharged from medical care.   Unfortunately, this did nothing to address his addiction. Without  seeing any other options, he turned to heroin. Within a few months,  Ryan was homeless and living on the streets. It wasn't until after he  overdosed that Ryan got the help he needed.   After he recovered, Ryan eventually was able to be in a treatment  center. He told me that he considered himself one of the lucky ones. By  the time I met Ryan, he was a year and a half sober and an active  advocate for the recovery community. He used his second chance to speak  on behalf of others battling this devastating addiction--people like  his friend, Tyler. Tyler was living in a sober living home, or a  recovery residence, when he died of a heroin overdose.   Sober homes are great a resource for those newly out of treatment.  They provide a safe and stable living environment to help people  transition back into their lives without addiction. Sober homes have an  added responsibility because the risk of overdose for those individuals  can be the highest while in recovery.   Unfortunately, some sober homes can be unequipped to handle at-risk  patients or do not employ staff with specialty training for individuals  in recovery. Sadly, some of these facilities are bad actors that do not  encourage recovery, but exploit vulnerable individuals recently  released from treatment in order to collect insurance payments.                                time  1500    For example, Tyler's home didn't have naloxone on site, which is a  drug that can counteract an overdose. Outraged and heartbroken, Ryan  came to me to seek a solution. People like Tyler, who do everything  right to get themselves sober, should know that they can trust the  sober living homes and others on whom they rely for support.   Together, we worked on a bill that I introduced to create best  practices as well as standards for sober living facilities. I cannot  express my pride enough when, just a few years after addiction forced  him onto the streets, Ryan appeared before Congress this spring to  testify in front of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health to  share his story and to encourage investment in recovery the way that we  are investing in prevention and treatment.   That is exactly what H.R. 4684 would do. It would allow the  Department of Health and Human Services to establish a set of best  practices that sober homes could adopt so that individuals in treatment  and their families can help differentiate the bad actors from the good.  These benchmarks would take into account existing standards developed  by the National Alliance for Recovery Residences, such as requiring  that all fees and charges be explained to residents and that naloxone  be available and accessible for use in emergency. As Ryan said in his  congressional testimony, not having naloxone on hand is like not having  lifeboats on a ship.   H.R. 4684 would also provide technical assistance to States that wish  to adopt or implement these standards so that the recovery community  has the support it needs.   Unfortunately, Tyler's story is not unique. I have heard from  advocates in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Missouri, Ohio, and countless  others who are concerned  [[Page H5038]]  for their friends and neighbors living in unregulated sober living  facilities. That is why I am so thrilled to have H.R. 4684 on the floor  here today. We need to stand behind those who have done the difficult  task of seeking and completing treatment and ensure that the homes in  which they live are able to meet their needs.   I would like to thank Representatives Ruiz, Walters, and Bilirakis  for joining me as original cosponsors of this bill and for supporting  it during their work on the Energy and Commerce Committee.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
