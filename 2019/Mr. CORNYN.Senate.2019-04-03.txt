 Mr. President, over the last 2 years, since the beginning  of the Trump administration, our Senate Democratic colleagues have  brought our work to a crawl over judicial and executive branch  nominees. It is as if they have frustration and surprise over the  election of President Trump in the first place and still haven't gotten  over it. This is another way in which they have sought to undermine the  administration--to deny the President the staff necessary to populate  the various executive branch Agencies as well as the judiciary.   The way you do that in the Senate is by stringing out the amount of  time it takes to confirm nominees who ordinarily would have been  confirmed by consent or by voice vote--certainly, not by taking 3 days  or so at a time to generate a confirmation. It is not because these  nominees are unqualified or even controversial; it is simply because  this is how the resistance operates at a time when President Trump is  President of the United States. These nominees are being used as a  weapon to slow the work of the Senate and, really, to deny us the floor  time in which to do other things that we might be doing that would be  beneficial to the American people, and they have been running this play  repeatedly over the last 2 years.   In February of 2018, President Trump nominated John Ryder to serve on  the board of the Tennessee Valley Authority. The work of the TVA is  undeniably important, but this isn't the sort of high-profile job that  typically leads to a contentious nomination. In fact, these board  positions are normally confirmed by voice vote.   Mr. Ryder was, by any account, well qualified for the job. He  received unanimous support from the committee of jurisdiction, the  Committee on Environment and Public Works. Under normal circumstances,  he would have been quickly confirmed by the entire Senate. Our  Democratic friends, instead, decided to delay and delay and delay some  more and forced the Senate to hold a cloture vote on the nominee, which  caused him to sit in limbo for 400 days.   I wonder how many Americans who want to serve their country in some  positions that require Senate confirmation can afford to put their  lives on hold and wait for 400 days or more just for the Senate to get  around to doing something that should be somewhat of a routine job.   With Mr. Ryder, in the end, the irony would almost be funny if it  were not so pathetic. Ultimately, he was confirmed by voice vote. For  400 days, we waited to achieve the result we all knew we were to have  all along if Mr. Ryder were to hang in there long enough. For 400 days,  the TVA waited for the vacancy to be filled without there being an end  in sight, and for 400 days, Mr. Ryder and his family waited and waited  and waited with uncertainty. Sadly, he is not alone. He is part of a  long list of nominees who have received similar mistreatment.   There is one Texan, a friend of mine, who had to wait even longer.  Susan Combs is a fourth-generation rancher from Big Bend who has led an  impressive career in both the public and private sectors and has gained  the respect of virtually every person who has crossed her path.   She served as a member of the Texas House of Representatives, then as  the first female agriculture commissioner of Texas, and later served as  the Texas comptroller of public accounts.   When she was nominated to be the Department of the Interior's  Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management and Budget, I was thrilled,  and I was happy to introduce her before her committee hearing. Less  than a month after she was nominated, Susan was unanimously approved by  the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Again, I was hopeful  that her nomination would sail through since it, clearly, was not a  controversial nomination. Unfortunately, that was not the case.   Here we are, 631 days later, and Susan Combs has still not been  confirmed. Again, it is not because she is not qualified for the job or  that she is a controversial nominee. Just the opposite is true. This is  simply the way our Democratic colleagues have sought to deal with  nominees from this President.   If Senate Democrats were delaying well-qualified nominees like Susan  to make sure they had adequate opportunity to debate their nominations,  we wouldn't have any disagreement with that, but we know, by their  actions, that they will stop at nothing to bring the work of this body  to a screeching halt, particularly during the time of the Trump  administration.   Over the last 2 years, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle  have forced votes on nominees who in previous years would have sailed  through the Senate. During President Trump's first 2 years, we held  more than five times the number of cloture votes on nominees as we did  during the same time for the last six Presidents combined. So to call  this unprecedented is not an exaggeration, and the long list of  vacancies is growing.   Our government is suffering, and the services that we provide to the  American people are being obstructed as well. The Senate's duty of  advice and consent is important, but it is not our only job. We have a  lot of other things we are supposed to do here, and they are falling by  the wayside while we try to work through these, largely,  noncontroversial judicial and executive branch nominees.   Unfortunately, our Democratic colleagues' delay tactics have brought  us to the point at which we really don't have many other options. We  have tried negotiations. We have been told they will be happy to limit  postcloture debate time but that, oh, by the way, they will not agree  to that unless it starts in the year 2021. This is hardly a principled  position. This is simply about resisting President Trump, his  administration, and this administration's ability to do the job the  President was elected to do.   What we have proposed is something that will not make nominations  easier to be confirmed. The process will be largely the same, and the  vote threshold will remain the same. It will simply keep us from  wasting valuable time that we should be spending on debating and voting  on other important policies, not widely supported nominees.   This certainly isn't as radical a change as many of our Democratic  colleagues are presenting it to be. In January of 2013, current  Majority Leader Schumer and then Majority Leader Harry Reid led the  charge to make similar changes in order to process President Obama's  nominees.   At that time, Republicans were in the minority. What did we do then?  Well, we weren't exactly fans of President Obama's, but he had just  been elected to his second term, and suffice it to say that while we  were hoping for a different outcome, we weren't about to obstruct his  ability to populate and staff the various Departments in the Federal  Government. We didn't obstruct nominees. We didn't sulk. We didn't try  to prevent the President  [[Page S2214]]  from filling these nominations throughout the entire government. This  is our government. In fact, we took the opposite approach. Along with  several of my Republican colleagues, I joined Democrats in voting for a  resolution that would speed up the consideration process for lower  level nominees.   I have to give Senator Alexander, the Senator from Tennessee, a lot  of credit for negotiating that in the first place. But it has now  expired, and we are back to the status quo before that temporary change  went into effect. Like the changes we are talking about today, it  didn't change the threshold for nominees; it just made the process a  little more efficient. It received votes from 78 Senators on a  bipartisan basis. So that is why it is a real head-scratcher that we  find ourselves where we are today. Unfortunately, I think we know what  the answer is. This is part of the anti-Trump resistance.  Unfortunately, it is not playing out just in social media or on TV; it  is playing out right here in the Senate--what used to be known as the  world's greatest deliberative body.   When our colleagues Senator Blunt, chairman of the Rules Committee,  and Senator Lankford of Oklahoma introduced this resolution, I was  surprised that our colleagues across the aisle wouldn't do what we did  back in 2013. Back then, all but one Member of the Democratic caucus  voted for the resolution--again, something very similar to what we are  proposing today--but yesterday, they refused to even proceed to debate  a similar change. They could have offered amendments. They could have  made changes to the resolution where they thought it fell short. But  no--their commitment to obstruction remains. It is clear they don't  really oppose the resolution; they oppose supporting a resolution under  the President of another party. Indeed, they oppose supporting this  resolution under President Trump.   When 78 Republicans voted for a similar change in 2013--as I said, we  didn't vote for President Obama, but we understood the importance of  protecting the Senate as an institution and allowing our valuable work  to continue on behalf of the American people. I wish our colleagues  across the aisle had that same commitment today.   Just as I supported this modest change in 2013, I will support it  again today. This will allow us to make meaningful progress in  confirming the long list of pending nominees without impeding our  ability to do our other work, like legislation.   In particular, there are four district court nominees from Texas I am  eager to get off the Senate calendar and on the Federal bench.   I yield the floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.
