 Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer amendment No. 32.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is simple and  straightforward. My amendment simply requires the administration to  submit their plan to increase oil and gas production on Federal lands  to the House Committees on Armed Services, Agriculture, and Energy and  Commerce and Natural Resources, as well as the Senate Committees on  Energy and Natural Resources, Environment and Public Works, Armed  Services, and Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.   This simple, good-governance amendment allows Congress to take back  its Article I authority in our system of checks and balances.   Without my amendment, the plan to bolster our domestic energy supply  will be filed away and never seen again. This amendment will provide  transparency for the administration to carry out its congressionally  authorized duty.   More than 55 percent of my Congressional District is Federal land and  accounts for nearly 44 percent of Colorado's natural gas production.  The underlying bill requires the administration to be responsible for  their actions. If Joe Biden and Secretary Granholm continue to dip into  the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, they must have a plan in place to  increase oil and gas production on land that has been locked up and  overregulated by the Federal Government. That plan should be submitted  to the congressional committees of jurisdiction.   By requiring the administration to submit its plan to the people's  House, we can provide important oversight as to how the administration  will carry out this plan and provide feedback.   On the Western Slope of Colorado, we have seen firsthand the harm  leftist policies have created in our communities, literally regulating  our communities into poverty. With the stroke of his pen, Joe Biden  unilaterally locked up Federal lands for oil and gas production and  development. Colorado's Western Slope used to have a booming energy  production economy. We used to have 112 drilling rigs on the Western  Slope, and now we have 4. These extreme leftist policies to lock up  land have driven away those good-paying jobs and have helped drive up  gas prices.   Congress needs to take back its power and advocate for the American  people they represent. My amendment will ensure those voices do not go  unheard and that we will hold the administration accountable for the  responsible energy plan required by this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from  Washington (Mrs. Rodgers).    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer amendment No. 33.    Mr. Chairman, this shouldn't be a controversial topic  and, my hope is that folks on both sides of the aisle will be able to  support this commonsense amendment.   House Democrats should support this amendment because it provides the  White House increased flexibility to tap more oil from the Strategic  Petroleum Reserve when necessary.   House Republicans should support this amendment because this modest 5  percent increase in flexibility for the SPR also allows a modest 5  percent increase to responsibly produce American energy on Federal  lands through the plan required by this bill.   Having said that, this amendment doesn't mandate increased energy  production. It just slightly modifies the cap. If the White House still  only wants to utilize 10 percent from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  and only wants the increase in Federal energy production on Federal  lands to be 10 percent, this amendment still allows that flexibility.   It is far past time we stopped begging foreign dictators to produce  oil and gas for America. America makes the cleanest energy in the  world. In fact, our natural gas is 42 percent cleaner than Russian  natural gas.   American innovation has allowed America to be the global leader in  reducing emissions since the year 2000. We should be producing the  energy Americans need right here in the good old U.S. of A. Yet, on  President Biden's watch, we have seen a 40 percent increase in gas  prices.   In order to help combat their significantly flawed energy strategy,  the White House raided the Strategic Petroleum Reserves by more than 40  percent.   My amendment prevents this type of abuse while slightly increasing  the amount of oil that can be drawn from the Strategic Petroleum  Reserve during an actual emergency like President Trump did.   The root causes of this record-breaking inflation were trillions of  dollars of wasteful spending federally and unnecessary attacks on  American energy. The Biden administration waged an all-out war on  American energy production. Biden shut down the Keystone XL pipeline on  day one of his administration, imposed new rules to block pipeline  projects, canceled oil and gas leases on millions of acres in Alaska  and the Gulf of Mexico, suspended oil drilling leases in a small sliver  of ANWR, even though Congress passed a law for this very purpose.                                time  1500    He imposed a moratorium on new Federal oil and gas leases on Federal  lands, failed to meet the statutory deadlines for quarterly lease  sales, and took countless other anti-energy measures that have  contributed to increased gas prices and inflation reaching record  levels.   The only reason oil and gas permits on Federal lands are being  approved at nearly the same rate during the Biden administration as  during the Trump administration is because of the permitting reforms  put in place by the Trump administration. In essence, they had a head  start.   This administration also likes to try and take credit for supporting  oil and gas production, but the reality is this occurred in spite of  them, not because of them.   In fact, much of this production has occurred on private lands where  producers aren't stifled by Federal policies and moratoriums.   In 2020, the National Ocean Industries Association found that Joe  Biden's proposal to ban new offshore oil and gas drilling in Federal  waters would kill approximately 200,000 jobs, cost the Federal  Government billions of dollars of revenue, and push production to  foreign adversaries.   Furthermore, and despite the exaggerations from the administration,  domestic production reached its highest point ever in 2020 while  President Donald J. Trump was in office with over 13 million barrels of  oil produced a day.   We all want clean air. We all want clean water. But we also want  lower gas prices and good-paying jobs right here in America.   We can have it all, as responsible energy production and conservation  are not mutually exclusive goals.   My amendment strikes the right balance. Again, it allows for  responsible emergency use of the Strategic Petroleum Reserves while  also allowing for responsible American energy production on Federal  lands.   Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this amendment, and I yield to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson).    I yield back the balance of my time.    =========================== NOTE ===========================        January 26, 2023, on page H369, in the third column, the  following appeared: Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. JOHNSON of  Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment even  though I am not opposed to it.  I  yield back the balance of my time.    ========================= END NOTE =========================       Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk, No. 137.    Mr. Chair, this amendment seeks to help provide a voice  for local communities who were ignored and cut out of the process in  October of last year when the Biden administration unilaterally locked  up nearly 300,000 acres in Colorado and in my district through the  stroke of a pen.   Shamefully, the Biden administration ignored the concerns and  opposition of impacted communities so he could appease Green New Deal  extremists through this executive overreach.   After the proposed land grab was announced, Kathleen Sgamma,  president of Western Energy Alliance, stated: ``The White House has  initiated a withdrawal for the Thompson Divide while advancing a false  narrative that energy development and land protection are mutually  exclusive.   ``Oil and natural gas activity has taken place in the Thompson Divide  area since the 1940s while conserving the land. We can do both: We can  develop energy while protecting the land.''   The area remains a vital resource and is located within the second  largest potential natural gas reserve in the United States.   ``There's no need to lock away public lands and minerals, especially  at a time of high energy prices.''   With gas prices skyrocketing again, and today's national average  exceeding $3.50 per gallon, it makes even less sense to unilaterally  lock up hundreds of thousands of acres from responsible energy  production, especially while local stakeholders are ignored and are  flatout opposed.   After the mineral withdrawal and associated national monument were  announced in October, the Ute Indian Tribe of Utah said: ``The White  House moved forward with a monument on our homelands without including  us. They talk about Tribal consultation, but their actions do not match  their words. We cannot support a monument on our homelands that does  not include the Tribe. It is a disgrace to our ancestors to exclude the  Tribe in the care and protection of these burial sites.''   Garfield County Commissioner Tom Jankovsky sent me an email just this  morning stating, ``President Biden unilaterally acted with an end run  around Congress. Rather than honoring the 10-year, hard-fought,  bipartisan support forged by local interests with Garfield County, the  President placed additional restrictions on future leasing in Thompson  Divide. This gutted the original bipartisan local support.''   My amendment requires the Secretary, as part of the plan required by  this bill, to identify areas for potential responsible energy leasing  within the second largest potential natural gas reserve in the United  States in an area where responsible oil and gas production has taken  place since the 1940s.   America produces the cleanest energy in the world. In fact, our  natural gas is 42 percent cleaner than Russian gas.   American innovation, in particular, fracking, has allowed America to  be the global leader in reducing emissions since 2000.                                time  1515    America should have never been dependent on Russia for significant  quantities of oil and gas. We need to stop begging OPEC, Venezuela, and  even Iran, to produce energy for us, and start producing more energy  responsibly right here in America, where our guys do it better than  anyone else, more responsibly, and cleaner.   We have to develop this right here at home, get back to American  energy independence, and pursue energy dominance.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
