 Mr. Speaker, these are challenging times for our country,  yet throughout our history, America has risen to every challenge. Today  is no different.   I thank our President, Donald Trump, for his strong leadership during  this crisis.   I don't like everything in this bill. While we kept out dangerous  provisions like union bailouts, the Green New Deal, and dangerous  election schemes, it still has items I don't agree with. And I worry  about the price tag.   However, families, hospitals, and small businesses need immediate  relief. I am talking about a small business in Concord where the owner  is doing his best but still had to furlough many of his 30 employees.  He told me he can put most of his employees back on the payroll using  the SBA 7(a) loan program in this bill.   It is workers and small businesses like this one that are counting on  this legislation.   It is not perfect, but I urge my colleagues to support this  legislation.
