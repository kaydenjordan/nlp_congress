 Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Chairman, as ranking member of the Interior, Environment, and  Related Agencies Subcommittee, I am deeply concerned about the  majority's lack of urgency to fund the government. The continuing  resolution expires in less than 3 weeks, but instead of getting to  work negotiating with the Senate on a full-year bill, we are wasting  time on bills that violate the terms of the Fiscal Responsibility Act  of 2023.    I strongly oppose the fiscal year 2024 Interior, Environment, and  Related Agencies appropriations bill. This harmful bill debilitates  America's ability to address the climate crisis and hobbles the  agencies within its jurisdiction.   It slashes funding for the Environmental Protection Agency by nearly  40 percent. That is nearly $4 billion less than we appropriated in  2023.   It also rescinds more than $7 billion of vital investments provided  by the Inflation Reduction Act for the United States to take immediate  economy-wide climate action. Climate change has reached a crisis point,  and experts agree that we must take bold action to avoid a major,  irreversible catastrophe.   In addition to the cut proposed by the State-Foreign Operations bill,  the Republicans' Interior bill virtually eliminates the greenhouse gas  reduction fund, which was established by the Inflation Reduction Act to  mitigate the costs of climate pollution through investment in low-and  zero-emission technologies.   The damage inflicted by this bill extends far beyond climate change.  The bill wipes out the environmental justice program and cuts $1.4  billion from the environmental and climate justice grants made possible  through the Inflation Reduction Act.   It curtails the progress that has been made to ensure that all people  are  [[Page H5244]]  equally protected from our environmental and health hazards. This bill  abandons our most vulnerable groups that currently bear a  disproportionate share of negative environmental impacts, which  includes large swaths of rural communities that I, and many of my  colleagues across the aisle, represent.   The bill also slashes funding for enforcement of the Clean Air Act  and Clean Water Act, which will enable polluters.   The cuts in this bill are so severe that even agencies that usually  garner bipartisan support are targeted for damaging reductions. Funding  for the National Park Service, for example, will be cut by 13 percent.   This bill also significantly reduces funding for the arts and  humanities agencies. The cuts to the Smithsonian Institution and  National Gallery of Art are so deep that they will be forced to reduce  the number of hours or days each week that the museums are open to the  public.   When our constituents bring their families to see our Nation's  Capital, I think all Members in this room expect they should have  access to these museums, but this bill takes that away.   The bill also fails our Nation's wildland firefighters. It does not  provide any of the funding requested by the administration to support  wildland firefighters and their families through better compensation,  safe housing, and health and well-being assistance. Without this  funding, firefighters will lose the compensation increases first  provided in the bipartisan infrastructure law.   Sadly, this bill also contains numerous discriminatory riders, as  well as an exhaustive list of anti-environment riders that seek to  derail any effort to combat climate change, and it undermines clean  water and clean air protections.   They give an open invitation to exploitive oil, gas, and mineral  leasing by blocking environmental regulations and even overriding  judicial review. At the same time, the bill suppresses clean energy  production. Clean, renewable energy is critical if we are going to save  our planet for future generations.   The majority of Americans support becoming carbon neutral by 2050,  and they support prioritizing the development of renewable energy  sources and preserving biodiversity for the benefit of future  generations. The austere and irresponsible cuts in this bill do not  align with their values.   Mr. Chairman, I thank Chair Simpson and Ranking Member DeLauro for  their tireless efforts on this committee. As Mr. Simpson mentioned, we  don't always agree on everything, but we have a chance to work well  together. I thank the staff on both sides of the aisle who work  tirelessly.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose this bill, and I urge my colleagues to oppose  this bill to protect the world we are leaving to our children and  grandchildren.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 6 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), who is the distinguished ranking member of  the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), who is the distinguished ranking member of  the Defense Subcommittee and the former chair of this subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), my good friend and the distinguished  ranking member of the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and  Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  Arizona (Mr. Grijalva), the distinguished ranking member of the Natural  Resources Committee and my good friend.    Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Arizona.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise to support this en bloc amendment,  which includes several noncontroversial amendments that we support.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the chair of this committee for  opposing the amendment.   As far as I am concerned, this amendment is extreme. It will not gain  bipartisan support and become law.   The draconian cuts proposed in this bill violate the agreement  reached by former Speaker McCarthy and President Biden that were  memorialized in statute in Public Law 118-5, the Fiscal Responsibility  Act of 2023.   We would not be teetering on the brink of government shutdown if my  Republican colleagues would hold up their end of the bargain.   As to this amendment, with the West reeling from the historic  megadrought, the worst in 1,200 years, why would any of my colleagues  want to hamstring the Bureau of Land Management from protecting our  public lands for the American public and future generations?   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment completely eliminates the  Council on Environmental Quality. This important office is responsible  for coordinating the Federal Government's efforts to improve, preserve,  and protect Americans' public health and the environment. These are  very important tasks.   It also works to ensure that environmental reviews for infrastructure  projects and Federal actions are thorough, efficient, and reflect the  input of the public and local communities.   This proposed amendment would hobble the office and result in  significant delays to infrastructure projects across the country at  exactly the wrong time.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Idaho  (Mr. Simpson), the committee chairman.    Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, once again, this is a terribly misguided  amendment to completely defund and eliminate the Council on  Environmental Quality. I appreciate the remarks by the chair that,  while in different administrations, we may feel differently about the  kinds of decisions or the tactic taken, but we understand the  importance of this particular agency, and defunding it would be  absolutely the wrong move.   I appreciate the gentleman who sponsored this amendment, his desire  to fund the national parks, and we have a way to do that. Just go  against the cuts that are made in this bill, vote against the Interior  Appropriations bill, and we will make sure that, in a future iteration  of this bill, we fully fund the national parks. I appreciate his  understanding the importance of making sure that funding is available.   As to this amendment, this is a bad amendment.   Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.                                time  1215     Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, let's just remember, we are here to protect  the welfare of the American public, and we cannot close our eyes to the  impacts of climate change: the drought, the flooding, the severe  storms, the wildfire events that we are experiencing. Climate change  has reached a crisis point, and we have to take bold action to avoid a  major irreversible catastrophe. That means we have to invest in  renewable energy.   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are proposing this  amendment that would focus all of BOEM's resources on conventional  energy. If my colleague from New Jersey wants to talk about the tragedy  of what could happen to our States--I represent Maine, and we care  about our beautiful coastline. We are worried about offshore oil  drilling and the fishermen's impact, the potential impact on tourism of  an oil spill, all of the things we have seen happen in other places.   We want to invest in the renewable and wind industry. To say it would  reduce our tourism industry down to zero is ludicrous. To say it would  do this to our fishing industry without careful management would be  ridiculous.   I have been to visit the countries of Norway and Denmark. I have  talked to the people from Scotland about their offshore wind projects.  It hasn't eliminated tourism or reduced their fishing industry. This is  misinformation made up because people want to stick to their dependence  on oil and gas and the things that we have to eliminate.   I oppose this amendment. It has nothing good about it. We should not  reduce the funding from the renewable energy programs, and we should  continue in the way that we are.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, this is another partisan amendment that  wastes more time on a bill that should go nowhere. Cutting $15,000 and  taking away the Cabinet Secretary's ability to host Tribal members and  other important dignitaries is just petty.   At a time when we are seeing record numbers of historic storms and  climate events, this is what my colleagues across the aisle have chosen  to care about?   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I want to be clear. I fully support hazardous  fuels reduction activities at the BLM. I am so sorry for the wildfires  that have occurred in Colorado and in so many other States across our  Nation.   I come from the most forested State in the Nation, the State of  Maine. We know how important good forest management is. We know how  important this is, but I absolutely do not support the offset.   The EPA has already been cut by 39 percent, and further cuts to its  core programs will only embolden polluters and weaken the safety of our  water and air.   We could easily fund both things, the EPA and forest management at  the Forest Service, if the majority had produced their bills at levels  that were agreed upon and passed into law in the Fiscal Responsibility  Act.   If my colleagues across the aisle are serious about managing  hazardous fuels at BLM, it would have been fully funded in the base  bill.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I want to address some of the same concerns  about this amendment as I did in the previous amendment.   To be clear, I fully support active forest management at the Forest  Service. I feel very bad about the wildfires that have occurred in  Colorado and so many other States across our country. I can't imagine  the devastation to a family who loses their home or a community that  finds the entire community leveled by a forest fire.   I am also very aware of the importance of managing our forests,  whether it is the timber sales or the great benefit we get from well- maintained forests. I come from the most forested State in the Nation.  Sustainable forest products and our wood products industry are  extremely important, and managing those forests is extremely important.   Mr. Chair, I cannot support this offset. The EPA has already been cut  by 39 percent. Further cuts to its core program will only embolden  polluters and weaken the safety of our water and air.   We can easily fund both things, the EPA and forest management at the  Forest Service, if only the majority had produced a bill at the level  that was agreed upon and passed into law by the Fiscal Responsibility  Act. If my colleagues across the aisle are serious about active forest  management at the Forest Service, it would have been fully funded in  the base bill.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, to be clear, I fully support all oversight  efforts and believe the mission of the inspectors general across  government is vital, but I disagree with the offset and the treatment  of the EPA in this bill generally.   In the base bill, the EPA is cut by nearly 40 percent. Every single  account is cut except for the Office of the Inspector General. Quite  frankly, the inspector general's office does pretty well under this  bill.   Cutting every single program at the EPA and seeking to increase  funding for only one office, which happens to be the oversight office,  is a clear attempt by the majority to politicize the inspector general,  and that is unacceptable.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I am pretty sure this is deja vu all over  again. I think we have already had an amendment to cut or eliminate the  Council on Environmental Quality. This one does it by cutting 36  percent.   This office is responsible for coordinating the Federal Government's  efforts to improve, preserve, and protect Americans' public health and  environment. It also works to ensure that environmental reviews for  infrastructure projects and Federal actions are thorough, efficient,  and reflect the input of the public and local communities.                                time  1300    This amendment would hobble the office and result in significant  delays to the very important infrastructure projects going on all  across this country.   We have debated this once already. This was a bad amendment then. It  is a bad amendment now. I oppose it, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, this amendment is back again. I think it  is still deja vu all over again because this is now the third time we  have taken up this amendment. It is to, once again, eliminate the  Council on Environmental Quality. We have a pending roll call on that  very exact question.   It just seems to me we have plenty to do around here. We have plenty  to do and are having a very busy day. We will have a very busy day  tomorrow, and we have very ambitious goals on the part of the majority  to pass through a lot of appropriations bills.   Why in the world would we have three of the same amendments?   I appreciate that different people wanted to give different  perspectives on it, but couldn't they all have spoken on the same  amendment?   I also would just say that a lot of my colleagues on this side of the  aisle had amendments that were eliminated and that weren't given a  chance to speak on the floor.   If the majority had just gone from three to one of these amendments,  they could have used the time for two more of my colleagues' amendments  and we could have had a little more Democratic debate, perhaps on  reinstating funding for the National Museum of the American Latino.  There were a lot  [[Page H5281]]  of good things we would like to see discussed under this bill.   Why in the world did the majority have to have us discuss this a  third time?   Mr. Chairman, I do want you to know I have my talking points. I can  say exactly the same things about why it is very arbitrary to eliminate  the Council on Environmental Quality, why the office is important in  establishing the Federal Government's efforts to improve, preserve, and  protect Americans' public health and environment, also to ensure that  environmental reviews for infrastructure projects and Federal actions  are thorough, efficient, and reflect the input of the public and local  communities, and I know you appreciate hearing that from me three  times.   Nevertheless, it just seems to me that if we were managing this floor  in a way that really made the best use of all our colleagues' time we  would either give a few more amendments to the Democratic minority or  we would just do this once, have one roll call, and give the majority  all a chance to speak on that particular bill and voice their opinion.   It is still a bad amendment. We will still oppose this amendment, and  we shouldn't be doing this at this particular time.   Once again, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, I am just so sad that we have to debate  this amendment to eliminate funding for the National Endowment for the  Arts.   The NEA is the Federal agency that funds, promotes, and strengthens  the creative capacity of our communities by providing all Americans-- that is all Americans--with diverse opportunities for arts  participation.   With the very small $186.3 million in this bill, the small but mighty  agency supports arts organizations and artists in every congressional  district in the country, and these investments yield enormous economic  benefits.   My colleague on the other side of the aisle says that he pays for his  own arts. He makes sure that his family has the arts opportunities and  that his children's art is paid for.   However, every community does not have the funding to pay for their  own arts. Not every community can afford arts and music in their  schools. They can't afford these opportunities. Yes, there is private- sector funding, but private-sector funding goes to where the private  sector wants it to be spent. It doesn't make sure that in rural States  like mine that small towns can take advantage of this and that small  arts organizations can have these opportunities.   A 2021 analysis done by the Department of Commerce and the NEA found  that arts and cultural industries add over $1 trillion to the U.S.  economy, support nearly 5 million jobs, and account for 4.4 percent of  the GDP--4.4 percent.  [[Page H5282]]    In what other sector wouldn't we make a lousy $186 million investment  in something that was going to add 4.4 percent to our GDP?   These guys would be all over it if it was auto manufacturing or chips  or something else.   The arts have an incredible value as a positive tool for economic  development, education, and community building. Defunding this  important agency would cause catastrophic harm. It is a terrible idea.   Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr.  Simpson), who is the chair of the committee.    Mr. Chair, to close, I appreciate the words of Mr.  Simpson, and I appreciate his acknowledgment that it is the rural  communities, whether in his State of Idaho or my State of Maine, where  there are so many communities that don't have the benefit of the  private funding, they don't have the benefit of wealthy parents who can  maybe afford to pay for their children's music and arts education.  These are communities that desperately depend on this money.   I also want to say that while there is a lot of economic growth going  on in the arts industry, that it is a huge contributor, that many of  these venues--particularly the small ones--were the first to have to  close their doors during the pandemic and the last to open, and many  haven't recovered.   Many people who work in the arts industry, many artists themselves  are still struggling to get back on their feet. That just makes this  funding even more critically important.   This is a great way to make sure that everyone in America has the  great educational benefit that all young people should have in arts and  music and developing that level of creativity and curiosity and the so  many wonderful educational benefits that we know come from having that  education in the arts. This makes sure that it is available to  everybody.   We are already facing a cut in this bill. We are going from $207  million--which was never enough; it ought to be at least a dollar per  person--down to $186 million. This cut has already been taken. We don't  need to do any more. Certainly, eliminating it would be a travesty.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time is remaining?    Mr. Chair, I would just reiterate that I oppose this  amendment that would defund the National Endowment for the Humanities.  I thank the chair for his eloquent remarks about the importance of it  in Idaho.   Idaho and Maine have a lot in common. Our potatoes are so much  better, but other than that, we really could see eye to eye on so many  issues. Sorry, I am sure their potatoes are perfectly fine.   This misguided amendment would significantly hinder support for high- quality projects and programs that reach every single State and  territory and benefit millions of Americans.   NEH is a very unique source of funding for a wide range of local,  nonprofit institutions and organizations across the country. This money  goes to our States and our local organizations. These grants strengthen  teaching and learning in the schools and colleges. They facilitate  research and original scholarship, provide opportunities for lifelong  learning, preserve and provide access to cultural and educational  resources, and strengthen the institutional base of the humanities.   My colleague on the other side of the aisle who proposed this  amendment says he doesn't really see the value of it and goes about to  disregard some of the programs that are being funded through this. The  fact is that sometimes we need to use literature, history, or the arts  to talk about difficult topics. You may not think it is important for  us to talk about climate change but, in fact, millions of young people,  in fact millions of people in this country, are very worried about that  and want to talk about it and think about how we can come with very  diverse ideas to a solution that works for all of us.   The same with our diversity and equity issues. These are tough  topics, and my colleague on the other side of the aisle would just have  them eliminated, sweep them under the rug. Yet, we have the opportunity  to use our great literature and the history of this country and the  lessons that we have learned to have those conversations.   I don't know what planet this amendment comes from; someplace where  these issues aren't important. Here they are very important. These  programs are used by American veterans, by American senior citizens,  and young people in our schools. They are so widely used in large and  small communities, and they are good investments in our communities.  These awards stimulate significant participation and commitment by  local and private partners. They generate more money to do exactly what  we are doing, so we should be doing more for the NEH, not less.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this misguided amendment.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment is one more controversial  poison pill rider that sadly shows that the extreme Republicans are not  interested in bills that can gain bipartisan support and become law.   In 2012, before the Bush tax cuts, the Congressional Budget Office  showed revenues exceeding primary spending for the next 65 years and  that debt as a percent of GDP would decline indefinitely.   Since then, tax cut extensions and the Trump tax cuts have added $10  trillion to the debt to date, and their cost will increase enough over  time to account for the entire long-term growth in debt ratio.  Remember, those benefits are disproportionately enjoyed by the wealthy.   If we want to truly protect the American taxpayer, we should be  marking up bills at the levels agreed to between the President and  Speaker McCarthy and signed into law in the Fiscal Responsibility Act  rather than bringing the government to the verge of a shutdown and now  marking up bills that just don't just break the deal but obliterate it  and cut crucial domestic investments.   Let's get serious about passing bills that can gain bipartisan  support and become law.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote against this harmful  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would prohibit all funds to  the United States Board on Geographic Names. The U.S. Board on  Geographic Names is a Federal body created in 1890 and established in  its present form by public law in 1947 to maintain uniform geographic  name usage throughout the Federal Government. The Board is comprised of  representatives of Federal agencies concerned with geographic  information, population, ecology, and management of public lands.   In this age of geographic information systems, the internet, and  homeland defense, geographic names data are even more important. The  Board works with Federal, State, Tribal, and local agencies, and more  than 50 nations have some type of national names authority.   My Republican colleagues should be focused on creating bills that  will garner bipartisan support and become law, not prohibiting funding  for a board that helps surveyors, mapmakers, and scientists, and serves  the Federal Government and the public as a central authority to which  name problems, name inquiries, name changes, and new name proposals can  be directed.   I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I am not an authority on this, but my  understanding is that the Federal Government could not rename a town in  a State. The Federal Government has authority on public lands on names  that are related to public property.   I am very pleased that we have Secretary Deb Haaland as the Secretary  of Interior right now, and I respect the fact that we have someone, for  the first time ever, who is a member of a Tribe. Secretary Haaland has  made a statement that using the word ``squaw'' is offensive to Native  American Tribes, and I fully agree with her, and many people in my own  State agree with her and have changed those names, but, in this  particular case, I don't believe that the Department of the Interior  can arbitrarily rename a town in any State in the Nation.   Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would prohibit the use of any  Federal funds to establish or modify any national monuments under the  Antiquities Act within Colusa County, California. Now, I am very sorry  that my colleague on the other side of the aisle feels this way. I  appreciate being able to serve on the Agriculture Committee with him.  We often have areas on agreement, but on this, we disagree.   The Antiquities Act provides the President with the authority to  designate national monuments in order to protect the objects of  historic or scientific interest. This amendment inappropriately  restricts the President's ability to declare a national monument in  specific parts of the country. Both Republican and Democratic  Presidents have used this authority to increase the protection of  special Federal lands.   In our State, we are particularly pleased that a previous President  declared the Katahdin Woods and Waters as a national monument. And we  are very glad about the way it has been managed and the fact that it is  an important resource to our State. This bill would go against 100  years of American tradition to protect the Nation's cultural and  natural resources. The Antiquities Act represents an important  achievement in the progress of conservation and preservation efforts in  the United States. Congress should not stand in the way of these  achievements.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would block New York City from  completing the terms of its lease agreement with the National Park  Service, and it offers no solution for those seeking refuge.   This amendment would put up yet another obstacle for the residents of  New York City as they try to address this unique challenge.   We should be looking for ways to help both residents of the city and  the migrants as they navigate the often complicated and lengthy  immigration process.   I know a little something about this challenge the cities are facing  because while I don't represent New York City, I represent Portland,  Maine, and other cities in Maine that have had a large influx of  asylees coming to our State. Now, we are a very welcoming State, but we  have some of the same challenges with finding sufficient housing for  people while they are navigating this difficult process of asylum  seeking.   Now let's just remember, we are a welcoming nation. Asylum seekers  are coming from war-torn countries, from political challenges, and the  process of seeking asylum can take a very long time. In my State, we  have some of the same challenges trying to find sufficient housing.   I want to say that we can't forget the fact that, again, we are a  welcoming nation. We are a welcoming State, and we are a nation of  immigrants.   I don't know about my colleague across the aisle, but I am very  fortunate that my grandfather had the opportunity to come to this  country. And that allowed my family to be a part of the American Dream.   So many of the people who are coming here today are leaving, as I  said, difficult political situations, war-torn nations, with real  challenges to get here. Our immigration process is lengthy. They are,  for the most part, legal asylum seekers. They need to go through a long  court process.   If, in fact, she really wanted to do something that would  significantly change the amount of time that people have to be in  shelters or in housing, perhaps--I know it is on another bill--she  could support my bill to reduce the amount of time that asylum seekers  have to wait to get their work permits so that they could more rapidly  go to work, so that they weren't waiting in shelters, in tents, in  other places.   I don't know about your State, but in mine our chamber of commerce is  constantly asking for more workers. We are constantly behind in having  sufficient people to do the work. So to say that we do not want to  welcome these people who come from war-torn nations and difficult  political situations, and that we don't want to find a way to  accommodate them, we should be looking for ways to speed up the process  to make sure that people can go to work, and so that they can make sure  that they can move forward and become those extremely responsible and  hardworking members of American society that they choose to be.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I am very sorry. I fully sympathize with the  city of New York and the many challenges they are facing in managing  this influx of people.   As I have said, I have had numerous conversations, whether it is the  mayor of my own city of Portland or the city council or the many people  who are working hard in social service agencies to make sure that we  continue to be a welcoming country; that the asylum seekers who are  legally in our country but waiting for the long process of their asylum  application to be approved or denied, to get through that process, that  they require housing.  [[Page H5290]]    I will just say a couple of things. I am sorry also that New York  City recently had to experience the foot of water, but I encourage my  colleagues to stop opposing measures to reduce the impact of climate  change. Once again, they are turning their head at the things that are  going to continue to happen more and more to some of our biggest cities  in the country and rural areas, as well.   I also recommend that people don't have to stay in shelters for so  long if we would only let them go to work. We have a provision for  asylum seekers to get a work permit, but right now it takes 180 days.  Why not just shorten it down to 30 days. When you are concerned about  the cost of this and the cost of people going to work, we can make sure  they go to work. I have talked to so many asylum seekers and their  families. They are so anxious to go to work, and we have a worker  shortage. This is one thing it seems like we could agree upon on both  sides of the aisle.   I have no idea if you block this particular park in New York City,  what you are going to do to solve this problem. This seems to me like  just a mean-spirited attempt to try to turn away people who have  nowhere else to turn, who are anxious to become workers in our society,  and who need to go through a lengthy process. We could shorten that  process.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would allow those who pollute  the Chesapeake Bay to ignore the Environmental Protection Agency's  water quality standards.   Restoring the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed continues to be a  priority. The EPA established mandatory water quality standards, and  Congress has approved over $1 billion for the Chesapeake Bay program to  help States, localities, and businesses meet those standards. This  amendment would jeopardize that funding and have devastating effects on  the health of the bay.   This amendment is not about the well-being of Virginia, Maryland, and  the surrounding States. It is about the fact that some industrial  operators don't think they should be responsible for controlling the  pollution they dump into our rivers and streams across the country.   The courts have sided with the EPA on this matter.   For more than 35 years, the regional partnership created through the  Chesapeake Bay program has sought to restore and protect the Nation's  largest and most productive estuary.   This amendment would undermine decades of work and have lasting  damaging effects to the health of the bay and the economy that it  supports.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, nature is declining globally at rates  unprecedented in human history. More than 1 million species are  currently threatened with extinction, many within decades.   This amendment seeks to legislate species status rather than  providing species with the protections they are afforded under the  Endangered Species Act, our principle conservation law, and would  potentially increase litigation regarding the government's  responsibility to implement the statutory requirements of the  Endangered Species Act.   Once again, my Republican colleagues are disregarding the law. We can  have a legitimate debate on how to best manage our border and how to  handle these issues, but that belongs in the Homeland Security bill and  not here under this and not talking about the Endangered Species Act.   The best available scientific and commercial information--not  politics--should determine whether a species is listed as threatened or  endangered. This amendment circumvents the rigorous process that is in  place to make these determinations, as well as the role of public  input.   Historical range for these species was throughout the mainstem Rio  Grande and select major tributaries in Texas and Mexico but today have  been reduced to a single population that occupies only a fraction of  this area.   Human activities that threaten and diminish animal habitats, pollute  nature, and accelerate global warming are driving species extinction  and creating unhealthy ecosystems.   When we lose a species, impacts reverberate throughout ecosystems and  we all suffer because our economy, health, livelihoods, food security,  and quality of life all depend on healthy ecosystems.                                time  1430    Defunding the Service's ability to list species would work against  the clear intent of the Endangered Species Act and would further  litigation by outside groups on both sides.   It would also undercut the Service's ability to work collaboratively  with Tribes, other Federal agencies, States, local communities, and  landowners to conserve this species.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and protect  vulnerable species so future generations benefit from a world with  healthy ecosystems and robust biodiversity.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would bar the use of any  Federal funds to create national monuments under the Antiquities Act in  Malheur County, Oregon.   The Antiquities Act provides the President with the authority to  designate national monuments in order to protect objects of historic or  scientific interest. This amendment inappropriately restricts the  President's ability to declare national monuments in specific parts of  the country.   Both Republican and Democratic Presidents have used this authority to  increase protection of special Federal lands. It goes against 100 years  of American tradition to protect the Nation's cultural and natural  resources.   The Antiquities Act represents an important achievement in the  progress of conservation and preservation efforts in the United States.  Congress should not stand in the way of these achievements.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment is petty and punitive. Rather  than pursuing grudges against public servants and spewing inaccurate  and disrespectful information, my colleagues across the aisle should  focus their energy on negotiating with the Senate on a bill to fund the  government.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, the Endangered Species Act is the Nation's  principle conservation law whose ultimate goals include preventing the  extinction of species and providing for their recovery.   On June 4, 2021, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Marine Fisheries  Service announced a plan to improve and strengthen implementation of  the Endangered Species Act to address 21st century conservation  challenges.   These agencies are proposing to revise three final rules issued in  2019 under the previous administration that do not adequately guide the  implementation of the Endangered Species Act. The proposed revisions  are intended to improve and clarify the interagency consultation  processes; listing, delisting, and reclassification decisions; and  designation of critical habitat.   Why would anyone object to making regulations clearer, more  straightforward, or improving implementation of the Endangered Species  Act?   The Services also proposed to reinstate the 4(d) blanket rule options  for protecting and conserving threatened species. Remember, Mr. Chair,  providing a suite of protections for threatened species will help it  avoid becoming an endangered species.   These proposed rules are now subject to public review and comment,  and the Services will carefully consider the comments they receive  before finalizing any changes.   The proposed revisions do not alter the standards for making listing  and delisting decisions, nor will they automatically lead to an  increase or decrease in the total amount or area of  [[Page H5294]]  critical habitat that is designated. These decisions will still depend  on the Services using the best scientific information available.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to consider how these revisions will  make ESA regulations more consistent and efficient, and to reject this  amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, we are now only 15 days away from a  government shutdown, and instead of focusing on keeping the government  open, we are working on a bill that is going nowhere.   The draconian cuts proposed in this bill violate the agreement  reached by former Speaker McCarthy and President Biden and that were  memorialized in statute in Public Law 118-5, the Fiscal Responsibility  Act of 2023. We would not be teetering on the brink of a government  shutdown if my Republican colleagues had held up their end of the  bargain.   We are here to protect the welfare of the American public, and we  cannot close our eyes to the impacts of climate change, such as the  drought, flooding, severe storm, and wildfire events we are  experiencing. As of October 10, the United States has experienced 24  confirmed weather/climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1  billion each. This is a new record.   This amendment seeks to prohibit funding for the Bureau of Land  Management to finalize, implement, or enforce a Draft Resource  Management Plan and draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement  that would remove 1.6 million acres of public lands in Colorado from  future oil and gas leasing. These lands do not have high oil and gas  potential, and BLM's actions would protect the important wildlife  habitat, recreation areas, and water resources, as well as reduce  emissions and the impacts of climate change.   Not investing in strategies that minimize and prevent the  acceleration of climate change and instead paying billions in disaster  relief shows my Republican colleagues are not thinking  [[Page H5295]]  about what is best for the American taxpayer.   Our economy, health, livelihoods, food security, and quality of life  all depend on healthy ecosystems.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and focus  instead on addressing climate change and making our Nation stronger,  and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1500     Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment is one more controversial  poison pill policy rider that sadly shows extremist Republicans are not  interested in bills that can gain bipartisan support and become law.   The proposed rule on fluid mineral leases and the leasing process  aims to enhance the administration of oil and gas-related activities on  America's public lands and reflects provisions in recently enacted laws  that modify aspects of the Federal onshore oil and gas program whose  regulations have not been updated since 1988. However, this amendment  seeks to prohibit that.   Once again, my Republican colleagues are disregarding the law. This  amendment circumvents the rigorous process that is in place to update  outdated regulations, which includes opportunities for public input,  protects the fiscal interests of the American public, and ensures  proper stewardship of public lands and resources for the benefit of  future generations.   The Government Accountability Office and the Department of the  Interior's Office of Inspector General have conducted audits of the  BLM's Federal onshore oil and gas program and highlighted weaknesses  that BLM needs to correct to ensure the American public receives a fair  return from oil and gas activities on public lands.   I do not understand why my Republican colleagues would seek to  undermine the efforts that address those weaknesses and protect the  American public. I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment to  protect the fiscal interests of the American public and our natural  resources so future generations benefit from a world with healthy  ecosystems and robust biodiversity.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would block the Department of  the Interior from its Bicycle Subsidy Benefit Program, which encourages  Federal employees to use bicycles to commute to the office. Not unlike  many wellness programs that are available in the public and private  sector, this is a good idea for the fresh air, for personal health, for  a whole host of reasons. It is also good for the environment. More of  us should be on bicycles instead of occupying a car to commute back and  forth to work.   The Department created this program in response to a 1993 law in  which Congress authorizes each agency head to establish a program to  encourage employees to use means other than single-occupancy motor  vehicles to commute to and from work. It is a governmentwide program,  and this amendment unfairly targets Interior employees.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to treat all employees fairly and  reject this amendment. I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would prohibit the EPA from  hiring scientists using its title 42 authority. Title 42 authority is a  flexible hiring mechanism that allows agencies to attract and retain  staff with outstanding scientific, technical, and clinical skills.   The authority is used by the EPA, CDC, NIH, and other agencies that  require candidates to have specialized degrees in areas such as  medicine, science, and engineering.   It is not always easy for the Federal Government to attract high- level professionals who have invested many years in school and can  easily make more in private practice or even in academia. That is why  the Federal Government allows these agencies to provide some additional  funding to retain or recruit these employees.   Mr. Chair, I am dismayed that the gentleman does not believe such  highly specialized employees deserve title 42 recognition.   With our Nation facing crises like COVID and climate change, we  should be investing in our scientists. It is a shortsighted amendment  that unfairly attacks Federal employees who devote their lives to  public service.   Mr. Chair, I urge the defeat of this amendment, and I reserve the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr.  Simpson), the chair of the committee.    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chairman, we are now only 15 days away from a  government shutdown, and instead of focusing on keeping the government  open, we are working on a bill that is going nowhere.   The draconian cuts proposed in this bill violate the agreement  reached by former Speaker McCarthy and President Biden that were  memorialized in statute in Public Law 118-5, the Fiscal Responsibility  Act of 2023.   We would not be teetering on the brink of a government shutdown if my  Republican colleagues had held up their end of the bargain.   Furthermore, we are here to protect the welfare of the American  public. We cannot close our eyes to the impacts of climate change, such  as the drought, flooding, severe storms, and wildfire events we are  experiencing.   As of October 10, the United States has experienced 24 confirmed  weather climate disaster events with losses exceeding $1 billion each.  This is a new record.   This amendment seeks to prohibit funding to further understand  greenhouse gases, which will result in more resilient communities,  mitigate the impacts of climate change, and protect our world for  future generations.   Not investing in strategies that minimize and prevent the  acceleration of climate change and instead paying billions in disaster  relief shows my Republican colleagues are not thinking about what is  best for the American  [[Page H5316]]  taxpayer. Our economy, health, livelihoods, food security, and quality  of life all depend on healthy ecosystems.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and focus  instead on addressing climate change and making our Nation stronger.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I will point out one thing that my  colleague said in what I thought was a very misguided argument.    He said the benefits of using our resources outweigh the costs. He  said we ignore the benefits of fossil fuels by only focusing on rising  temperatures and that this is our agenda. I want to be perfectly clear.  Climate change is not my agenda. It is not the Democrats' agenda. It is  the majority of all scientists' agenda around the world. It is the  majority of facts based on what is going on with adverse weather,  warming oceans, warming temperatures, and the hottest summer on record.   To say we are just looking at our agenda completely denies the  challenges that we are facing today. There are plenty of benefits of  fossil fuels. In fact, we have benefited from fossil fuels for  generations. We have become an incredibly wealthy Nation. I don't deny  that.   For all of us, we would rather continue with the status quo, but the  fact is that we know how to create renewable energy, how to reduce our  dependence on fossil fuels, and how to reduce the warming of our  planet. It is our responsibility. It is not an agenda or sort of a whim  or a fad. It is our responsibility.   That is what we are here to do, to protect the American public, to  protect it for future generations.   I don't know about my colleague, but I have three children and seven  grandchildren. Each one of those grandchildren, if not today, if not  tomorrow, then when they are old enough to talk, are going to say:  Grandma, what were you doing when the planet was melting? What did you  do when you had the resources, ability, and scientific knowledge to  convert to renewable resources? Yet, you decided to say: I am just  going to stick my head in the sand and pretend the science doesn't  exist. I am going to pretend that none of this matters and is some kind  of an agenda or a fluke. I am just going to put my faith in the fossil  fuel industry.   We know what to do here and know what our responsibility is here. To  neglect that and not continue to do what we are supposed to do to  reduce the impact and mitigate the influence of climate change is  completely going against our responsibility to the American public and  to future generations.   Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to reject this amendment. I ask my  colleagues to continue to support the work that we are currently doing  in this country to mitigate the impact of climate change.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, this amendment blocks an executive order that  seeks to reestablish the Federal Government as a leader in  sustainability and improve the Nation's preparedness and resilience to  the effects of a changing climate.   We are here to protect the welfare of the American public, and we  cannot close our eyes to the impacts of climate change such as the  drought, flooding, severe storm, and wildfire events we are  experiencing.  [[Page H5317]]    The Federal Government is the single largest landowner, energy  consumer, and employer in the Nation, and it is appropriate that it  would lead the Nation on a path to achieving net zero emissions by  transforming how the government builds, buys, and manages electricity,  vehicles, buildings, and other operations to be clean and sustainable.   Not investing in strategies that minimize and prevent the  acceleration of climate change and instead paying billions into  disaster relief shows my Republican colleagues are not thinking about  what is best for the American taxpayer.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and focus  instead on addressing climate change and making our Nation stronger,  and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I want to be clear. Congressional funding and  inclusion in the annual appropriations bill is congressional oversight  of the EPA. That is what Chairman Simpson, I, and the other members of  the committee do every year so there is oversight of the EPA, and it is  congressionally authorized funding.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment. My colleague  proposes that we don't allow the cancellation of lease sales in a  pristine environment that is already suffering from the impacts of  climate change. The Arctic is warming more than twice as fast as the  rest of the planet.   It shows that my Republican colleague and so many others are not  thinking about what is best for the American taxpayer. He should be  focused, instead, on investing in strategies that minimize and prevent  the acceleration of climate change.   He invoked one of my favorite colleagues, our dear departed colleague  Don Young. I remember several years ago when Don Young came to visit me  in Maine to an Arctic conference, and we discussed climate change. He  said: I haven't decided yet if this is man-made, but I do believe  climate change is happening.   None of us can expect to share the words of Don Young, who is not  with us here today, but I think he witnessed the warming that is going  on in the Arctic in his State, the glacial melting.   I recently visited Alaska, and I met with Tribal communities. There  are 31 communities, most of them Tribal communities, that currently  have to be moved because of the glacial melting, because of the  permafrost melting. The cost of that, I have heard some people  estimate, is about a million dollars a person to move a community, not  to mention the cultural loss, the economic loss.   The challenges that people are facing, what is going on in the Arctic  today is unfathomable. Nothing we could have ever predicted. Nothing  that the scientists could have predicted. Yet, my colleague wants us to  continue drilling for oil. My colleague wants us to deny the importance  of renewable energy.   We are talking about an area where it is expensive to drill. The fact  is, most of the oil companies don't often want to be up there anymore,  and it is not practical for us to be drilling for oil. To be doing it  in the very places that are experiencing the losses because of climate  change in such an extreme way makes absolutely no sense.   It is a misguided policy. To go against this cancellation of these  lease sales is wrong. I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and  focus instead on addressing climate change, making our Nation stronger,  and investing in renewable energy.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, once again, I remind everyone, we are here to  protect the welfare of the American public. This amendment would  prohibit the Bureau of Land Management from balancing oil and gas  development with protection of lands that harbor significant  subsistence uses and resources throughout the National Petroleum  Reserve in Alaska.   My colleague is describing the Willow Project, an oil drilling  project by ConocoPhillips that is located on the plain of the North  Slope of Alaska in the National Petroleum Reserve. This amendment would  prohibit the administration from stopping that project for all of the  reasons we have previously discussed.   My colleagues are always talking about if we don't do this drilling,  if we don't do this drilling in significantly critical areas like the  North Slope of Alaska, like places where climate change is already  having an unreasonable impact, we will have to go to untrustworthy  foreign sources. Why is it they always use that argument, that somehow  we have to go to untrustworthy foreign sources? Our goal is to convert  to renewable energy, to have all American energy, whether it is wind or  solar or tile or so many of the other opportunities that we have out  there to make sure we do invest in America and American jobs instead of  misguided projects like this.   This amendment also prohibits the BLM's ability to respond to  changing conditions in the Arctic while providing transparency and  conservation and development decisions.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I have just one more thing to say about this  project, just to know what we are talking about. It is not a  hypothetical. As we have mentioned, we have already talked about the  excessive warming that is happening in the Arctic, the changes they are  already experiencing in places like Alaska. This project is likely to  produce 287 million tons of carbon emissions plus other greenhouse  gases over 30 years. It would adversely impact Arctic wildlife and  Native American communities. This would damage the complex local tundra  ecosystem. According to another government estimate, it would release  the same amount of greenhouse gases annually as half a million homes.   We know how to do this in another way. We don't have to do this  project. We don't have to drill for oil in sensitive areas, and we  don't need to do this particular project.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to this amendment.  [[Page H5320]]     Mr. Chair, I am opposed to this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment is petty and punitive.   Rather than pursuing grudges against public servants, my colleagues  across the aisle should focus their energy on negotiating with the  Senate on a bill to fund the government.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment prohibits the withdrawal for  20 years of public lands surrounding the Chaco Culture National  Historical Park from mineral leasing in order to protect these lands  and the greater connected landscape in New Mexico with a rich Puebloan  and Tribal nation legacy from the impacts associated with oil and gas  development activities.  [[Page H5321]]    It does not impact valid existing rights nor non-Federal interests in  the area that will be withdrawn.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I yield  the balance of my time to the gentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Leger  Fernandez).    Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I am pleased to see my good friend on the  other side of the aisle, and sorry that I so violently disagree with  him on this particular issue, maybe not violently, but strongly  disagree with him on this issue.   This amendment seeks to force the Secretary of the Interior to issue  more oil and gas lease sales instead of allowing for the transition to  clean energy that will result in more resilient communities, mitigate  the impacts of climate change, and protect our world for future  generations.   To not invest in strategies that minimize and prevent the  acceleration of climate change instead of paying billions in disaster  relief shows that my colleague is not thinking about what is best for  the American taxpayer. Our economy and health and livelihood, food  security, quality of life all depend on us making progress on climate  change and renewable energies.   I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, my colleagues are always saying we have to  reduce our dependence on foreign oil, and I wholeheartedly agree. In  fact, the United States is still a major producer of oil and gas, but  we have to make the investments and force ourselves to move forward on  renewable energy.   We have done that through bills like the IRA. We continue to do that,  and I just want to continue to support that and make sure that we are  opposing expanding our oil and gas leases and just investing in  renewable energy.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.  [[Page H5323]]     Mr. Chair, this amendment seeks to block air quality  monitoring. So often, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  start their speeches by saying, We believe in clean air, we believe in  clean water, but apparently they don't, and certainly, in this case,  this amendment does not.   Now, I come from a State with one of the highest rates of asthma.  Asthma is directly attributed to not having clean air. One in nine  people in Maine is experiencing asthma. Those are children. Those are  adults. Those are people who have serious health impacts because of  that, so why we would ever deny the opportunity to do more air quality  monitoring to make sure our citizens are safe, to make sure our  children don't have asthma, it is just beyond me.   I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, I appreciate my colleague's invitation for us  all to come visit. I am sure it is a wonderful place. And, of course,  being from  [[Page H5324]]  Maine, we like anything that has the word crab in the title.   Unfortunately, this amendment blocks the National Park Service from  complying with the 1998 Concessions Act, which sets up the framework  for evaluating commercial services and parks. It stops the Park Service  from being able to complete its existing process to remain in  compliance with the Act.   The amendment would effectively grandfather in all permit holders  from the prior year, regardless of whether the services are necessary  and appropriate. The amendment also limits the National Park Service's  ability to ensure public safety of commercial services.   Currently, all vendors undergo public health, fire, and permit  condition inspections throughout an operating season. These inspections  have documented significant concerns such as food being cooked, held,  or served at temperatures or conditions that do not meet public health  standards; refueling processes that place workers and patrons at risk;  lack of basic safety, and fire protection; and operating in violation  of permit conditions.   The amendment eliminates the ability to manage the issuance of a  permit based on current or past performance, which creates conditions  that place workers, visitors, and park resources at risk from some  commercial services. I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment once again attempts to block  the administration from ensuring that the air we breathe is clean. I  truly think we can all agree that breathing clean air is a basic right.  For that reason, I oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would prohibit the use of any  Federal funds to implement, administer, or enforce the Presidential  proclamation that establishes the ancestral footprints of the Grand  Canyon National Monument in Arizona, an area significant to many Tribal  nations.   The Antiquities Act provides the President with the authority to  designate national monuments in order to protect objects of historic or  scientific interest. This amendment inappropriately restricts the  President's ability to declare national monuments in specific parts of  the country.    Both Republican and Democratic Presidents have used this authority to  increase the protection of special Federal lands. It goes against 100  years of American tradition to protect the nation's cultural and  natural resources.   The Antiquities Act represents an important achievement in the  progress of conservation and preservation efforts in the United States.  Congress should not stand in the way of these achievements.   I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I am opposing this amendment which would  block the Bureau of Energy Management from implementing the terms of a  stay agreement between NOAA and several NGOs related to mitigation  measures to protect the Rice's whales in the Gulf of Mexico.   I guess my confusion here is that this amendment has already been  overtaken by events. On October 27, NOAA announced that it had denied  the petition from several NGOs to establish a mandatory 10-knot speed  limit and other vessel-related mitigation measures to protect the  Rice's whales in the Gulf of Mexico. Further, NOAA stated that it will  not be proceeding with the rulemaking at this time.   I guess I would ask the gentleman, now that he is aware of this  development, since this happened just on October 27, would he consider  withdrawing this unnecessary amendment from a bill that is already  bloated with riders? It seems to have no purpose.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, once again, I would say I understand we  have disagreements on energy policy, and I understand that my  colleagues often like an opportunity to criticize the Biden  administration because they don't agree with their stand on energy  policy.   I just want to be clear. Again, the Biden administration didn't do  this, as he said in his remarks and I clarified. This was an NGO that  sued to have this happen, but NOAA stated it is not proceeding with the  rulemaking at this time. The Biden administration is not doing this. It  is not slowing down boats. It is not stopping boats at night. None of  the things that he said were actually true. In fact, they have backed  off on this.   I know we all have moments in our own State. I represent a coastal  State. We have all kinds of disagreements on lawsuits that are filed  against current practices, but that didn't happen.   Could he just withdraw this? Because he has got an amendment about  something that isn't happening. Believe me, we have got enough  disagreement and misinformation and there are enough harmful riders in  this bill. I would respectfully request that he just withdraw this and  acknowledge that none of this actually happened.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's thoughts. I  continue to disagree. I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Madam Chair, this amendment is one more controversial  poison pill policy rider that sadly shows that the Republicans are not  interested in bills that can gain bipartisan support and become law.   The amendment would prohibit the Department of the Interior from  removing any monument on land under their jurisdiction.   There can be many reasons a monument would need to be removed, such  as the health and safety of visitors and staff. This amendment provides  no latitude for the Department to steward the land and resources they  are responsible for.   In 15 days, the government will shut down, yet we are spending time  on a bill that will never become law and on this superfluous partisan  poison pill rider.   We should be focused on creating a bipartisan bill that abides by the  agreement reached in the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023.   Let's do the job we were elected to do, ensure the American people  receive the benefits and services they are entitled to.   Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I appreciate the thoughts of the former  Secretary of the Interior, and I thank him for his service, but I want  to be clear. Let me read this back. There may have been an earlier  version of this, but this one says: ``None of the funds made available  by this act may be used to remove any monument on land under the  jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior.''   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, just to clear up a couple of things. My  colleague mentioned the Founding Fathers. Robert E. Lee was not one of  the Founding Fathers. He was a general of the Confederacy. That was in  the city of Charlottesville. That wasn't a national monument when that  statue was removed.   I have to say, I find it rich that the party that has supported book  banning in our libraries, rewriting curriculum, and not talking about  our history over and over again is the very one that is saying that we  have to often keep painful monuments in places where they do damage,  where they interfere with people's ability to enjoy the particular area  that they are in, and leave it to the Department of the Interior to  have that discretion.   If we are going to get into talking about book banning and rewriting  history, let's have an honest debate about it and talk about the  differences between our two parties on this.   Madam Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, the EPA's Integrated Risk Information  System identifies and characterizes the health hazards of chemicals  found in the environment in an impartial manner. IRIS assessments are  critical in understanding the environmental risks we face.   This amendment would deny Americans a valuable tool in understanding  the health effects resulting from chronic exposure to chemicals. This  includes cancer descriptors that help us better understand which  chemicals are most likely to cause cancer.   Madam Chair, I support the work done by the EPA. I oppose this  amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Madam Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.  [[Page H5329]]         Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Madam Chair, I am just sad about this. I really don't  understand why my colleague would want to roll back this great program  on clean schoolbuses. I just don't understand. I mean, first off, you  have to deny that climate change is real in order to say we shouldn't  be doing significant things like this, converting our transportation  system--which is an enormous part of climate change challenges,  converting our transportation system to electric vehicles.   We have had this program since the IIJA, which was actually a  bipartisan program. Perhaps you didn't vote for it. You may not have  agreed with it, but it was a bipartisan bill, and this was in that  bill, so this funding is already out there.   I have had the good fortune of talking to someone who works in one of  the school programs where they have the clean schoolbus program. He  couldn't say enough good things about it. He couldn't say enough about  how good it has been for their district.   Number one, I don't know if you know this about electric vehicles,  but your maintenance costs go way down. For most communities who have  big schoolbus fleets, they have to have a maintenance barn. They have  to have maintenance members who work in there, and this has reduced  greatly their costs for maintaining the vehicles because there are not  a lot of component parts in an electric vehicle.   He also told me that they have a little competition with the bus  drivers. Each one is trying to figure out how long can I go on a  charge? How does my bus work? They are all very engaged in this  process.   Also importantly, there are no emissions from this bus. I don't know  if you heard me earlier, but I was talking about the high asthma rate  in my State. We are one of the top 10 in the country in asthma rates,  and that means asthma in kids. So for kids to be able to ride on a bus  that has no emissions, it is just that much better for their health and  well-being.   There are no good reasons to want to eliminate this. We have already  funded it. There is no funding in this bill. You are just talking about  this as sort of a grudge match against electric schoolbuses, which,  frankly, there are more important problems to deal with in this  country.   We have already funded this. School districts are already  implementing this, applying for this. It is reducing their maintenance  costs. They feel very good about these buses.   I suggest you talk to a school district, maybe one in your own  district, your congressional district, and ask them how they feel about  this, how it is working for their community.    You are opposing something that has gone very well. You are trying to  prohibit a program that runs on clear fuel, that reduces the impact  schoolbuses have on climate change. We are doing something good for  America in this program, good for our schools, good for the health of  our kids. There is no possible reason to want to do this, that is why I  said it just makes me sad.   Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, if my colleague is so concerned about the  challenges that students are facing in our schools, and I admit many  schools are facing challenges because kids have been home during the  pandemic, they have had a lot of setbacks, we are in a very difficult  time in our world, kids have a lot to worry about, I would suggest that  he debates another bill in support of encouraging more funding for the  Department of Education. That would be a good place to put his  concerns, but I would have to say there is no reason to be concerned  about the schoolbuses.                                time  2100    In fact, we should be happy about the schoolbuses because we are  implementing electrification of our fleet. We are helping the well- being of our students by making sure there are less emissions from  those buses, and they can ride on buses with cleaner air. We are  reducing the cost of schools who are able to use these electric buses.  I am in strong support of making sure that we have more electrification  of our schoolbuses. I encourage my colleagues to reject the amendment.   Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, first I have to say, I am perplexed that  anyone would not want to provide good-paying jobs that will help our  Nation tackle the climate crisis and build a stronger country. The goal  of the American Climate Corps is to put more than 20,000 young people  on career pathways in the growing fields of clean energy, conservation,  and climate resilience.   In launching this effort, President Biden is calling on Tribal,  State, and local governments, labor unions, not-for-profit service  allies, the private sector, and philanthropy to collaborate with the  Federal Government to build on current relationships and expand skills- based training partnerships to ensure our workforce is ready to meet  the climate crisis.   We have seen the devastation to coastal communities impacted by  hurricanes and tropical storms. Why would we not want to train our  youth to restore coastal wetlands that can protect communities from  storm surges. We know the damage and loss that accompanies wildfires  across our Nation. So why would we not want to train youth to manage  forests, to improve health, and prevent catastrophic wildfires?   We know the power of skills-based training as a tool to expand  pathways into good-paying jobs. Let's not deny our youth this  opportunity. I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I don't remember mentioning social movements  or environmental justice, although I do think environmental justice is  very important. I was talking about skill training and making sure our  youth are prepared for the jobs of the future. I don't anticipate that  they can stop storms. That would be Herculean, and I don't think anyone  can stop climate change at this point, but I think they can help us  deal with catastrophic wildfires, with coastal resilience. We can train  people with skills of the future. This is a wonderful opportunity for  our young people. I oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, one of our greatest strengths as a Nation is  our diversity. The American experience is not a singular experience,  and diversity programs exist to recognize this.   The fact is, and business leaders agree, having a diverse and  inclusive culture in the workplace is critical to performance.  Attempting to defund or block the implementation of these efforts only  takes us back to a time when our Nation's diversity was not seen as an  asset.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, I encourage my colleagues to do  the same, and I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chairman, I don't know that I could say it any  better than the chair of the Interior, Environment, and Related  Agencies Subcommittee did about the reason that it never makes sense to  use this amendment to reduce somebody's salary. Reducing somebody's  salary to $1 is basically firing them.   When it comes to Michael Regan, the Administrator of the  Environmental Protection Agency, my colleagues are talking about a  hardworking public servant. I think we are very fortunate to have him  there and to have him dealing with some of the biggest challenges our  country is facing, whether it is climate change or environmental  pollution, and moving our country forward in a very difficult time. We  are grateful to have him there.   To ask a public servant to take $1 for their hard work in carrying  out this administration's goals is ludicrous.                                time  2130    To my colleague on the Agriculture Committee, we serve together and  have many areas that we work together on, and to have sort of a grudge  match about this consideration about solar panels on agricultural land,  frankly, doesn't make any sense to me. Of course, his mission is to  make sure we incentivize solar panels, absolutely, of course.   However, to say that he is trying to do this on rich, fertile  farmland goes against the mission of the USDA, and it goes against the  mission of this administration.   It is always a difficult balance to figure out where to put solar  panels. I know in my State we have found some projects where we have  dual use where some kinds of agriculture actually can accommodate solar  panels and also have grazing land and blueberry land. We have a variety  of things going on. Nobody thinks we should use rich farmland--in a  time when we are losing farmland all too fast--for solar panels, and I  am sure Administrator Regan doesn't either.   Nevertheless, incentivizing solar panels, yes, that is absolutely the  mission  [[Page H5340]]  of the EPA. I am thrilled they are doing that and moving us faster and  faster towards renewable energy.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, just to respond to a couple of concerns  that my colleague on the other side of the aisle raised, if we are  about to promote a culture of volunteerism, I think it is very hard to  ask the hardworking administrators of the EPA to serve for a dollar  when we all get paid $175,000 a year which is a lot of money in my home  State. I am very grateful the taxpayers of this country support us to  that tune, but until all of us are willing to take a dollar for our  work, it is hard to ask the hardworking members of the administration  to do the same.   To say that Members on the left somehow don't want India or China to  reduce their impact on climate change and their use of fossil fuels,  that is ludicrous. I know that Secretary Kerry has spent a lot of time  meeting with those countries trying to reduce things that they are  doing that impact climate change. I agree. Those countries have to  reduce it just as we are reducing it in this country.   To say that solar panels somehow should be not used in this country  because we are dependent on buying them from China, well, that is based  on the shortsightedness of Republicans who have consistently blocked  our involvement in renewable energy.   Had the gentleman voted for the IRA, he would have seen that we are  incentivizing American manufacturing and doing our best to return the  manufacturing of those solar panels to this country, and if we are  going to consistently oppose renewable energy and oppose the  manufacture of renewable energy, then we are just going to fall further  and further behind in making sure that we are making those components  here in the United States.   So, once again, I reject this amendment, and I yield back the balance  of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman for yielding. I just say  that, again, this idea of asking public servants to be volunteers, to  serve for $1, actually carries no weight until all of the Members of  Congress are also willing to serve for $1. It is completely  impractical, and it would mean that only a few people would have the  opportunity to serve as Members of Congress or to be in the executive  branch.   Also, to criticize Deb Haaland, a woman who I was very proud to serve  with in the House of Representatives, who we were very pleased to have  her here as one of the first Native American women elected to Congress,  but then to go on to lead the Department of the Interior as a Native  American woman who also has oversight of the Bureau of Indian Affairs,  who has had so much personal experience but also experience within her  own community, who has a deep love of our public lands, of our natural  systems, and in my opinion, has done a fantastic job, this is  insulting. It is petty. We shouldn't even be here standing at this hour  of the night talking about such a highly regarded and well-respected  public servant.   Mr. Chair, I thoroughly oppose this amendment.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim time in opposition to this amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would prohibit the President  of the United States from designating national monuments under the  Antiquities Act of 1906. The Antiquities Act provides the President  with the authority to designate national monuments in order to protect  objects of historic or scientific interest. Both Republican and  Democratic Presidents have used this authority to increase protection  of special Federal lands.   This amendment inappropriately restricts the President's ability to  declare national monuments in specific parts of the country. It goes  against 100 years of American tradition to protect the Nation's  cultural and natural resources.   The Antiquities Act represents an important achievement in the  progress of conservation and preservation efforts in the United States,  and Congress should not stand in the way of these achievements.   Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I continue to oppose the amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment seeks to prohibit funding for  the EPA's Global Change Research Program, which will result in more  resilient communities, mitigate the impacts of climate change, and  protect our world for future generations.   The gentleman who proposed this amendment said that there is too much  research on climate change and that climate change alarmism, as he  called it, is immoral.   In my perspective, not being alarmed by the possibility of climate  change is actually immoral. Our responsibility is to care for and  protect future generations, to care for and protect the planet.   He said that the impact is too great on businesses and is creating  problems for businesses. I say if we don't deal with climate change, we  are impacting all of our businesses that have to deal with things in my  State like sea level rise, adverse weather impacts, flooding, drought,  all the things that are impacting our farmers, natural resource-based  businesses, and communities.   It is our responsibility to do something about this. To say it is  just alarmist or that somehow we shouldn't talk about it, research it,  or do something about it is putting our heads in the sand and not  taking responsibility for what we need to do.   Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, there is a lot of alarmism going on because  we are facing a significant climate crisis. We just had the hottest  summer on record. We are having some of the most challenging weather,  whether it is a hurricane or a drought or flooding, impacting all of us  in all of our districts.   We are facing this and trying to end our dependence on foreign  sources of energy by making sure that we have renewable energy in this  country, by investing in American businesses, not Chinese owned, not  other foreign countries, but making sure as we did through the IRA that  we are investing in American manufacturing and American energy  solutions.   Most of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle oppose this.  They continue to oppose the solutions that we  [[Page H5343]]  have to implement to make sure that we are energy independent and that  we can deal with climate change. This is one more example of that.   Mr. Chair, I encourage my colleagues to reject this amendment, and I  yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.    Mr. Chair, this amendment would prohibit any funds to  enforce any COVID-19 mask mandates. This amendment is one of the more  controversial poison pill policy riders that sadly shows extremist  Republicans are not interested in bills that can gain bipartisan  support and become law.   Preventing disease reduces healthcare costs, such as hospitalization  and pharmaceuticals, and benefits employers by resulting in less  employee absenteeism. Facial masks are an essential personal protective  measure to fight the COVID-19 virus.   We also know that some people infected with the virus that causes  COVID-19 can suffer from the long-term effects from their infection,  meaning they can experience health problems that can last for years.  Why would we politicize something that would help our fellow Americans  stay healthy?   From January 3, 2020, to September 27, 2023, there were 1,127,152  deaths from COVID-19 in the United States reported to the World Health  Organization, some of whom the people in this room knew and loved.   I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against this harmful amendment.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I don't know that we have time to debate all  the science tonight, but a study that says that mask using has no  impact, I wouldn't want to go into a surgery ward and find out that the  surgeon who was about to perform my operation wasn't wearing a mask.   To say that hand washing doesn't matter, I have never seen a  physician who doesn't go into the emergency room or a surgical room  without washing their hands.   Social distancing, this is starting to sound a little bit like crack  science to me, not anything very serious, something that you might see  on the internet or social media, so I question my colleague's science  in this regard.   I also just say I oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    The Environmental Financial Advisory Board supports the  EPA's mission to lower the cost of and increase investment in  environmental and public health protection.   Just to be clear about its role, here are some of the activities the  board pursues: ways to lower the cost of environmental protection;  remove financial and programmatic barriers that raise costs; increase  public and private contributions in environmental facilities and  services; and build State and local financial ability to meet  environmental laws.   This mission is critical if we want to ensure that the investments we  need to protect our country from climate change are sound and  achievable.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, it is hard for me to actually understand my  colleague's argument here. He opposes modernizing the Mineral Leasing  Act, basically raising lease fees at a time when he is complaining  about the deficit, meaning the revenue could be very helpful.   The way I read this, we are just catering to oil and gas interests,  enabling them to continue to operate at rates that don't benefit the  American people.   I have no idea how this works well for us. Why would my colleague  think that at a time when he is also looking for more ways to balance  our budget?   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chairman, I couldn't possibly call the Inflation  Reduction Act a scam that has ruined anything in America. I have to say  it is one of the best things we have ever done. It is the first time we  have made a significant investment in renewable energy and in defeating  climate change.   I am sorry that my colleague doesn't see it in the same way. I am  sorry that my colleague thinks that the only way we can end our  dependence on foreign oil is to drill in his front yard. I wish him  luck on that. I hope that he does discover oil in his front yard. That  could be an amazing day in his life.   The fact is that we need to invest in renewable energy. We need to  invest in American manufacturing.   The very idea that this incredibly wealthy industry, the oil and gas  industry, shouldn't pay reasonable rates when it is extracting  resources from the land that belongs to all Americans, that somehow  that should be a free kind of giveaway to them, is that what the free  market is? America giving away its resources to highly profitable  companies is not the way I see the free market. I see the free market  as paying a fair price.   For this administration to modernize this act to make sure that gas  and oil interests are paying a fair price when they do drill on  American public land seems only reasonable to me. It seems like a  better way to take care of American taxpayers.   While the gentleman might say that doesn't amount to much money, I  have been listening to bill after bill tonight where people say this  person's salary here will make a difference on the deficit, that  $15,000 cuts to the Secretary of the Interior would make a difference  on the deficit.   I have been hearing all night long--in fact, all day and all night  long, as I recall--that every penny counts. That these pennies don't  count because we should be giving a break to the oil and gas industry  goes far beyond my understanding of how business should work and how  our job protecting American resources should work.   Once again, this is a terrible amendment, one in a string of terrible  amendments, and I oppose it.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, we oppose this amendment, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this  amendment.    Mr. Chair, I strongly oppose this amendment that would  cripple the EPA's ability to exercise its criminal enforcement function  by preventing the EPA criminal enforcement from being able to issue  warrants, make arrests, or carry firearms.   I am truly befuddled by this attack on law enforcement. The  majority's disdain for the EPA has been evident throughout the debate  of this bill, but this amendment is beyond the pale.   I cannot understand how anyone would think it is a good idea to give  a pass to criminals who deliberately break the law.   The EPA's criminal enforcement function is a vital part of our  efforts to help protect the environment and safeguard the public  health, but it is important to recognize that it is only one part of  these efforts.                                time  2340    The fact is that EPA's compliance and enforcement process is a  multistep process that uses criminal law enforcement only as a last  resort. EPA initially provides compliance assistance  [[Page H5356]]  to help the regulated community understand and comply with regulations.  EPA compliance monitoring subsequently assesses compliance through  inspections and other activities.   Enforcement actions are initiated only when the regulated community  does not comply or when cleanup is required. Criminal actions are  usually reserved for the most serious violations, those that are  willful or knowingly committed.   The mere threat of criminal action can and does help ensure  compliance. If this irresponsible amendment passes and we remove the  threat of criminal action, we will inevitably see a decline in willful  compliance of our environmental laws. That would be bad news for all of  us, as the quality of our air, water, and public health will inevitably  suffer.   As to the issue of EPA personnel carrying firearms, I would point out  that more than 70 Federal agencies employ law enforcement officers who  are authorized to carry firearms and make arrests in the United States,  including the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, the Food and Drug  Administration, and the Tennessee Valley Authority. The EPA is hardly  unique in this regard.   Make no mistake, this amendment is clearly anti-law enforcement. It  cripples the ability of the EPA to ensure enforcement of our  environmental laws and will inevitably lead to even more harm to the  public health.   Let's ensure that the EPA can continue to enforce our Nation's  environmental standards.   Mr. Chair, I urge the defeat of this amendment, and I yield back the  balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose this amendment.    Mr. Chair, section 115 of the Clean Air Act is  essential. It enables the United States to work with other nations to  address transboundary air pollution.   As we have seen recently while Canada was experiencing historic  wildfires, pollution knows no boundaries and can travel anywhere,  whether by air or water.   We cannot address these environmental issues on our own, and we must  work with other nations. Prohibiting the EPA from implementing section  115 of the Clean Air Act is shortsighted, and I oppose this amendment.   Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the  amendment.    Mr. Chair, on top of the cuts already included in the  base bill, this would nearly eliminate the office. This means that we  will no longer have anyone in the government to run programs that  prevent air pollution, ensure high-quality indoor and outdoor air,  monitor and reduce pollution from vehicles and engines, prevent acid  rain, protect the public against radiation, and monitor and address  stratospheric ozone depletion.   These draconian and shortsighted cuts put all Americans at risk.   Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my  time.    Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.    Mr. Chair, honestly, I don't even know where to start. I  am pretty sure it is about midnight, and this is the United States  Congress. We are dealing with enormous challenges in the world. We  currently have a war going on in Ukraine with Russia, in Israel with  the Hamas, and we are trying to face a climate change and so many  serious issues, and we are here debating a plastic straw, whether or  not plastic straws should be used, whether or not they are the best  alternative.   I understand it is complicated, what is the best kind of straw to  use, a reusable straw, a paper straw, or a plastic straw, and there are  issues related to this. Nonetheless, this is because of a mandate to  reduce the amount of single-use plastic.   I don't know about you, Mr. Chair, but I have an ocean border that is  longer than any other ocean border in the United States, and one of the  big challenges that we are dealing with right now is an excess amount  of plastic in the ocean. We have no good recycling in this country. We  have excess amounts of plastics in our landfill, and we have toxics  that we are dealing with every day. So reducing our amount of single- use plastic is important.   Whether or not it is our job in Congress to decide what kind of straw  should be used or exactly how these bans should be implemented, I just  don't think it is something that we should be doing at midnight when we  have a lot of big problems to deal with.   I am just disappointed to see this amendment, to see that my  colleague doesn't want to address the big challenges that we have with  single-use plastic, and the difficult issues that have to be dealt  with.   Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of  my time.
