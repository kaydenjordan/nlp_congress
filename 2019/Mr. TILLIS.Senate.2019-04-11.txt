 Mr. President, Judge James C. Fox, who served as a  Federal District Court Judge for the Eastern District of North Carolina  for more than 35 years, passed away Saturday, March 23, 2019, at the  age of 90.   Judge Fox was born on November 6, 1928, in Atchison, KS. As a young  boy, his family moved to Greensboro, NC, where he grew up. Judge Fox  graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1950  and married Katharine deRosset Rhett on December 30, 1950. Judge Fox  served as a corporal in the United States Army Reserve from 1951-1959.   Judge Fox attended law school at the University of North Carolina  School of Law, where he graduated in 1957 with highest honors.  Subsequently, he took a clerkship with Judge Donnell Gilliam who  predated Judge Fox as a U.S. District Court Judge for the Eastern  District of North Carolina. Judge Fox entered private practice in 1959  with the firm Carter & Murchison in New Hanover County, NC, where he  practiced for 20 years. While in private practice, Judge Fox served as  the county attorney for New Hanover County for 13 years.   President Ronald Reagan nominated Judge Fox to serve as a U.S.  District Court Judge for the Eastern District of North Carolina on  September 13, 1982. Judge Fox served the residents of North Carolina  for more than 35 years. He served as chief judge from 1990 to 1997 and  assumed senior status on January 31, 2001. Even after assuming senior  status, Judge Fox maintained a full caseload until he retired in 2017.  Judge Fox was known as courteous but firm and was widely respected by  everyone who came into his courtroom.   In addition to his decades of public service, Judge Fox served as  director of the law alumni association for the University of North  Carolina in 1964 and president of the law foundation at the University  of North Carolina from 1977 to 1979.

Judge Fox was also an active member of Ducks Unlimited. He loved the  outdoors and spent significant time and resources on conservation  management efforts.   Most importantly, Judge Fox was a devoted husband, father, and  grandfather. I am grateful to Judge Fox for his service and to his  family for sharing his time with the residents of North Carolina. He  will be greatly missed.                            ____________________
