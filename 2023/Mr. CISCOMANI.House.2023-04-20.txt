 Mr. Speaker, I rise to give a big congrats to a very  impressive individual from Arizona's Sixth Congressional District.   Last month, Karen Opoku-Appoh, an 8th grader from Marana Middle  School, won the 2023 Arizona Spelling Bee.   Karen correctly spelled the word ``passage'' to beat out 26 fellow  competitors and become Arizona's spelling bee champion. Now she has the  honor of representing her school, our district, and our entire State at  the Scripps National Spelling Bee.   Arizona is proud to have one of the highest spelling bee  participation rates in the country, with over 480,000 students  competing in private, public, and homeschool classrooms.   For decades, the Arizona Spelling Bee has motivated high-achieving  students from across the State to get excited about spelling.   Mr. Speaker, I speak for our community in congratulating Karen on  this remarkable achievement. Her hard work and drive have yielded an  accomplishment that makes our entire State proud. Karen has been a  shining example of the power of dreaming big.   Mr. Speaker, we will be rooting for Karen at nationals.                            ____________________
