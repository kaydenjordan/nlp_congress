 Mr. President, let's stop playing games with critical  funding for minority serving institutions or MSIs.   Mandatory funding expires on September 30, just days from now.   If that funding isn't reauthorized, MSIs will collectively face a  $255 million annual shortfall.   That will impact these institutions' academic programs, ability to  provide housing to students, renovate facilities, and provide critical  counseling and other student supports.   In 2018, Illinois received $5.3 million of this funding, which  supported city colleges in Chicago, Northeastern Illinois University,  Chicago State, the University of Illinois, and other institutions  around our State.   Recently, the House of Representatives passed the FUTURE Act to  reauthorize this funding.   Unfortunately, the passage of this bipartisan bill has been blocked  in the Senate.   This is a great example of what frustrates the American people so  much about Congress.   We have a bipartisan bill that passed the House by voice vote and  that maintains funding for institutions of higher education that enroll  6 million students, of which two of three are students of color.   But it is being held up, and we are unnecessarily creating a crisis.   Let's stop the games.   Let's show America that we can come together.   Let's pass the FUTURE Act now.    I announce that the Senator from New Jersey (Mr. Booker),  the Senator from Vermont (Mr. Sanders), and the Senator from  Massachusetts (Ms. Warren) are necessarily absent.

Mr. President, as World War I came to a close in 1919,  Ada Sophia McKinley founded a Chicago South Side settlement house for  returning war veterans and anyone else in need of training, food,  shelter, and recreation. As century later, the Ada S. McKinley  Community Services serves more than 7,000 people annually at 70  locations in Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin.   McKinley was born 3 years after the Civil War in Galveston, TX.  During World War I, she moved to Chicago with her husband and son. She  was a schoolteacher and a community activist. McKinley began  volunteering as an official hostess of the War Camp Club on South  Wabash Avenue, helping war servicemen and their families. The club used  recreational and civic activities to help soldiers make the transition  back. It was a precursor to the therapies we use today for  posttraumatic stress disorder treatments.   The War Recreation Board cut funding to the War Camp Club when the  war ended, but the Douglas/South Side community still needed help, and  the Great Migration had accelerated people moving to Chicago with very  little resources. McKinley continued helping people, eventually  founding what became the South Side Settlement House in an old, three- story mansion at 32nd and Wabash Avenue in 1919.   At the South Side Settlement House, people could get a meal, some  cash, and take classes in sewing, cooking, arts, and crafts, ceramics,  and storytelling. There was a summer camp, a library, and even  friendship clubs for lonely seniors.   McKinley never collected a salary for her work. She established a  board of directors, implemented childcare, job training, employment  referral, and educational systems for all ages.   After the 1919 Chicago race riots, McKinley marched with legendary  colleagues Jane Addams, Harriet Vittum, and Mary McDowell. McKinley  worked with the Chicago Commission on Race Relations to help restore  order and relief to people.   On August 24, 1952, McKinley helped lay the cornerstone for a new  headquarters for her organization at 100 E. 34th Street. Hours later,  she suffered a cerebral hemorrhage and passed away.   Her legacy lives on in the work of her agency. Today, children can  attend quality education services at the Ada S. McKinley Community  Services locations. People can get help for their lives with mentoring  programs, financial aid counseling, and a host of other programs. Their  motto is ``Empower. Educate. Employ.'' Today, we honor a  [[Page S5740]]  century of their good work doing just that.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of  the bill be printed in the Record.
