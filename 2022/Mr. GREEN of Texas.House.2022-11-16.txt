 Madam Speaker, as my friends are assisting me, I  [[Page H8526]]  shall start by thanking the leadership for the opportunity to give this  message today. I believe this is a message that is long overdue. In  fact, it is hundreds of years overdue.   I thank the persons who are assisting me. They have done an  outstanding job. I thank all of the persons associated with this body  for making it possible for me to have this opportunity to speak today  on a matter of vital importance, an issue that is hundreds of years  overdue, an issue that can make a difference in the life of our  country.   I am Al Green, Member of Congress from Texas, and still I rise, Madam  Speaker, and still I rise today to call to the attention of the  Congress that I will be asking for a Congressional Gold Medal for the  many persons who toiled and slaved in this country such that our  country is the economic and, quite frankly, the world powerhouse that  it is when it comes to all of the things that can make a country great  as it relates to its economic standing.   This is the message that I would have my colleagues take note of, the  message that I hope they will give consideration to.   The message: Confederate soldiers were awarded a Congressional Gold  Medal in 1956. When some people hear this, they have what we call a  double take, because it is difficult for them to believe that  Confederate soldiers were awarded a Congressional Gold Medal.   Some things bear repeating. A Confederate soldier, more than one,  were awarded a Congressional Gold Medal in 1956. What Congress did for  the soldier enslavers it should do for the enslaved. I am asking my  colleagues to support the historic Congressional Gold Medal for  America's economic foundational mothers, fathers, and children.   I say children because in this country, persons of African ancestry  early on were born into slavery, lived in slavery, and died in slavery.  This was the status of things in the United States of America at one  point and when the country was known as the colonies at another point.   The enslaved people made a difference in the lives of those who were  living here as persons other than slaves. The deadline for this  document, this monumental piece of legislation, this bill requesting a  Congressional Gold Medal, will be February 1, 2023. This will be the  first day of Black History Month.   Black History Month has been chosen, Madam Speaker, because the  history of Africans in America has not been told. There are many  aspects of it that have been deleted from history. I believe that it is  time for us to clear the record.   The deadline will be February 1, 2023, the first day of Black History  Month. This date was chosen because Black history has not been told. It  is one of the greatest stories never told, and we are still trying to  complete it. This will be a part of that process, to let people know  more about what the enslaved people in this country contributed to the  country.   Some people would say to me, and I have had at least one person to  say: Do you really believe that Congress will accord a Congressional  Gold Medal to the slaves? And my answer is: Yes, I believe Congress  will do it.   I believe Congress will do it because I remember what the father of  Juneteenth suffered in his effort to get Juneteenth as a holiday in  Texas. I remember how he was called names and castigated. I remember  how there were people who felt that Juneteenth was a country holiday,  they felt that it was too bucolic, too rustic, for intellectual society  to embrace. But he fought and he won. The Honorable Al Edwards is now  the father of Juneteenth. At the time he introduced it, he was thought  of as a person who would never succeed in the Texas House of  Representatives, but he served well and he showed and demonstrated to  us that persistence can make a difference.   So we plan to be persistent with this legislation, and we plan to  make sure that we continue until we get the legislation passed.   The letter that I will send to my colleagues reads--continuing to  read it--on July 18, 1956, Congress--this would be the House and the  Senate--awarded a Congressional Gold Medal to Confederate soldier  enslavers. However, to this day, Congress has never awarded a  Congressional Gold Medal to the over 10 million enslaved men, women,  and children.   I have to pause. Ten million men, women, and children. Who can  imagine that a country would have a process by which a person is born  into slavery, lives his or her entire life in slavery, and dies in  slavery. This was the status of things in this country at one time.   The country has never awarded a Congressional Gold Medal to the over  10 million enslaved men, women, and children who toiled for over 240  years to build the economy and the infrastructure, the foundation, if  you will, of the wealthiest nation to ever exist on the planet Earth.   These foundational mothers and fathers of our country labored  arduously, constructing our roads, bridges, wells, and cities. They  laboriously planted as well as harvested the food that fed our Nation.  How ungrateful can we be to people who made such a sacrifice for this  country, to still to this day see them as less-thans, to this day not  accord them some degree of honor and dignity for the suffering that  they endured for some 200-plus years.   They were the de facto producers of the cash crops that fueled our  Nation's foundational wealth. America is the wealthy powerhouse that it  is today because of Black people, people from Africa, who were  enslaved, brought to this country, and made to work their entire lives,  many of them, so that America could be the economic powerhouse that it  was then and has continued to be until this day.   These enslaved human beings of African ancestry toiled as slaves  without remuneration or recompense. They have not been given any  emolument, and to add insult to this injury, they have not been given  any degree of respect for what they did to make this country great.   Their humble hands were relied on for the erection of some of our  Nation's most renowned edifices and monuments, including the White  House, the Capitol Building--this is the Capitol Building, for those  who may be unaware--and the Washington Monument. Humble hands, forced  to do the bidding of those who lived lives of luxury, many of them,  made America great, built the Capitol, humble hands, the Washington  Monument.   In truth, their sacrificed lives provided the genesis of our Nation's  economic preeminence. These sacrificed human beings--men, women, and  children--were the greatest contributors to the foundational economy  whose contributions are almost universally forgotten, underrecognized,  ignored, overlooked, and/or undervalued.                                time  1415    Many of the things that I read to you today I will repeat. They have  not been said before. They should be heard multiple times, and some  things just bear repeating.   So let me repeat. These sacrificed human beings--men, women, and  children, with the emphasis on children--were the greatest contributors  to the American foundational economy whose contributions are almost  universally forgotten, underrecognized, ignored, overlooked, and  undervalued.   For these and countless other justifications, I am beseeching the  Congress to award the Congressional Gold Medal collectively to the  human beings who are the foundational fathers, mothers, and children  who toiled as slaves without recompense or recognition for their  unparalleled contributions to the infrastructural and economic  development of the Nation that we enjoy today.   Awarding a Congressional Gold Medal to groups of individuals is not  unprecedented, as a Congressional Gold Medal was awarded to Confederate  enslavers. I think this bears some sidebar commentary. Confederate  enslavers. The people who fought to maintain slavery have been awarded  a Congressional Gold Medal. The people who sought to maintain the  institution that prevented people from having the freedom that they had  have received a Congressional Gold Medal.   What is wrong with us? What mindset could we have had in 1956 when  this House decided that it would accord Congressional Gold Medals to  Confederate soldiers? I cannot understand how we would ever do this.  But then to add additional insult to injury, to never consider the  people who helped build the country, the people who made it the  economic powerhouse that it was then and is now.  [[Page H8527]]    What is wrong with us? Is racism such a disease that it infects our  minds to the extent that we cannot see and concentrate with the degree  of clarity necessary to make righteous decisions? This was one of the  saddest days in this Congress when it voted to give a Congressional  Gold Medal to Confederate soldiers.   But there is a way for Congress to redeem itself. Redemption is at  hand. And here is the means by which you can redeem yourself, Members:  Give these persons who toiled and slaved, born into slavery, lived and  died in slavery, give them the same level of respect that you gave the  people who sought to enslave them, that fought to enslave them. Some of  them died in their effort to keep them in chains, in bondage, subject  to the whims of their masters, and their whims were many times things  that are unacceptable in decent societies.   Awarding a Congressional Gold Medal to groups of individuals is not  unprecedented, as a Congressional Gold Medal was awarded to Confederate  soldier enslavers, also to the Tuskegee Airmen--some of them received  their Congressional Gold Medals antemortem, and some others  postmortem--to the Navajo Code Talkers, and posthumously to the  servicemembers who perished in Afghanistan on August 26, 2021.   So, friends, the point to be made here is, you can't make the  argument that we can't do it because it is a group of people. We have  done it for other groups. You can't make the argument that we can't do  it because none of them are alive. We have done it posthumously for  others.   There is really no argument to make except you don't believe that  persons who toiled all of their lives--many of them lived, died, born  into it--that they deserve respect and recognition. That is what this  is about, respect and recognition.   I am bringing this to your attention so that you can give  consideration to it. We won't ask for signatures until the next  Congress because to ask for them in this Congress with the short period  of time left would be futile, and I believe that we should wait, and we  will wait until February 1 of next year to do it during Black History  Month.   It is my belief that men, women, and children who suffered a great  crime against humanity--and this was a crime against humanity; slavery  was a crime against humanity, one of the greatest crimes ever  perpetrated on humanity--it is my belief that men, women, and children  who suffered a great crime against humanity, toiling unremunerated as  slaves, many for their entire work lives, are more deserving of a  Congressional Gold Medal than those who soldiered to preserve slavery.   To be as clear as I can be, perspicuously so, it is my belief that  those who were enslaved have a greater entitlement to a Congressional  Gold Medal than the soldiers who fought to maintain slavery.   The zeitgeist of our time, the mood, the spirit, the zeitgeist of our  time impels the introduction of this historic legislation. I am going  to ask if Members wish to be recognized as a courageous historic  original cosponsor, they should contact my office. We will more than  honor requests that are made early, but officially we will start in the  next Congress. We will have this historic legislation made available on  our website. In my office, you might contact Aaron, and his email  address is readily available for those who would like to contact him,  or you can simply call our office, and we will be more than pleased to  speak to you.   I will close by talking about a couple of pictures that I have here.  It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words. This is a  depiction of the arrival of these first 20 or so persons in this what  is now the United States of America. It wasn't then, 1619. If you can  see this, you can see a representation of persons who are standing  around.   This is purported to be the White Lion, the ship that brought them  here, and these persons standing around, you can see that they have on  clothing that would protect them from the weather. It appears to be a  day wherein the weather is not kind, inclement weather. But if you look  at the persons who are enslaved, shackled, to say that they are  scantily clad is a gross understatement. It would be an insulting  euphemism.   This picture speaks volumes about what slavery was all about. It was  about people who were thought of as less than human. Didn't have to  treat them fairly. Didn't have to keep them warm if you chose not  to. Didn't have to keep them alive. One insult could cost a person his  or her life. The picture is worth a thousand words. These people, well- clothed, looking on, some of them possibly contemplating what they  would do with these human beings.    I plan to go to Norfolk, Virginia, Old Point Comfort, if you will. I  want to see this place. It is identifiable. I want to see it. I want to  say I was there. I want to say I stood on the soil where human beings  were first introduced, by many accounts. There may be some discrepancy,  but my most accounts, this is where it happened. I am going to go.   Here is another rendition. This one shows a baby. Looks like the baby  is with a female, possibly the mother, dressed in clothing that I would  consider more acceptable for the weather than in the other. There are  many renditions, but we still have the White Lion, and we still have  persons standing around talking about these human beings, contemplating  their fate is my speculation.   What kind of person enslaves a baby? What kind of person enslaves a  baby? What kind of person would see a child and see labor that can be  the benefit of having this human being survive and have this child grow  up and deny the child an opportunity to get an education? What kind of  person denies a baby the opportunity to grow up and just understand the  world by virtue of being able to read?   There are still places on the planet where young girls are not  allowed to get the same level of schooling and education as young men.  I am opposed to that. I am opposed to the people who do that. I have  good reason to be opposed. Here is one. I understand what has happened.   What kind of person keeps people in ignorance intentionally? The kind  of person who would want to make sure that this person never has a  life, but only an existence. They didn't have a life. They just existed  to serve their masters.   Anybody who believes that this piece of legislation is inappropriate  is a person that doesn't understand this, and I am being kind by saying  what I just said. There are many other ways; there are many adjectives.   When I first examined these photos, I had tears well up in my eyes  because I realized who they were. Not only were they human beings,  these were my relatives. These are the people on whose shoulders I  stand. More than 240 years they suffered. These are the people that  this country ought to honor and appreciate, and these are the people  that deserve what we have given to the enslavers.                                time  1430    I won't give up, friends. I will not. These are my people. I am not  ashamed to say that I am a proud descendant of the enslaved people who  made America great. I am not ashamed of it.   My dear brothers and sisters, my dear friends, I beg that you give  consideration to the legislation. Those who want to have further query  can call me, talk to me. I will be on the floor.   It would be no surprise, when I initially thought about introducing  the legislation, my thought was, well, we will just wait and introduce  it and start asking for signatures. But, no, I want to make sure that  everybody has an opportunity to read it, peruse it, dissect it,  scrutinize it, and do all the things you need to do to make a decision.  Then, once we file it, I am going to come back to this floor, and I am  going to announce and thank the persons who have signed on to the  legislation. Anybody who signs on to this legislation deserves a word  of gratitude, and I will be one of the many who will, hopefully, give  these expressions of gratitude. I plan to come back to the floor and  say to the public at large: We thank you for supporting this  legislation.   My hope is that we will get the signatures necessary for the benefit  of the public at large. You cannot get this legislation passed in the  House with a majority of votes. It will take 290 votes or more.  [[Page H8528]]    I see the Parliamentarian looking in my direction. If I am incorrect,  Madam Parliamentarian, will you give me some nod as to being correct or  incorrect? She indicates that I am correct. So, now you have heard it  from me and you have heard it echoed from the Parliamentarian: 290  votes we will need, not 289, 290 people of goodwill who have the  courage to recognize the people who made America great.   Others have done things to make America great. I don't mean to  minimize the efforts of any others. I just mean to maximize the efforts  that have been ignored, that have been, quite frankly, with  intentionality pushed aside.   They are people who are ashamed to acknowledge that they are the  proud descendants of the enslaved people who built this country. I am  not one of them, of course. But there are still people who are. They  are ashamed. We have to change that. I want to do everything I can to  bring about that change.   I will return to Al Edwards, the father of Juneteenth. I remember  what he went through. He was my friend. I saw him suffer. I know about  his fight to rid South Africa of Apartheid, how he went to jail in that  struggle.   I am prepared to do whatever it takes, however long it takes, as long  as I am in Congress.   Madam Speaker of the House of Representatives, I thank you for this  time, and I will be asking for additional time to have additional  commentary about this subject. I assure you that those who take this  seriously will be doing the righteous thing, not just the right thing,  but the righteous thing.   Again, I will close with Maya Angelou's very powerful words. She  reminded us that we--persons of my ilk, if you will--were:       Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,      I am the dream and the hope of the slave.    I plan to fulfill their dreams.   Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
