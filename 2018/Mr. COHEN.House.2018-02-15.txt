 Madam Speaker, this House generally jumps into action once  there has been a mass shooting by having a moment of silence. Today we  didn't even have a moment of silence because the House knows that those  are meaningless acts that don't have any effect on our schoolchildren  who have been the victims of 18 school mass shootings this year.   It is shameful this Congress has not dealt with no fly, no buy. If  you are on a terrorist list, you can still buy a gun.   It is a shame this Congress passed a law that takes away from  individuals who get Social Security who may be mentally ill the ability  to buy a gun.   We don't even have studies on what has been happening in trying to  protect schoolchildren. It is a shame.   We need to act. American schoolchildren are at risk, and I am ashamed  at what this Congress has failed to do: take action.                            ____________________
