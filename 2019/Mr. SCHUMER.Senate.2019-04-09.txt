 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, the watchword in the executive branch  today is ``chaos.'' This chaos stems from one source and one source  only--President Donald Trump and his extreme agenda--and America is  paying the price.   Everyone agrees there are issues at the border, but if you are the  President and if you are in charge of our national security, you don't  tweet your way into a strategy; you don't keep changing policies; and  you don't keep switching personnel if you want to make progress on the  most challenging issue that is facing our country.   Every day, we hear this is the President's new policy, and 2 days  later, we hear it is not happening. People are being fired because they  tell the President, according to news reports, that he can't break the  law when he wants to do something. You cannot keep changing personnel,  changing strategy, and tweeting your way through a problem as serious  as this. That is why there is chaos when it comes to border issues--all  created by the President and his whimsical, erratic, and oftentimes  nasty pursuit of policy.   Even the Republicans are worried sick about the chaos President Trump  has created over the week. My friend John Cornyn says this is all a  giant ``mess''--his words. Well, my friend from Texas is correct. Yet  this dysfunction is not confined to a few Agencies; this chaos is  throughout the executive branch because Donald Trump has the same kind  of switching of personnel, changing of policies, and trying to tweet  his way through a problem in other areas as he does with regard to the  border.   Let me remind my colleagues that the Secretary of Health and Human  Services, the Interior Secretary, and the EPA Administrator each  resigned amid scandal. The Trump administration has not yet nominated  anyone for probably the most important Cabinet position, the Secretary  of Defense, since Secretary Mattis's departure, and when he departed,  Secretary Mattis had a scathing rebuke of President Trump's policies.   Look at the chaos at the State Department, where the damage extends  way beyond America's borders. Because of incompetence and inaction,  there are no nominees to more than 30 vacant key positions at State,  including Under Secretary of State for Public Diplomacy and Special  Envoy for North Korean Human Rights. There are no nominees to be our  Ambassador to Pakistan or Egypt and none for Qatar or Thailand.   This is not the Senate blocking nominees as much as the President  likes to blame somebody else for his problems; this is the President's  own administration that has failed to nominate people for such  important positions, and many of these positions have been long vacant.  The areas we mentioned are ever important in our changing world, and  this administration is simply failing to nominate anyone.   We should be projecting stability and continuity through our State  Department. Instead, it has been battered and belittled by its own  administration to the point at which both sides in Congress have spoken  out. Just yesterday, we learned the administration is pushing out the  head of the Secret Service amid a new scandal surrounding a security  breach at Mar-a-Lago, the so-called winter White House. Now joining the  others who are gone--fired by Twitter or whatever--is the head of the  Secret Service. All of this chaos has one source and one source only-- the President of the United States and his erratic, vacillating  attitudes toward policy and personnel.   Across a broad spectrum of issues, his policies are so extreme that  even good-faith nominees eventually face a choice--leave the  administration or be consumed by the quicksand of the Trump swamp.   I hope the President or some of the people around him will realize  that his administration is far from a fine-tuned machine; it is a slow- motion disaster that the American people see in action every day.                                Women's Health    Madam President, on women's health, the Senate Judiciary Committee  will hold a hearing today on a sham bill that would further restrict  women's access to care.   Every woman and every family in America should shudder at the  Republicans' campaign to take away the rights of women to make  decisions about their own health just to satisfy a hard-right, radical  agenda that the vast majority of Americans completely disagrees with.   This bill would unduly restrict women's rights to make their own  health decisions. Dr. Jennifer Conti, who is a clinical assistant  professor of OB/GYN at Stanford, described the 20-week mark set by the  bill as ``just an arbitrary limit set in place by politicians that has  no medical or scientific backing.'' Let me repeat--``an arbitrary limit  set in place by politicians''--politicians making decisions about  women's health. That is what is wrong here.   What is more, a 20-week ban is, arguably, unconstitutional. Just 2  weeks ago, a Federal judge in North Carolina ruled it was. We know the  20-week ban is just a start among those who want to take away women's  rights. They will try to go for a 10-week ban, then a 6-week ban. It is  all part of a radical, relentless effort to completely and  unequivocally strip women of their right  [[Page S2300]]  to make their own healthcare decisions.   The rhetoric we will hear from the Republicans in this hearing will  be much the same we have heard for years. Whether it is a vote we took  in the Senate or a new law protecting one's rights in my home State of  New York, the Republicans have repeatedly used scare tactics and  falsehoods to mislead the public. Yes, these are nothing but scare  tactics, but don't take my word for it. Time and time again, fact  checkers have ruled the Republicans' rhetoric on these issues to be  outright false.   Let's be clear. Across the country, the reproductive rights of women  are under attack. In statehouses across the country, the Republicans  are forcing through radical proposals that would dramatically limit  women's rights to make their own choices--in Mississippi, in Georgia,  in Kentucky. This is a threat to women in all 50 States, not just in  those 3. It is dangerously out of step with the American people.   The Trump administration is even imposing a gag rule on healthcare  providers to stop them from discussing the full range of options with  women who consider having abortions. They are literally preventing  doctors from doing their jobs. It is illogical, intrusive, and  hypocritical that the Republicans in Washington would tell a doctor  what he or she can or cannot say to a patient in a private medical  conversation.   I have been around here long enough to remember when the Republicans  were preaching that government should never come between a patient and  his or her doctor. Why the change? Since taking office, President Trump  and his Republican colleagues have repeatedly prioritized restricting  women's reproductive freedoms and have strategically placed obstacles  in the way of their accessing the healthcare they deserve. Donald Trump  and our Republican friends believe they know better than American  women. That is wrong, and American women totally disagree with them.   Yet, while the Republicans across the country push these proposals,  they look the other way when President Trump proposes cutting programs  that help newborns and young children.   The President wants to cut Medicaid by more than $1 trillion. That  provides healthcare coverage for 37 million children. He wants to  eliminate programs that support emergency medical health services for  children and that address autism and developmental disorders.   I hope my Republican colleagues will join us instead of slipping down  this radical, ideological, and deeply misguided path to strip away the  rights of women.                                   H.R. 268    Now on disaster relief, as I said yesterday, the question of  providing funding for our fellow Americans hurt by natural disasters is  not an either-or proposition, but Republicans have treated it like one.  They argue that we can either have funding for our neighbors in the  Midwest, or we can pursue aid for Puerto Rico that the President  opposes. For the President of the United States to pit American  citizens against each other is simply un-American, and for Republicans  in the Senate to go along with him is exhibit A of their refusal to  stand up.   Some of my colleagues have said: Well, we are giving Puerto Rico just  food stamp money. OK. Let's give all the other States just food stamp  money. See if they think that is going to help them rebuild their homes  and deal with the roads and all the other things that natural disasters  have brought. Of course not.   That is the double standard, and it is not going to happen. We know  the House, to their credit, is standing firm.   Let's come up with a compromise that funds both. As Americans have  always done when American citizens in one part of the country are in  trouble because of disaster, we come together and help them all--not  just the ones the President likes or finds politically advantageous but  all. We don't say: We will give just food stamps to some but complete  disaster relief to the others. That is wrong, and that hurts American  citizens in Puerto Rico and elsewhere.   Last week, Senator Leahy and I presented a solution that solves all  the problems--$16.7 billion in relief for all Americans affected by  natural disasters, including $2.5 billion in new funding that could  help communities with the new disasters in the Midwest. It had support  for Puerto Rico and the people in the other territories.   It is about time we stop this standoff, pass disaster relief, and  help our fellow Americans before the next storms make their unwelcome  arrival.                                 Nominations    Finally, on judges, today, the Republican leader will follow through  on his plan to remake the judiciary in the image of President Trump.  Irony of ironies, the first nominee we will consider is a gentleman who  supported the Republican leader's decision to not consider even a  committee hearing or a vote on Merrick Garland. That is galling.   Mr. Domenico and the other nominees we will consider today are  outside the mainstream--way outside the mainstream--and should not be  rushed through this body. Two hours of debate on a lifetime  appointment? Shame on our Republican friends who went along with that.   By participating in this sham process, every Republican will fully  own each and every radical decision each of these nominees makes. We  see what is happening now. A very conservative justice in Texas is  taking healthcare away from millions of Americans. He is taking away  their protection for preexisting conditions.   My fellow Republicans, you are on warning: If you keep voting for  these judges, you are going to carry the burden of their awful  decisions that will hurt so many Americans. They are so far out of the  mainstream.   I yield the floor.
