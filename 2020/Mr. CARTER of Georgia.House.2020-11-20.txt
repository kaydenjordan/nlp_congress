 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and  honor Jim Galloway on his retirement from The Atlanta Journal- Constitution.   He most recently served as AJC's political columnist and has been a  writer and editor there for over 41 years.   Jim knows Atlanta like the back of his hand, and he covered some of  its most prominent figures and events.   He was responsible for creating the AJC's Political Insider Blog,  which is one of the south's most influential political news sites.   Starting in 1992, Jim led the newspaper's Presidential coverage. He  also covered various topics on religion, and even led the AJC foreign  desk.   I am thankful for Jim's many years of dedication to reporting in an  honest and balanced manner, and I wish him the best as he begins his  retirement.                            ____________________
