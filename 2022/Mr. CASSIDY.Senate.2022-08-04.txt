 Mr. President, James Bollich was born on April 15, 1921,  in Mowata, LA. As a young man, he joined the U.S. Army Air Corps and  participated in Louisiana maneuvers in 1941.   In 1942, he was deployed to the Philippines, and 18 days after his  arrival, Congress voted to enter World War II. Mr. Bollich served as an  infantryman on the island of Luzon and fought valiantly during the  Battle of Bataan. He was captured by Imperial Japanese forces and was  forced to endure the Bataan Death March. Mr. Bollich later spent more  than 3 years as a prisoner of war in Mukden, Manchuria. On August 15,  1945, his 24th birthday, Mr. Bollich and his fellow survivors were  freed by the Russian Army.   After the war, Mr. Bollich transitioned into civilian life, and  attended college at the University of Southwest Louisiana. He and his  wife Celia raised their family in Lafayette, LA, and worked as an  exploration geologist until his retirement in 1986. He was the author  of several books including ``A Soldier's Story,'' where he detailed his  time as a serviceman and a prisoner of war.   Mr. Bollich received many commendations during his military service  including the Purple Heart, Bronze Star medal, Prisoner of War medal,  WWII Victory medal, Presidential Unit citation with two oakleaf  clusters, American Campaign Medal, Asiatic-Pacific medal with 2 bronze  stars, Army Good Conduct medal, American Defense medal with one bronze  star, Philippine Presidents badge, Philippine Defense medal, Philippine  Liberation medal, and the Philippine Independence medal.

Mr. Bollich was an  American hero and should be honored as such.                            ____________________
