 Madam Speaker, it is a pleasure being here today. As we  say in east Tennessee, you class up the joint. Thank you for allowing  me to be here.   Today, I rise to celebrate the 90th birthday of one of my dearest  friends, Julia Tucker, 90 years old.   Julia has served the Knoxville community in many different ways over  the years. Julia was the first woman to chair the Knoxville City School  Board, where she served with my daddy.   Julia is a force to be reckoned with, and she fights for things that  are important to her. Julia once saved her unconscious neighbors' lives  during a gas leak by dragging them out of their house.  [[Page H2552]]    Since Julia's son, Bill, lost his tragic battle with AIDS in 1991,  Julia has dedicated her life to raising money and awareness to combat  the disease and also to fight the bigotry. I still have his minibike, a  ``Lil'' Indian, in my collection, and I treasure it very much.   Julia also honored her son by building Williamswood Castle, which is  a castle modeled after a Scottish hunting lodge, in Knoxville,  Tennessee, Madam Speaker. Bill was a historic preservationist way  before his time. People weren't doing things like that, and Bill kind  of set the mark for it. Bill was incredibly proud of his family's  Scottish heritage, and this castle is a unique way for Julia to  preserve her son's memory.   Julia allowed my sweet little girl, Isabelle, to have her birthday  party there, and it was magical.   Julia also serves on committees and boards for local organizations.  Julia adopts orphan dogs--I guess me being one of them--and fiercely  loves her family and friends.   When I was mayor of Knox County, I had the privilege of publicly  recognizing Julia's exemplary work in the community, and now I am  pleased to stand on the House floor and wish her a happy 90th birthday.   Julia was the first person I knew who had cable TV. She introduced me  to Shirley Temples and rare roast beef sandwiches when I was a little  boy.   Madam Speaker, I wish Julia a happy birthday. Julia is loved by many  people, and especially the Burchetts.                                time  1100           Honoring the Service of Corporal Rollen Delano Bradshaw     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Corporal Rollen  Delano Bradshaw, an American hero and Korean War veteran, as  Tennessee's Second Congressional District's Veteran of the Month.   Corporal Bradshaw was rejected three times from joining the military  during the Korean War because of his partial blindness, but he didn't  let that get in the way of his patriotism. With just a seventh-grade  education and a whole lot of persistence, he memorized the eye chart  and was accepted into the United States Army on his fourth attempt.   Corporal Bradshaw served in Korea for 18 months, where he worked as a  postal clerk delivering mail to his fellow soldiers. While deployed,  Corporal Bradshaw earned the Korean Service Medal with Bronze Star, the  United Nations Service Medal, National Defense Service Medal,  Meritorious Unit Commendation, and the Republic of Korea Presidential  Unit Citation.   Following his service, Corporal Bradshaw spent 17 years in American  Legion leadership roles, serving as commander at Post 120 for 15 years  and as Tennessee's national executive committeeman for 20 years.   Corporal Bradshaw remains dedicated to his military fraternity to  this day. Every year, he coordinates Loudon County's Memorial Day and  Veteran's Day ceremonies. Our country's heroes are the men and women of  our Armed Forces and those that wear our country's badges, like  Corporal Rollen D. Bradshaw, who served and sacrificed for our freedom.   Thank you for your service. And, brother, I am truly sorry to hear  about the passing of your sweet wife.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, Joe Biden says America is on the move  again. But to me, folks, it looks like Americans are still at home.  There are a record 8 million job openings in America right now. Eight  million, folks. That is the population of the great State of Tennessee,  where I come from.   We are hurting small business recovery and the economic growth. We  have got to get our country back to work, Mr. Speaker. Joe Biden and  the Democrat policies are not helping our recovery. The $15 minimum  wage makes it harder on the very small businesses. The McDonald's  restaurants in the district that I represent are now starting folks off  at $15 an hour, and some are offering health benefits as well.   Bonus unemployment benefits that we are paying Americans to stay at  home is just not working. The job-killing regulations that are directed  at industries, like our energy sector, as well. The Green New Deal and  more of this push to the left is only hurting us further.   Worst of all, we are pushing tax increases during an economic  recovery. This is totally backwards, Mr. Speaker, and this is keeping  Americans dependent on Big Government, which I am not so certain is not  the ultimate goal.   Instead, we need to be encouraging the private sector to invest in  recovery areas. My Opportunity Extension Act does just that, giving  investors more time to use the highly successful Opportunity Zones  program.   Opportunities Zones are in areas that are hit hardest by COVID  economic fallout. These Opportunity Zones represent areas such as our  rural areas and our inner cities, areas which I am proud to represent.   Our Opportunity Zones were responsible for $52 billion--$52 billion,  Mr. Speaker--in new investment, and a half a million new jobs in our  underserved areas before COVID hit.   This bill renews investment in these communities. It spurs economic  growth. It attracts business. It is creating good-paying jobs, a much  better alternative than the Federal Government handouts being pushed by  many of my colleagues across the aisle.   Mr. Speaker, I would be happy to discuss my bill further with anyone  who is interested.   I thank the vice chairman for yielding to me. I appreciate you for  organizing this event, brother.
