 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of the  Fair Investment Opportunities for Professional Experts Act. This is a  bipartisan bill. It expands economic opportunities for many, many  Americans because, to date, only an individual's wealth has been taken  into consideration when defining whether he meets the qualifications or  she meets the qualifications of an accredited investor under our  securities laws. The simple fix proposed by this bill will empower  those with financial expertise and those with experience to join the  ranks of those who can invest in private, high-growth companies.   It was explained very eloquently here by the bill's author, and I  think that this commonplace change is going to broaden the pool of  startup capital. That is going to help companies looking to grow,  companies looking to add jobs.   At the same time, it provides an investment opportunity, one with  greater upside and more risk, to those previously locked out of the  private placement market. This includes many educated young Americans  who have not yet had time to grow their pocketbooks but do have the  expertise in these areas.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I have seen firsthand that the  entrepreneurial spirit is certainly alive and well in California and  all across this country, and this bill before us today ensures that  more Americans can participate in both the risk and reward of the  startup economy.   Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support passage of H.R.  1585.
