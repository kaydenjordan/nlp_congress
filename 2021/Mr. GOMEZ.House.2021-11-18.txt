 Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a second-generation American.  I am the son of Mexican immigrants who came here in pursuit of the  American promise; a promise that if you work hard and follow the rules,  you will succeed, and your children and grandchildren will build on  that success.   Unfortunately, the promise has eluded far too many Americans,  particularly the working class and people of color. Although some of  them feel America has given up on them, they have refused to give up on  America. That is why we must pass the Build Back Better Act to make  historic investments in our people and our planet and put the American  promise within reach of an entire generation for the first time.   Through the Build Back Better Act, we have an opening to invest in  children and families by expanding the child tax credit and universal  pre-K, give millions of families an affordable place to call home, and  tackle climate change while creating good-paying jobs. We have a chance  to redefine our commitment to the American people and to move toward a  more just, equitable, and perfect Union.
