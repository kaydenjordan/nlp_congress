 Madam President, before I speak about the legislation  we are going to be voting on shortly, I wanted to mention today's  significant Supreme Court decision to protect the LGBTQ community and  Americans from discrimination in the workplace.   This is a very important step forward. Gay and transgender Americans  should not face discrimination in the workplace or live in fear of  losing their jobs simply because of who they are, and it is an  important step forward but is also long overdue.   My home State of Washington has been a leader on this issue for  decades, but--just think--until today, June 15, 2020, we had no  nationwide rules against firing an employee or harassing someone at  work for being gay, lesbian, bisexual, or trans. That is just wrong,  and LGBTQ+ Americans still face discrimination in far too many areas of  life: public accommodations, housing, education, and some federally  funded programs.   We have proposed legislation that would be, I believe, comprehensive  civil rights and anti-discrimination legislation to help protect this  community. The House has passed this legislation, and I believe it is  time that the Senate pass this legislation.   Leader McConnell and the Republicans should take the Equality Act out  of the legislative graveyard and get it onto the Senate floor. Today I  join my colleagues Senators Merkley, Baldwin, and others who are  calling for Senate action on this important issue.   Again, I want to emphasize how important and fundamental I think this  decision was and how challenging and disappointed I am that we have had  legislation to protect this community that we could have passed decades  ago.                                  H.R. 1957    Madam President, I also rise to talk about the several votes we are  going to have on public lands coming up, and one of them is about a  budget point of order.   In my mind, budget points of order are about cost. Well, we are here  to talk about what a good investment public land is.   We have the Grand Canyon. We understand that. It is a good  investment. Mt. Rainier, in my home State of Washington--a good  investment--is an iconic mountain, maybe, to some, but we in the State  of Washington also know that it brings in millions of dollars in  revenue and millions of visitors.   That is just what our public lands do: They become icons. The  preservation of the natural world is a good investment--in my mind,  better than roads and bridges and buildings--because it actually lasts  for centuries. Places like the Grand Tetons or Denali--which are in  other States--literally are icons to all of us and help us from one  generation to the next.   Besides being icons, they do pay for themselves. That is, the  economic return of public lands is phenomenal. It does create, but it  generates. It generates activity that generates income to county  governments, to State governments, and to the Federal Government--and  lots of private entities are involved.   So hundreds of billions of dollars are spent. In fact, $877 billion  was part of a report that was issued a few years ago. You might not  think of that right off the top of your head because you are thinking  about some aspect of the outdoors, and you might not think of it as  generating dollars, but, OK, try a few of the brand names on, whether  it is REI or The North Face or Columbia Sportswear Company--or just  your local fishing guide who does whitewater rafting or fishing or  other outdoor activities.   These lands are basically generating billions of dollars in revenue.  So, in my mind, the fact that they are receiving oil and gas offshore  leasing revenue, along with getting the benefit of the public lands-- and generating all of that revenue--to me, is very sound fiscal policy  and a great investment.   So, to me, the issue isn't the budget point of order as much as it is  the question of why this program has been around for so long and the  money wasn't used in the program. Probably somewhere around $20 billion  has been used for other things instead of the intended purpose of the  Land and Water Conservation Fund. Maybe it is because not everybody was  on board with spending that amount of money for public lands, but I  think we are here today to say there is a new coalition of people who  are willing to say that, and they do see the economic return.   We are specifically passing a law that says that you are going to  spend those dollars for that and that the other purposes Congress may  have decided in the past are not the specific purpose but that public  land is.   So I am very happy we are making this investment that, in my mind, is  one of the smartest fiscal policies we could ever make; that is, to  spend money not from the taxpayer but from these private entities on  offshore drilling that goes into something for the benefit of the  taxpayer and that generates economic return to all of us.   I can't ask for a better tax policy or fiscal policy than to use it  to preserve open space and public land and generate revenue and help  all of us enjoy the outdoors.   As I said, revenue raising from offshore leasing and investing in  public land was exactly what Scoop Jackson had in mind when he authored  the Land and Water Conservation Fund more than 50 years ago, and it is  actually what we should be doing. I am glad my colleagues have realized  this is the right fiscal policy. It is good for us, and it is good for  America's future.   I know that Scoop Jackson would be very happy, and I know his son  Peter, who just passed recently, would also be very happy that this  correction is being made.   This will be the first time that the money is fully used for the  intended purpose of what the money and revenue was put into the fund to  do. I am glad we are making this milestone happen, and I encourage my  colleagues to think about this fiscal policy. The fiscal policy that  benefits the United States by having open space and public lands  generates $877 billion.   Yes, if you want another reminder, this is a view of downtown Seattle  from a very famous park, Gas Works Park, in the north end of Lake  Union.  [[Page S2964]]  That park probably wouldn't be there if we didn't have the Land and  Water Conservation Fund. The idea was, as Scoop said, as America  urbanized, we needed to preserve open space for the public to use it.  Some of the most iconic open spaces across the United States have been  created for the public to enjoy.   So let's reaffirm our commitment that was always there. Let's turn  down the budget point of order and make sure that we are making the  right investments and finish moving this legislation to its final  passage   I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
