 Mr. Speaker, tomorrow House Republicans will  perpetrate a careless financial assault on good, hardworking America in  exchange for a massive payoff to greedy insurance executives and their  cronies. Yes, this vote is rigged against the good.   If you are 50 to 64 years old, you and your family get clobbered.  More doughnut holes, more premiums, and less health care.   UnitedHealthcare, one of America's largest private insurers, is today  under investigation for defrauding the Medicare program of billions of  dollars. Your bill, in 17 words on page 67, rewards UnitedHealthcare,  their executives and cronies, with a massive tax cut. UnitedHealthcare  made $83 billion last year, and their CEO was compensated with $66  million. They don't need a break. Hardworking America does.  [[Page H2301]]    Your bill also allows UnitedHealthcare to charge five times more for  older Americans, and imposes a 30 percent unemployment tax on the  unemployed, all going to more profits for them and less health care for  America.                            ____________________
