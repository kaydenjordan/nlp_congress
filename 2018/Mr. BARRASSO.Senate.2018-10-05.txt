 Mr. President, today I wish to submit for the Record a  column written by Mr. Dennis Sun, a Wyoming journalist and rancher,  entitled ``The Act is Broken.'' The article was published in the  Wyoming Livestock Roundup on August 29, 2018.   Since its passage in 1973, the Endangered Species Act has contributed  to the recovery of iconic species like the bald eagle. It has been an  important conservation tool, but it is in need of an update.   Wyoming has invested more than $50 million for the recovery of the  grizzly bear alone. Twice in the last decade, the U.S. Fish and  Wildlife Service has found that the grizzly bear met all recovery  targets and no longer should be protected as ``threatened'' under the  Endangered Species Act. Courts have twice overturned the delisting  decisions and, in so doing, undermined the expert opinion of wildlife  biologists who set, approved, and met recovery goals.   Mr. Sun's article highlights the case of the grizzly bear as a prime  example for why my efforts to give states more opportunities to engage  in conservation under the act have merit. The successful recovery of  the grizzly bear took decades, but I am hopeful we will be able to  improve the act and improve conservation much faster.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:              [From Wyoming Livestock Roundup, Aug. 29, 2018]                             The Act is Broken                         (By Dennis Sun, Publisher)         On Sept. 24, U.S. District Court Judge Dana Christensen       issued his decision that stopped the delisting of the Greater       Yellowstone Ecosystem grizzly bear.        This ruling was not unexpected, as Judge Christensen had       already ruled twice to postpone the planned grizzly bear       hunting seasons.        The case was brought by some wildlife advocates and a       couple of tribes. They argued the bears face continued       threats from climate change and loss of habitat. The case was       based on more procedural action that they felt was not       included the delisting study. During this trial, the       questions Judge Christensen asked gave lawyers for Wyoming       and the Mountain States Legal Foundation the notion he was       going to rule against the state, and he did. An appeal to the       Ninth Circuit Court in San Francisco, Calif. is most likely       not going to happen, as that court doesn't rule in favor of       the western states often. The Ninth Circuit tends to be       pretty liberal in its views.        The grizzly bear is now under the jurisdiction of the U.S.       Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS).        Gov. Matt Mead said, ``I am disappointed with this       decision. Grizzly bear recovery should be viewed as a       conservation success story. Due to Wyoming's investment of       approximately $50 million for recovery and management,       grizzly bears have exceeded every scientifically established       recovery criteria in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem since       2003. Numbers have risen from as few as 136 bears when they       were listed in 1975, to more than 700 today.''        Gov. Mead also noted, ``Biologists correctly determined       grizzly bears no longer needed Endangered Species Act (ESA)       protections. The decision to return grizzly bears to the list       of threatened and endangered species is further evidence the       ESA is not working as its drafters intended. Congress should       modernize the ESA so we can celebrate successes and focus our       efforts on species in need.''        Government biologists contended that Yellowstone's       grizzlies were thriving, having adapted to changes in their       diet and are among the best managed bears in the world. If       the judge's ruling would have different, FWS would have also       lifted federal protection for around 1,000 grizzly bears in       the Glacier National Park and the Bob Marshall Wilderness       Area of Montana, but the ruling stopped that, as well.        Just like dealing with the wolf issues, this ruling will       take some time to get straightened out. Hopefully President       Trump, our Congress, Sen. Barrasso and other states will get       an improved and revised ESA bill passed--that is what it will       take to delist bears. More states are having issues with       endangered species. In Washington, ranchers see wolf       predation on livestock, so we should have more sympathy to       get ESA corrected.        There is a big push today that says many of the risks faced       by many species today result from habitat modifications       caused by  [[Page S6629]]       climate change. Well, if the habitat is changing, usually the       species will adapt also. Studies show that is happening. If       the grizzly bears are short of white bark pine nuts, that       doesn't mean they can compensate by eating livestock or       attacking people. Let's be reasonable about this.                            ____________________
