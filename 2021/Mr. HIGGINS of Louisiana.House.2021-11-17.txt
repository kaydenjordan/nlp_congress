 Madam Speaker, America is being crushed  under the oppressive weight of the Democrats' greed for lust and power.  They want totalitarian control over every aspect of American life, and  they are ruling the people's House as if they were royalty. America is  dissolving under our feet, and Democrats are worried about cartoons.   In Afghanistan, Democrats led the betrayal of American honor and  abandonment of American citizens, granting control of the Afghan  theater to Taliban terrorists and arming those jihadist terrorists with  billions of dollars worth of American weapons systems.   Our southern border control has disintegrated, American sovereignty  lost, and control of our own border completely ceded to criminal  cartels.   American parents are tracked like terrorists and persecuted by our  own FBI because parents had the audacity to challenge government  indoctrination of their children, assembling to redress their  grievances at their own school boards in their own communities.  American parents are treated like criminals.   Americans are dealing with unbelievable inflation. Families cannot  afford groceries and fuel.   Millions of Americans are being commanded by Federal decree to choose  between losing their job or kneeling to comply with an  unconstitutional, mandated medical procedure.   And the oppressors intend to distract you with cartoons.   Over the Speaker's podium are forever etched the words ``In God We  Trust.'' Scripture says: A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is  born for adversity.   Madam Speaker, I stand today with my brother Paul Gosar because I  stand against oppression and persecution.
