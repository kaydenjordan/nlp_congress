 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this  resolution.   ``Impressionable children are watching all of this, and they are  learning from us. I believe we each have a moral obligation to exercise  good judgment and model the behavior we hope they will emulate.'' That  was Betsy DeVos.   ``As I am sure is the case with many of you, it has deeply troubled  me in a way that I simply cannot set aside.'' That was Elaine Chao.   Mr. Speaker, these were members of the President's own Cabinet who  bore the sacred responsibility of taking action when the President is  clearly unfit for office. But their words are all talk, and if they  will not act, then Congress will.   So, today, we are giving the Vice President 24 hours to do right by  the American people. Remove this President from office, and if you do  not, the House will impeach.
