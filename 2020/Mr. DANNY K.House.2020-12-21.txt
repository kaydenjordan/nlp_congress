 DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support  of the 900 billion dollar economic relief package which has been agreed  to by Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. While this  package is far from what is actually needed, it is necessary to act  right now and we do not have any additional time to wait. This bill  will direct billions of dollars in aid to unemployed individuals who  are suffering with no other hope or help in sight.   It will provide up to $600 in stimulus checks, it will extend  unemployment benefit checks, extend a moratorium on evictions for 1  month, 325 billion for business relief with 275 billion going to  paycheck protection, 82 billion for schools, 20 billion for vaccine  distribution. While this is not quite exactly what I was looking for,  it will hold us until President Biden takes the reins and leads us on.
