 Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Dr. Beth Pelz, a  criminal justice professor at the University of Houston-Downtown.   For over 30 years she helped countless criminal justice students and  her community, and now she is enjoying a well-deserved retirement.   Throughout her career she helped students access scholarship funds to  pursue higher education, with some of those funds extending to the  University of Houston-Downtown Police Academy.   She also established the Robert S. Brown Memorial Scholarship fund to  help criminal justice students. Dr. Pelz helped and assisted law  enforcement in both Houston County and Harris County, related to street  and prison gang issues. She is an expert.   In fact, Dr. Pelz played a very important role as one of my  professors while I attended the school for my master's degree. Dr. Pelz  helped shape and mold countless public servants and law enforcement  officers throughout her dedicated career. I thank her for mentoring me  and helping prepare me to serve my community during my time as the  sheriff of Fort Bend County, Texas.   Madam Speaker, I wish her the most well-deserved retirement after her  tireless dedication to every student at the University of Houston, and  those she helped in the community.   Beth, you truly mean the world to me. I love you.                            ____________________
