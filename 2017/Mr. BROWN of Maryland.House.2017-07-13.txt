 Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this  House discriminating against transgender Americans and restricting  their ability to serve our country, saying now is not the time for a  social experiment. I firmly believe that the privilege and  responsibility to defend our country should not be denied to anyone  based on gender identification.   Prior to the 1950s, the ``not a social experiment'' argument was used  to deny African Americans from fully participating in our military.  Today there is a long history of service and heroism by African  Americans, including Generals Colin Powell and Vincent Brooks.   Prior to 2010, the ``not a social experiment'' argument was used to  keep gays and lesbians from full participation in our military. Today  there is a long line of distinguished service by gay and lesbian  servicemembers, including Generals Randy Taylor and Tammy Smith.   Today there is a long line of transgender servicemembers who are  ready to distinguish themselves. I welcome their service and appreciate  their willingness to sacrifice for our Nation.   As a Member of Congress, I will never deny that privilege and  responsibility to those who want to serve.                            ____________________
