 Madam Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume  to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Langworthy).    Madam Speaker, tonight. We are actually going to  continue on a theme. I am going to try to dial back sounding like a  jerk tonight, but I have been trying to make a point on the scale of  the debt, the level we are at, the misunderstanding on its growth, and  some potential solutions.   We are also going to spend a little bit of time tonight--and this is  what I was sort of pre-apologizing for--I am going to show that some of  my brothers' and sisters' ideas from the left on raise this tax, do  this, do that, don't even count as rounding errors.   Let's actually start with some of the boards here.   I have shown this a half dozen times, and I keep showing it because  this is what I have bad dreams about. If you live in a world of math-- and I know  [[Page H3945]]  this is, functionally, a math-free zone--but when we finished the debt  ceiling deal, we basically got some applause by economists saying you  basically moved yourself from maybe 120 to maybe 115 percent of debt- to-GDP at the end of the 9 years.   That was the CBO number, but then some of the outside economists came  in. Moody's Analytics said there are other things going on--the higher  interest rates, the dramatic increase in spending in Medicare.  Remember, the first 7 months of this year, we spent 16 percent more on  Medicare. Next year's interest will functionally be three-quarters of a  trillion dollars. We weren't supposed to hit numbers like that for  years, but the one that took my breath away was when the Bloomberg  economists--and these aren't slouches, they have a really good data  system--said their model was coming back with higher interest rates,  higher healthcare costs, lower labor force participation, and some of  the other things we don't talk about because it doesn't really fit our  scenario.   I am going to hyper-simplify this, and I have done this a handful of  times, but I am trying to get the concept through. As part of the deal  6 weeks ago, this $700 billion that is in the nondefense discretionary,  we are going to cut a hundred billion of that. Bloomberg economists  basically say that the removal of that $100 billion is necessary, but  it also slows down the economy by about a half a percent of GDP.   We don't seem to understand when we do policies like this, which we  need to do, you also have to be adopting policies that backfill the  growth. This place can barely walk and chew gum, and that is why this  number here was so terrifying when the Bloomberg economists were  saying, functionally, that 9-year window 10 years from now--and the  reason we say 9 years is because we are already working on next year's  budget and appropriations and spending--it is 130 percent of debt-to- GDP, $51 trillion of borrowing. If interest rates even go back to a  somewhat more normal number, that is almost $2 trillion a year in  interest.   That is functionally 9 years from now, and we are going to do what?  We are not going to talk about it. We are going to be just giddy, and  say, look at the hard work we did. We removed a hundred billion dollars  out of discretionary.   I know my math is different than the Congressional Budget Office and  at the end of September, we will find out which one of us had a better  calculator; however, I have been right more times this year than they  have. I know that is boastful, but I can prove it. Go back and look at  some of my floor speeches and we have got the quarterly reports from  Treasury.   I have us this fiscal year coming in around $1.84 trillion of  borrowing. Why is that important? The 2023-fiscal year discretionary,  Defense and nondefense discretionary included, was supposed to be a  total spend of $1.836 billion; meaning, every dime of what you think of  as government is on borrowed money this year.   When we go home and talk to our constituents, do we say, Do you know  all of Defense, all of the Supreme Court, all of the State Department,  all of everything you think of as government is on borrowed money? Is  that what we do? How many times do we go home and we get someone that  says we just got rid of foreign aid, and then I show them my chart that  foreign aid is 12 days of borrowing. They just look at you with  daggers, then say it is waste and fraud. But the Democrats do something  that drives me insane when they say, just tax rich people more.   I am going to show you some boards here that basically show that is  theater. It is not real math. Let's actually walk through some of the  things going on right now, and I am going to go back and forth on some  of these boards. There is going to be a reason why I am doing it this  way. I spent the last 2 weeks, when I came to this microphone talking  about obesity and diabetes--and that is a really dangerous thing  sometimes to come and talk about, but diabetes is 33 percent of all  U.S. healthcare. It is 31 percent of all Medicare spending. We need to  talk about it. Our brothers and sisters in this country are dying, and  we are afraid to talk about it.   I am going to spend the first part here sounding like an economist on  steroids and I am going to try to explain what the cost is, then I am  going to talk a little bit about just the simple morality of not doing  anything.   Let's actually play a game here. Estimated deficit reduction for  2023, if you actually were just to take on obesity-related illnesses  this fiscal year using current math, $283 billion.   Remember, the Democrats' tax proposal, the President's tax proposal  was, we are going to go from 37 percent to 39 percent for top earners.  That is a stagnant number. None of these are dynamically scored on the  effects on the economy because if you made people healthier on this  side, the economy would grow.   When you raise peoples' taxes, the economy shrinks, but the stagnant  number is $30 billion. Just obesity-related spending will be $283  billion this fiscal year to the taxpayers and the Democrats, the  President's tax hike produces 30 billion.   Does anyone see the insanity here? We basically did the math for  everyone, saying Democrats would have to increase the top tax rate to  62 percent to raise the same amount of money as getting rid of obesity  for people on government programs.   That is uncomfortable to talk about, but think about that. You  basically have to raise the top tax rate to 62 percent just to produce  the revenues of receipts for this population here. I am struggling,  trying to find a creative way to get people to think about the path of  having a healthier America is both moral and it is great economics.   Let's try it another way: Estimated deficit reduction for fiscal year  2024 to 2033, functionally, that is 9 fiscal years. We expect Federal  spending on severe obesity, not the mainstream, to be $1.724 trillion.  If anyone wants to see this report once it is officially voted on, this  will be on the Republican side of the Joint Economic Committee, chapter  3. Read it. It is brilliant. $1.724 trillion over, functionally, that  10-year cycle, just for severely obese populations. These are for  Medicare, Medicaid, Indian Health Services, veterans, taking care of  our brothers and sisters, because of the illnesses that come with this.                                time  2045    You would have to increase the top tax rate to 49 percent to raise  the same amount of money as getting rid of severe obesity. We are not  talking obesity, just the severe obesity. Remember, last week, I  brought the charts on how it is rated.   We are told, of the 4,000 human conditions, illnesses, misery, half  of them are related to obesity. Are we willing to talk about it as we  do the farm legislation? Are we willing to talk about it with some of  the new technologies? I am going to touch on those that are available  to us. Are we willing to talk about just what is happening with how  many prime-age working males are not in the labor force? The number one  thing we are seeing isn't substance abuse. It is close, but it is  actually health related to obesity.   Let's try another one here. Let's see if I can make myself a complete  pariah around here from telling the truth on the math.   Estimated deficit reduction for 2023, projected Federal spending on  severe obesity, just that very top threshold, this budget year will be  $115 billion. This is, once again, just in Medicare, Medicaid, Indian  Health Services, and veterans. Democrats would have to raise the top  tax rate to 47 percent to raise the amount of money just this  population costs.   Am I at least making a point here that the discussions say, ``Just  raise taxes. That takes care of it''?   Remember, what do we borrow per second over the last 12 months?  $63,000 every second is what we have borrowed over the last 12 months.   One more of these. This is estimated deficit reduction between '24  and '33, the estimated deficit reduction, projected Federal spending on  all obesity-related illnesses. Remember, this is a static number. There  is also, we estimate, about another trillion-and-a-half that you would  gain in productivity because these populations can actually come back  and participate in society. Over that time, it is over $4 trillion that  our government will spend.   Now, add in another $1.5 trillion on the economic vitality you gain,  and  [[Page H3946]]  you would actually have to have a marginal tax rate of the top earners  in this country of 65 percent to come close to covering that cost. That  is for one illness.   It is the illness that is the most expensive in our society because  it is related to diabetes, kidney failure, heart attacks, and  everything else. Am I sort of making the point? We are seeing over $4  trillion just in the disease, and the Biden tax proposal produces $375  billion over the 10 years.   For those of you who are not really good at math, $375 billion is a  hell of a lot less than $4 trillion. This is the lunacy here, where the  theater is so much more important than the reality and the math.   Let's actually walk through this. Joint Economic Committee  Republicans estimate the cost of obesity over the 10 years--the 10  years we are about to start the budget cycle on--is $5.6 trillion. If  you want to start to stabilize debt to GDP, can we at least have a  conversation about this?   You start to see the mortality statistics in this country, the number  of working-age people, people who should be actually living their  lives, who are dying and are dying early.   I am going to show you a chart in a little bit of our young people  and what is going on there.   The game of avoiding this discussion needs to come to an end because  the economics and the morality of it are here. Let's pull our heads out  and have time to actually have that difficult conversation.   Let's do the next one. This one is really interesting. The estimated  economic cost is actually $2.6 trillion of growth in the GDP. This  isn't spending. I just showed you a few trillion dollars of spending.  This would be actual growth in the size of the economy and  participation because our brothers and sisters actually are not sick.  Their ability to come back and be a part of society, $2.6 trillion over  that 10 years.   We worked hard on this math. We spent months vetting it. I will argue  that it is incredibly conservative math.   Let's have a little more fun here. Maybe you just don't care. Maybe  you are one of these people that, you know, sends in things to my  office, and all you care about is you want more money for something.  Fine. Do you at least care about your kids and your grandkids? I have  two young kids. When I look around, I am terrified of what I see. We  are actually looking at the growth of obesity amongst our kids. Do you  understand what happens to their life, their life expectancy, their  ability to participate in their society when you start to see numbers  growing like this?   We are actually starting to see a world where, at the end of this  decade, 12 percent of our children will be morbidly obese. It is  uncomfortable to say, but that is the math.   In 10 years, half of our kids are technically--is this moral? Should  we not talk about it? It is going on. This is the math. Understand what  it does to the society. An unhealthy society doesn't grow, doesn't have  economic vitality. Then, you start to wonder why all day long our  hallways are full of people saying: ``I need you to spend more money on  this. Because we can't find workers, we can't do this.'' Yet, we come  back and show data that basically says there are 3.5 million prime-age  working males that aren't in the economy. Then, the economists come  back and do the stats. The demographer comes in and sits there and  rattles off the numbers, and we start to realize the number one cause  wasn't substance abuse. It was obesity. Am I starting to make a point  here?   This is life expectancy for 18 years old and older by their BMI  class. Do you understand functionally, in the last 4 years, life  expectancy in the United States has fallen? Is that moral? Does anyone  care? Even when you adjust for COVID, our lifespans are falling in this  country.   It turns out, in digging and digging, the primary reason is this. We  have this stratified by different ethnicities, different genders, but  you start to actually see what we are seeing here in the numbers. You  start seeing in some of our populations that the life expectancy is 66  years.    A little while ago, the Congressional Black Caucus took the first  hour, and they talked about the morality of their issues. I would argue  this is their issue. This is all of our issue, but no one else will  talk about it.   Yes, there is some happy stuff coming.   Part of the point I have been trying to make over and over is let's  just talk about diabetes. Thirty-one percent of all Medicare spending  is just diabetes. One in four TRICARE dollars in the United States is  just diabetes. Thirty-three percent of Medicare benefits are spent for  folks with diabetes. Sixty-seven percent of the $327 billion spent on  diabetes is by government insurance, and that is from way back in 2017.  Today, it is dramatically higher, but that is the last year we could  actually get the number.   Five of the top 10 part D drugs--this one drives me crazy. Remember,  we are having all of this debate about all this money: You are spending  too much money on pharmaceuticals. These part D drugs are driving so  much of the debt and deficit. Half of those top 10 drugs, half of them,  are drugs for diabetes.   Does anyone see sort of the trend here? Am I making sort of a flow of  a concept? Is consciousness coming with us?   The Joint Economic Committee Republicans: Medicare spending will  double, functionally being $22 trillion over the next 10 years.   I have come here for the last couple of years and brought the chart  that basically shows, over the next 30 years, 100 percent of the $130  trillion of borrowing, all of borrowing growth, 75 percent is the  shortfall on Medicare and 25 percent is the shortfall on Social  Security if we choose to backfill it.   Remember, we are functionally 9 years away from the Social Security  trust fund being gone, and in that same 10 years, the transportation  trust fund is gone, and the Medicare part A trust fund is gone.   We dink around with stupid stuff around here, not taking seriously  that the wheels are coming off. It turns out there are some things that  are absolutely moral we could be doing if anyone here actually gave a  damn.   A couple more of these concepts, and then we are going to do some of  the positive side, some of the plan.   JEC, Joint Economic Committee, Republicans, project annual healthcare  costs attributed to severe obesity. This is interesting. This is for  the sick person. This is for the person with obesity--severe obesity,  not regular. They spend another over $14,000 per year on top of their  other healthcare costs. The problem is a huge portion of this  population is also on government-paid-for healthcare.   Here is the one that I expect I will get the nastygrams on tomorrow,  so let's have at it.   Joint Economic Committee Republicans annual increase of Medicare  expenses caused by obesity-related health: $3,500 a year per taxpayer.  $3,500 a year per taxpayer is functionally what obesity costs. That is  me sounding like the accountant on steroids, but the math always wins.  I am sorry if it is uncomfortable. Bless you, but the math always wins.   Let's actually come back and say I have actually convinced someone  out there that maybe we should make America healthier and actually have  an honest discussion about what is going on because these numbers have  just gone skyrocketing over the last 10 years.   Let's talk about a couple of things here. This is just another  example. I have brought a handful of these. This is a blood glucose  monitor you can have on your body. It is fairly cheap and incredibly  effective on stabilizing someone with a prediabetic condition.   We are about to have a pill for obesity. It is the next generation of  these GLP-1s. It is coming. It is almost through the process. There is  a whole series of other categories of weight-loss drugs that are coming  that are remarkably effective.                                time  2100    Studies actually are sort of breaking down. It turns out that one of  the most moral things we could do is use the technology we have.   If I came to you tomorrow and said: Let's make a plan. Maybe we  should make some changes in the farm legislation--that is really hard  to do. The lobbyists marching up and down the hallways won't be happy  with it, but we have to do it.   Number two, go back to access for people to be able to manage their  blood glucose.  [[Page H3947]]    Number three, maybe we should start to look at the accessibility for  those who are on Medicare, Medicaid, Indian Health Service, and  veterans who actually really, really, really, really have  comorbidities, lots of diseases, substantially because of their weight  or because of diabetes. Maybe the moral thing is to make these drugs  available to them.   Here is part of the holy grail. I have come back and talked about it  multiple times, and I have been mocked--sorry, I don't mean to be  personalizing it. I do mean to be personalizing it.   FDA approves the first cellular therapy to treat patients with type 1  diabetes. Yes, there is finally one of them. There are a half a dozen  of these that are in FDA-approval stages or tests, but the first one is  fully approved now. That therapy can get the body to start producing-- excuse me, accepts a replenishment of islet cells. Do you see the flow?   If we actually said we need a healthier society--oh, by the way, it  is amazing for what it does in bending the debt curve. Oh, by the way,  it is moral. Oh, by the way, it would mean extra populations can come  back into society and we might get productivity gains. We have a way to  help people manage their prediabetes with some technology. We have some  ways to help people get their weight down.   Oh, by the way, those people that do get their weight down, the 30  percent or so, and their body is so damaged that they can't produce  insulin anymore, it turns out we can replace the islet cells in their  body now. It is here. It is moral. It is optimistic. It is joyful.   When was the last time you had an idiot like myself standing here and  sounding like an accountant on steroids, and saying, I actually have a  solution. It doesn't solve the whole problem; it only solves a portion  of it.   This would do more than all the jaw-moving around here that you have  heard so far this year, and it is doable. Is this Republican or  Democrat?   I will just argue it is the right thing to do.   Is this place capable, Madam Speaker, of actually doing the right  thing?   Is it capable of doing something that is great math, it is morally  wonderful, and actually would be really good for everyone?   Dear God, I hope so.   Madam Speaker, thank you for tolerating my tantrum, and I yield back  the balance of my time.                              ____________________     Madam Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 9 o'clock and 3 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Wednesday, July 26, 2023, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.                            ____________________
