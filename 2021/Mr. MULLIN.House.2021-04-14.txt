 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in full support of my bill,  H.R. 1762, the Protecting Indian Tribes from Scams Act. The bill will  help protect our Tribes and Tribal members from predatorial scams.   Tribal communities have long been targets of fraud. Scammers often  target vulnerable communities who receive trust or settlement payments,  like many Tribes do. FTC data says that Tribe members are more likely  to be the victims of scams and are less likely to report scams than any  other group.   H.R. 1762 will direct the FTC to study the types of scams that target  Tribes and find the best ways to combat them.   Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Arizona for working with me on  these issues, as well as many other issues important to Indian County.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.
