 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill.   My State of California has several provisions in law that are  included in this bill, but it doesn't work as a patchwork because  individuals can cross State lines and endanger people.   Everything in this bill is consistent with the Second Amendment. That  is why it got such bipartisan support in the Senate.   In the last 3 years alone, my district has had two cities added to  the long list of communities that have experienced mass shootings.   America doesn't have to be the only country in the world where mass  shootings are a near-daily occurrence. There is broad support in the  country for reform that will prevent this epidemic of gun violence.   This bill doesn't do everything that I think should happen, but it  does something. It will make people safer. I strongly urge its support.
