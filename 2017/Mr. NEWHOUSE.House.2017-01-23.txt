 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   Mr. Speaker, I rise to add my voice of strong support for the Amateur  Radio Parity Act of 2017. This important measure will affirm individual  freedom and property rights and ensure every ham radio operator has the  opportunity to enjoy their pastime regardless of the community in which  they live.   H.R. 555 guarantees that all amateur radio operators living in deed- restricted communities have the right to construct and operate an  effective outdoor antenna without burdensome restrictions being imposed  by their respective homeowners' association.   Under the bill, HOAs would be required to allow ham radio use with  the least practicable restrictions to preserve their aesthetic  interests.                                time  1700    Across central Washington, many of my constituents are avid ham radio  operators. I believe we should be encouraging this advocation, which  also serves as a useful tool for emergency communications and  preparedness.   I was proud to cosponsor this legislation in the 114th Congress, and  I commend the work of Chairman Kinzinger, Chairman Walden, and Mr.  Lance to bring this bill forward again.   I look forward to supporting this bill on the House floor later  today, and remain hopeful that, in this new Congress, we can advance  the Amateur Radio Parity Act to the President's desk, where it can be  signed into law.
