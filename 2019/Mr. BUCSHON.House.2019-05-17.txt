 Mr. Speaker, I was unavoidably detained on May 17, 2019,  in order to deliver the Commencement Address at the Concordia Seminary  in Saint Louis, Missouri. Had I been present, I would have voted  ``yea'' on rollcall No. 215, ``yea'' on rollcall No. 216, and ``nay''  on rollcall No. 217.                             personal explanation
