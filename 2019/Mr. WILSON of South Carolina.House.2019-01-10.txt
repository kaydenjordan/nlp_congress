 Madam Speaker, I was grateful last  month to visit one of the privatized hotels of the Army at Fort  Jackson, managed by the InterContinental Hotels Group.   IHG has worked to revitalize Army lodging to provide improved  facilities for Army travelers and their families by supporting 40 major  installations globally. Significant progress has been made under the  leadership of President Donald Trump.   Many of the 370,000 guests and family members of basic combat  training graduates who come to Fort Jackson are served every year by  these hotels. More than 1 million guests have stayed at the Holiday Inn  Express at Fort Jackson since 2013. This has saved $84 million and  employs 100 personnel directed by Chuck Sourbeer.   I support reforms for servicemembers and their families to have the  same world-class hospitality experience that Fort Jackson provides.   In conclusion, God bless our troops, and we will never forget  September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.                            ____________________
