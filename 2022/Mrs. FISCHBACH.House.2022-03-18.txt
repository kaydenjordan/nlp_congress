 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize Todd and  Louise Malecha, the 2022 winners of Farm Journal's Top Producer of the  Year award.   Located in the heart of Minnesota's Seventh Congressional District in  Villard, Minnesota, Malecha Enterprises is a multi-generational,  family-run dairy, pumping, and custom work operation.   Both Todd and Louise grew up on dairy farms, and now five of their  seven children are in the family business. Louise loves being able to  see the next generation getting involved and taking up the reins.   Their company values include integrity, trust, and a commitment to  constant and never-ending improvement. With values like that, it is no  wonder they received such a prestigious award.   Congratulations to the Malechas for this impressive achievement.                            ____________________
