 Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to bring  up H.R. 724, which would rescind President Trump's cold and callous  refugee ban on travelers like the UK resident who holds an Iranian  passport, was due to fly back to Glasgow via New York, and had her  transit visa revoked.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   I rise in support of H.R. 58, the First Responder Identification of  Emergency Needs in Disaster Situations, or the FRIENDS Act.   This bill requires the Government Accountability Office, or GAO, to  submit a report on how State and local programs affect the preparedness  and protection of first responders. Congress and the American people  need to know whether these programs consider circumstances that may  affect a first responder's ability to respond to an event.   In particular, the bill requires GAO to examine the degree to which  State and local programs and policies consider the presence of a first  responder's family in an area impacted by a terrorist attack, the  availability of personal protective equipment for first responders, and  the availability of home MedKits for first responders and their  families for biological incident response.   While we are asking GAO to examine State and local programs and  policies, some of these programs and policies may be funded with  Federal dollars. To that extent, Congress needs to know whether these  federally funded programs and policies are as effective as possible to  prepare and protect first responders.   This month, the State of Georgia received two Presidential disaster  declarations from devastating tornados in districts neighboring my own.  While these are not terrorist attacks, these tornados highlight the  fact that first responders are often called upon to respond to events  in their own communities where they and their loved ones live. Our  heros immediately respond to the call of duty, even though they  themselves or their loved ones may be impacted. Thus, it is important  that State and local preparedness programs are designed and developed  to consider all situations that may impact first responder  preparedness.                                time  1415    We must do everything we can to support our first responders who are  often called upon to put their lives on the line to help others, even  when their own families need them. So I thank my colleague, the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), for introducing this bill and  for her diligent work on this issue.   In response to my chairman's welcome, I would have to respond by  saying I am just giddy about being a part of this subcommittee, and I  look forward to working with him and his staff to make things good for  America and for our future.   I urge my colleagues to join in my support of this bill.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the sponsor of this  legislation.  [[Page H773]]         Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes  to the gentlewoman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my  time.
