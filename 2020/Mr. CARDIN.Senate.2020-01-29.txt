 Mr. Chief Justice, I have a question on behalf of Senator  Baldwin and myself, and I send it to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The question is addressed to the House managers:         Is the White House correct in its trial memorandum and in       presentations of its case that ``President Zelensky and other       senior Ukrainian officials did not even know that the       security assistance had been paused'' before seeing press       reports on August 28, 2019, which was more than a month after       the July 25 phone call between Presidents Zelensky and Trump?    Mr. Manager CROW. Thank you, Chief Justice and Senators, for the  question.   The answer is no. The evidence does not show that. We know that  Defense Department official Laura Cooper testified that her staff  received 2 emails from the State Department on July 25 revealing that  the Ukrainian Embassy was ``asking about security assistance,'' and, in  fact, counsel for the President brought up these emails just now. I  would propose that the Senate subpoena those emails and we can all see  for ourselves what exactly was happening.   We also know that career diplomat Catherine Croft stated that she was  ``very surprised at the effectiveness of my Ukrainian counterparts'  diplomatic tradecraft, as in to say they found out very early on, or  much earlier than I expected them to,'' and that LTC Alex Vindman  testified that by mid-August he was getting questions from Ukrainians  about the status of security assistance.   So the evidence shows over and over again from the House inquiry that  there was a lot of discussion, and there should be because we also know  that delays matter. They matter a lot. You don't have to take my word  for it. This is not just about a 48-day delay. Ukrainians were  consistently asking about it because it was urgent. They needed it.  They needed it.   You know who else was asking for it--American businesses. The  contractors who were going to be providing this were also making  inquiries about it because there is a pipeline.   As my esteemed Senate Armed Services colleagues know very well,  providing aid is not like turning on and off a light switch. You have  to hire employees. You have to get equipment. You have to ship it. It  takes a long time for that pipeline to go. In fact, we had to come  together as a Congress to pass a law to extend that timeline because we  were at risk of losing it. And to this day, $18 million of that aid has  still not been spent.   Let's just assume for a minute, also broadly speaking, that the  President's counsels' argument that support for Ukraine has never been  better than it is today, that under the Trump administration, they are  the strongest ally Ukraine has seen in years. Just assuming for a  minute that argument to be true, it kind of makes our own argument. It  kind of makes our argument: Then why hold the aid? Why hold the aid?  Because nothing had changed in 2016; nothing had changed in 2017; and  nothing had changed in 2018. One thing had changed in 2019, and that  was Vice President Biden was running for President.   Lastly, the previous question by my Senate Armed Services colleagues  framed this in terms of the military impact. They asked: What was  greater in terms of military impact, not providing lethal aid or a 48- day delay?   Let's not forget the reason for the delay, because there is a lot of  discussion today about the technicalities of the delay and that the  President's  [[Page S663]]  mentality, his mindset, doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what he  intended to do. I would posit that is exactly why we are here--that it  does matter what the President intended to do because in matters of  national security, the American people deserve to go to bed every night  knowing that the President, the Commander in Chief, the person who is  ultimately responsible for the safety and security of our Nation every  night, has the best interests of them and their families and this  country in mind, not the best interests of his political campaign. That  is why we are here.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.    Mr. Chief Justice, I have a question on behalf of Senator  Markey and myself, and I send it to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question is as follows:         Supreme Court Justice Byron White, in a concurring opinion       in Nixon v. United States (1993), acknowledged that the       Senate ``has very wide discretion in specifying impeachment       trial procedures,'' but stated that the Senate ``would abuse       its discretion'' if it were to ``insist on a procedure that       could not be deemed a trial by reasonable judges.'' If the       Senate does not allow for additional evidence and the       testimony of key witnesses with firsthand knowledge of       President Trump's actions and intentions, would a       ``reasonable judge'' conclude these proceedings constitute a       constitutionally fair trial?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. I think the answer is no. I don't know that we  need to look to the words of a prior Justice to tell us that a trial  without witnesses is not really a trial. It is certainly not a fair  trial. If the House moves forward with impeachment and it comes before  the Senate and wants to call witnesses and wants to make its case and  is told ``Thou shalt not call witnesses,'' that is not a fair trial.   I think the American people understand that without reading the case  law. They go to jury duty themselves every year, and they see that the  first thing that takes place after a jury is sworn in is the government  makes its opening statement, the defense makes theirs, and then begins  the calling of witnesses.   I do want to take this opportunity to respond to Professor  Dershowitz' arguments while they are fresh. You can say a lot of things  about Alan Dershowitz, but you cannot say he is unprepared. He is not  unprepared today. He was not unprepared 21 years ago. And to believe  that he would not have read 21 years ago what Mason had to say or  Madison had to say or Hamilton had to say--I am sorry, I don't buy  that. I think 21 years ago he understood that maladministration was  rejected but so was a provision that confined the impeachable offenses  to treason and bribery alone was rejected.   I think the Alan Dershowitz from 21 years ago understood that, yes,  while you can't impeach for a policy difference, you can impeach a  President for abuse of power. That is what he said 21 years ago.  Nothing has changed since then.   I don't think you can write off the consensus of constitutional  opinion by saying they are all Never Trumpers. All the constitutional  law professors--in fact, let's play a snippet from Professor Turley,  who was in the House defending the President, and see what he had to  say recently.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         Professor TURLEY. Abuse of power, in my view, is clear. You       can impeach a President for abuse of power and you can       impeach a President for noncriminal conduct.    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. We can't argue plausibly that his position is  owing to some political bias, right? Just a few weeks ago, he was in  the House arguing a case for my GOP colleagues that the President  shouldn't be impeached.   Now, he did say: Well, if you can actually prove these things, if you  can prove--as, indeed, we have--that the President abused his power by  conditioning military aid to help his reelection campaign, yes, that is  an abuse of power. You can impeach with that kind of abuse of power,  and that is exactly what we have here.   We are not required to leave our common sense at the door. If we are  to interpret the Constitution now as saying that a President can abuse  their power--and I think the professor suggested before the break that  he can abuse his power in a corrupt way to help his reelection and you  can't do anything about it--you can't do anything about it because if  he views it as in his personal interest, that is just fine. He is  allowed to do it.   None of the Founders would have accepted that kind of reasoning. In  fact, the idea that the core offense that the Founders protected  against--that core offense is abuse of power--is beyond the reach of  Congress through impeachment would have terrified the Founders. I mean,  you can imagine any number of abuses of power--a President who  withholds aid from another country at war as a thank you for that  adversary allowing him to build a Trump Tower in a country. OK, that  may not be criminal, but are we really going to say that we are going  to have to permit a President of the United States to withhold military  aid as a thank you for a business proposition?   Now, counsel acknowledges that a crime is not necessary but something  akin to a crime. Well, we think there is a crime here of bribery or  extortion--conditioning official acts for personal favors. That is  bribery. It is also what the Founders understood as extortion. And you  cannot argue--even if you argue, well, under the modern definition of  bribery, you have got to show such and such--you cannot plausibly argue  that it is not akin to bribery. It is bribery. But it is certainly akin  to bribery.   That is the import of what they would argue--that, no, the President  has a constitutional right. Under article II, he can do anything he  wants. He can abuse his office and do so sacrificing national security,  undermining the integrity of the elections, and there is nothing  Congress can do about it.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.                                    Recess    The CHIEF JUSTICE. We are in recess.   There being no objection, at 6:32 p.m., the Senate, sitting as a  Court of Impeachment, recessed until 7:25 p.m.; whereupon the Senate  reassembled when called to order by the Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senate will come to order.
