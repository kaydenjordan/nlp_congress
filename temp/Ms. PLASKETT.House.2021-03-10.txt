 Mr. Speaker, this month is not only Women's History  Month, but it is also Virgin Islands History Month, and what better way  to celebrate it than today for me to salute Virgin Islands' native and  basketball upcoming star, Aliyah Boston, who had another dominant  performance in South Carolina's 67-62 win over Georgia in the SEC  tournament final.   Boston put up 27 points and 10 rebounds for her 15th double-double of  the year, and was named the tournament MVP as South Carolina captured  its sixth championship in the last 7 years.   ``Aliyah was huge,'' said Coach Dawn Staley after the game. ``She has  to be that dominant in order for us to win these kind of basketball  games.''   Aliyah, you are huge. You are dominant. And what better way to  recognize Women's History Month and Virgin Islands History Month by a  Virgin Islander and a woman making history.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I hope my colleague from Wisconsin will  not leave at this time, as he has talked about Black Lives Matter.   How dare you--how dare you say that Black Lives Matter, Black people,  do not understand old-fashioned families. Despite some of the issues,  some of the things that you have put forward that I have heard out of  your mouth in the Committee on Oversight and Reform, in your own  district, we have been able to keep our families alive for over 400  years in the assault on our families to not have Black lives or not  even have Black families. How dare you say that we are not interested  in families in the Black community. That is outrageous. That should be  stricken down.   Mr. Speaker, I was going to talk about the American Rescue Plan. We  know that this is going to provide relief to not only Black lives,  Black Americans, but all Americans, that we are interested in children  and in their welfare.   Forty-nine days ago President Biden took office and promised the  American people that help is on the way. Today we take our final step  forward on delivering on that promise. Millions of Americans will be  supportive who have been economically crippled by a year-long pandemic.  Most of this money goes directly to the American people. And, we have  one of the most generous expansions of tax relief to working people in  modern history in this plan. The child tax credit provisions on their  own is a policy revolution in the making. More than 93 percent of our  children-- 69 million children--would receive benefits under  [[Page H1265]]  this rescue plan. Minority farmers will finally get the relief from  indebtedness they deserve.   This version of the bill sent back from the Senate is not perfect. It  is the result of compromise. Nonetheless, we have before us one of the  most significant pieces of legislation to benefit working Americans in  our recent history.
