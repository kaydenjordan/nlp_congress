 Mr. Speaker, over the past 2 years, one thing has become  clear: This administration cares more about advancing its radical Green  New Deal agenda than about the financial well-being of the American  people.   We have seen it with their energy policy, but the latest example is  the Biden administration's rule to inject woke ESG factors into  workers' retirement accounts.   Thanks to President Biden's economic policies, workers' retirement  savings were down 10 percent in 2022 compared to 2021. Why is this  administration doubling down to further jeopardize Americans'  retirement?   Retirement plan sponsors have two responsibilities to their clients:  maximize returns and minimize risk. The Biden rule would allow asset  managers to impose a political agenda on Americans at the expense of  retirement savings.   The Biden administration should not be jeopardizing Americans'  retirement by allowing plan managers to gamble their savings on ESG  funds that have proven to be riskier and charge steeper fees.   That is why I cosponsored this bill with my friend,   Andy Barr, to  use our authority to nullify the Biden rule and protect Americans'  hard-earned retirement savings from politically motivated  mismanagement.
