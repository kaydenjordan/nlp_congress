 Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr.  Raskin).    Mr. Speaker, I am proud to say that, for 242 years,  whenever and wherever America's freedom has been threatened, we called  in the Marines.   A Marine Corps infantry platoon is trained to close with and destroy  the enemy by firearm and maneuver. That is what we do. That is our  purpose. Marines kick in the door and kill the bad guys. Period. I know  because that is what I had to do in Iraq. My platoon fought door-to- door against deadly insurgents. For this mission, the Marine Corps  issued me an M-16 A4.   The M-16 is a weapon designed with exquisite precision for the  singular purpose of killing as many people as possible in the shortest  amount of time. It is not for deer hunting. It is for killing people.   The original M-16 was relentlessly refined to take enemy lives in  combat. But you might know the version available in stores called an  AR-15. Republicans and their bosses at the NRA believe almost anyone  should be able to carry this weapon of war. That is right. Republicans  honestly believe that this killing machine has a place in our  communities. They think that a weapon very similar to one I carried in  Al Anbar belongs on the streets of Phoenix.    That is idiotic, and I will explain why.   Republicans aren't just ignoring the voices of the thousands of  victims. They are also denying basic physics. Because a round from an  AR-15 is larger and leaves the muzzle traveling faster, it will impact  the body without about three times more energy than a bullet from a  handgun.   Surgeons treating the Parkland victims described organs that looked  like ``overripe melons smashed by a sledgehammer.'' They talk about  exit wounds as big as oranges. They recount opening bodies of these  children, hoping to stem the bleeding, and discovering that, as one  doctor put it, ``there was nothing left to repair.''   And here is the thing: that is not an unexpected outcome. Delivering  fatal wounds that no surgeon can fix is the whole point of these  weapons. That is precisely why they were given to us in combat.   The AR-15 also has a standard magazine of 30 rounds. Those 30 rounds  are necessary if you are putting down suppressive fire or engaging  insurgents. They are not very useful when you are hunting deer.   Mr. Speaker, I can confidently say that if you need more than a  handful of shots to put down the deer, you are probably the problem,  not the weapon.   In addition, the AR-15 has a significantly faster effective rate of  fire than a bolt-action hunting rifle or a handgun. That means you can  shoot more people in less time. That means police officers responding  to the scene of a shooting will be outgunned and outmatched. That means  more children will die in the classrooms before help can arrive.   I went through literally thousands of hours of training to become a  marine. It was arduous and grueling. I was taught how to clean and care  for my weapon. I had to pass a rigorous marksmanship test. I was only  armed after I earned the privilege and responsibility for that weapon.   In contrast, my Republican friends think anyone should be able to  walk into a sporting goods store anywhere in America and walk out with  an AR-15.   When children are slaughtered in their classrooms, we respond with  thoughts and prayers instead of smarter policies or stronger laws. We  are asked to simply accept this bloodshed as an unavoidable fact of  American life.   Not anymore.   How about this? Let's reform our background check system. Let's ban  assault rifles and keep weapons of war out of our communities. Then, if  people are truly desperate to fire those types of weapons, they can do  what I did: go to www.marines.mil and enlist.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                            ____________________
