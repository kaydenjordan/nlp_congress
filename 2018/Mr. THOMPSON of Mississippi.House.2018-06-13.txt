 Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and  fellow member on the House Committee on Homeland Security, Congressman  Lou Correa, for leading tonight's special order regarding the need to  protect immigrant children and families from the cruel and punitive  policies adopted by the Trump Administration.   Over the past several months, the Trump Administration has engaged in  the barbaric activity of separating migrant children from their parents  to instill fear and deter families from seeking legal protection in the  United States. These families are fleeing dangerous and violent  situations in their home countries--seeking safety in the United  States--only to have their children taken away from them. In many  situations, the parents are not told where their children are or when  they will be reunited.   We have laws in place so that people fleeing dangerous situations can  request protection and humanitarian relief. We should open our arms to  these families, not tear them apart and put them in jail.   Earlier this year, I was proud to lead all 12 of Democrats on the  Committee on Homeland Security, as well as 63 of our Democratic  colleagues, in sending a letter to Secretary Nielsen strongly opposing  the practice of separating migrant parents from their children at the  border. I continue to condemn this practice by the Trump  Administration. A secure border and effective immigration system is  important. The use of these tactics to deter migration is not only  ineffective, but also un-American. I urge my colleagues to join me in  speaking out against this unjust and inhumane policy.
