 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Mr. Frank  Troutman, Jr., who passed away on August 10 at the age of 84.   A great citizen of the State of Georgia, Mr. Troutman was passionate  with every endeavor he undertook.   In academics, he graduated from the University of Georgia, earning  Phi Beta Kappa membership, attended the university's law school, and  remained a lifelong voracious reader and lover of history. He was one  of the biggest Georgia Bulldog fans in the State, making the trip to  Pasadena in 1943 to see the Dawgs play UCLA in the Rose Bowl.   Mr. Troutman served for 15 years as president of his family's  Castleberry's food business, introducing modern techniques to the  company, and making it into the business that it is today. And he was  the first Republican elected to the Richmond County Commission, being  largely responsible for introducing the Republican Party in the State  of Georgia.   It would be hard to find anyone in Georgia more passionate about our  State than Mr. Troutman, and I am thankful to have called him a fellow  Georgian. His family and friends will be in our thoughts and prayers  during this difficult time.                    In Remembrance of Judge Tom Edenfield     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Judge Tom Edenfield, who passed away on Tuesday, October 15, at the  age of 80.   Born and raised in Savannah, Georgia, Judge Edenfield made our  community a better place to live during his numerous posts in the  judicial system.   Only a few examples of his positions include his work as a special  assistant to the district attorney, creating his own law firm, and  presiding as a municipal court judge. Constantly using his position to  help others as a municipal court judge, he would often suspend  sentences in return for individuals attending a house of worship. He  additionally assisted with the county's drug court in order to help  people reclaim their lives from substance abuse problems and avoid  incarceration.   Judge Edenfield's colleagues remember him as always having a smile on  his face and a bad joke, along with being a mentor to all members of  the bar. He will be missed throughout our  [[Page H8395]]  community, and I will keep his family and friends in my thoughts and  prayers during this most difficult time.                       In Remembrance of Harriet Konter     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life  of Ms. Harriet Konter, who passed away on Sunday, October 13 at the age  of 94.   Ms. Konter was truly a pioneering woman in Georgia real estate.  Working in the industry for over 50 years, she became the first female  president of the Georgia Association of Realtors in 1987, as well as  the first female member of the Georgia Realtors Hall of Fame.   She founded scholarships for female realtors to attend the National  Women's Leadership Conference and remained heavily involved in real  estate well into her nineties. Her colleagues remember her as someone  who blazed a trail for many women in real estate and beyond.   Yet, Ms. Konter's passion to better our community reached everyone.  She served as the director of the Savannah Jewish Educational Alliance,  trustee for the Armstrong Atlantic State University Foundation, owned  two local supermarkets, and more.   Ms. Konter will be missed throughout Savannah. Her family and friends  will be in my thoughts and prayers during this most difficult time.                 In Recognition of Pierce County High School     Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Pierce  County High School for being recognized by the Department of Education  as a Blue Ribbon School for 2019.   This prestigious award recognized approximately 350 schools across  the country for their commitment to academic excellence and closing the  achievement gaps among diverse groups of students.   To commemorate the award, Pierce County High School will receive a  flag that is a symbol of excellence in teaching and learning. The  school has been providing a high-quality education to its students for  a number of years, and this is not the first time the school has been  recognized.   In 2018, Pierce County's principal, Ms. Dara Bennett, was named the  Principal of the Year in the State of Georgia. Additionally, the  National Federation of State High School Associations named their  athletic department the third best in the Nation.   To teachers, students, and staff alike at Pierce County High School,  congratulations on your awards and keep up the good work.                            ____________________
