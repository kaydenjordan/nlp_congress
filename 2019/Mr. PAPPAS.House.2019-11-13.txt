 Mr. Speaker, on Monday, we gathered around the country to  honor our veterans to whom we owe a tremendous debt. But sentiments  expressed at parades and ceremonies ring hollow if we don't follow our  good words with meaningful deeds for those who have served and  sacrificed so much.   Although the VA has countless care providers and employees who have  dedicated their careers to veterans, they work in a system that has  serious problems that must be addressed quickly.   It is unacceptable that the health network for more than 9 million  veterans has remained on the High-Risk List of Federal agencies prone  to deficiencies and waste. That is why I introduced the Reducing High  Risk to Veterans and Veterans Services Act with my colleague, General  Bergman, to improve the management and care at the VA.   It is also unacceptable that the VA has not met the needs of a  growing number of women veterans. I introduced legislation with  Congresswoman Stefanik that will ensure the VA is equipped to provide  women veterans with life-changing prosthetics as part of the Deborah  Sampson Act.   We made a solemn promise to our veterans, and we should be working  together every day to fulfill that promise. These pieces of legislation  are an important step forward, and I thank my colleagues for supporting  these bipartisan bills.                            ____________________
