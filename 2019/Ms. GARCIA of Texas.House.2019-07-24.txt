 Mr. Chair, I rise in support of H.R. 3239, a  bill introduced by my friend and colleague from California, Congressman  Raul Ruiz, and which I proudly cosponsor.   The humanitarian crisis at the southern border is greatly worsened by  understaffed, unprepared, and under-equipped CBP facilities.   I know this. I have seen them firsthand in visits that I have made to  some of these facilities not only in Texas, but also in New Mexico.   This bill will alleviate these problems by requiring CBP facilities  to maintain the personnel and equipment necessary to screen all  individuals in custody and provide emergency care as needed.                                time  1900    Our American values, moral conscience, and the Constitution require  that we treat all individuals on American soil humanely and  respectfully. For this purpose, border agents must have the equipment,  resources, and training necessary to carry out this mission and save  lives.   Congress must continue working to solve the immigration issue and  finally end the humanitarian crisis at the southern border.   Mr. Chairman, I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting  H.R. 3239.
