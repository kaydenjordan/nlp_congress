 Madam President, I listened to the statements of my  colleague from South Dakota. I would like to make a suggestion.   Since the Republicans are in control of the U.S. Senate, since there  is a Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I would  suggest to my colleague that perhaps we have a hearing on this bill he  just described. You see, it came to the floor yesterday without any  hearing. And the reason why we need a hearing is that many of us--many  of us--voted for an infanticide law, which is currently on the books--a  law that says that a child needs to be protected and that those who  don't protect that child are subject to criminal penalties, as they  should be.    Now, if this is a different approach to it, doesn't it at least merit  a hearing from the Republican majority before it comes to the floor for  a vote? There are many questions I would like to ask of those who  propose this. I want to understand why the law that has been on  [[Page S1451]]  the books now for 17 years, as I remember, is inadequate to the  challenges it faces.   I supported the infanticide law. I will continue to. If there are any  changes that the Republicans want to make, is it too much to ask them  to have a hearing in their own committee, which they chair, on this  subject matter? I hope they will take it seriously enough to do it.  Critics have said this has nothing to do with changing the law. It is  just a ``gotcha'' vote on the floor--an amendment which may be used  against candidates in future elections.   When it comes to children, something as serious as life and death  should be taken much more seriously by the Republican majority.    Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum be rescinded.    Madam President, I rise in opposition to the pending  nomination of Eric Miller to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court of  Appeals in a seat based out of the State of Washington.   If the Senate chooses to confirm Mr. Miller, it will be a historic  decision because it will be the first time ever since the introduction  of blue slips over 100 years ago that the Senate has confirmed a  nominee who is not supported by either of the home State Senators from  the State in which he will be seated.   What is a blue slip? It is basically a consultation with the Senate  before we move forward on a nomination. It is a courtesy that has been  extended. It is an effort to try to find some common ground, some  understanding, perhaps some moderation when it comes to the choice of  nominees. It has been abused in some cases, but the two Senators here-- Senator Cantwell and Senator Murray--are well known in this body for  being reasonable people who try to find solutions to problems and work  well with both sides of the aisle. Yet, in this case, the Trump White  House has decided that they are going to push this nominee for the  Ninth Circuit in their home State of Washington against their wishes.  If Mr. Miller is confirmed, we will have taken away yet another  guardrail in the Senate advice and consent process.   If you follow what has happened in the Senate over the last 2 years  and a few months, you know that the highest single priority of Senator  McConnell's--the Republican leader--is to fill the Federal judgeships,  to put in place men and women who will serve literally for a lifetime,  as long as they live. He is determined to do it. There is a template  for the people who they find acceptable. If you have been a law  [[Page S1460]]  clerk for Clarence Thomas, you check the box, you are ready to go--a  lifetime appointment. If the Federalist Society decides you are the  right person for the Supreme Court of the United States, box checked,  off we go.   Instead of relying on common sense, moderation, and judgment, we are  going through a formula here to put people on the bench for a  lifetime--those who have been approved on the Republican side of the  aisle. Make no mistake--under Democratic Presidents, we look to  nominees who are closer to our value system, for sure, but we never  walked away from the blue slip process until this nominee--the first  time ever it has been done.   We have seen so many things change under the Republican leadership in  the Senate when it comes to the selection of judges.   We used to say that if you are found unqualified--not qualified--by  the American Bar Association, forget it. Go about your business. Do  something else. We are not going to put you on the bench for life.  Well, we have decided, under the Republican leadership, that is no  longer the case. Simply being unqualified is not enough to disqualify  you.   We have also said that when it comes to the process of making these  decisions, we will have hearings where we will consider multiple  candidates in the same day. Let's run them through. Of course, you know  what happens when you do that: You get in a hurry, and you end up  putting people on the bench for life who shouldn't be there.   We have also decided in this White House that we will send people off  to be Federal judges who have never been in a courtroom in their  lives--not once. Maybe they watched ``Perry Mason'' on some retro  channel, but that is about as good as it ever was for some of them.   I recall one of the nominees from the Trump White House. It was a  moment in the history of the Senate Judiciary Committee. Senator John  Kennedy of Louisiana asked him some basic questions about what it meant  to be a judge and some of the things he would have to rule on. It was a  sad moment. It reminded me of my worst days in law school when I didn't  know the answers to the test or to the question being asked by the  professor. This nominee, thankfully, withdrew. He never should have  been nominated.   In this case, when it comes to Mr. Miller, neither of the Washington  Senators returned a blue slip on him, and they have a reason. He is 43  years old; he may serve on the bench for three decades or more. In his  relatively short legal career, he has demonstrated that his views are  far outside the legal mainstream, particularly when it comes to one  legal issue--the issue involving Indian Tribes.   I don't know if you watched the Oscars, but I did, and I was watching  for a movie that I saw that I was impressed with. It was called  ``Roma.'' It was a movie about Mexico. It received quite a few awards,  and I thought it deserved them. It raised some painful questions for  people living in Mexico. I know because I have spoken to Mexican  Parliamentarians at a dinner a few weeks ago. It is the treatment of  indigenous people.   Most countries in the world, including the United States, haven't  written a very admirable record when it comes to the treatment of  people who were here before we ``arrived.'' What we have done to Native  Americans in this country, sadly, is nothing to brag about. They were  dispossessed, relocated for their lands, and many times treated in the  poorest possible fashion. The movie ``Roma'' was about indigenous  people of Mexico who are servants, and some would say slaves, to  families who have more money in Mexico. So the question of the  treatment of Native Americans is not something that we can just push  back in the pages of history; it still confronts us in the United  States today, as it does in other countries, like Mexico and Australia  and so many others.   So what does this have to do with this nominee? It turns out that in  a rare moment, the National Congress of American Indians weighed in  against Eric Miller for this circuit court nomination. The National  Congress of American Indians opposed his nomination. Here is what they  wrote in a letter to the Judiciary Committee, and I want to quote it in  its substance:         Our concern is that he chose to build a law practice on       mounting repeated challenges to tribal sovereignty, lands,       religious freedom, and the core attribute of federal       recognition of tribal existence. His advocacy has focused on       undermining the rights of Indian tribes, often taking extreme       positions and using pejorative language to denigrate tribal       rights. Indeed, his law firm website touts his record, with       over half of his private practice achievements coming at the       expense of tribal governments. Given his strong preference       for clients who oppose tribes, there are considerable       questions about whether he would be fair in hearing cases       regarding tribal rights.    You might say to yourself: Well, that has to be a narrow area of the  law--Tribal rights--and if he happens to consistently get that wrong,  how important could it be?   Take a look at the fact that he has aspired to be a nominee to the  circuit court--the second highest court in the land--in the Ninth  Circuit. The Ninth Circuit includes 427 of the 573 federally recognized  Tribal nations of America. That circuit he aspires to for a lifetime  appointment hears more cases involving Tribal issues than any other  Federal circuit. It is deeply troubling to see a Ninth Circuit nominee  whose impartiality on Tribal legal matters is in question.   Mr. Miller's nomination is opposed by not only the National Congress  of American Indians; he is also opposed by a broad array of civil  rights, environmental, labor, and other organizations that are  concerned about his record and legal views. He is 43 years old--43  years old--three more decades to hand down decisions.   It is astonishing that the Senate would vote to confirm a nominee  this controversial over the objection of home State Senators and to  break a century-old tradition in the Senate to do it. These Senators  represent millions of people in the State of Washington. Their good  judgment has been recognized by election and reelection. But when it  comes to having a voice in the selection of a circuit court nominee who  will be serving their State for the next three decades, they have been  shunned and pushed aside.   I think the Republican majority is making a mistake. They are so  bound and determined to fill these vacancies that they are abandoning  basic Senate traditions--which, in fact, will slow things down from  time to time, I am ready to admit, but also put at least a note of  caution into a critical judgment process.   Blue slips encourage consensus and cooperation between the Senate and  the White House. There isn't a single one of us serving in the Senate  who hasn't counted on that cooperation to make sure that lifetime  appointments to the Federal judiciary are people who can stand the test  of time. Although they may not agree with any Senator every single  time, they bring judgment, experience, balance, and moderation to their  service. Blue slips ensure that the voices of the American people,  through their Senators, are heard in this process, and they help steer  the nomination process toward the middle of the road. Without blue  slips, the White House can ignore home State interests and pick extreme  judges who do not have the confidence of that State's legal community.   This decision--for the first time in a century--to abandon blue slips  for the sake of putting this man in a lifetime position on the circuit  bench could affect every one of our States someday. I can't understand  why my Republican colleagues want to diminish their authority, their  ability to safeguard against judges who should not be appointed for  life. That is what we are doing on the vote to confirm Eric Miller to  the Ninth Circuit.   I will oppose his nomination. I urge my colleagues to do the same, if  for no other reason, so that when the time comes--if it ever comes-- that you ask for the respect of this body when it comes to the  selection of an important Federal judge, you will receive it regardless  of who the President may be.   Madam President, I yield the floor.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.    I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Ms. Sinema) is  necessarily absent.    I announce that the Senator from Arizona (Ms. Sinema) is  necessarily absent.
