 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this en bloc amendment. I want  to put things in perspective.   Mr. Speaker, I mentioned on the floor yesterday that there were  approximately 390 amendments filed on this bill--390 amendments filed.  There are approximately 148 Democrat amendments and there were 22  Republican amendments that were accepted and allowed to be voted on,  but because of this distorted process, those were only being allowed  seven votes.   Mr. Speaker, en bloc B, there were 45 Democrat amendments; en bloc C,  there were 34 Democrat amendments; en bloc D, there were 28 Democrat  amendments; and in this bloc F, there are 25 Democrat amendments--zero  Republican amendments in any of those blocs.   The amendments in this bloc, there is another grab bag of the  majority's priorities, many of which take a very generous view of what  actual infrastructure is.   This bill is supposed to be infrastructure legislation. The bloc  includes everything from air-conditioning for postal vehicles to  studying sinkholes, to unworkable vehicle mandates that have zero  consideration for actual taxpayer funds. It mandates the acquisition of  certain types of vehicles without looking at any type of economic  analysis on the use of those taxpayer funds.   It continues to ignore the need for reasonable bipartisan solutions  to address our biggest infrastructure needs, and rather than looking  forward at solutions, the amendment tries to eliminate longstanding  bipartisan agreements that have addressed our infrastructure needs and,  instead, put these left-leaning visions in place.   It doesn't have to be this way. It didn't have to be this way. We  could have come together and written an infrastructure bill that would  have easily cleared this Chamber.   Mr. Speaker, I want to remind you, going back to TEA-21 when our  distinguished chairman was around, TEA-21, the highway bill, the  Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century, the vote coming out of  this House was 337 ``yes'' votes--337--to 80 ``no'' votes.   In SAFETEA-LU, our distinguished chairman emeritus, the dean of the  House, led that effort. The vote out of the House was 417 to 9 ``no''  votes--417 ``yes'' to 9 ``no'' votes.   MAP-21, 293 ``aye'' votes, 127 ``no'' votes, and I want to make note  that our chairman, Chairman DeFazio, voted ``yes.'' He was in the  minority but voted ``yes.''   And, of course, the FAST Act, once again, when the Republicans were  in charge, a big four agreement, when Republicans and Democrats had to  come together. The vote was 372 ayes to 54 nays.   Right now, just to demonstrate this is doable, right now, Republicans  and Democrats are working together in this very committee on the Water  Resources Development Act, including  [[Page H3020]]  both resilience and climate provisions in those negotiations.   Mr. Speaker, this is a failure of leadership, and it is incredibly  disappointing to watch this continue to happen when we have such urgent  needs in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the  gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I  may consume.   Mr. Speaker, once again, 25 amendments, and we are being given 30  minutes to debate 25 different amendments. We just effectively approved  $250 million--one-quarter of a billion dollars--in 2 minutes.   These aren't our funds. These are taxpayer funds. This bill had, I  believe it was around 1,300, 1,400 pages of text just airdropped in the  bill. It wasn't marked up in committee. It was just airdropped in the  bill, added to it, and now we are just going to appropriate trillions  of dollars in taxpayer funds without adequate consideration.   Once again, Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of this en bloc, and I  reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of  my time.   Mr. Speaker, once again, I want to highlight what just happened.   We just went and effectively approved an amendment that would allow  for $20 billion in bonds to be issued. We just effectively approved the  transfer of 2,500 acres of taxpayer property without the consideration  of the Natural Resources Committee, the committee of jurisdiction.   This is like Monopoly money we are sitting here playing with, but the  reality is these are taxpayer funds. These aren't our moneys. These are  funds of the taxpayers.    This bill has not been through the proper process to ensure that we  are actually and legitimately addressing the importance and the  integrity of taxpayer funds.   I will say it again: dating back decades, Mr. Speaker, we have had  bipartisan legislation related to infrastructure--bipartisan. Dating  back to the late 1990s, TEA-21, 337-80; SAFETEA-LU, 417-9; MAP-21, 293- 127. I will say it again: our distinguished chairman voted for it. The  FAST Act got 372 ``aye'' votes.   These were all House versions, Mr. Speaker, not the conference  report. What we are seeing right now, what we are doing--I believe,  again, the number is 148 Democrat amendments compared to, I believe it  is 22 Republican amendments.   This is not representation. This entire process is a farce. We just  approved perhaps billions of dollars--or we are about to approve  billions of dollars--by giving it 30 minutes' consideration. That is  not what we were sent here to do. This process is fatally flawed.   Three hundred ninety amendments distilled down to effectively  allowing up to seven votes?   This is a failure in leadership.   Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of this en bloc. I urge rejection of  the underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.                                time  1145     Madam Speaker, I have expressed my  frustration about the fact that so few Republican amendments have been  allowed to even be debated, yet this is the one en bloc amendment. This  is block G, and there are eight Republican amendments--eight--eight  Republican amendments where we actually get to debate. And, of course,  they are all wrapped in. Our amendment is No. 349. And, as I have  mentioned before, nearly 380 or 390 amendments on this bill.    Our amendment amends page 1968 that I am sure everyone here has read,  and what this does is it very simply--it very simply says that, in  order for this brand-new urban park grant program that has not been  through the committee of jurisdiction, the Natural Resources Committee,  if you are going to take money from one area and give it to this  urbanized park grant program, you at least need to make sure that the  area where the revenues are coming from, which happens to be the area  that I represent, that it is sustainable, that it is ecologically  sustainable and the community is sustainable and that it would be a  better investment for taxpayers to invest in the urban parks than it  would be to ensure the ecological and the community resilience or  sustainability of these regions.   That is it, a very simple amendment.   I would love to have anybody come explain to me why they are going to  vote ``no,'' because we are going to see this amendment voted down in  just a few minutes. I would love for anybody--and I would be happy to  yield time, Madam Speaker. I would be happy to have anybody explain to  me why they are opposed to this amendment and what they are going to  explain to people next time we have a hurricane and these communities  are decimated. That is what I would love to hear.   So, Madam Speaker, I yield my remaining time to my friends on the  other side of the aisle to explain to me the opposition to this  amendment.
