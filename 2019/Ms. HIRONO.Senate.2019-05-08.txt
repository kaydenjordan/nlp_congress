 Madam President, I thank Senator Murray for organizing  all of us to come to the floor in honor of Mother's Day. I will take  time to talk about the ongoing attacks on women's health in this  country.   I feel a sense of urgency about the increasingly hostile, escalating,  and unrelenting attacks on women's health by Donald Trump and  Republicans. From continuous efforts to defund Planned Parenthood, to  the taking away of title X funds, to trying to repeal the Affordable  Care Act--all programs that support healthcare for millions of women in  this country--I have to ask, why? What is the motivation to take away  healthcare services for millions of women in this country? It is not  clear why they are doing this. What is clear is the harm they are  causing women.   Repealing the Affordable Care Act would mean that insurance plans  would no longer be required to cover maternity care and birth control.  Insurance companies would be able to discriminate against people with  preexisting conditions. Astoundingly, for women, this would include  pregnancy.   Donald Trump and congressional Republicans are proposing trillion- dollar cuts to Medicaid. If implemented, this could endanger tens of  millions of women in this country who rely on Medicaid for coverage  during pregnancies and births. Do they even care that these cuts to  Medicaid are particularly cruel in the face of an infant and maternal  mortality crisis in our country, particularly for Black women?   By establishing a gag rule, Donald Trump is forcing healthcare  providers to choose between providing full and accurate information on  all available healthcare options for women, including for abortion, and  hundreds of millions of dollars in Federal title X funding. States like  Hawaii are refusing to succumb to this unjustified coercion by refusing  title X funds and are replacing them with hard-earned State funds so  that providers in our State, for example, can give the necessary  healthcare to women.   By trying to pass onerous, new abortion restrictions in States across  the country, conservative forces are working hard to undermine a  woman's constitutional right to have an abortion. One institution that  can stand up to this assault on women's rights and women's health is  our Federal judiciary. Last month, for example, a Federal judge in  Washington State blocked the implementation of the Trump  administration's title X gag rule. In March, a Federal judge in  Kentucky prevented a new law from going into effect that would have  restricted abortion after 6 weeks of pregnancy. These two recent  examples demonstrate the importance of our courts in upholding the  Constitution and the law and in constraining radical rightwing assaults  on women's health and rights.   To counter what independent judges are doing, Donald Trump, Leader  McConnell, and Senate Republicans are packing our courts with  ideologically driven conservative judges who will be on their  ideological page. Over the past 2\1/2\ years, they have confirmed more  than 100 new Federal judges, an overwhelming majority of whom was  selected by two ultraconservative organizations--the Federalist Society  and the Heritage Foundation.   Their efforts to pack the courts continue this week in an upcoming  vote on a nominee for the Second Circuit in New York, Michael Park, who  fought to restrict access to reproductive healthcare for women. In one  recent example, Mr. Park defended Kansas's attempt to defund Planned  Parenthood by terminating its Medicaid contracts. This would have ended  the vital services Planned Parenthood provides to low-income patients,  services such as cancer screenings and access to contraception.  Fortunately, the judges who heard that case rejected Mr. Park's  arguments. Yet, now, with his confirmation to the Second Circuit all  but assured, Mr. Park is set to become the judge in these types of  cases. It is no wonder that both of his home State Senators oppose his  nomination.   In their not being satisfied with packing our courts with judges who  have ideologically rightwing agendas, Donald Trump and Republican  leaders are resorting to incendiary, reprehensible, and false rhetoric  to inflame their base. We have seen this most recently in the debate  around the so-called Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act and  the vilification of women who seek abortions later in pregnancy.  Infanticide is already a crime, but you would never know it if you  listened to Republican politicians and their mouthpieces on FOX News  and the conservative media.   In a FOX News op-ed, my colleague from Nebraska, for example, accused  the Democrats of ``blurring the line between abortion and outright  infanticide.'' During the debate on the bill, ultraconservative FOX  News host Laura Ingraham compared Planned Parenthood--the Nation's  largest maternal health provider that has saved thousands of lives--to  Adolf Hitler. She said: ``Hitler, just like Planned Parenthood,  practiced and defended mass extermination.''   Immediately after the Senate defeated this unnecessary bill, Donald  Trump tweeted:         Senate Democrats just voted against legislation to prevent       the killing of newborn infant children. The Democrat position       on abortion is now so extreme that they don't mind executing       babies AFTER birth.    The President's incendiary and completely false rhetoric on this  issue has become a rallying cry at his bizarre political rallies across  the country. Last  [[Page S2719]]  month, in Green Bay, WI, for example, he said:         The baby is born, the mother meets with the doctor, they       take care of the baby, they wrap the baby beautifully, and       then the doctor and the mother determine whether or not they       will execute the baby.    This kind of rhetoric is simply outrageous. It is not harmless  electioneering. It is dangerous. It is incitement. It is also provoking  a dramatic uptick in threats to abortion providers and supporters of  abortion rights across the country.   This sustained rightwing attack is taking a heavy emotional toll on  women who seek to have abortions later in their pregnancies and the  doctors who provide this essential care.   Kate Carson, a woman from Boston who sought an abortion after Laurel,  her daughter, was diagnosed with catastrophic brain malformations in  2012, wrote a powerful op-ed about her painful decision.   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the  Record Kate Carson's op-ed, dated February 19, 2019.   There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in  the Record, as follows:                      [From USA Today, Feb. 19, 2019]   I Had a Later Abortion Because I Couldn't Give My Baby Girl Both Life                                 and Peace                   (By Kate Carson, Opinion Contributor)         No one loves my baby more than I do. Her death was a gift       of mercy. Now, women like me will always be a scapegoat for       policies limiting women's rights.        People are talking about me again, loudly, unkindly. Even       the president of the United States has had his say about       families like mine. I have told this story so many times, but       I will tell it again as many times as it takes.        I help run a support group for families who have ended       pregnancy after poor prenatal or maternal diagnoses. If       you're wondering, ``Who are these women who get abortions in       the third trimester?'' We are. I am. Parents who love our       babies with our entire hearts. Desperate acts like an       abortion in the 36th week of pregnancy are brought about only       by the most desperate circumstances and are only available to       those who can come up with a lot of money quickly.        I know. I've been there.        My daughter, Laurel, was diagnosed in May 2012 with       catastrophic brain malformations (including Dandy-Walker       malformation) that were overlooked until my 35th week of       pregnancy. I did not know much about brain disorders at that       point. I imagined developmental delay, special education       classes, financial pressure, an overhaul of expectations for       Laurel's life and my motherhood. Here were the doctors' real       expectations for Laurel: a brief life of seizures, full-body       muscle cramps, and aspirating her own bodily fluids.        When I heard the list of all the things my beloved daughter       would not do--talk, walk, hold her head up, swallow--I       grasped for what she would be able to do.        ``Do children like mine just sleep all the time?'' I asked.        The neurologist winced. Children like yours, he told me--      slowly--are not often comfortable enough to sleep.        Our choice was sad--but clear.        Let me answer some questions you might be thinking: Yes, we       were sure that these problems were severe. No, there is no       cure, nor any on the horizon. Yes, we were counseled in-depth       on our options, including adoption. Because we wanted to       spare our daughter as much suffering as possible, our choice       was very sad, but crystal clear: abortion.        I imagined an abortion at eight months would be grisly. But       no matter how violent my imagination, it surely could not       compare with the suffering Laurel would have endured in her       own broken body.        In Massachusetts, my home state, a later abortion can be       obtained only if the life or health of the mother is at risk.       So I set off on a 2,000-mile journey from Massachusetts to       Colorado to access this abortion. I landed, not in the       nightmare I had imagined, but in the safest, kindest, most       dignified hands I have ever encountered as a patient       anywhere. Dr. Warren Hem at his Boulder Abortion Clinic is       one of the few doctors in the country performing this       procedure. After a single injection and a couple of hours, my       baby was laid to rest in my womb, the purest mercy that I       knew how to give my Laurel.        As the usual hubbub of hate and misunderstanding around       abortion swelled to a roar this month, the president unfairly       addressed families like mine in his State of the Union       address. He hasn't really listened to women like me or       doctors like Dr. Hem. He seems to care nothing for the true       stories of heartbreak, loss and extreme medical complexity       behind abortion later in pregnancy. Instead, his agenda must       inflate fear and horror until every last American thinks of       unspeakable violence.        Mercy means something different to each family.        This is not about abortion. It is about power. This       administration needs the public to be angry at women like me       and misinformed about what compels women to seek later       abortions, which make up less than 1.5 percent of abortions,       according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.       But I believe that Americans can hear our story and meet the       painful, complicated truth about abortions later in pregnancy       with love and understanding.        And most Americans have compassion for a woman's choice       when it comes to her reproductive health care. In fact,       nearly 70 percent of Americans do not want to see the Supreme       Court completely overturn Roe v. Wade, according to the Pew       Research Center.        Nobody loves Laurel more than I do. Her death was a gift of       mercy. Mercy means different things to different loving       families, and that has to be OK. To all the families who       faced similar circumstances and made a different choice, I       honor you. I trust your wisdom. I celebrate your child's       brief and beautiful life.        We must treat each other with love, tenderness and respect.       It is horrible, as a parent, to choose between life and peace       for our children, especially when we want to give our       children both beautiful and precious gifts.        It is devastating to lose a child. But, unlike most       bereaved parents, women like me will live out the rest of our       lives as scapegoats, fuel for an agenda that seeks to strip       women and families of our reproductive freedoms.        When I think of my baby Laurel, I feel love and peace.       Unfortunately, I cannot be with that peace because there are       fresh wounds in the way, the throbbing pain of being hated       and misunderstood.     Madam President, here is some of what Kate wrote:         I help run a support group for families who have ended       pregnancy after poor prenatal or maternal diagnoses. If       you're wondering, ``Who are these women who get abortions in       the third trimester?'' We are. I am. Parents who love our       babies with our entire hearts. Desperate acts like an       abortion in the 36th week of pregnancy are brought about only       by the most desperate circumstances and are only available to       those who can come up with a lot of money quickly.        I know. I've been there.        My daughter, Laurel, was diagnosed in May 2012 with       catastrophic brain malformations . . . that were overlooked       until my 35th week of pregnancy.        I did not know much about brain disorders at that point. I       imagined developmental delay, special education classes,       financial pressure, an overhaul of expectations for Laurel's       life and my motherhood. Here were the doctors' real       expectations for Laurel: a brief life of seizures, full-body       muscle cramps, and aspirating her own bodily fluids.        It is devastating to lose a child. But, unlike most       bereaved parents, women like me will live out the rest of our       lives as scapegoats, fuel for an agenda that seeks to strip       women and families of our reproductive freedoms.    Madam President, it is outrageous and offensive that Donald Trump and  his allies in Congress would seek to turn women like Kate into  scapegoats for their political agendas.   I have been an advocate of abortion rights for decades, and I fear  that one day soon, women in this country will wake up and realize they  no longer have control over their own bodies. What could be more  intrusive than the government's telling women what they can do with  their own bodies?   In the face of these ongoing attacks on women's health and women's  rights, we will continue to raise our voices. We will continue to fight  back.   I yield the floor.
