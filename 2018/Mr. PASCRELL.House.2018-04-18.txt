 Mr. Speaker, yesterday was tax day. Today is tax day. I  call upon House Republicans to allow review of the President's tax  returns. Now it is tax day again, so I want to reiterate and give my  colleagues a vote for transparency.   It was reported yesterday that the President filed for an extension  on his returns, but while every President going back to Richard Nixon  released his tax returns to the American people in the name of  transparency and accountability, this President continues to keep his  own finances shrouded in secrecy.   He was told to disinvest at the very beginning of his administration  by the Office of Government Ethics, Mr. Shaub. The President has not.                                time  1245    Since February of 2017, I have been calling on the chairman of the  Committee on Ways and Means, of which I am a member, to request the  President's tax returns, which they have the power to do under section  6103 of the Tax Code. I called up resolutions, but 18 times the  committee and the House have voted against seeing the President's tax  returns--just seeing them.   Today, I renew my call for this Congress to act to review the  President's tax returns and out his conflicts and self-enrichment while  in office.   Why did President Trump support giving the wealthy and big  corporations a giant tax cut in the tax scam just passed in the  Congress in December?  [[Page H3408]]    Why is he letting lobbyists for Wall Street and Big Oil write their  own rules?   Candidate Trump promoted himself as a successful businessman who  would run the government like he ran his businesses. Well, let's take a  look at the business.   In Azerbaijan, he did business with the likely money launderer for  Iran's Revolutionary Guard. This is a fact. In the Republic of Georgia,  his partner was being investigated for bank fraud and money laundering.  In Indonesia, his development partner was deeply involved in ``dirty  politics.'' In Brazil, there were criminal investigations into his  deals. The FBI is reportedly looking into his Vancouver hotel where one  of the Trumps worked with a Malaysian family that admitted to financial  fraud. And in New York, Donald, Jr., and Ivanka were investigated for  financial crimes in their dealings with the Trump hotel in SoHo.   When he became the President, he did not divest himself from his  business. Since then, there is no question that Mr. Trump has profited  from the taxpayers and from their government positions, as have the  members of his Cabinet. The examples of self-dealing and quid pro quos  are too myriad to recount. Here are just a few.   January 23, 2017, Saudi Arabia held a party at the Trump hotel after  renting rooms for lobbyists for 5 months.   I know this is unpleasant to listen to, but we have a right.   And I return you to April of 2014, when the Speaker of this House  presently was the head of the Ways and Means Committee and dictated to  us how they had a right, as a legislative branch of government, to go  into the backgrounds, if not the tax returns, of Lois Lerner, who was  being investigated at that time, and nothing happened to her, of  course, but we argued the point on 6103. And he said, very  specifically: This is our duty to oversee the executive branch of  government.   Well, what is good for the goose is good for the gander. It is,  period, and that is what he said.   So Saudi Arabia, on January 23, 2017, held a party at the Trump  hotel.    February 28, Trump, who owns 12 golf courses, rolled  back a rule limiting water pollution by golf courses.   April 4, the State Department ran an online ad for Mar-a-Lago. Isn't  that nice?   September 19, reports reveal that the Pentagon spent more than  $130,000 a month to rent at the Trump Tower, more than twice as much as  the other tenants.   I have got a whole list of these, Mr. Speaker. I won't bore you, but  I will tell you this: We are going to enter them into the Record. This  is not the America I know, and this is not the America you know. We  have a right to put sunlight on the disinfection. That is our job. This  is a checks-and-balance system, Mr. Speaker, and we need--not to take  advantage of it, but we need to follow the rules. There are no  personalities here.
