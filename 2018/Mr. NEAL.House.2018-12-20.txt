 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I recall this very quaint time when some of us arrived  in Congress when the legislative session would wind down. There would  always be this stellar photograph of the Speaker of the House and the  Republican leaders and the Democratic leaders and the Republican and  Democratic leaders in the United States Senate, who would be  photographed on the front page of most major dailies on the phone  speaking to the President of the United States, regardless of what the  President's political affiliation might be.   So here we are closing the second session of the 115th Congress when  we had time to do this. Instead, this is the second iteration of an  irresponsible manner in terms of process that was offered to the  Democratic minority in this House.   On Monday night, we got notice of this without even seeing the  substance of the proposal that was in front of us. This is not the way  regular order functions nor, as I have just referenced, the way that  legislative sessions are supposed to conclude.   My friend--and I mean that with all sincerity--the chairman of the  committee, noted that the American people are waiting to hear from  Congress. Well, let me tell you this about these tax bills. It didn't  take the wealthy long to hear from Congress. They heard from them right  away, and the offering that they had was more concentrated wealth and  more tax relief for people at the very top in America--taking that top  rate from 39.6 to 37 percent, a cut in the corporate rate to 21  percent, doubling the estate tax, and here we are again with another  vehicle that is not paid for.   So where do we find revenue right now as a percent of gross domestic  product? It is at 16.4 percent. And we are hearing, well, just maybe  this tax bill might bring us to 17.5 percent, when the historic battle  tha the two parties have had in this House has generally been about  between 18 and 19 cents on the dollar.    So a year later, what do we have in front of us? The same procedure:  closed doors, no hearings, not one witness. And if you pick up some  gossip in the hallway about what this is to include, that is generally  conceded now to be a point of achievement.   So a year later, we are rushing another package through to correct  the errors that were delivered in the first bill.   And, by the way, these were not small errors. A couple of them were  big enough to drive a Mack truck through.   Not one hearing, not one witness, not one piece of evidence  documented to put in front of this committee.   So this is a last-ditch effort by our Republicans to revisit their  tax law and ensure that it further benefits those who really are the  strongest already in our society. They want to jam through some of  these provisions to help corporations at the expense of shining some  light on how we might have found a substantive opportunity to achieve a  bipartisan outcome.   The American voters delivered a resounding rebuke last month, and our  friends don't seem to understand what that message was about.   On election day, the tax bill polled that 49 percent were against and  41 percent were for. And if you think it was just a messaging problem,  that would be a mistake. They should have joined with us to advance  some very important matters that are in this legislation; and when we  would have had an opportunity to fix these together through  transparency, hearings, witnesses, I think we could have easily  accomplished a different outcome.   I oppose this legislation because it is also not offset. For the  third time this year, the party of fiscal rectitude that always  lectures us when there is a Democratic President about balancing the  budget went out and borrowed more than $2 trillion for the purpose of  providing a tax cut to the people at the top--$2 trillion added to the  budget deficits.   Can you imagine what the reaction would have been if Barack Obama or  Bill Clinton did that? The outrage would have been empowering in this  institution. We would have heard about it for years at a time. But, no,  it is okay to do it and then call it juice to the economy.                                time  1545    Well, there are many items in here that we fully approve of, but we  disagree with the approach that is being taken, and we disagree with  many of the substantive matters that are being offered.   There is a national principle involved here, and that is, we come to  the aid of all members of the American family when natural disasters  settle in, not on a piecemeal basis. And we will, I assure you, try  very earnestly and very quickly next year to address many of these same  issues. And I guarantee you this, for all members of this committee,  there will be hearings, and there will be witnesses, and it will be  done in daylight to make sure that there is an opportunity for all to  be heard, including our Republican friends.   To close on part of this measure as well, this bill significantly  erodes the Johnson amendment by allowing certain tax exempt  organizations to make political statements during the ordinary course  of activities.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself an additional 2 minutes.   So this would allow now priest, rabbi, imam, minister, to stand at  the pulpit and offer an endorsement of a particular candidate for  public office.   What happened to Jefferson's wall of separation?   What happened to the idea that, unlike Europe and places like that  where they have had religious strife for centuries, that we were able  to avoid that because of the wall that Mr. Jefferson very skillfully  constructed?   This is a dangerous precedent that threatens to politicize charitable  and philanthropic organizations.   Finally, the health provisions in this bill do nothing to increase  accountability for the device industry, employers, or health insurers.  If we are going to provide tax relief to corporations, we should have  guarantees that the savings will be reinvested in innovation; put more  dollars in workers' pockets, and lower insurance premiums.   Another issue that is not in dispute, Mr. Speaker, is the following:  Overwhelmingly, that tax cut went to share buybacks with corporations  and dividends. It did not come to the benefit of people who needed tax  relief every single day.   There are a number of provisions here that we find very supportable,  but the idea that we are doing this in the closing minutes of the 115th  Congress, I think, is objectionable to our side.   The proposal before us is not paid for. It did not go through the  regular order, and I urge our colleagues to oppose this legislation.  [[Page H10471]]    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Michigan (Mr. Levin), the ranking member of the Health Subcommittee,  who has served this institution with great distinction and dedication  over many years.   (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas  (Mr. Doggett), the ranking member of the Tax Policy Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson), the very assertive spokesperson from Napa  Valley and my friend.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oregon  (Mr. Blumenauer).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Oregon.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  Jersey (Mr. Pascrell), the always erudite Mr. Pascrell.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Judy Chu), well-known for her financial acumen.    Mr. Speaker, we don't object to the three brackets being  lowered for the American people in the middle class. We object to the  idea that there were no hearings on this and the top brackets were  reduced, doubling the estate tax exemption, cutting the top rate from  39.6 percent to 37 percent. If you want to do that for people at the  very end of the economic scale, we are in.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms.  Jackson Lee).    Mr. Speaker, could we have clarification as to how much  time is remaining on each side.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, so the holy grail of the tax cut was the constant  reference to the stock market. That is what we have heard for the last  year. I wonder about some of our Members, if they want to compare their  401(k) to what it was like in October of 2008. Or as we have witnessed  that constant reference to the stock market, the stock market, the  stock market, and a reminder that at the end of 2017, the stock market,  or the Dow Jones Industrial Average went up to 24,719, and this  afternoon, it is at 22,859.   Mr. Speaker, I call attention to that because of the chaotic nature  in which this legislative body has functioned: no hearings, no  witnesses, legislation crafted, we don't know where, brought to the  floor, and then referenced as the achievement of a rising stock market.   So here we are again without one single hearing, rushing through  another tax package that is not offset, and doubles down on the  original law's skewed benefits for people at the top, again, without a  markup or a single hearing.   A rushed process resulted in a failed product. And now, they want to  duplicate that process with these changes proposed here today.   The bill includes a number of provisions that could have been  reconciled very easily with our side enthusiastically, including the  references that Mr. Kelly made to retirement benefits. We are all in.   But the hit on nonprofits--by the way, taking away benefits for  parking for some of the nonprofits, is but another example of how this  legislation actually lacked substance.   We can do much better. And I certainly want to encourage colleagues  to oppose this legislation on process and policy, and just as I yield  back, we on both sides here, are very fortunate to have exceptional tax  advisers in terms of the staff members, and I want to thank Kara Getz  for her work as the chief tax counsel as she moves to her new role in  my office as well.    Mr. Speaker, I would like to be able to say Merry Christmas to all,  but this tax bill does not help my enthusiasm. But I will still say  Merry Christmas to all, and I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
