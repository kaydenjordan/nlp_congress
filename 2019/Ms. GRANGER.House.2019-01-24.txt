 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.J. Res. 31.   Mr. Speaker, we have a true humanitarian and security crisis on our  southern border. In the month of December alone, Border Patrol agents  apprehended more than 50,000 individuals on our southern border. Of  those, a record-breaking 27,518 were family units; nearly 5,000 of them  were unaccompanied children.   Due in part to the treacherous journey, Border Patrol refers  approximately 50 individuals a day for medical treatment. In 1 week  alone, at the end of December, they referred 451 people to medical  providers for treatment; of those, 259 were children. Seven out of ten  people are victims of violence on their journey to the southern border;  31 percent of women are sexually assaulted.   There has been a significant increase in drugs like methamphetamine,  heroin, and fentanyl coming across the border. Unfortunately, this is a  crisis partly of our own making. For years, Members on both sides of  the aisle have warned against the growing threats posed by our failure  to enforce and reform our Nation's immigration laws. Just this week,  Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said:         We want border security. We want to make sure that people       who come into the United States of America are authorized to       do so, and we know they come in. We don't want contraband. We       don't want drugs coming in. We don't want dangerous people       coming into the country. So we are for border security.    Given this, we would think that they would be jumping at the chance  to vote for a bill that includes:   Provisional status for 3 years for 700,000 current DACA recipients,  giving them access to work permits, Social Security numbers, and  protection from deportation;   Provisional status for 3 years for 300,000 immigrants whose current  temporary protected status is set to expire;   $805 million for technology, canines, and personnel to help stop the  flow of illegal drugs, weapons, and other contraband;   $800 million in humanitarian assistance, medical support, and new  temporary housing;   $782 million to hire an additional 2,750 border agents, law  enforcement, and staff;   $563 million to support our immigration court system, including  hiring 75 new immigration judge teams to reduce the immigration court  backlog of 800,000 cases.   All of this was included in the reasonable compromise that President  Trump put forward over the weekend, but that is not the bill we have  before us. Not only did House Democrats reject this plan before they  even heard the details, the bill they put on the floor today provides  not one single reform for our broken immigration system. All this bill  does is extend the status quo.   Mr. Speaker, I have been to the border more times than I can count. I  have talked to these families who are risking their lives and the lives  of their children to come here. I have heard the stories of Americans  whose family members' lives were cut short due to drugs and bad actors,  who seek to exploit our immigration system.                                time  0930    We owe it to all of these families to do something about this crisis,  and I call on my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to end the  political games. It is past time for them to come to the negotiating  table and work to resolve this crisis in a reasonable, meaningful way,  and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this measure.    Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.    I am, in its current form.    Mr. Speaker, my motion amends the date of the continuing  resolution to January 24. My motion will ensure that Homeland Security  employees will get the pay they deserve, consistent with the Government  Employee Fair Treatment Act that was enacted last week.   Last week and yesterday, I offered motions very similar to this one  to immediately pay the hardworking Federal employees affected by this  shutdown. Many of these people are on the front lines protecting our  Nation. They shouldn't suffer because of this unnecessary shutdown, and  they don't have to any longer if Members would support this motion.   Last week, six Democrats voted for my motion, and yesterday, 10 did.  Today, I call on all members of the majority party to agree with me  that we should provide Homeland Security employees the backpay they  deserve and join me in voting for this measure.   These employees have bills to pay and families to support. This  motion will ensure that they are able to do that immediately while we  continue working toward a permanent solution that will reopen the  government. The homeland security staff protecting the Nation should  not be harmed because some of my colleagues refuse to negotiate.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the motion, and I yield back  the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.   The yeas and nays were ordered.
