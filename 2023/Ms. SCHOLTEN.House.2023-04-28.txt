 Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of the bipartisan  Protecting Sibling Relationships in Foster Care Act.   Several students from my district have written in to ask me to  support this essential piece of legislation. Frankly, they have a  really good point.   We know that CPS investigations and removals are traumatizing for  children. When we keep kids together in foster care, we protect them  from adverse experiences, provide them with continuity, and help  expedite the delivery of services to them at a critical time.   Currently, it is estimated that 53 to 80 percent of these children  are separated from one or more of their siblings while in care. This  can't continue.   There are overwhelming psychological, academic, operational, and  humanitarian reasons for supporting this legislation. This bill would  increase the placement of siblings together in foster care and  encourage the development of programs designed specifically for sibling  groups.   It is pragmatic, bipartisan, and, most importantly, good for our  kids.   Mr. Speaker, I call on my colleagues to do right by our children and  support this legislation as well.                            ____________________
