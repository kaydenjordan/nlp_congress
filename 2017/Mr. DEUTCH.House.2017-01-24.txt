 Madam Speaker, it doesn't take a law degree. It doesn't  take imagination. All it takes is common sense to see that President  Trump's ownership and his family's operation of hotels and golf courses  and rental properties is ripe for corruption.   President Trump's failure to completely divest his ownership interest  not only violates tradition followed by every other modern President,  it is unconstitutional. The Constitution prohibits any U.S. official-- including President Trump--from taking payments from foreign  governments.   His ongoing involvement in The Trump Organization will let foreign  governments funnel payments to his businesses. Foreign operatives will  try to curry favor with the administration with no accountability to  the American people.   When he took the oath of office last week, President Trump swore to  preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.  Sadly, his refusal to cut his business ties has broken that vow in  these very first days of his administration.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, on Saturday, I proudly stood shoulder to  shoulder with thousands of strong women and their allies in south  Florida. It was one of hundreds of demonstrations across the country  and the globe, millions of people in the streets sending a loud message  that rang out all across the world.   But the GOP majority has chosen to ignore the calls for women to be  able to control their own bodies and their own health care. This bill  says to American women: your bodies, Washington's rules.   The majority uses talking points about getting Washington out of  health care when they are fighting to kick 32 million people off their  insurance, but when it comes to women's bodies, House Republicans are  happy to step between a woman and her doctor.   As a man, I have never had to drive across State lines to find a  doctor. I have never had my doctor silenced about a medical procedure.  As a man, I have never had to endure an invasive and unnecessary  procedure to satisfy someone else's twisted political desires. These  experiences are all too common for women in America today.   While I and my male colleagues in Congress get to have an open and  honest relationship with our doctors, this bill will deepen the ugly  fight against women's control of their own bodies. Reproductive rights  are women's rights and must be respected. Show that respect by voting  ``no'' on H.R. 7.
