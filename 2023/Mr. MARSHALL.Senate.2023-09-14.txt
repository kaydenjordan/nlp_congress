 Thank you so much for sharing this moment with us. You  know, one of my mentors here on the Hill has a saying that some  Senators come here to make a point and others come to make a  difference. The first time Senator Sanders and I sat down together, he  said: Roger, do you want to make a difference?   We have worked so hard on this issue together, developing rapport,  confidence in each other, in our staff--they have all done an  incredible job--as we try to get through this riddle from healthcare  challenges throughout this great Nation.   I think as both of us travel back to our home States of Vermont and  Kansas, what we found is that not everybody has meaningful, affordable  access to primary care. So we went out and tried to find the best  actors, what is the best outcome, who is making a dent? And I think we  both discovered that our community health centers were doing a great  job. They had taken many pilot programs, and they were improving them.   I am not sure what Senator Sanders would talk about some of his, but  what I saw was this meeting patients where they are a concept,  integrating all the different elements of primary care--not just your  blood pressure, not just your Accu-Chek, but also your mental health.  Dental needs, as well, are just a few more things we are seeing being  integrated into the community health centers--nutrition coaching,  something that has seldom been done in clinics before. So I think we  saw these community health centers as doing a great job. And we asked  each other: How can we improve upon that?   And Senator Sanders and I agreed on this lofty goal that we could get  more Americans into these clinics, and that was a great solution for  primary care. So for the past 3 months, we have had a very thoughtful  approach to this problem. And even before then, our committees had  multiple hearings with different folks as they tried to address the  problem as well. And then we had multiple Zooms and meetings with folks  back home: How do we solve this primary care problem and, again, this  mental health epidemic slapping us in the face every time we go back?   And, certainly, I think most of our committee would agree that the  community health centers are a great solution, but they need to be  bolstered and need to continue that mission across this great Nation.   So I am proud of the work that we have done on the community health  centers in this legislation--again, thoughtful legislation. And our  goal is to make sure it doesn't cost American taxpayers any more.   Again, Senator Sanders and I both said many times this country is  spending plenty of money on healthcare, but maybe we need to refocus a  little bit more of it to primary care. That is what we have done with  this legislation, again, with a thoughtful approach. And our goal,  again, is to make sure it is all paid for and it doesn't cost the  American taxpayer any more.   I think the other big issue that we found in common with folks back  home is a nursing shortage and a primary care doctor shortage. If there  is one thing that this bill would do, it would turn around the nursing  crisis in a matter of just 3 years.   My own wife is a community college graduate nurse. Ninety percent of  the nurses in our hospitals in Kansas, especially the rural hospitals,  are 2-year community college graduates. So what we have done with this  legislation is bolster more money for nursing programs. And the other  program, like Senator Sanders said, the other challenge, is colleges  cannot afford the faculty, the nursing faculty. So we have some money  to help bolster that program up as well.   We have young men and women standing in line for incredible jobs in  healthcare, but we don't have the faculty to bring them in. So we help  with scholarships. We help with the faculty. That alone will change the  dynamics across America if we have more nurses who are just the glue to  this healthcare  [[Page S4509]]  system. And then the next challenge of the attack here is just a  shortage of primary care doctors in so many ways as well.   So the legislation addresses that. It is great steps forward. I have  been very proud, again, to work with Senator Sanders and his team,  finding common ground. And I think we made incredible strides.   Senator Sanders and I have talked many times about our community  health centers. I might just ask him about the successes that you are  seeing in your community health centers and what your vision going  forward looks like.    Senator Sanders and I discussed this vision of what  primary care looks like in the future, making sure we are meeting  patients where they are.   Some of our community health centers back home are bringing in the  food bank; they are bringing in the WIC Programs, social services,  basic mammography. We lose track of the patients when we have to say:  Come back in a month for your mammogram. Instead, it is a great thing  to say: Let's get it done today.   One of the biggest underserved areas of medicine is dental. I know  that one of Senator Sanders' visions, specifically, in this legislation  is to address the dental crisis. As an obstetrician myself, the only  known cause of preterm labor is poor dental health, caries, cavities,  whatever you want to call it. There are lots of links to having  cavities and poor gum health to having heart attacks as well. It is a  way underrecognized challenge for primary care.   I can't tell you how many times I have been called at 10 at night or  2 in the morning on a Saturday with one of my OB patients who is  obviously very pregnant, but she has a cavity, and now, it turned into  an abscess. I can't get her into a dentist. I call all my buddies. It  is Saturday, 10 p.m., and all my buddies, the dentists, are gone.   Share your vision on dental and how this bill impacts that.    I want to turn this discussion to what our vision is  for these primary care community health centers.   I think we all realize we have an obesity epidemic in this country,  too, and a type 2 diabetic epidemic in this country that we need to  address on the front end.   I am so happy to see some of my community health centers coming in  and doing nutrition classes. They are doing cooking classes. I think so  many folks of our current generation maybe learned how to do some  cooking, but fast foods were a little bit too easy. It is that out-of- the-box thinking you get with different programs. I call it coaching.  We need to be coaching folks up and teaching them but also give them  the opportunities. So whether we are on the Ag Committee and working on  food programs, we try to bring all these pieces together in the program  as well.    I know Senator Sanders is also certainly committed to helping us  address this. He has been a leader on this issue, trying to take care  of folks with diabetes as well.    I might close with a couple of thoughts. Again, we came  in with the lofty expectations that we could make a difference in  primary care for people across the Nation. I think our bill  accomplishes just that.   Again, I can't thank the staff enough for their support through this.  Senator Sanders and I spent most of the August recess--and our staff  spent every moment of every hour of every day on this August recess-- working on this legislation. I think it is a good product. I think  there is always opportunity for improvement. We are welcome to those  ideas.   I appreciate the Senator using traditional Hyde protections at the  appropriate places, so we maintained that, which is important to many  folks, including to myself. I think we addressed primary care issues. I  think we have a plan to increase the nursing workforce. Again, in 3  years' time, we can turn that problem around and long-term address some  of the primary care issues. Addressing dental, as well, I think will be  a huge improvement.   At the end of the day, you cannot overestimate how much money this  will save in programs like Medicare and Medicaid and the health  insurance back home and help drive the cost of healthcare down for  people. I am glad  [[Page S4510]]  to see us try to emphasize maybe some better ways to spend the American  taxpayer moneys.   But most importantly to me, the physician, is just this is the right  thing to do. This is absolutely the right thing to do. It is a chance  to improve the health of Americans. I am just proud to stand here  beside Senator Sanders and introduce this legislation. Thank you.    Mr. President, I rise today to honor and  celebrate the career and legacy of Mr. David Smith.   In the realm of visionary leadership in the independent grocery  industry, few names shine as brightly as David Smith's. David has had a  long and successful career in the food industry, beginning as an  independent store owner and then rising the ranks to work in various  assignments at the wholesale level in leadership positions, and serving  as an officer on the National Grocers Association board of directors  executive committee.   David's ascent to the helm of Associated Wholesale Grocers marked a  pivotal moment in the company's strategic direction. Guided by an  unwavering commitment to excellence, he steered AWG to new horizons of  growth and prosperity. His strategic acumen and forward-thinking  approach not only expanded the company's reach but also fostered an  environment of collaboration and empowerment.   A true luminary, David's leadership extended beyond the boardroom.  His emphasis on cultivating strong partnerships transformed suppliers  into allies, fostering a sense of unity within the industry. David's  ability to foresee trends and adapt to evolving market dynamics was  nothing short of remarkable.   David's legacy extends far beyond business success. His philanthropic  endeavors exemplify his compassionate heart and commitment to giving  back to the community. His leadership in charitable initiatives served  as a beacon of hope, illuminating the path toward positive change and  societal betterment.   As we reflect on his remarkable journey, we pay homage to a servant  leader who redefined mentorship, innovation, and corporate  responsibility. His legacy serves as a testament to the transformative  power of visionary thinking and unwavering determination. In  commemorating David Smith, we pay tribute to his shining example of  what is possible when passion, purpose, and leadership converge.   I now ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the legacy and career  of Mr. David Smith, as well as congratulate him on his upcoming  retirement.                            ____________________
