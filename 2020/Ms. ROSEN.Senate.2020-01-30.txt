 Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. I am sorry. The House managers have 2\1/2\  minutes.   Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Chief Justice and to our Senators,  Senators, thank you so much for that question. I know you have asked  about a conversation between a father and his son, and what I can tell  you, probably like just about everybody in this Chamber, there are  probably some conversations that I can't repeat to you about my  conversations with my son. So I don't know the answer to your question,  Senator, what that exact conversation was.   But what I can tell you is this: If we are serious about why we are  here--and I have no reason to doubt that we are--we are serious about  seeking the truth because the truth matters, not just for those who  have paid the price in our history to form a more perfect union and  protect our democracy, but it is important for our future. And in this  case, if we are serious about that, then I can tell you this: that we  are serious, then, about hearing from fact witnesses.   Looking at the Bidens, no matter how many times we call their name,  we have no evidence to point to the fact that either Biden has anything  at all to tell us about the President shaking down a foreign power to  help him cheat in the next election--the President's election trying to  steal each individual in this country's vote.   I don't believe either Biden has any information about that, but let  me tell you who I think does. Maybe we should call Ambassador Bolton.  If we are serious about the truth, maybe we should call him because we  have a good idea about what he might say. Or what about Mr. Mulvaney,  who had day-to-day contact with the principal in our investigation--the  President of the United States.   That is not good enough? Well, what about--the question was asked  about when did we know--or when did the President first put the hold  on. Well, we do have reports that say on June 19 of 2019, Mr. Blair  personally instructed the Director of OMB to hold up security  assistance from Ukraine--over a month before the infamous July 25 call.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mrs. Manager Demings.   Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Nevada.    Mr. Chief Justice, I send a question to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Rosen is addressed to the House managers:         Over the course of your arguments, you have tried to make a       case that the President put his personal interests over those       of the Nation, risking our national security in the process.       What precedent do you believe the President's actions set for       future Presidents?    Mr. Manager CROW. Mr. Chief Justice, Senator, thank you for that  question. It is one that I have wanted to answer for some time now.   You have heard me speak before about some of my personal experience  in service to the country, and one thing that experience has taught me  is that we are strong not just because of the service and the sacrifice  of our men and women in uniform, which is extreme and pure in all of  its sense and something that I think everybody in this Chamber actually  appreciates and respects, but we are also strong because we have  friends. We are strong because America doesn't go it alone.   You know, when I was in Iraq and Afghanistan, I worked frequently  with Afghan Army partners, Iraqi Army partners and others, not because  it was important but because it was essential. We couldn't accomplish  the mission without it. But if those partners feel like our policies-- what we say publicly--don't matter; if they feel like we are not a  reliable and predictable partner; if they feel like the American  handshake isn't worth anything, then they will not stand by us. They  will not stand by us.   For over 70 years, since the end of World War II, the partnerships,  the alliances that we have built, that we have strived to create, that  have ushered in an unprecedented period of peace and prosperity  throughout the world, will start to fray because the American handshake  will not matter. Ukraine has started to learn that.   Our 68,000 troops throughout Europe deserve better because every day,  they get up and they do their job--the job we have asked them to do-- and they rely on our consistency, our predictability. They rely on the  interest being in the national interest, not the whims and the personal  interest of the President, whether that be President Trump or any other  President.   It will continue to call into question our broader alliances, and it  will send a message that the American handshake doesn't matter.   We have a slide that shows the evolution of some of the different  arguments that we have seen on the other side that I think is important  to see.   (Text of Videotape presentation:)         President TRUMP. Russia, if you are listening, I hope you       are able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing. I think       you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press. Let's       see if that happens.         Mr. Chief Justice.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. The Senator from Nevada.    I have a question I send to the desk for the House  managers.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   The question from Senator Rosen is for the House managers:         During the President's phone call with Ambassador Sondland       he insisted there was no ``quid pro quo'' involving the       exchange of aid and a White House meeting for an       investigation, but he also said, according to Sondland, that       the stalemate over aid will continue until President Zelensky       announces the investigations. Isn't that the definition of       the exact quid pro quo that the President claimed didn't       exist?    Mr. Manager SCHIFF. The short answer is yes; that is exactly what a  quid pro quo is.   When someone says: ``I am not going to ask you to do this,'' but then  says: ``I am going to ask you to do this,'' that is exactly what  happened here.   Sondland calls the President, and the first words out of his mouth  are ``no quid pro quo.'' Now, that is suspicious enough when someone  blurts out there--what we would find out is a false exculpatory, but  then the President goes on, nonetheless, to say: ``No quid pro quo.''   At the same time, Zelensky has got to go to the mic to announce these  investigations--that is the implication--and he should want to do it.  So no quid pro quo over the money, but Zelensky has got to go to the  mic.   And if you have any question about the accuracy of that, you should  demand to see Ambassador Taylor's notes, Tim Morrison's notes. And, of  course, Sondland goes and tells Ukraine about this coupling of the  money in order to get the investigations.   Let me just, if I can, go through a little of the history of that.  You have Rudy Giuliani and others trying to make sure the Ukrainians  make these statements in the runup to that July phone call. This is the  quid pro quo over the meeting. So they are trying to get the statement  that they want. They are trying to get the announcement of the  investigations. And around this time, prior to the call, the President  puts a freeze on the military aid. And then you have that call, and the  minute that Zelensky brings up the defense support and the desire to  buy  [[Page S734]]  more Javelins, that is when the President immediately goes to the favor  he wants.   So the Ukrainians, at this point, know that the White House meeting  is conditioned on getting these investigations announced, but in that  call, the minute military aid is brought up, the President pivots to  the favor he wants of these investigations they already know about.   Now, after that call, the Ukrainians quickly find out about the  freeze in aid. According to the former Deputy Foreign Minister, they  found out within days. July 25 is the call. By the end of July, Ukraine  finds out the aid is frozen. The Deputy Foreign Minister is told by  Andriy Yermak: Keep this secret. We don't want this getting out. She  had planned to come to Washington. They canceled her trip to Washington  because they don't want this made public.   And so, in August, there is this effort to get the investigations  announced. That is the only priority for the President and his men. So  the Ukrainians know the aid is withheld. They know they can't get the  meeting. They know what the President wants, these investigations. And  the Ukrainians, like the Americans, can add up two plus two equals  four. But if they had any question about that, Sondland removes all  doubt on September 1 in Warsaw, when Sondland goes over--after the  Pence-Zelensky meeting, he goes over to Yermak, and he says that  ``until you announce these investigations, you are not getting this  aid.''   He makes explicit what they already knew--that not just the meeting  but the aid itself was tied. And on September 7, Sondland tells  Zelensky directly: The aid is tied to your doing investigations. And it  is at that point, on September 7, when Zelensky is told by Sondland  directly of the quid pro quo, that Zelensky finally capitulates and  says: All right; I will make the announcement on CNN.   And then the President is caught. The scheme is exposed. The  President is forced to release the aid. And what does Zelensky do? He  cancels the CNN interview because the money was forced to be released  when the President got caught.   But that is the chronology here. Let's make no mistake. The  Ukrainians are sophisticated actors. As one of the witnesses said, they  found out very shortly after the hold. The Ukrainians have good  tradecraft. They understood very quickly about this hold.   And what would you expect when you are fighting a war and your ally  is withholding military aid without explanation and the only thing they  tell you that they want from you are the announcement of these  investigations? And if it wasn't clear enough, they hammered them over  the head with it and told Yermak on September 1: You are not getting  the money without announcing these investigations. They tell Zelensky  himself on September 7: You are not getting the money without these  investigations. And finally the resistance of this anti-corruption  reformer, Zelensky, is broken down. He desperately needs the aid.  Finally, the resistance is broken down: All right; I will do it. He is  going to go on CNN.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you, Mr. Manager.   The Senator from Kansas.
