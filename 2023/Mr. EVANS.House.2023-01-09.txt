 Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this  legislation that will cut major investments in the IRS that will help  American taxpayers receive the benefits they have earned. It is  important.   This tax cheat act would gut IRS funding to protect Republicans'  wealthy corporate investors. It is important to understand that I urge  my colleagues to reject the Republican tax cheat act.   It is important because this is politics above people. The reality is  this is not about people. This is really all about politics.   I thank Mr. Neal, who led this effort through the Ways and Means  Committee, and colleagues who fought for the importance of investment  in the IRS.   Mr. Speaker, I stand today to encourage people to say ``no.''
