 Mr. Chief Justice, I have a question for the House  managers, and I send it to the desk.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Senator Leahy asks the House managers:         The President's counsel argues that there was no harm done,       that the aid was ultimately released to Ukraine, the       President met with Zelensky at the U.N. in September, and       that this President has treated Ukraine more favorably than       his predecessors. What is your response?    Mrs. Manager DEMINGS. Mr. Chief Justice, Senators, thank you so much  for your question.   Contrary to what the White House counsel has said or has claimed-- that there was no harm, no foul; that the aid eventually got there--we  promised Ukraine in 2014 that if they gave up their nuclear arsenal,  that we would be there for them, that we would defend them, that we  would fight along beside them.   Fifteen thousand Ukrainians have died. It was interesting the other  day when the White House counsel said that no American life was lost,  and we are always grateful and thankful for that. But what about our  friends? What about our allies in Ukraine? According to Diplomat Holmes  and Ambassador Taylor, our Ukrainian friends continue to die on the  frontlines, those who are fighting for us, fighting Russian aggression.  When the Ukrainians have the ability to defend themselves, they have  the ability to defend us.   The aid, although it did arrive, took the work of some Senators in  this room who had to pass additional laws to make sure that the  Ukrainians did not lose out on 35 million additional dollars.   Contrary to the President's tweet that all of the aid arrived and  that it arrived ahead of schedule--that is not true. All of the aid had  not arrived.   Let's talk about what kind of signal is sent, withholding the aid for  no legitimate reason. The President talked about burden-sharing, but  nothing had changed on the ground. Holding the aid for no legitimate  reason sent a strong message that we would not want to send to Russia-- that the relationship between the United States and Ukraine was on  shaky ground. It actually undercut Ukraine's ability to negotiate with  Russia, with which, as everybody in this room knows, it is in an active  war, in a hot war.   So when we talk about ``The aid eventually got there; no harm, no  foul,'' that is not true, Senators, and I know that you know that.  There was harm and there was foul. And let us not forget that Ukraine  is not an enemy. They are not an adversary. They are a friend.   The CHIEF JUSTICE. Thank you.   Senator Cruz?
