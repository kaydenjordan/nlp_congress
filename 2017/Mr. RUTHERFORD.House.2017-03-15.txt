 Mr. Speaker, tonight I rise to speak of fairness, to  speak of equity, to speak of parity for America's hardworking  taxpayers. I want to talk about bringing parity between Americans who  get their insurance coverage through their employer and those who are  forced to purchase theirs on the individual market.   Currently, over 150 million Americans who have employer-sponsored  health insurance enjoy a tax benefit to  [[Page H2076]]  purchase that health insurance. However, Americans who purchase their  insurance in the individual marketplace, like farmers, small-business  owners, plumbers, and mechanics, do not have a similar kind of benefit.  Mr. Speaker, simply put, this is just unfair.   However, the American Health Care Plan helps fix this inequity by  offering a portable tax credit to help these Americans purchase the  health insurance they choose. These credits are also age-adjusted so  older Americans who have higher healthcare costs will also see a larger  credit to assist them in purchasing that insurance.   Mr. Speaker, I can tell you, many individuals and families in  Florida's Fourth Congressional District will benefit from this reform  and for the first time will be on a more level playing field in  purchasing their health insurance. We are fighting for basic fairness.  No American, no small-business man or woman, no farmer, plumber, or  mechanic should be disadvantaged because of where they work or where  they are forced to purchase their insurance.
