 Madam President, in the past week and a half, the  American people have seen a confusing and chaotic process play out  right here in the Senate.   They have seen uncorroborated, decades-old allegations of wrongdoing  pop up in the press at the last minute, just as Judge Brett Kavanaugh's  confirmation process was winding down.   They have seen an accuser's request for privacy disregarded and  ordinary standards of fairness completely discarded.   They have seen a disturbing pattern play out on two separate  occasions already. It goes like this: No. 1, our Democratic colleagues  on the Judiciary Committee get wind of or maybe even go looking for a  sensitive allegation. Second, they decline to share it with the  majority, meaning the committee cannot promptly take appropriate  action. Third, they allow the allegation to leak to the press at the  last moment.   Fortunately, in stark contrast to this malpractice, the American  people have also seen the exemplary manner in which Chairman Grassley  has led the Judiciary Committee throughout the entire process. The  chairman has acted swiftly and transparently in pursuit of the truth.  He has treated Dr. Ford with kindness and respect. Acknowledging that  the irresponsible and irregular manner in which her allegation was  brought to light was no fault of hers, the chairman opened a dialogue  with Dr. Ford's counsel. He deferred to her preferences on the timing  of her hearing and a number of other details.   I will quote from a letter the chairman wrote to Dr. Ford yesterday.  Here is what Chairman Grassley had to say:         I am committed to fair and respectful treatment of you. . .       . [The] hearing on Thursday will allow you to testify and       also will allow the nominee to address the allegations. . . .       Both of you deserve a credible and fair process in a secure       and professional setting.   [[Page S6284]]     That was Chairman Grassley.   So we have one side that is handling these sensitive matters with  dignity, with professionalism, by the book, and we have another side  that chose to sit on allegations and keep them secret until they were  leaked to the press--the same side as the Democratic leader's, who had  already made up his mind mere hours after Judge Kavanaugh was chosen  and said: ``I will oppose him with everything I've got.'' Well,  apparently so.   Look, the American people know that sexual misconduct is gravely  serious. They expect this to be treated seriously and addressed  promptly. That is precisely what Chairman Grassley has done and is  doing. But the American people also insist that vague, unsubstantiated,  and uncorroborated allegations of 30-plus-year-old misconduct--where  all the supposed witnesses either totally deny it or can't confirm it-- is nowhere near grounds to nullify someone's career or destroy their  good name. Justice matters. Evidence matters. Facts matter.   Let's look at one of the supposed witnesses, Ms. Leland Keyser. She  is not a friend of Judge Kavanaugh's. In fact, she says she doesn't  even know him. Rather, she is a longtime friend of Professor Ford's.  What does Ms. Keyser say about the allegations? Through her lawyer, she  says that she ``does not know Mr. Kavanaugh and she has no recollection  of ever being at a party where he was present, with, or without, Dr.  Ford.'' In other words, she backs up Judge Kavanaugh's statement.   Look, this is America here we are talking about. We are supposed to  uphold fairness and a presumption of innocence. Everyone deserves  better than this--not just Judge Kavanaugh; everyone deserves better  than this.   I was surprised and disappointed by the recent statements on  television from some of my Democratic colleagues, including one  statement this weekend that Judge Kavanaugh is not owed the presumption  of innocence. One of our Democratic colleagues said Judge Kavanaugh is  not owed the presumption of innocence, because they disagree with his  judicial philosophy. That is not a standard we want to set in America.   No matter how loudly my Democratic colleagues try to say otherwise,  we have never been and do not wish to be a society in which a single,  uncorroborated allegation--disputed by everyone who supposedly has some  knowledge of it--can float out across decades and wield veto power over  somebody's life.   Judge Kavanaugh is an immensely bright and qualified nominee. We have  heard from legal experts and scholars that he is one of the fairest and  most brilliant jurists anywhere in our country. We have heard from  hundreds of character witnesses from his high school days to the  present who vouch for his character and his integrity.   Yet the need for a fair process runs even deeper than Judge Kavanaugh  himself. As he wrote in his own letter to Chairman Grassley yesterday,  the weaponization of unsubstantiated smears--that is what we have here,  the weaponization of unsubstantiated smears--``will dissuade competent  and good people of all political persuasions from service.''   This isn't what Members want the Senate to be. This isn't what  Americans want our society to be. So I look forward to hearing from  both Dr. Ford and Judge Kavanaugh under oath this Thursday morning. I  am glad we will be able to hear testimony from both. Then I look  forward to an up-or-down vote on this nomination right here on the  Senate floor.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all  postcloture time on Executive Calendar No. 941 be considered expired at  1:45 p.m. on Wednesday, September 26; that if confirmed, the motion to  reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; and that the  President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session for a period of morning business, with  Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, at the end of this month, my friend Jim  Paxton will end his 32-year tenure with the Paducah Sun newspaper in  western Kentucky. Through his service as the paper's editor and  publisher, Jim has shown a dedication to his community and his  organization, and he deserves our sincere gratitude. Looking back at  his experience with the paper, Jim called it, ``the best job a person  could ask for.'' It is my privilege to congratulate him on his  remarkable career in journalism.   Founded more than 120 years ago as the Paducah Evening Sun, Jim's  newspaper has always been a family business. Before joining the paper,  Jim worked with other news organizations in Nashville and Lexington and  went to law school. However, after a tragic aviation accident that  claimed the life of the Sun's previous editor, Jack Paxton, Jim left  his legal career behind and agreed to lead the local institution.   Jim began at the Sun in 1986 and soon after earned the title of  editor. With his brothers David and Richard, who later joined the  company, the family expanded their media offering to better serve their  community. The story of Paducah is intertwined with the region's river  system, and the Sun has the news that its readers need for their day.  There is a great deal of local news to cover. Paducah is the heart of  our Nation's inland waterways network, and it is home to both the  National Quilt Museum and the U.S. Department of Energy's Gaseous  Diffusion Plant. Further, in 2013, the U.N. Educational, Scientific,  and Cultural Organization, UNESCO, designated Paducah as the world's  seventh City of Crafts and Folk Art. The Paducah Sun, under Jim's  leadership, has kept a close eye on each of these aspects of the city's  life and heritage.   In recent years, Jim has taken a leading role in crafting the Sun's  editorial page, a page of his paper I rarely miss. I have especially  enjoyed each of my opportunities to meet with the paper's editorial  board to discuss the issues most vital to Paducah's future. By  presenting a fair and even-handed opinion to his audience, Jim and the  Sun's staff have made themselves a central feature of the day for many  western Kentuckians.   When Jim leaves his post at the end of this month, he does so after a  career filled with distinction and one he can be proud of. Whatever the  future may hold for Jim and his family, I send them my sincere best  wishes. Families throughout Paducah and across the Commonwealth have  benefited from Jim's diligence and thoughtfulness, and I would like to  express my profound gratitude to him. I ask my Senate colleagues to  join me in congratulating Jim Paxton, the gold standard for a  professional newsman, on a successful career and wishing him a happy  retirement.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation be discharged from  further consideration of S. 3389 and the Senate proceed to its  immediate consideration.
