 Mr. Speaker, today, the Democrats got their wish.  Special Counsel Robert Mueller testified before not one but two House  committees.   I wonder if they would reconsider that in hindsight. I don't think it  went as they had planned.   Today's hearings only hammered home the simple fact we already knew.  The special counsel did not find evidence to charge the President with  a crime. Game over.   Sadly, this was nothing more than political theater and a colossal  waste of time. Democrats wanted reinforcement for their partisan witch  hunt against the President. Didn't happen.   If anything, today's testimony is only going to raise more questions  as to why this entire investigation was even opened in the first place  and why exculpatory evidence wasn't included in the report.   After wasting 22 months, 25 million taxpayer dollars, and countless  other resources, Americans deserve to know the truth about how this  whole episode was fabricated and who is responsible.   The Steele dossier, abuse of our intelligence agencies, DNC direct  involvement? If Democrats would put as much effort in improving our  country as they do into baseless attempts to impeach the President, we  might just be able to get something done around here.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to move on from this disaster and  get back to work for the American people.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I move that the House do now adjourn.   The motion was agreed to; accordingly (at 10 o'clock and 49 minutes  p.m.), under its previous order, the House adjourned until tomorrow,  Thursday, July 25, 2019, at 10 a.m. for morning-hour debate.
