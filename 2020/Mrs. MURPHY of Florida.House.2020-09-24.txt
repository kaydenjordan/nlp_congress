 Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor an American  patriot, a great and good man, and a hero of mine, Brent Scowcroft, who  passed away recently.   From humble roots, Brent rose to become an Air Force general, the  National Security Advisor to two Presidents, and a statesman whose  counsel was sought by policymakers of all political stripes.   After his passing, Brent's family and friends held a ceremony to  celebrate his life. They described Brent as an exceptional public  servant who left an indelible stamp on U.S. foreign policy and on the  National Security Council as an institution.   Brent's contributions as National Security Advisor may be his primary  legacy, but what I find most striking about the tributes to Brent are  not what they say about him as a professional, but what they say about  him as a person.   As Stephen Hadley put it: ``There are few people in Washington who  were as respected and revered as Brent Scowcroft. It was not just  because of what he did. . . . It was because of who he was. A true  gentleman . . . much loved by all who had the privilege of working with  him.''   Bob Gates noted that Brent was ``tough as nails on matters he cared  about,'' but also ``the most decent, kindest, and humble person I have  ever known.''  [[Page H4891]]    These words resonate with me because I was one of the many people who  had the honor to call Brent a role model and a friend. Brent served as  a mentor to multiple generations of men and women who valued his wisdom  and sought to emulate his example.   I met Brent between my sophomore and junior year of college when I  interned at The Scowcroft Group, a firm Brent founded after leaving  government.   I was assigned to write a piece on the prospect of Russia selling  missiles to Cyprus. I remember gingerly asking Brent for guidance in  the way a young nobody approaches a distinguished somebody, expecting  to be brushed off. He couldn't have been kinder, patiently walking me  through the intricacies of the issue, telling me stories about his  experience negotiating with the Soviets, and making me feel at ease.   It was these small acts of grace, repeated so many times, for so many  people, when nobody else was watching, that made Brent so special.   Our first meeting was the start of a lifelong friendship that I  cherished. Brent took more joy in the success of others than in his own  success, and he genuinely cared about me, my family, and my career.   I know how happy he was when his former intern became the first  Vietnamese-American woman ever elected to Congress. It made me proud to  make him proud.   In fact, it was Brent Scowcroft who is partially responsible for my  decision to enter public service. As luck would have it, Brent gave the  commencement speech at my college graduation. His message was about the  importance of a strong but humble American leadership around the world.  It was also about the value of public service, especially government  service.   Brent's words stirred something in me. I was a refugee from Vietnam  whose family's life had been saved by the U.S. Navy. Brent's speech  made me realize that public service might be the best way for me to  chisel away at the debt of gratitude I owed this country.   I recalled that speech after 9/11, when I left my private-sector job,  went to grad school, and on to work at the Department of Defense. I  also recalled that speech a decade later when I made what some might  call a foolhardy decision to run for Congress.   After Brent's passing, I tracked down that speech. It wasn't easy  because Brent often wrote things by himself and then tended to throw  them away, which was consistent with his unpretentious character.   Reading it again made me emotional, and it made me miss Brent. It  still inspires me all these years later. In the speech, Brent asked me  and my young classmates, our futures before us, to reflect on what we  would like our epitaph to say after we drew our last breath.   Then he offered this gentle advice: ``I would hope that many of you  would consider turning to public service. There is something enormously  fulfilling about being engaged in something bigger than you yourself.  It imparts a satisfying sense of purpose which, in my experience, is  not attained in any other way. And there is a desperate need in this  country for good people to man our government structures. I know it is  getting more and more difficult to be a public servant. We have driven  many of our best people away. But I ask you to consider public service,  not because it is easy, but because it is hard, rewarding, and oh-so- necessary. How well the wonderful things this great Nation stands for  will be preserved and projected will depend on the quality of people  whose hands are on the helm of state.''   This Nation was blessed to have Brent's steady hands on the helm of  state.   Ginny Mulberger, one of Brent's closest friends and colleagues, said  the word that best described Brent was ``devotion.'' He was devoted to  his country, his family, and his friends.   His legacy will be carried forward by men and women he taught,  mentored, and inspired to pursue public service. What better epitaph  could there be?   Rest in peace, General.                            ____________________
