 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R.  5038, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2019.   I am very proud to support Congresswoman Lofgren, members of the  Hispanic Caucus, and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who  helped make this bill possible today.   There are, in the United States, four or five major industries that  would not exist the way they do but for immigrant labor, documented,  and undocumented. One of those industries is the agriculture industry.   This bill would recognize the important work that undocumented  workers do in our agriculture industry. It would recognize that their  work deserves respect; that it is dignified; that it has a place in our  country; and that they have a place in our country. It would do so by  allowing for a path to legal status for these workers.   For 2 million folks, it would mean that they would no longer face the  threat of deportation; that they and their families could rest assured  that in the middle of the night they would not be taken away from their  children.   This legislation is important to our country, and I hope that all of  my colleagues, Republican and Democrat, will support it today.
