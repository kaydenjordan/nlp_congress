 Mr. Speaker, I stood before you in this very spot not  long ago urging this Congress to do the work of the American people  that the American people sent us here to do. Yet, 2 months later, not  much has changed. Distrust in government is still at an all-time high,  and it is not hard to see why. Our Federal debt continues to approach  $20 trillion. Our Tax Code remains broken and burdensome. Threats  continue to rise abroad. And here at home, by the way, our veterans are  still not getting the care they deserve despite the progress that we  have made this week on that issue. From my perspective, this is  unacceptable.   Despite the fact that Congress, by any metric we devise, is not doing  the basic job the American people sent us here to do, in 7 weeks, we  are going to adjourn on a month-long vacation without reforming the Tax  Code or getting our appropriations done. And just 30 days after  returning from the August recess, if we don't make some hard choices,  the government may shut down, cutting our constituents from access to  the programs they depend on for their livelihoods.   My message is simple: let's work through the August recess because in  what other job would you grant yourself a month off if you hadn't  gotten your work done?   I know we need to get back home to meet with our constituents, but  more than anything else, I believe our constituents sent us here to do  our job, to work together to fix problems, rather than punt them to the  next generation.   So, please, let's stay here and let's do the work for the American  people.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the  Strengthening Career and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act.   Not only is this bill critical to giving American workers the skills  they need to lead in an increasingly competitive world, but also to  making sure that our  [[Page H5128]]  career and technical education is in stride with the major advancements  that have been made over the last decade.   As I travel across northeast Wisconsin, businessowners routinely tell  me they are hiring, but can't find workers with the knowledge and  skills necessary to do the jobs they are hiring for.   Passage of this bill helps close the skills gap and boost economic  growth by equipping students with the skills they need to fill the in- demand and high-skilled jobs in our local economies.   Schools in Wisconsin's Eighth District are prepared to lead the way  when it comes to closing our country's growing skills gap, and it is  time that we give them the tools that they desperately need to do  exactly that.   I am proud to cosponsor this important piece of bipartisan  legislation. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this bill.
