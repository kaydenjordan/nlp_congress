 Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 1, rule I, I demand a  vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal.    Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a  quorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not  present.    Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend my colleagues for  their steadfast commitment to pursuing and achieving a bipartisan  agreement that prevents another government shutdown, upholds our shared  values, and provides stability for American families.   I am encouraged that we have returned to a productive dialogue and  set a constructive tone that seeks to unite and not further divide us.  The American people expect and deserve nothing less.   Now, it is my hope that we continue that same spirit of  bipartisanship as we return our focus to governing and addressing the  important issues facing our Nation. That means working together to  ensure access to quality, affordable healthcare for every person, to  protect the promise of Social Security and Medicare, to expand economic  opportunity, and to stop the devastating cycle of gun violence.   Progress can only be achieved through cooperation and partnership,  and I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the  aisle to deliver results that uplift the lives of all Americans.                            ____________________
