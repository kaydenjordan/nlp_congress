 Mr. President, I rise to speak about a horrible tragedy  that occurred in Adams County, CO, on January 24, just last week. Adams  County sheriff's deputy Heath Gumm was pursuing a suspect when he was  shot and killed in the line of duty.   Heath was 31 years old and is survived by his wife and other loving  family members. He had served with the Adams County Sheriff's Office  since 2012, which was not a surprise to those who knew him best,  because of his upbringing.   He grew up in a family of first responders. His father is a retired  West Metro Fire Protection District engineer. So his teachers and  classmates who knew Heath as a student at Mullen High School, in  Denver, were not shocked to learn that he had decided to become a law  enforcement officer.   As reported by the Denver Post, Heath's ninth grade English teacher,  Sean Keefe, said:         By all accounts, he lived his life as a grown man as he did       as a kid. He was a good guy. That didn't change. That only       got more accentuated as he grew up. He lifted his friends. He       made his friends the best version of themselves, and they did       that to him as well.    Heath's cousin remembers him as the ``kind of man you wanted out  there protecting our streets. He was kind, fair, funny and friendly to  everyone.''   Keefe went on to remember Heath as ``someone people gravitated  towards, and he was someone who people could count on.''   It is these qualities that made Heath such an incredible sheriff's  deputy.   At a press conference last Thursday, Adams County sheriff Michael  McIntosh read parts of a letter he had received from a stranded  motorist whom Heath had recently helped when he was out on patrol.   The resident wrote: ``Heath made the interaction enjoyable and easy  to get through instead of acting like I was in trouble or a nuisance.''   Heath showed what it means to be a law enforcement officer who  selflessly serves and protects a community. He went to work each and  every day--ready to walk that thin blue line.   When we lose an officer in Colorado, I come to this Chamber to honor  his sacrifice and recite the words of LTC Dave Grossman, who wrote that  American law enforcement is the loyal and brave sheepdog who is always  standing watch for the wolf that lurks in the dark.   Unfortunately, many in this Chamber have heard me read that quote far  too often in the last weeks.   Across Colorado and across the country, we owe so much to Heath and  law enforcement officers for their service. Instead of fleeing to  safety, they run toward danger to save lives. They provide hope and  safety to our families in the worst of times.   I thank Heath for answering the call. He protected his community. I,  along with Coloradans across the State, are forever grateful. We will  never forget his sacrifice, and we will always honor his memory.   We also lost a sheriff's deputy on New Year's Eve in Colorado, just a  few weeks before. In a tribute to him, I read something that former  State Representative Joe Rice had written during his service in the  Army. I think it is appropriate to share it now because, each and every  day they wake up, I know the thoughts of many in law enforcement are  reflected in the words of Representative Joe Rice:         In a few hours, it will be Christmas in Afghanistan. I       spent 3 Christmas Days in Iraq. Only on one of them did I       have to go out on Christmas Day, itself. I found myself       praying that I didn't want to die this day and ruin every       future Christmas for my family. I realize that most of the       other soldiers I was with were quietly or openly saying the       same thing.        So, for all of those around the world who are in harm's       way, we pray with you: Please God, just not today.    To our men and women in law enforcement, please know that I pray with  you each and every day: Please God, just not this day.   I yield the floor.
