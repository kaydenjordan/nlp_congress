 Mr. Speaker, last week, I received a  letter from a Boy Scout in my district telling me how his family has  been forced to change their budget and cancel their summer vacation.   Unfortunately, this story is not unique, and right now, more than  two-thirds of Americans have been forced to dip into their savings to  pay for groceries and gasoline. This is the reality of an economy that  has been wrecked by Biden's socialist spending spree.   These policies have consequences, and it is estimated that American  families will spend an additional $460 a month because of inflation.  Just this morning, it was reported that inflation rose by 9.1 percent  in the past year.   Let's call this 9 percent inflation what it is. It is a tax on  workers and families, and it is having a severe impact on my community.  It is time to stop spending money that we don't have on policies that  we don't need. It is time to return to fiscal responsibility.                            ____________________
