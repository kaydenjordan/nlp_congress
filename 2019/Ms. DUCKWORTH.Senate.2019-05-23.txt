 Mr. President, in 1902, a little known machinist by  the name of Charles Edward Taylor began working for Orville and Wilbur  Wright at the Wright Cycle Company in Dayton, OH. Over the course of 6  weeks, using only a metal lathe, drill press, and hand tools, Mr.  Taylor built a 12-horsepower engine that was used to power the Wright  brothers' first successful aircraft in 1903.   Today, Charles Taylor's May 24th birthday is observed as Aviation  Maintenance Technician Day to recognize the thousands of men and women  who follow in Mr. Taylor's footsteps and fulfill a critical safety role  in the U.S. aviation industry. Whether maintaining military,  commercial, general aviation, private, space, or experimental aircraft,  aviation maintenance technicians use their specialized knowledge and  skillset to ensure that all aircraft are safe and reliable.   I want to thank aviation maintenance technicians across Illinois and  throughout the Nation for their hard work and dedication. Their  expertise and integrity ensures the U.S. aviation system will remain  the safest and most reliable in the world.                            ____________________
