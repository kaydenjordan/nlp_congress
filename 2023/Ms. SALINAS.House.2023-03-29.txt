 Madam Speaker, as Women's History Month comes to a  close, I rise to recognize a few of the remarkable women who call  Oregon's Sixth District home.   This month my office accepted submissions of inspiring women from  across our community. While we couldn't possibly feature all of them,  the women you see here today represent some of the best Oregon has to  offer.   Every day, women hold the weight of the world on their shoulders.  Take Lori Simpson, for example. Lori has worked at a nonprofit for 20  years, giving back to vulnerable members of our society throughout her  career. Outside work, she is laser-focused on building a happy home for  her two boys, especially after she was tragically widowed when her  youngest was just 11. She is unstoppable and loved by all who know her.   The same can be said for Estela Anaya, another remarkable woman from  Oregon's Sixth. Twenty years ago, Estela left her home and her family  in Mexico in hopes of providing her five children with opportunities  she could only dream of. Estela struggled to learn English, but never  to care for her children. She showed up to every meeting, concert, and  game because for her, family comes first.   Family is the foundation of life for so many women in our community,  but that doesn't limit them from doing more because the women of  Oregon's Sixth District can do it all.   Just look at Kristen Stoller. When she is not being a devoted mom to  three beautiful children or running her successful business, she is  working to make Yamhill County stronger and safer as a volunteer, board  member, and nonprofit leader.   Then there is Remy Drabkin, a community organizer and elected  official who is currently serving as the mayor of McMinnville. Outside  her duties, Remy doubles as an entrepreneur and small business owner.  Her incredible winery is now a staple in Willamette Valley.   Of course, we can't leave out Valerie Castillo, who is described by  those who know her as ``in every way an everywoman.'' Valerie works  with food banks, donates blood, hosts exchange students, and has been a  union steward for years.   Women like Kristen, Remy, and Valerie are a reminder that  ``Everything Everywhere All At Once'' is more than just a best picture  recipient; it is a way of life.   The next few women I want to mention have a shared gift for turning  adversity into purpose.   Vivian Ang is one of those women. When she was younger, Vivian failed  third grade because she struggled to read, but she didn't let that stop  her. No. She turned that experience into a force for good, and now she  runs a literacy organization that has tutored thousands of adults and  helped hundreds gain citizenship.   Vivian's story reminds me a bit of Donna Lepley's story. Donna  struggled with alcoholism for 40 years before she found the strength  and support to embrace recovery. When she was 57, she went back to  school, eventually earning her master's in psychology and addiction  counseling. Donna now works to help people struggling with addiction  and is living proof that recovery is possible.   Of course, when we are talking about turning adversity into purpose,  we need to talk about Caitlin Sticka. Caitlin is a two-time breast  cancer survivor who founded a group to provide support and resources  for families who are impacted by this awful disease. She makes people  feel welcome and safe during what can be a frightening, isolating  experience, and she is changing lives, one survivor at a time.   Like Vivian, Donna, and Caitlin, Erica Jauregui also faces  challenges. She was homeless as a teen but turned that into a plan to  serve Oregonians at the Department of Human Services. Today, she is  someone who fights hard for unhoused communities and other vulnerable  individuals, and she has made a big difference in our community.   Last, but certainly not least, I want to tell you about Namene James  Rodgers. Namene is a diversity, equity, and  [[Page H1532]]  inclusion specialist whose mission is to ensure that her organization  is as inclusive and compassionate as possible. She embodies the quality  that unites all of these women, a shared desire to build a better  future for all.   Lori, Estela, Kristen, Remy, Valerie, Vivian, Donna, Caitlin, Erica,  and Namene, you enrich our community beyond measure. Never doubt your  impact because we all feel it every single day.                            ____________________     Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1, the  polluters over people act.   Vladimir Putin's war on Ukraine demonstrated that the clean energy  transition isn't just important for our planet, it is important for our  national security.   It revealed the dangerous pitfalls of our overreliance on global oil  and gas markets. The solution is not to deepen our reliance on fossil  fuels, it is to go all in on clean, American energy. We need to ramp up  solar, wind, hydrogen, and other similar projects across the country.  Oregon is poised for this type of investment in development.   However, H.R. 1 doesn't do that. Instead, it repeals major clean  energy programs, even going so far as to target the home  electrification rebate designed to help American families make their  homes energy efficient, yet another petty, retributive action by House  Republicans.   This bill worsens the climate crisis and hampers our ability to  produce clean energy here at home. It is a disaster in the making.   I also want to talk more specifically about my community back home.  Oregon's Sixth District is home to hundreds of specialty crop farmers  who grow everything from blueberries to wine grapes and hazelnuts. The  farming tradition in the Willamette Valley dates back centuries. It was  even publicized in the 1820s as a ``promised land of flowing milk and  honey.''   Today, this land faces a serious threat. Specialty crop growers in my  district recognize the imminent danger the climate crisis poses to  their farming tradition. Many are already feeling  [[Page H1551]]  the impacts of our warming planet as extreme drought, heat waves, and  wildfires diminish crop yields and endanger farmers' livelihoods.   H.R. 1 would exacerbate the climate crisis, and further threaten  Oregon's future. This bill would repeal key clean energy programs in  favor of unmitigated fossil fuel production, leading to more emissions  and harmful climate impacts.   For all these reasons and more, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no''  on this legislation.
