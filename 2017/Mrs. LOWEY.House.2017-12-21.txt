 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a failure of both process and  substance. When Congress received the paltry and insufficient disaster  request from the administration, the House and Senate Appropriations  Committees began a bipartisan and bicameral process to develop an  emergency assistance package that would come closer to meeting the  massive scale of need resulting from hurricanes and wildfires in the  summer and fall 2017.   I sincerely regret that the majority leadership abandoned that  process, choosing, instead, to disregard input from Democrats and even  from Senate Republicans, and developed their own partisan supplemental.  The results of that decision is a poor product that will not be enacted  into law.   Despite some robust funding levels, this bill fails to fix a  potentially calamitous Medicaid system situation for Puerto Rico and  the U.S. Virgin Islands. Without help from Congress, these programs  will exhaust available funding within months. This bill also fails to  waive unworkable and unjustifiable cost share requirements for FEMA and  the Army Corps of Engineers' projects, which could put Federal funding  out of reach.   These and other serious shortcomings must be fixed before an  emergency supplemental is enacted into law. Even if this supplemental  passes today, the House majority's decision to exclude both Democrats  and Senate Republicans from this process means that it will not be  enacted this year because it cannot pass the Senate.   Instead of the partisan product with no chance of advancement, we  should be considering a responsible bipartisan emergency supplemental  that both the House and the Senate could pass and enact into law.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Serrano), the ranking member of the Commerce, Justice,  Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.   (Mr. SERRANO asked and was given permission to revise and extend his  remarks.)    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New  York (Mr. Crowley), the chair of the Democratic Caucus.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 additional minute to the gentleman  from New York.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).    I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Thompson).    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my  time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute to close.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to reiterate that the bill before us is  insufficient to meet the needs of those living in Puerto Rico and the  Virgin Islands. Months after hurricanes devastated the islands,  hundreds, if not thousands, of Americans have died, and far too many  people are living without basic necessities that all Americans should  have.   I include in the Record a letter from Puerto Rico's Resident  Commissioner, Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, which requests Medicaid  assistance and 100 percent Federal costs for FEMA and Army Corps  projects which are not included in the bill.                                      Congress of the United States,                                        House of Representatives,                                  Washington, DC, December 20, 2017.      Hon. Thad Cochran,      Chairman, Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,      Ranking Member, Appropriations Committee, U.S. Senate,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Rodney Frelinghuysen,      Chairman, Appropriations Committee, House of Representatives,           Washington, DC.      Hon. Nita M. Lowey,      Ranking Member, Appropriations Committee, House of           Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Chairmen Cochran and Frelinghuysen and Ranking Members       Leahy and Lowey: I write to draw your attention to several       disaster supplemental appropriations matters that are       important to Puerto Rico's recovery from the catastrophic       damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. The revisions I       propose to the disaster supplemental legislation that       Congress is currently considering are necessary for       rebuilding the lives of the 3.4 million U.S. citizens who       live on the island.        Regarding any federal funding for Medicaid in Puerto Rico,       it is imperative that disaster supplemental legislation       provide that for not less than two years Puerto Rico will       receive 100% federal funding (FMAP). This funding is       necessary because there is no question about Puerto Rico's       looming Medicaid crisis: within the first months of 2018,       absent emergency funding, Puerto Rico's Medicaid program will       exhaust its current funds and the island's Medicaid system       will collapse, which will bring to a halt Puerto Rico's       entire healthcare system.        The disaster supplemental legislation must be revised so to       statutorily waive for two years Puerto Rico's state cost       share for FEMA Public Assistance. Moreover, the disaster       supplemental legislation must be revised so to include a two       year waiver of the cost-sharing requirements for all Army       Corps of Engineers projects in Puerto Rico.        As you know, the recent hurricanes have destroyed Puerto       Rico. The lives of millions of U.S. citizens are now in the       federal government's hands. I look forward to continuing to       work with you to move forward the proposals I have outlined       in this letter. Together we can rebuild Puerto Rico better       than ever and make the island anew. At this moment, the       federal government has an opportunity to demonstrate       America's commitment to all its citizens, including those who       reside in Puerto Rico.            Sincerely,                                          Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon,                                   Member of Congress, PR-At Large.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this epic failure of governing.   Nearly 3 months into the fiscal year, the Republican majority is  advancing  [[Page H10398]]  its third temporary continuing resolution with no foreseeable path  forward on enacting full-year appropriations and no evident urgency to  address priorities that are critical to American families and  communities.   Completely preoccupied with showering tax breaks on corporations and  the wealthiest Americans, the majority has failed to clear the  extremely low bar of charting a course to keep the government open and  meet deadlines they have set for themselves.   In short, the Republican majority has made a complete mess of the  very basics of governing. Now they want Democrats to bail them out by  carrying a bill that neglects our priorities.   This continuing resolution should include the bipartisan Dream Act,  protecting from deportation young people who were brought to this  country as small children and only know the United States as home. But  this bill tells those facing deportation that their plight is not our  concern.   It should include a bipartisan reauthorization of the Children's  Health Insurance Program, providing long-term certainty for 9 million  children and families who depend on the program. Instead, this bill  tells children and families their medical needs are not our priority.   It should include an agreement to raise caps for defense and  nondefense spending with parity so that appropriators can get to work  on a full-year spending package that keeps America secure and  prosperous. Instead, the bill tries to make an end run around solely  the defense cap by slipping in nearly $5 billion in new spending for  the Pentagon.   It should not clean up the mess the majority made triggering  automatic reductions to Medicare because of their deficit-busting tax  bill.   The majority wants to pass this bill and go home for the holidays,  somehow content with its performance on behalf of the Americans they  represent. In every sense, this bill fails to live up to our  responsibilities as legislators and as Representatives. Given these  failures, I urge a ``no'' vote.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.                                time  1600     Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), the ranking member of the Interior,  Environment, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the ranking member of the Energy and Water  Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Ohio an  additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  California (Ms. Lee), a member of the Appropriations Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz), the ranking member of the Military  Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the ranking member of the Labor, Health and  Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentlewoman from Connecticut.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the Democratic whip.    Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the  gentleman from Maryland.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, once again, this is an epic failure of governing.   How many more times will we have to pass a continuing resolution,  which not only denies certainty to men and women in uniform and all  Federal employees, but is an inefficient waste of taxpayer dollars?   How many more times would the majority stumble from crisis to crisis,  narrowly averting a shutdown?   It is long past time that the majority work with Democrats to  increase the budget caps and write full-year spending bills. The  Appropriations Committee stands ready to do our job. I hope that  Republican leadership finally does its job and agrees to permit  reasonable spending bills that invest in America's future.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
