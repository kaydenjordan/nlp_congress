 Madam Speaker, I rise today in honor of  Larry Joe Alexander of Jerseyville who passed away on September 6 at  the age of 57.   After graduating from Jersey Community High School, Larry attended  Worsham College of Mortuary Science and obtained his degree in funeral  directing and embalming.   Larry married his true love, Julie Ann Calvey, in 1989. After  building a beautiful life together, Julie passed away on May 14, 2016,  after a brave battle with cancer.   In 1985 Larry started his career in the funeral home business. In  1992 Larry was elected as the Jersey County Coroner and continued to  hold that office until his death. Larry was a member of the First  Assembly of God church in Jerseyville, the Jersey County Republican  Party, the Shriners, Full Moon Masonic Lodge 341, the Scottish Rite,  and many other organizations.   His passing is a loss for the 13th District and everyone who had the  pleasure of knowing him. In the past few months, Larry and his  daughters have been in the process of creating a scholarship in his  wife, Julie's, memory. His daughter, Alyssa, and niece, Kari Jo, have  decided to honor both their parents with a joint education scholarship.   Shannon and I send our thoughts and prayers to Alyssa, Kari Jo, and  the rest of Larry's family.   Larry, may you rest in peace my friend.                                time  1015             Honoring the Distinguished Service of William Haine     Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor my  good friend, William Haine, for his distinguished service to the State  of Illinois and the American people.   Bill was born in Alton in 1944. He attended St. Patrick's Grade  School and Marquette High School in Alton, and received a Bachelor's  Degree from St. Louis University. Soon after, he enlisted and served in  Vietnam as a member of the First Cavalry Division, earning the Bronze  Star for Meritorious Service in Combat Operations.  [[Page H4869]]    After returning home from Vietnam, he earned his juris doctorate from  St. Louis University, where he met his future wife, Anna.   Bill began his career as a clerk for George Moran of the Fifth  Appellate Court District. He soon became an assistant public defender  while entering into private practice. Bill's illustrious career of  public service began with his election to the Madison County Board. He  was then elected to multiple terms as the Madison County State's  Attorney and eventually as a State Senator in the 13th District. At the  time of Bill's passing just a few weeks ago, he was serving on the  Illinois State Board of Elections.   Bill was a member of many civic and religious organizations,  including the Knights of Columbus, the Equestrian Order of the Holy  Sepulchre of Jerusalem, and the American Legion and VFW.   One of my favorite stories about Senator Haine was when he and his  family and his wife, Anna, came to tour Washington, D.C., and I had a  chance to take him on the House floor here and on the Senate floor  where Bill, who wasn't in the best health when he came, decided to sit  down in the Senate, and an overzealous Senate staffer came out and  said: ``I'm sorry, but that chair is reserved for a Senator.'' And Bill  said: ``I'm a Senator.''   And I happily reminded that overzealous staffer at the time that it  was actually a staff member's chair and Bill was okay sitting there  while we showed the glorious splendor of what we get to see every day.   Shannon, my kids, we send our heartfelt prayers to his wife, his  seven children, his 38 grandchildren, and his great grandchild.   Bill's commitment to public service was second to none.                     Honoring the Service of Joe Champley     Madam Speaker, I rise today to  recognize one of my best friends in the world, Joe Champley, who was  honored as Taylorville Junior High School's Teacher of the Month for  September. Joe has over 30 years of experience serving as a teacher,  coach, mentor, and friend to so many in our community.   Joe received Taylorville Junior High School's Red Apple Award which  honors his outstanding dedication to students and staff. As an  instructor, his compassion and care for kids is unmatched, as is his  humor. He teaches because he believes teachers can make a difference in  kids' lives, and he hopes to lead them down the right path. And I can  count countless numbers of kids who have gone through the junior high  school that I went to who Joe has helped.   One of his fondest memories is when he introduced the Illinois  Secretary of State, Jesse White, and all the students chanted  ``Champley needs a raise. Champley needs a raise.''   Joe graduated from our high school, Taylorville High School, in 1985,  after having an outstanding career in athletics. During Joe's tenure as  a three-year starter on the basketball team, the Tornadoes won an  Apollo Conference Championship and a regional championship; and he  happens to still be 16th on the all-time Tornadoes scoring list.   The Taylorville community, my community, is honored to have leaders  like Joe Champley. Joe is somebody who has made a difference in so many  lives, and he is going to continue to do that for many years to come.   I wish you the best, Joe, my friend.                            ____________________
