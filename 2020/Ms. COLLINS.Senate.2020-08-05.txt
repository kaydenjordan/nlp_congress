 Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the State  Veterans Homes Domiciliary Care Flexibility Act. This bill would  address a current gap in care for veterans in Maine living with early- stage dementia. Specifically, it would ensure that the VA can waive  certain eligibility requirements to allow veterans with early-stage  dementia to be cared for in State veterans' homes when it is in the  best interest of the veteran.   In Maine, we lead the way in caring for our veterans. For more than  40 years, Maine Veterans' Homes has been a vital part of our State's  commitment to our heroes. My father, Donald Collins, a decorated World  War II veteran, was cared for by the Veterans' Home in Caribou at the  end of his life, so I know firsthand the compassion and care that Maine  Veterans' Homes provide. In the land of the free, Maine Veterans' Homes  help ensure that there will always be a home for the brave when they  need care.   As chairman of the Senate Aging Committee and representing the oldest  State by median age in the country, I have championed policies to help  individuals living with dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease, as well  as America's hidden heroes--our military and veteran caregivers. I  cofounded the Senate Alzheimer's Task Force in recognition of the  devastating impact  [[Page S4945]]  that disease has on individuals and families.   Our Nation owes America's veterans our deepest gratitude. We must  honor our commitment to veterans by continuing to support their needs,  including the needs of veterans who are living with early-stage  dementia.   The State Veterans Homes Domiciliary Care Flexibility Act would  require VA to implement a waiver authority, allowing the VA to grant  domiciliary care per diem payments for veterans who meet at least half  of the VA's current eligibility requirements and if such a waiver would  be in that veterans' best interest. This will provide the flexibility  to ensure this vulnerable group of veterans do not fall through the  cracks and that VA can help address the growing needs for assistance  for these patients.   Mr. President, this legislation has the support of Melissa Jackson,  the president of the National Association of State Veterans Homes, as  well as Kelley Kash, CEO of Maine Veterans' Homes, and I urge all of my  colleagues to join me in honoring and supporting some of our Nation's  most vulnerable veterans by supporting its passage.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the State  Veterans Homes Domiciliary Care Flexibility Act.
