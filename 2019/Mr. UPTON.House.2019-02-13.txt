 Mr. Speaker, I thank my fellow dean, my bipartisan dean on  the  [[Page H1569]]  other side. I have so many stories to tell, so I am going to watch the  clock here a little bit. I am going to ramble. I don't have a prepared  speech.   I am delighted to be here. I am delighted that you were able to get  this time for some of us to speak and honor a legend. And when you  think about this last year, man, we have lost some really terrific  ones: President Bush, John McCain, others. Certainly, John Dingell  joins those ranks as a distinguished American who really made a mark on  everyone's life in this country.   Mr. Speaker, I include into the Record an article written by editor  Nolan Finley of The Detroit News.                   [From the Detroit News, Feb. 9, 2019]                 John Dingell Knew How to Live, How To Love                             (By Nolan Finley)         I was up to my waist and cork tight in what I can only       describe as quicksand when I looked up and saw John Dingell       squinting down at me with that familiar, satisfied grin.        ``How in bloody hell did you get in there? And more       important, how in blue blazes are you going to get out?''        We were hunting ducks on Maryland's Eastern Shore. I'd       winged a goose that came down running, and was in hot pursuit       when I stepped into the hole of muck and quickly sank.        John pulled me out, and then finished off the goose.        I never know how to answer when someone asks how a       conservative, Republican-leaning newspaperman could become       such fast friends with a New Deal Democrat who shaped the       liberal politics and policies of the second half of the 20th       century.        I never occurred to either of us that we could be anything       else.        John didn't choose the people he loved based on political       compatibility. Certainly, he had strong opinions, and so do       I, and we engaged often in intense discussions. Not once in       25 years did we exchange angry words, nor ever part with hard       feelings.        We were more than our politics. When together, our       conversation quickly moved to our common loves--guns and       hunting. It was what drew us together in the first place.        John was a great hunter, a dead-eye with a shotgun. I was       with him when he shot the last duck he ever killed. Four of       us were settled into a blind on a brisk but sunny January       morning, and the ducks were coming in fast and furious. Three       of us were blasting away like a trio of Elmer Fudds, shooting       a lot of birds, but burning up a case of shells in doing so.       Not John.        Barely able to stand, he shouldered his shotgun just three       times that day. And all three times a duck fell from the sky.       Not a shell wasted.        John's great passion was his wife, Debbie. After that, it       was a toss-up between a duck blind and the House chamber for       his next greatest love. I recall an afternoon when we were       returning to Washington, and as we crested a hill the       gleaming white Capitol dome came into view. ``I never get       tired of seeing that,'' he said softly.        And obviously he never did. John spent nearly 60 years in       Congress, serving longer than anyone else. And better. John       was a parliamentarian; he cherished the traditions and       processes of the House.        And while he was a bare-knuckled negotiator who relished a       fight, he was ultimately a pragmatist. When the time came to       compromise, John set down his club and made the deal.        His decision to retire was based mostly on his waning       physical condition. But he was also disgusted with the       poisonous partisanship and gridlock ruining Congress. He       couldn't stand to watch what was becoming of the institution       he joined as a teen-aged page during World War II.        Still, he hated to leave. The night before he announced his       retirement, he called me to have dinner with him and Debbie.       John had made his decision but hadn't accepted it. He was       looking for assurance that he wasn't letting down the people       of his district by leaving, that he'd done his best for them,       that they'd understand his reasons.        At the same time, he was offering counsel to Debbie, who       had a quick decision of her own to make. He wanted her to       succeed him, as he had his father, to continue a Dingell       legacy in Congress stretching back to 1935. It was a poignant       moment between the past and future.        When I'd visit him after retirement, the questions were       always the same. Did I make a difference? Do my people       remember me? Would Pop be proud?        I was always stunned that he could harbor such doubts,       given his enormous accomplishments. But John Dingell never       took the obligations of public service lightly. He always       felt there was more he could do for the people who placed       their trust in him.        He was a man in the best sense of the word. A man of the       Greatest Generation. A man of courage, confidence,       compassion. A man who did his duty. A man who took care of       his own business, and of the people he loved.        And he sure did know how to love. He and Debbie shared an       epic love affair that never waned. You couldn't be around       them more than five minutes without hearing him say, ``I love       you, Fox.'' The fire in his eyes when he looked at her burned       until his last breath.        She was fiercely protective of him, and kept him alive       years longer than he should have expected by the sheer force       of her will.        Our friendship may have been unlikely, but it was one I       cherished. I loved him, and hate to see him go.        But if life's a game, John Dingell won it. Nearly 93 years,       and every minute of it lived honorably and with passion and       purpose.        Goodbye, good friend. I hope wherever you are this morning,       the ducks are coming in fast and low.    I am going to also read to you an email that I got just an  hour or two ago from his wife, Debbie, our colleague, who received this  from the Ford family.   This is from Mike Ford. Of course, his father was Gerry Ford, a great  man, President, Michigander. And he wrote this, it is very brief:         Debbie,        Since learning of John's recent passing, my thoughts and       prayers have been constant with you and your extended family.        Through my reading of the many wonderful remembrances of       and tributes to John, I have been deeply moved and blessed to       revisit his remarkable legacy of leadership and service to       the people of Michigan and to all of our Nation.        John and my father, though identified from competing       political parties, held so much in common as men of wisdom,       integrity, compassion, and selfless service for all of       humanity, and their friendship was true and enduring through       a shared lifetime calling of public service. John Dingell and       Gerry Ford represent what is good, honorable, and decent in       our country.        Please know of our Ford family's grace giving wishes and       prayers for you and all the Dingell family at this time of       loss and grief.        May you know of God's abiding comfort, love, and hope this       day and always.        Mike Ford.    Good guy that, again, some of us know, particularly those of us on  the west side of our State. You know, he was our dean. And when I  became the dean of the Michigan Republican delegation--that was in the  early nineties. I have got to say--I was just adding it up here sitting  with Tim--I was probably in thousands of meetings with John.                                time  1845    Our delegation is close. We stand together on a host of issues, from  the Great Lakes to the autos. We often had an agenda we worked  together. Our offices were across the hall from each other for a lot of  years. Of course, we have known Deborah forever and a day as well.   I had the chance to talk to John Dingell the day before he died, and  I talked to him a number of times over the last number of weeks. I read  his book, which I would recommend to folks. Might put the R rating next  to it, in terms of his language. You can hear him speak, and he had a  genuine sense of humor. He had so many stories.   I was asked a little bit earlier today: What about his tweeting?   He tweeted until, literally, the last day or two. For those of you  watching tonight, get on Google. Google MLive. That is sort of the  Michigan news network. Google: MLive Dingell tweet. This weekend, they  ran the top 20 tweets that he did, and they will make you laugh. They  really will, especially the one with the bulldog. All of the animal  lovers out there, make sure you find this one. He had a sense of humor.   People say: How could a 92-year-old do all this?   Well, let me tell you how. It is because of our committee. The  committee has so much jurisdiction, part of which is  telecommunications. We were the first ones. We forced the broadcasters.  It was actually the Tauzin-Dingell bill, I want to say a lot of years  ago, and I had an amendment that was critical there. We passed the  Tauzin-Dingell bill. He cared so much about bipartisanship.   We forced the broadcasters to go from analog to digital. That then  allowed us all to have devices like this: iPhones and the internet.  Instead of using a shoe for your phone, you got something like this  that is like the world.   We forced them to go digital, and that allowed this to happen. So  guess what? John Dingell, in Congress, we would often sit down. We all  meet in Detroit, let's face it. All of us, our delegation, we come from  someplace. Mr. Kildee comes from Flint. Tim Walberg is actually lucky  and gets on in Detroit. I come from South Bend or Kalamazoo or Grand  Rapids. We all come from someplace, but generally, we fly Delta from  Detroit back to D.C.   We are all sitting at that A-75 gate. There is John Dingell, a  colleague, and  [[Page H1570]]  he is on his BlackBerry, zipping away, typing just as fast as you could  imagine, communicating with people around the world. It is because of  the work he did in our committee. That made our lives what they are  today.   Whether it is that or the environment or healthcare or pipeline  safety, you name the issue--we are sorry Mr. Kildee went to the Ways  and Means Committee. Deborah chose right; she went to the Energy and  Commerce Committee. Mr. Kildee went to the dark side. Our committee has  jurisdiction over so much.   John Dingell was such a leader. He didn't care about who got the  credit. He just wanted to get the job done. He sat right over here.  When you would come over and ask his advice, you would make sure that  you were on his good ear, and he would talk, and he would remember  things.   I can remember taking the Congressional Record from some big debates,  the Voting Rights Act and others, and I would sit with him here, and we  would go through the names, particularly the Michigan delegation, and  why they voted this way or that way. He would tell the history. He was  here for our lifetime.   He was a gentleman to the very end. He knew the rules. He had respect  from both sides of the aisle. He was a guy who we will never see  replaced here in this House.   In closing, let me say, even at the end, he was wondering: Did I make  a difference?   Of course he did. But here was a guy who made such a difference and a  guy who really never thought he would be in this institution. When his  dad died, a week before his dad died, he didn't think he was going to  run for that seat. It was the people at home who encouraged him to run.  When he chose to retire, he didn't push Deborah, nudge Deborah, to run  for that seat.   It is hard to imagine, 86 years of a Dingell representing southeast  Michigan. What a tribute to a family that has made such a difference in  this body, folks who love not only our State, but certainly their  constituents.   Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Kildee for doing this Special Order.    Will the gentleman yield?    We really ribbed Dave Camp about this, and the good Sandy,  too.
