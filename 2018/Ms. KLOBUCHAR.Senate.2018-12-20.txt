 Mr. President, I rise today in response to the  President's announcement on the withdrawal of troops from Syria.   Like many of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, I am deeply  concerned that prematurely withdrawing American troops from Syria is  contrary to the advice of senior national security officials and that  the President's announcement will have negative consequences for our  country's national security interests. I am also concerned about the  implications of U.S. withdrawal for the security of our allies and for  innocent civilians in Syria.   Since August of this year, the Secretary of Defense, Secretary of  State, and National Security Advisor have all suggested that the Syrian  conflict requires sustained U.S. commitment. Just last week, the  administration's Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to  Defeat ISIS said that ``we can't just pick up and leave'' Syria. This  week, the U.S. Special Representative for Syria Engagement said that  the U.S. would remain in Syria until the U.S. achieves three  objectives: ensuring the defeat of the Islamic State, reducing Iranian  influence, and reaching a political solution to resolve the crisis. The  President's announcement contradicts the advice of our diplomats and  military leaders and fails to address these issues.   These concerns are shared by our key allies, including Israel and  Jordan. The withdrawal of U.S. troops will also abandon the Kurds, who  have been our partners in the region. Once again, we see the U.S.  abandoning critical alliances in favor of narrow and ill-defined aims.   I have seen firsthand the devastating effects of the ongoing Syrian  conflict and resulting humanitarian crisis, which has led to the worst  refugee crisis since World War II. In 2015, I visited a Greek refugee  center and met with officials who are dealing with the crisis. I saw  groups of children who had traveled alone to try to find better lives,  but when we tried to ask one little boy about his story, he did not  want to tell us because he and all his friends were afraid that they  would be sent back home. I also visited the Za'atari refugee camp in  Jordan, where we heard about atrocities taking place in Syria that one  refugee said would ``make stones cry.''   This crisis is not over, and it requires an international response  and clear U.S. policy. There are no easy solutions in Syria. But what  we need is leadership and a comprehensive plan based on the expertise  of those on the frontlines, not hasty and ill-informed decision-making.   Thank you.                            ____________________
