 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize, with the  highest respect, the service and life of George Shepard Haerle for his  dedication to serving Indiana and the Nora Community Council, NCC. Over  the course of NCC's 50-year history, George has volunteered 47 years of  his own to leave an indelible mark on the Nora community. The great  State of Indiana is proud of and ever thankful for George's  distinguished commitment and exemplary service.   Since its founding, the Nora Community Council has covered 12 square  miles with 25,000 to 28,000 Hoosier residents, including 60 local  neighborhoods under the civic umbrella. As a chairman of the NCC,  George commits hundreds of hours each year to promote growth,  development, and the general welfare of the Nora community.   George Haerle's renowned service was rightfully recognized on July  29, 2017, when Governor Eric Holcomb bestowed upon him Indiana's most  prestigious designation, a Sagamore of the Wabash. George follows in  the footsteps of his father, Rudolf K. Haerle, who was also recognized  as a Sagamore of the Wabash for his contributions to the State as the  first president of the Civil War Round Table and a former longtime  member of the Library Board of the Indiana Historical Society.   George has not only been a role model for the NCC, but he has also  been an outstanding advocate for the community of Nora-Northside. His  remarkable service is exceeded only by his devotion to his amazing  family, including 7 daughters, 1 son, and 18 grandchildren. On behalf  of myself and all Hoosiers, for his selfless and lifelong commitment,  George is worthy of the highest praise. I feel truly privileged to have  him as a fellow and lifelong Hoosier.                            ____________________     Mr. President, it is my great pleasure to pause and  recognize the accomplishments of Boy Scout Troop No. 533 from my home  State of Indiana. For the past 90 years, Boy Scout Troop No. 533 in  Munster, IN, has been instilling the values of respect, honesty, and  leadership in young Hoosiers that have had a lasting impact on our  State. I am very proud of troop No. 533 for all of their service over  the past 90 years and applaud their dedication to bettering their  community.   Boy Scout Troop No. 533 was formed in 1927 by Munster native Mr.  Muary Kraay when he was in eighth grade. Since its founding, troop No.  533 has been active in their community. During World War II, the Boy  Scouts organized parades and rallies for war bonds, planted community  gardens, practiced blackout drills, and participated in wartime  recycling programs. On June 14, 1947, when President Coolidge dedicated  Wicker Park in Highland, IN, troop No. 533 was there to welcome him.  The Boy Scouts also had a crucial role during the September 2008  flooding of the Little Calumet River. In anticipation of the flood,  troop No. 533 assisted in filling sandbags, and after the flood, they  assisted in yard cleanup and regraveling driveways. Over the past 90  years, Boy Scout Troop No. 533 has produced over 100 Eagle Scouts, one  of the highest levels of honor a Boy Scout can achieve.   I would like to thank Boy Scout Troop No. 533 for their 90 years of  outstanding public service. On behalf of all Hoosiers, congratulations  on your 90th anniversary.                            ____________________
