 Madam Speaker, I rise today to remember the  life of a Benedictine High School and Savannah baseball star, Hank  Lehwald.   The Benedictine Cadets in Savannah have a rich history of success. On  top of multiple State titles in multiple sports, they won a football  State title this past season.   That legacy of victory began with a baseball team that won the  school's first State title, led by Hank. At catcher, Hank was a  standout. His teammates referred to him as ``the general'' due to his  tremendous leadership. Hank was a 4-year letterman in baseball,  football, and basketball, and he earned many scholarship offers to play  football from schools like the University of Florida. Hank chose to  pursue baseball and was drafted by the Los Angeles Dodgers right out of  high school.   After his baseball days were behind him, Hank attended Georgia  Military College and Georgia Southern University. He was drafted into  the United States Army and went to Officer Candidate School.   When Hank left the military, he founded a successful investment  banking firm in Boca Raton, Florida. In 2016, Hank was honored by his  induction into the Greater Savannah Area Hall of Fame. He is remembered  as being as good of a person as he was an athlete, and he will be  dearly missed.                            ____________________
