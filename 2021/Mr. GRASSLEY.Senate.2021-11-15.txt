 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Mr. President, the Senate has unanimously passed a bill  entitled Protecting America's First Responders Act. I authored this  legislation to expand benefits to first responders who are injured in  the line of duty.   The Public Safety Officers' Benefit Program, or PSOB for short,  offers a one-time lump sum payment to first responders who are killed  or permanently disabled in the line of duty. I think that legislation  has been on the books since the 1970s.   I started investigating this program when I heard complaints about  long delays in processing payments. Those delays reached up to 3 years,  on average. It is just not understandable why it should take 3 years  for somebody who is killed in the line of duty to decide if the family  should have help from that program. We fixed that particular issue with  my 2017 bill entitled the Public Safety Officers' Benefit Improvement  Act.   However, my investigation uncovered a lot of other problems with that  program, now 50 years old. The Justice Department was denying payments  to folks who should have received those payments. In one case, a  disabled police officer suffered a traumatic brain injury. The  Department said that he wasn't disabled because he held a part-time  position at Home Depot as a greeter.   In another case, again, a police officer with brain injury was denied  the benefit. Why? Because the officer tinkered around with motorcycles  in his garage. It would take this officer months to do simple things  that would otherwise have taken him just days. Still, the Department  said that he wasn't disabled. They said it. It is unreasonable.   But my bill that I described to you, which has now passed the Senate  recently, will correct this problem. This legislation clarifies that  first responders who are totally and permanently disabled but can still  perform some very simple tasks can still get benefits. It adds a fair  boost in payments to first responders who have waited years for these  benefits. It provides the Justice Department with more tools so that it  can process claims more quickly.   Finally, my bill extends a presumption in the law that ensures that  first responders who contract COVID on duty don't have to jump through  hoops to prove it, because, you know, with COVID--did you get it when  you were actually policing, or did you get it when you were in a  restaurant, or did you get it when you were in church?--you don't  really know. This bill will go a long ways in helping our first  responders where it is impossible to show whether you got it when you  were actually on duty.   I would like to thank Senators Gillibrand and Booker, as well as all  the other cosponsors.   I also want to thank our House counterparts, specifically,  Congressman Pascrell and his staff, who led the effort to pass the bill  in the House of Representatives.   Lastly, I want to thank the Justice Department for working closely  with us to improve this language.   Before I wrap up, I just want to say a few words about our first  responders. Whether it is police officers, firefighters, or EMTs, first  responders are the embodiment of the best qualities of Americans. Their  daily sacrifices make our society better and safer.   I am proud to have sponsored this legislation, and I urge the  President to quickly sign the bill.    Mr. President, on September 23, 2021, I inserted for  the record an explanation of my intent to hold the Intel Authorization  Act because I was concerned with changes made to the whistleblower  protections.   Specifically, it would have prevented whistleblowers from going to  any committee that had jurisdiction over the matter they were reporting  on.   I was also concerned that this bill could inadvertently overturn  protections that I authored in 2016 for FBI whistleblowers.   I have long advocated that whistleblowers should have as many avenues  as possible to report waste, fraud, and abuse. So I placed a hold and  made two simple requests: first, that the law permit whistleblowers to  report wrongdoing to any committee of jurisdiction; and second, that  language be inserted to clarify that nothing in this bill overturns  protections guaranteed for FBI whistleblowers under the FBI  Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act.   I am happy to report that Chairman Warner and Ranking Member Rubio  agreed to incorporate these changes into the Intel Authorization Act.   I would like to take this opportunity to commend both Senators Warner  and Rubio for their commitment to supporting whistleblowers. Thanks to  them, Congress is on the verge of passing much needed reforms with  regard to how whistleblower complaints in the intel community are  handled. I would also like to thank EMPOWER and the many whistleblower  advocacy groups that wrote the Senate Intelligence Committee to show  the need for these changes.   However, the job is still not done, and the House must agree to  support these changes. As such, I urge members of the House Permanent  Select Committee on Intelligence to support these much needed changes.                            ____________________
