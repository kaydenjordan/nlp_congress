 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his  remarkable leadership in this important debate.   Seven years ago, I was on this floor and I heard that, if you liked  your plan, you could keep it. I heard, if you liked your doctor, you  could keep that doctor. And I heard that healthcare costs were going to  drop by $2,500 per family. None of it was true.   I sit here now and look at my State, and I know what is happening  next year. The rates on the ObamaCare exchanges are going up by 69  percent. We are down to a single provider. That is what 7 years ago  brought us.   Today we have a chance to do something different, and everybody from  my State will do something different. They will vote for a plan that  actually does what it says it is going to do. Number one, they will be  able to actually have plans that are designed by Oklahomans, not by  bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. They will be able to have a tax credit,  if they are not already insured under Medicaid or Medicare or from  their employer. They will be able to have an individual tax credit to  purchase a plan that they design, that they like. They will be free of  the mandates of ObamaCare, free to make their own decisions, free of  the mandates that require them to buy insurance products that they  simply don't need.   I have got a lot of people in my district that are in their fifties  and sixties. Some of them might like to have children again, but they  are not likely to have children again, and they mostly don't want  maternity care.   So it is a pretty simple choice for us. It is a choice to be free and  make our own decisions. It is a choice to design our own plans. It is a  choice to have Federal assistance where we need it, but to be used  under our direction. It is an easy choice.   I urge the passage of this rule, and I urge the passage of the  underlying legislation.                                time  1000
