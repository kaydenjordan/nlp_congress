 Mr. Speaker, I rise today on National Religious  Freedom Day to announce that I am reintroducing my resolution in the  House in support of the Coptic Christians in Egypt.   I sponsored a nearly identical resolution last Congress, and I truly  appreciate the support I received from more than 50 of my House  colleagues who cosponsored that resolution.  [[Page H608]]    Egypt and the United States are important partners in the fight  against terrorism in the region. Egypt's role at Camp David has led to  some of the closest ties between the United States, Egypt, and Israel  in their history.   I am reintroducing this resolution because the Egyptian Government  can do more to protect its Christian citizens.   I have great respect for President el-Sisi, someone I have had the  opportunity to meet with on two occasions, and I applaud the changes  and message that el-Sisi has made in the areas of religious tolerance  and plurality.   He continues to say and do the right things at the top level of  government: having a good relationship with the Coptic Pope, attending  mass on multiple occasions, getting some churches reconstructed while  constructing the largest Christian cathedral in the Middle East in the  new administrative center outside Cairo, and holding terrorists  accountable for their atrocities.   But, Mr. Speaker, there is more to do. I stress to the Egyptian  foreign affairs officials when I meet with them that this is not an  attack on President el-Sisi. To the contrary, I acknowledge the support  and partnership and friendship that we have with Egypt. But there is  more that can be done in the area of protecting religious freedom and  human rights, especially in the rural parts of the country.   The State Department's 2018 religious freedom report on Egypt names  Minya province as a particular area for concern. The Egyptians  routinely claim that they have no minorities in Egypt. ``We are all  Egyptians, and we all take our water from the Nile,'' is something that  is frequently said.   But from my studies and in my view, there is a population in Egypt  that does not have the same protections of rule of law as others. The  country must do better in places like Minya province.   Following Secretary Pompeo's recent visit to Egypt, Hamza Hendawi of  the Associated Press wrote: ``El-Sisi's widely publicized policy to  staunch sectarianism, however, has done little to protect Christians in  rural Egypt, where Muslim extremists frequently attack their homes and  businesses or force them to leave their homes after violent disputes.   ``Critics and activists say discrimination against Christians there  is often tolerated by local authorities and branches of the security  agencies.''   Mr. Speaker, my resolution calls on the Egyptian Government to end  this culture of impunity for attacks on Christians and to undertake the  arrest, prosecution, and conviction of individuals who carry out  attacks on Copts and other Christians in Egypt. It calls on the  government to hold accountable these local government officials who  fail to enforce the law.   I stand with Secretary of State Pompeo and support his message that:  ``More work certainly needs to be done to maximize the potential of the  Egyptian nation and its people. I'm glad that America will be a partner  in those efforts.''   However, as the second highest recipient of American military aid in  the world, the United States Government must use the tools that it has  to hold our allies to a higher standard, if they are to continue to  receive our aid.   I encourage Egypt to live up to the legacy of Camp David at home,  working to achieve what former President Anwar Sadat called ``permanent  peace based on justice.''   Today in America, we commemorate Virginia's 1786 adoption of Thomas  Jefferson's Statute for Religious Freedom. In his proclamation today,  President Trump urged all Americans to help ``secure this blessing both  at home and around the world.''   All people around the world, regardless of their religious  affiliation, deserve the same freedom to practice their chosen religion  like we have enjoyed here in the United States of America for more than  200 years.   Permanent peace based on justice for the Coptic Christians of Egypt,  that is my goal with this resolution.   As President Reagan said: ``Respect for human rights is not social  work; it is not merely an act of compassion. It is the first obligation  of government and the source of its legitimacy.''   Mr. Speaker, the respect for human rights and religious freedom is  fundamental to the American position, and I will continue to promote  this issue for Coptic Christians and all Egyptians who take their water  from the Nile.                            ____________________
