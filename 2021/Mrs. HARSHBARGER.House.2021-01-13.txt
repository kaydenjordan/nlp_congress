 Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote against  impeachment of our sitting President, Donald J. Trump.   You can tell the American people that this is a vote to impeach upon  the grounds of inciting violence and insurrection, but the American  people see a double standard. They see a standard applied to those on  the left who commit violence, and they see a standard applied to those  on the right who commit violence. The American people see this, and  they understand it.   I have been here all of 1 week, and what I see instead of lawmakers  who are truth-seekers, I see lawmakers who are power-seekers. That is  never good--never good. What a shame. What a shame.   The American people are watching to see how their elected officials  respond at this moment in history. Will you vote to mend or will you  vote to further divide this country?   I am urging you to use this opportunity to be the leaders the  American people are seeking for such a time as this.   God help us as a nation, and I pray that God will keep His hand upon  on the greatest nation that the world has ever seen.
