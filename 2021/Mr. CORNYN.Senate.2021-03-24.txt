 Madam President, as we all know, over the last year,  COVID-19 has taken center stage as the No. 1 public health crisis  facing our Nation. No community has been spared from the devastation  caused by this virus, which has claimed more than 540,000 American  lives.   But beneath the surface, the problems we were facing before the  pandemic still exist, and, in many cases, they are getting worse. A  year of stress, isolation, and loss has taken a serious toll on  America's mental health and has led to increasing rates of anxiety and  depression.   These same factors have led to an increase in domestic violence as  families have spent more time at home, often while battling the stress  of job losses, financial difficulties, and virtual learning.   And, of course, there is the opioid epidemic, which continues to  destroy communities across our country.   In 2019, there were more than 70,000 overdose deaths in America-- 70,000. We are still waiting on the complete figures for 2020, but  preliminary data shows that things are trending in the wrong direction.  From June 2019 to May of 2020, more than 81,000 Americans have died  from overdoses.   We know a significant portion of those deaths involve heroin--roughly  20 percent of those who overdosed in 2019. According to the Drug  Enforcement Agency's ``National Drug Threat Assessment,'' the vast  majority of that heroin comes from Mexico, a staggering 92 percent.   As we have discussed the crisis at the border, I have talked about  ways the surge of unaccompanied children affects Customs and Border  Protection's ability to carry out its other missions, including  stopping the flow of these illegal drugs. Time spent processing and  caring for children means less time on the frontlines catching or  deterring the cartels from moving their poison across the border into  the United States.   A Bloomberg report last year brought another aspect of this epidemic  to light: the fact that chemicals made in the United States by U.S.  companies were key ingredients in the manufacturing of heroin in  Mexico. One of those companies is Avantor, a Fortune 500 company that  supplies chemicals and lab materials and services across a number of  industries. Avantor produces millions of products, including everything  from medical masks to high-quality chemicals for pharmaceuticals, to  kits for science labs in schools. But the focus here is on one  particular chemical--acetic anhydride.   This is an 18-liter jug of acetic anhydride, and you can see  Avantor's name on the label. Avantor sells this through a subsidiary  known as J.T. Baker into Mexico. Now, there are legitimate uses for  acetic anhydride. It is used to make cigarette filters and chemicals  used for photographic films, but this wasn't a photo taken in a  chemical lab or a manufacturing plant here in the United States. This  was taken by a Bloomberg reporter in Mexico who was able to purchase  this chemical online, no questions asked. This should have never  happened. Why? Because acetic anhydride is a highly regulated chemical,  at least in the United States and, actually, around the world. Some  companies even bar the importation of acetic anhydride because of its  use in manufacturing illegal drugs.   But the reason it is regulated is it is a precursor in the production  of heroin. That is why many countries ban the importation outright.  Without this chemical, it is virtually impossible to transform opium  from a poppy seed into the more lethal drug of heroin.   Acetic anhydride, as I said, is one of the most tightly controlled  chemicals worldwide and has been for some time. The International  Narcotics Control Board has been sounding the alarm on this dangerous  chemical since the  [[Page S1735]]  2000s. In fact, its annual report has described horrific examples of  the dangerous precursor chemical being diverted from legitimate uses to  illegitimate uses, like making heroin.   But the fact is, Mexico did not sign on to the International  Narcotics Board protocol for this dangerous chemical until 2018, and  even then, the enforcement, oversight, and control of this precursor  was lax, at best. Even now, given the controls the cartels exert over  large swaths of Mexico, I have no confidence that any controls on this  chemical are effective in stopping illicit uses in that country.   The Bloomberg investigation brought to light how easy it was for the  cartels to get hold of this chemical. The reporters were able to  purchase this 18-liter jug online or at a medical supply store. It  didn't take any special requirements. You can imagine how easy it was  for the cartels to get their hands on this chemical.   While the controls, oversight, and enforcement of this chemical are  much tighter in the United States and have been for years, it presents  a constant challenge when Mexico does not have the same standards and  enforcement.   It presents an additional hurdle for the safety of our communities  when U.S. companies, like Avantor, avail themselves of foreign  subsidiaries to create and manufacture the precursor chemical in a  cartel's own backyard, thereby facilitating the manufacture and sale of  the deadly drug known as heroin.   Of course, the winners in all of this are the cartels, in addition to  their criminal network of smugglers, who move the drug across our  border. The losers are our communities here in the United States and  our loved ones who have been tragically affected by the opioid  epidemic.   This is an open-air drug lab in Sinaloa State, the home of El Chapo's  drug empire. Cartels can use this single jug of 18 liters of chemical  to make heroin in this drug lab that is concealed in a rural part of  Mexico. They can make out of that one jug about 80 pounds, or 90,000  hits, of heroin out of one jug. Of course, one hit is enough to destroy  a life, but think of the pain that one 18-liter jug can inflict on an  entire community, and Avantor knows that these jugs in this size can be  easily concealed in something like the trunk of a car.   One container of this chemical costs $324. The street value of the  heroin that it will yield is at least $3.6 million. One jug at $324 can  produce $3.6 million worth of street value in heroin. If this doesn't  make your blood boil, you are not paying attention. After all, it is  simply impossible to believe that Avantor, which is a Fortune 500  company that is publicly traded here in America, was selling large  quantities of this chemical--banned in many countries of the world  because of its use in illegal drug manufacturing--and had no idea that  it was being used for illicit purposes in Mexico. I don't think anybody  would believe they didn't know.   Bloomberg reports that this has been going on for at least the last  10 years, when photos like this surfaced of the J.T. Baker line of  product showing up in drug busts by the Mexican authorities.   Unfortunately, the bad news doesn't stop there. The nominee for the  third highest ranking position at the Department of Justice has  profited to the tune of millions of dollars from Avantor stock. Vanita  Gupta has been nominated to serve as the Associate Attorney General,  and she is a very large shareholder in this publicly traded company.  She owns millions of dollars of Avantor stock, parked in her own  accounts and in the various trusts she has identified in her financial  disclosures. This isn't just a blind investment in a mutual fund; this  is the family business. Ms. Gupta's father is Avantor's chairman of the  board.   Following Ms. Gupta's confirmation hearing in the Judiciary  Committee, Senators submitted questions for the record. One question  was submitted by Senator Grassley, the ranking member. He asked Ms.  Gupta if she were aware that Avantor was producing and selling chemical  precursors used in the illegal heroin trade in Mexico.   She said:         I am aware of the allegations.    The next question from Senator Grassley was about her financial  holdings. Since she owns upwards of $55 million in Avantor stock, he  asked if she had profited financially from this chemical trade of  acetic anhydride by Avantor in Mexico.   Ms. Gupta said:         As a shareholder with no role in Avantor, I am not able to       say whether and how much I have profited from the various       parts of Avantor's business.    I generally believe witnesses who testify under oath at Judiciary  Committee hearings if there is no reason not to believe them, but it  pains me to say that Ms. Gupta had already established a clear pattern  of deception or of flat-out lying during her confirmation process.   Ms. Gupta wrote an op-ed piece in the HuffPost on November 4, 2012.  At that time, she said that States should decriminalize the possession  of all drugs--not just marijuana but all drugs--for personal use.   In the article, she said:         States should decriminalize simple possession of all drugs,       particularly marijuana, and for small amounts of other drugs.    That is a quotation. You can see that here. That would include  decriminalizing fentanyl, methamphetamine, and other highly addictive,  deadly drugs, including, of course, heroin.   Well, that wasn't her answer at her confirmation hearing. When asked  whether she advocates for the decriminalization of all drugs, she  didn't mince words.   She said:         No, Senator. I do not.    Now, I understand that it is natural for people to change their  minds, especially in light of new information or new experiences. In  Ms. Gupta's case, she noted that her experience at the Department of  Justice and with addiction in her own family had led her to evolve her  position on these issues.   Yet, in responding to Senator Grassley's written questions, she  wrote:         I have never advocated for the decriminalization of all       drugs, and I do not support the decriminalization of all       drugs.    That is demonstrably false. It is not true. She obviously held the  view and felt so strongly about it at the time that she penned an op-ed  piece in a national publication to advocate for the decriminalization  of all drugs.   When a person has been nominated for a leadership position at the  Department of Justice, that person has a duty to be honest and  forthright. If you have learned any new information and have changed  your mind, that is fine, but you can't flat-out mislead about not  having held beliefs that you clearly held in the past, especially when  those beliefs could interfere with your ability to do the very job for  which you have been nominated.   It is not just with decriminalization that Ms. Gupta has misled the  Judiciary Committee. As to qualified immunity, defunding the police,  and the death penalty, Ms. Gupta has offered misleading statements on  each of these issues. Policy differences, I can accept, but a lack of  candor is disqualifying, especially for th Office of the Associate  Attorney General.    So when Ms. Gupta said she was unaware that Avantor was profiting or  that she was profiting from the illicit manufacturing of heroin in  Mexico, I do not find that credible. It is just another example of  saying whatever you need to say to get confirmed by the Senate.   The Department of Justice is the highest law enforcement Agency in  the country, and Ms. Gupta has been nominated to serve as third in  command. If confirmed, she will oversee the Civil Division, which will  make major decisions about who will be investigated, who will be  charged, and who will face punishment. Some of those potential targets  include opioid companies, drug manufacturers, or perhaps even companies  that are diverting precursor chemicals to the cartels. If you look at  the work at the moment of the Civil Division of the Department of  Justice, you will see a number of civil actions already related to the  diversion of opioids and companies involved in illegal schemes. What  does this say about her ability to supervise those kinds of cases?   The Department requires professional detachment from even the  appearance of impropriety, and this conflict of interest of Ms. Gupta's  goes far beyond simple appearance. Ms. Gupta has financially benefited  from the sale of this chemical to cartels in Mexico.  [[Page S1736]]  She has financially benefited whether she knew it at the time or not,  but she won't even admit it. As a result, any case that has a nexus to  drugs brought by the Department of Justice while she is at the helm  will have a giant cloud cast over it.   Finally, what I find most troubling, in addition to her lack of  candor, is that Ms. Gupta has shown absolutely no remorse for the harm  done by Avantor in facilitating the manufacture and sale of heroin here  in the United States. I estimate that, in the last 10 years, more than  100,000 Americans have died of drug overdoses associated with heroin.  So I cannot support the nomination of Ms. Gupta to serve as Associate  Attorney General, and I urge all of my colleagues to oppose her  nomination as well.
