 Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the right  to life.   As a mother, a grandmother of two precious grandsons, and the other  mother to many students and young people who I have mentored over the  years, I am truly committed to saving the lives of the unborn.    As a pharmacist, I have helped many women through the years with  infertility issues and helped them achieve successful pregnancies.  These women were desperate to have and to hold those precious children  that many women want to abort. That is why I will continue to advocate  on behalf of the right to life.   I believe it is a moral and a God-given responsibility that we  protect these treasured trusts from Heaven. We always must remember to  protect the most vulnerable among us and give a voice to those  voiceless babies, those precious children that somebody would want and  somebody would nurture and somebody would love.
