 Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for inviting me to  participate today.   I actually serve on the House Oversight and Government Reform  Committee, and today we had a hearing about the conditions of the camps  at the border, the conditions that the children are kept in.   We have lost six kids at the border, and I want to just highlight  their names, because we need to recognize that there is a human face to  the tragedy that we see; it is not just numbers.   We have Carlos Hernandez Vasquez; he was age 16. Wilmer Josue Ramirez  Vasquez, age 2; Juan de Leon Gutierrez, age 16; Felipe Gomez Alonzo,  age 8; and Jakelin Caal Maquin, age 7, and Mariee Juarez, age 1.   Mariee's mother actually testified in front of the committee to tell  her story of what she was trying to accomplish by coming to this  country and about the fear that she had as she crossed and as she was  detained.   I want to remind people; a lot of people think that it is a crisis  that is being created on its own. It is not. It is something that is a  result of this administration's zero tolerance policy.   I want to remind people that the zero tolerance policy started  because this President, as he was running for office, said that he was  going to be tough on this issue, and that he would be the only one that  could solve it. So what we ended up seeing is that we saw the zero  tolerance policy.   And what is it? The zero tolerance policy states that anybody that  crosses in between ports of entry will no longer be held civilly and  administratively responsible; that they will be convicted criminally.   Jeff Sessions, the Attorney General when this policy was started to  be implemented said: Zero tolerance policy shall supersede any existing  policies.   And what this did is it caused people, when they are criminally  convicted or being held for breach of criminal law, the parents are  being separated from the kids.    Correct. And that is where we want to make sure people  understand that this crisis, the separating of the children, was a  direct result of this policy. It doesn't say, yeah, they will be  separated. But it is that they would be--zero tolerance led to the  separation. One triggered the other.   People then also try to make the argument that this happened under  the Obama administration, but the Obama administration didn't do that.  They were dealing with unaccompanied minors that were flowing into the  country, and they had to deal with that humanitarian crisis at that  moment.   So this administration has really taken a zero tolerance policy,  which has had a ripple effect on capacity to handle influx, the  metering issue, the Remain in Mexico issue, the separating of the kids  and not keeping appropriate track of those children to make sure that  they are actually returned to their parents.    And this administration, time and time again, now says that they  never had a child separation policy.    And it wasn't only Secretary Nielsen. It was Kelly Anne  Conway. It is a fabrication and a lie that has been repeated by the  administration; and that is something that we want to call out, to make  sure people understand that what is going on now is a direct result of  the zero tolerance policy.   Additionally, we want to make sure that people understand that a lot  of the decisions were made based on, I believe, on politics. My own  personal belief was this, they wanted to seem tough, so they  implemented policies without really understanding how they implement it  on the ground.   I have taken tours not only of Otay Mesa, Adelanto, I went out to  Victorville; I went to Tornillo, Texas, so I have been to the border  quite a bit of times, a number of times.                                time  2100    And when you start talking to the people who are responsible for  implementing these policies, the men and women who are in Customs and  Border Protection, some of them are trying to do a good job. They are  saying that they are being put in an impossible situation by this  administration by often determining policy at a whim. And the problem  is, when you are making policy not on rational decisions but on  politics, then you end up with this situation, which is a big mess on  the border.   I actually spent a night at the border with one of my colleagues.    Yes, at Otay Mesa. We spent the night at the Mexican side  of the border, literally on the line, and we were there just to observe  migrants to present themselves for asylum. They were on U.S. soil. They  presented themselves. They were told that it was full. Congresswoman  Barragan and I asked to see the facility. They refused to show us.    Yes, correct. Customs and Border Protection refused to let  us in to see it. So the migrants sat down. We sat down with them. We  got there around 1 o'clock in the afternoon, and we didn't leave until  the next day, around 7 a.m. So we spent the night. It was cold. We  slept on the ground.   The migrants couldn't leave the U.S. soil or the Mexican authorities  would have grabbed them. So we actually got corralled, using bike  racks, into kind of a cage to keep us in a certain area. Every so  often, Customs and Border Patrol would wake us up to ask us who is  here, how many kids, how old, but these were questions that we answered  three or four times.    Correct. And what we were trying to remind them is that,  by international law, by U.S. law, these migrants had a right to  present themselves for asylum and then ask so that they can be  processed. They ended up getting in. It was the woman who was tear- gassed at the border in that famous----    With her kids. She was one of the folks, and she asked for  a credible fear asylum hearing, and she went through the process. That  is why we have this process, so that we don't  [[Page H5578]]  end up with just a backlog at the border that is more dangerous for the  kids and the migrants, and it is unnecessary under what we believe  under our rule of law.    And if I can interject.    I mentioned this article in the Oversight hearing. It is  actually a ProPublica article, entitled: ``Inside the Secret Border  Patrol Facebook Group Where Agents Joke about Migrant Deaths and Post  Sexist Memes.''    I think you make some excellent points.   One point I want to kind of talk about, this culture that is  permeating Customs and Border Protection, I think that it is also based  because of the leadership of this administration. The attitude of zero  tolerance, as in, like: Nope, it doesn't matter what conditions you are  leaving, it doesn't matter if you are fleeing violence, it doesn't  matter if you are a victim of domestic abuse, you can no longer use  that as a rationale for seeking asylum. That zero tolerance mentality  is what is also helping drive this rotting of the culture within  Customs and Border Protection.   Changing the leadership makes a difference, but as long as there is a  change in the civilian leadership.   Oversight is crucial. A lot of people ask: What is the difference  between Democrats and Republicans? What is the difference between you  guys being in charge versus Republicans being in charge?   One of the things that I noticed when I was on Oversight in the  minority from my first year, year and a half in Congress is that we  couldn't call in Customs and Border Protection and ICE and the  Department of Homeland Security to have a public hearing on these  issues. The only hearing we had regarding the zero-tolerance policy was  behind closed doors, no cameras present. I don't even believe staff was  allowed in the room.   So we had to sit there and ask, and we asked enough questions to get  more information about how the zero-tolerance policy worked, how it was  the nitty-gritty. But if people don't hear it, the public doesn't hear  their testimony, then it lacks the credibility because some people  think we are making it up.   So we need not only the right kind of leadership to reform the  culture, we also need to make sure that there is direct oversight by  Congress, and that is our job.   I voted against the emergency supplemental because I didn't feel that  [[Page H5579]]  there were enough constraints on the money that was going to be sent to  the agencies, that they were going to actually use it to improve the  humanitarian crisis that was going on on the ground at the border  region.   So we need to continue pushing that oversight, and that is what I  plan on doing. I know that, under your leadership, the Congressional  Hispanic Caucus is doing so.   At the same time, I want to highlight another issue. People act like  ICE has been around forever. We have to remind people that our system  was restructured after 9/11 to make sure that we do have appropriate  security at the border, at the ports of entry, through the airports,  right, that we had major flaws. So reorganizing and changing and  holding a bureaucracy accountable, that is the job of Congress. That is  the job of everybody who gets elected.   So the idea of what should be done, I think that first we need to  make sure that we are more specific on our money, make sure there is  better leadership and, at the same time, never run away from our values  that this country is based on immigrants and built by immigrants.    Madam Speaker, Mr. Castro makes a good point regarding the  guardrails, the funding.   One of the things that I would like to point out is if this  administration, this President, as he claimed, was the only one who  could solve this problem, then why hasn't it been solved?   It is a bigger mess and a bigger disaster than we have ever seen, and  that is resulting in these conditions on the border where people are  mistreated. This culture that is becoming rotten to the core is  starting to just fester. We have seen an uncounted number of children  who have died.   According to Newsweek, there were no migrant children who died while  in CBP custody during the final 6 years of the Obama administration.  Former DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen previously admitted that it had  been more than a decade since a child had died in CBP detention until  December of last year when the 8-year-old Guatemalan national passed  away on Christmas Eve. Since then, at least four other children have  died while detained.   We are seeing this crisis get worse and worse, and my fear is that we  haven't hit the bottom yet. Until Congress steps in and puts those  guardrails in place, until we flex our constitutional muscle, we are  going to see things deteriorating further.    Madam Speaker, I want to stress a few points.   Mr. Castro mentioned that this administration hasn't invested in aid  to the Northern Triangle countries. One of the things that we need to  recognize is that the zero-tolerance policy isn't working. It might  feel good for hardliners to say: ``It is zero tolerance. We are not  going to take it anymore. We are going to push back,'' but it is not  solving the problem.   For example, the statistics show that net migration from Mexico to  the United States is zero. In some instances, it has declined, where  more Mexican nationals are returning to Mexico than ever before.   Why is that? Mexico still has issues regarding security, but its  economy has built up more and more.                                time  2130    I have family members who are in Mexico, and they have no desire to  move to the United States because they believe that their opportunity  there is just as good as it is here.   So imagine if we want to be serious about tackling the issue of  undocumented immigration to the United States, especially from Latin  American countries. The way you do it is first by, of course, creating  a comprehensive immigration reform here in this country but, at the  same time, investing the resources and the policies that build up the  economies of Latin America, thereby creating a situation where people  feel that, instead of risking their lives to get here, they would  rather stay at home.   That is one thing that this administration doesn't understand, but we  also need to highlight for the American people. The zero-tolerance  policy, the tough on undocumented immigration hasn't worked.    And they know about the conditions on the border, they  know about the risk that they are taking, but they are leaving some  desperate situations. So the way you make it so that they don't want to  leave is that you make things better for them at home.   Some folks will say, well, that is not our responsibility; that is  the responsibility of their home countries. But if you want to be a  political realist about how we solve it, you have to have international  aid, almost a Marshall Plan, for Latin America in order to build up  their countries, their economies, their infrastructure, their training,  and then make sure that we have a system here that has enough legal  immigration in order for people to not try to come into this country  illegally.    And we know, because of that, you have a situation where  people are getting sick in these facilities, and then putting the kids  and the people whose immune systems are compromised into more  vulnerable positions.   We definitely have a lot of work to do, but in order to do that, we  need to make sure that the American people know what is going on, to  tell the story and to not let people forget about the kids who have  passed away: Wilmer, Carlos, Juan, Jakelin, Felipe, and Mariee. Because  if we forget, we turn away, only more kids will perish and more people  will die at the border   It is our moral obligation. It doesn't matter if they are not U.S.  citizens. It is our moral obligation to ensure that doesn't happen.
