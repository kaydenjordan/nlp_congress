 Madam Speaker, I rise in support of this, the fourth  bill.   At a time of adversity, I would like to reach out to my colleagues on  both sides of the aisle. The American people are concerned, but we are  optimistic. The American people are worried, but we will come through  this adversity. I think of the people I represent in Tennessee, but we  are coming together as a Nation during this time like I have never seen  us come together before. At a time of difficulty, we have an  opportunity to actually seize this moment and move our great Nation  forward. So, yes, am I concerned? Yes, I am concerned. Of course, I am.  But we will see better days in this great Nation.   Madam Speaker, let us never forget, we in this Chamber represent the  people of the greatest Nation in the world. We shall prevail.
