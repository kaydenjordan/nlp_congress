 Mr. Speaker, I stand here today during National  Military Appreciation Month to recognize some of Virginia's many  Active-Duty servicemembers, veterans, fallen heroes, and military  families.   Earlier this month, I reached out to families across Virginia's  Seventh District to gather their stories of service, detailing the  courage and the unwavering commitment of Virginians who have answered  the call to serve our country.   As the daughter, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter of veterans, I am  humbled to read some of the stories I received.   Rick Pullen of Fredericksburg shared the story of his wife, Air Force  Colonel Cherie Zadlo, whom he described as the ``first woman'' in  nearly every job she had in her 27-year career. Colonel Zadlo built an  airfield, saw missiles come right at her while she was a passenger in a  military cargo plane, and was almost killed by a roadside bomb. A  symbol of dedicated service to our country, her maternity uniform is a  part of the Women's Military Museum collection.   Marie Atkins from Prince William shared the story of her late  husband, Michael Atkins, who joined the U.S. Army when he was 17 years  old. He served two tours in Vietnam, joined the Army Reserves, and  served in the Gulf war. Upon returning home, Mr. Atkins married Mrs.  Atkins, they had two daughters, and he enjoyed spending time with his  three grandchildren. Committed to honoring his brothers in arms, he was  a member of two motorcycle clubs, Rolling Thunder and Patriot Guard,  which escorted fallen servicemembers to burials in military cemeteries.  Mr. Atkins is now buried with military honors at Quantico National  Cemetery.   Annette Wiahner from Orange shared the story of her late father, U.S.  Army Air Corps fighter pilot Walter Kozial. Of her father's service in  World War II, she writes: ``Few people know that he was among a few  brave volunteers to be the first to try shooting projectile rockets off  the P-51 Mustang. They were told that it was uncertain when the rockets  would detonate and that they could light up while still on the wing.  Dad said to himself, `Well, somebody has got to do it.' He had guts,  and he loved his country.''   I also heard from Clayton Hill from Stafford who shared the story of  his great uncle Wibb Cooper, a U.S. Army veteran and doctor in the  Pacific theater during World War II where my own grandfather served.   Mr. Cooper was captured by Japanese forces and survived the horrific  Bataan Death March. In Clayton's words: ``During that time, he stood up  to his captors on behalf of other prisoners. He was decorated for his  valor.''   Michele from Stafford, who was born and raised in Germany, emigrated  to the United States in 1980, and she shares that she always felt that  service to country is the responsibility and duty of all citizens. She  wrote: ``When I joined the Army, it was my way of giving back to a  country that was to become my new home.'' She served for 8 years before  transitioning into civilian service working for the U.S. Government,  and she retired after 35 years of total service to our country.   Alexa Rice from Prince William wrote to honor many of her loved ones;  her husband serving in the U.S. Army currently on Active Duty, as well  as her brother who serves in the U.S. Marine Corps. Her husband has  been deployed for the past 8 months and Alexa's father served for more  than 20 years in the Marine Corps. Her oldest brother served in the  Marines, and her grandfather served with both the Marine Corps and the  U.S. Navy.   She writes: ``It is with such gratitude that these special  individuals, not just in my own family, but men and women all over get  the recognition and appreciation they surely earn and earned.''   Virginians who are serving, have served, or love someone who is  serving or has served know the true meaning of sacrifice.   We as Americans owe a debt of gratitude to every servicemember past  and present who put on the uniform and defended our Nation. I will  continue working in Congress to pass legislation to connect Virginia's  veterans and veterans across the country with the benefits and support  they deserved and have earned, and I will encourage all Americans to  give thanks for the men and women in your life, in our life, in our  communities who took up arms. We must all remember those who made the  ultimate sacrifice for our great country.   Mr. Speaker, we as Americans enjoy the promise of freedom because so  many brave Virginians answered the call.                            ____________________     Madam Speaker, I inadvertently voted ``nay'' on  rollcall No. 235 on Motion to Suspend the Rules and Pass, as amended  H.R. 1669, VET-TEC Authorization Act. I meant to vote ``yea.''
