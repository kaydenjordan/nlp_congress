 Madam Speaker, might I say that is a wonderful outfit  you are wearing today.   Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the Powell Panthers  football team for winning its first-ever Tennessee Secondary School  Athletic Association State championship in 2021.   On December 3, 2021, the Panthers defeated the Page High School  Patriots  [[Page H4517]]  by a final score of 42-34 at Chattanooga's Finley Stadium to win the  Class 5A BlueCross Bowl championship. That is the equivalent to our  State championship, if anybody is wondering.   This victory was significant for all the players and coaches,  including the Panthers' head coach, Matt Lowe. Back in 2011, Coach Lowe  was a freshman player on the Powell football team when the Panthers  lost in a heartbreaker State championship game to Henry County High  School.   A decade later, he led his alma mater to a championship that brought  pride to every student at Powell High School and the community.   It was not an easy win for the Panthers. The Patriots were  competitive throughout all four quarters, but the Panthers claimed the  title when the final whistle sounded.   Winning this championship was the Panthers' goal all season long, and  nothing was going to stand in their way. The team kept its eye on the  prize and gave it their all to capture its first State championship in  the end.   The Powell Panthers worked hard and supported each other the entire  season, and it paid off with a State title.   Congratulations to all the players, Head Coach Matt Lowe, the team  support staff, and the entire Powell High School community on this  great victory.             Celebrating the Distinguished Career of Albert Harb     Madam Speaker, I rise today to sing the praises of a  man who I feel is probably the greatest legal mind in America. It is my  good friend Albert Harb. He has been an attorney in East Tennessee  since the 1980s, and Albert will retire from practicing law this  spring. I rise to celebrate his distinguished career.   Albert earned both his undergraduate and law degrees from the  University of Tennessee. After working with fellow attorney Joe Yancey  for several years, Albert went to work for the firm Hodges, Doughty &  Carson in 1984. He has been employed by the firm ever since.    Throughout the years, East Tennessee has sought out Albert's legal  expertise in commercial litigation, construction law, product  liability, personal injury, domestic litigation, and occasional divorce  cases. He also provides legal services for business transactions,  corporate law, and wrongful death suits.   Organizations such as the Best Lawyers in America, Best Lawyers  Consumer Guide, Who's Who American Law, and Mid-South Super Lawyers  have all recognized Albert for his excellent representation in the  fields of commercial litigation and personal injury.   In the Knoxville News Sentinel, a noted politician was quoted as  saying that he was the best legal mind in America. Additionally, he is  consistently recognized by Cityview Magazine as one of Knoxville's top  lawyers for personal injury and construction law.   Outside of practicing law, Albert is engaged with the Knoxville  community. When West High School's mock trial team won the Tennessee  State championship, Albert mentored the students by serving as their  attorney coach.   He also held leadership positions with WDVX, the Peninsula Club, and  the Ramallah Club of Knoxville.   Albert and his wonderful wife, Carmen, are parents to Ashley,  Nicholas, and Noel, and they have several grandchildren.   Albert, thank you for your dedicated legal representation to East  Tennesseans. I wish you the best in your retirement, and  congratulations on achieving of counsel status.          Recognizing Lucy and Ray Hand as Knoxvillians of the Year     Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Lucy and Ray  Hand, two of my all-time favorite people and two incredibly amazing  people who helped me through one of the toughest periods of my life.   They were recently recognized by the Junior Achievement of East  Tennessee as Knoxvillians of the Year.   When I was going through a particularly tough time in my life, I had  a lot of bad press. On a Tuesday, I always recall, I received a call  from Lucy Hand. She said: Kickoff for the UT game is this Saturday at  noon. I expect to see you in the skybox with us.   I asked if she had seen what the paper was saying about me, and she  said: Timmy, kickoff is at noon. Don't make me send Raymond after you.   You know it is serious business, Madam Speaker, when Lucy brings up  Ray.   So, I went to the game, and the Hands, of course, were gracious hosts  to me as they always are. At halftime, I decided to go down to the  lower section of Neyland Stadium and check out some renovations that  were recently completed and to see General Neyland's statue.   When I got there, I heard the most beautiful noise in the world. It  was the sweetest little 4-year-old girl I think I had ever seen. She  was wearing some unbelievably cool little red shoes. They were  sparkling, and she was spinning around. I can see it in my mind's eye  right now.   After I saw her, I looked to my left, and it was the most beautiful  woman that I had ever seen. Her name was Kelly, and she would later  become my wife, and Isabel would soon become my daughter.   That day changed my life. Lucy and Ray Hand were there for that  moment, just like they were there when my parents died, when I married  Kelly, and when I adopted my Isabel. They were also here in Washington  in 2019 when I was sworn into Congress.   I remember when they were standing in line, and the Capitol policeman  asked me if they were my family because they were escorting family  through. I looked at him and said, yes, they are my family. Madam  Speaker, they are my family.   I thank them for being my friends, and I thank them for bringing  Kelly and Isabel and me together and creating a wonderful family for  me.   I congratulate them on winning Knoxvillians of the Year.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, folks on the left have accused us good  Republicans of complaining about inflation. They say we have no plan  for lowering the cost of food, clothes, or gasoline.   Of course, the Democrats have controlled Congress for the last 15  months, Mr. Speaker, as you well know. During that time, they have  successfully rammed through trillions in unnecessary Federal spending.   Let's look at where that has gotten us. Prices for goods and services  Americans rely on rose by 8.5 percent in March 2022 compared to March  2021. That is unacceptable for working Americans, especially for east  Tennesseeans.   That is not even the worst of it all. Even after all this spending  raised costs for American families, the Democrats still don't think it  was enough. They still think the multitrillion-dollar high tax Build  Back Better Act--which we have called build back broke, you can call it  whatever you want--is a good idea. That bill will be catastrophic for  price stability.   Right now our country is dealing with the consequences of reckless  government spending. All we seem to be doing is saddling more debt on  the shoulders of future generations. We used to say we are piling it on  our kids. Now it is our grandchildren and great-grandchildren, which  some of the folks in this body, I am sure, have multiples of those. And  that is not right.   So to the critics on the left who complain that Republicans don't  have a plan to address inflation, I ask you this: What is wrong with a  plan to spend fewer taxpayer dollars and to be smarter about the money  we do spend? This kind of fiscal responsibility is a legitimate  solution to fixing the unstable prices that are worrying families in  east Tennessee and across the country. Republicans should not be afraid  to say that fiscal responsibility is our plan.   My folks instilled in me a lot of values, and one of those is,  ``Don't spend it if you don't have it,'' and ``Just because you have it  doesn't mean you have got to spend it, dadgummit.''   Mr. Speaker, I thank Vice Chairman Johnson, as always, for his  lackluster leadership.  [[Page H4565]]
