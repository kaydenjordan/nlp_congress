 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.   I am excited, Mr. Speaker, because the people's House is at work this  month. I wish I had more than 1 minute to talk about it all. Police  reform, equal justice, lowering healthcare costs, protecting renters  and homeowners from eviction. That is just in the last few days.   This morning I joined Speaker Pelosi and chair Kathy Castor and our  select committee members to unveil a comprehensive climate action plan  to save the planet and to build a more healthy, just, and resilient  America. And now I have the honor of supporting Mr. DeFazio's H.R. 2.   The Transportation and Infrastructure provisions in this bill are an  historic investment in our Nation's infrastructure that will strengthen  our economy, improve safety, and cut gridlock and pollution, but there  is so much more in this bill.   I am also proud of modernizing the postal service's clunky old fleet  and electrifying it.   I am proud of encouraging responsible broadband deployment on or near  public lands and building more resilient western water infrastructure.   Colleagues, after years of people in this body talking about  infrastructure, we are finally doing it. I urge an ``aye'' vote.
