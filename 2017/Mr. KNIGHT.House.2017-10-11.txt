 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for his hard  work and for his leadership, and I want to thank my partner in this,  Congresswoman Murphy, for her cosponsoring of this bill and for her  work on this important piece of legislation.   A 21st century military requires a 21st century acquisition process,  one that is agile, efficient, and effective. I represent California's  25th District, and nowhere will you find a more exemplary place that  demonstrates the important role that small businesses play in both our  aerospace and defense industrial base.                                time  1430    I see firsthand the innovative effect small businesses make and how  they can positively impact government functioning.   The Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology  Transfer--SBIR and STTR--programs are critical to this impact. Now that  these programs have been reauthorized until 2022, it is important that  we continue to focus on spurring innovation.   That is why I introduced H.R. 2763, the Small Business Innovation  Research and Small Business Technology Transfer Improvements Act of  2017. My bill reinforces agency accountability by requiring the Small  Business Administration to provide Congress with better information and  reasonable, hard deadlines. It clarifies congressional intent of the  previous authorization to ensure that taxpayers reap the benefits of  SBIR and STTR programs by tying them to long-term projects at the DOD.  It also allows participating agencies to establish a new, separate  commercialization assistance pilot program and extends three popular  pilot programs through FY 2022, when the full program will need a full  reauthorization.   With the use of SBIR and STTR programs, we can increase small  business participation in the defense and aerospace industry while  tapping into the true potential their American innovative spirit  represents.   Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and to  vote ``yes'' on H.R. 2763, the Small Business Innovation Research and  Small Business Technology Transfer Improvements Act.
