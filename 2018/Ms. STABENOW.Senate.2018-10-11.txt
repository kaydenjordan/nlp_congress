 Mr. President, today I wish to pay special  tribute to Wayne State University, which this year is celebrating 150  years.   Michigan is home to many world-class colleges and universities.  However, what has set Wayne State apart from the very beginning is its  unique role in serving the people of Michigan from the heart of  Detroit.   Wayne State traces its roots to 1868, when five physicians who had  witnessed the very worst of human suffering on Civil War battlefields  vowed to change medicine for the better. They founded Detroit Medical  College. Its motto: Salus Populi--Suprema Lex.  [[Page S6814]]  The Welfare of the People is the Highest Law.   A lot has changed since those early days. Today more than 27,000  Warriors from 80 countries are earning degrees in everything from  accounting to manufacturing engineering, orchestral studies to urban  planning, but one thing has not changed at all: Wayne State's  dedication to people's welfare. For 150 years, Wayne State has been  making Detroit and our State stronger and creating true leaders.   It is doing that at the Integrative Biosciences Center, a 127,000- square-foot, $90 million facility dedicated to studying and eliminating  health disparities, and the National Institutes of Health's  Perinatology Research Branch, which has helped more than 20,000 at-risk  mothers and babies.   It is doing that at the brand-new Mike Illitch School of Business,  which is creating the next generation of business leaders while helping  revitalize the corridor between downtown and midtown.   It is doing that through its Wayne Advantage-Macomb program, which  allows students to begin to earn their degree at Macomb Community  College, and the Warrior Way Back program, which helps students who  didn't receive their degrees get back into class while easing their  student debt burden.   It counts among its alumni people who have excelled in nearly every  field: Dr. Joseph Ferguson, class of 1869, the first African-American  medical school graduate in Michigan; Helen Thomas, class of 1942, dean  of the White House Press Corps; Emmett Leith, class of 1949, recipient  of the National Medal of Science; Philip Levine, class of 1950, Poet  Laureate of the United States and winner of the Pulitzer Prize; Damon  Keith, Wayne State University Law School class of 1967, U.S. Circuit  Court of Appeals; Garth Fagan, class of 1969, winner of the Tony Award  for Best Choreography for ``The Lion King''; Mark Fritz, class of 1978,  winner of the Pulitzer Prize for international reporting; Dr. Carmen  McIntyre, class of 1990, creator of the Mental Health First Aid  Training program; and Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, class of 2006, whose  careful research helped discover elevated lead levels in the children  of Flint.   Hundreds of thousands more alumni, famous or not, can credit Wayne  State in part for their success, but so too can hundreds of thousands  of people who have been educated, inspired, represented, protected,  entertained, and treated by those graduates. I think those original  five physicians would be extremely pleased with the impact their school  has had not just on Detroit but on our Nation.   Since 1868, Wayne State University has been building leaders.  Congratulations to students, faculty, staff, and alumni on 150 years of  putting the welfare of the people of Michigan first.   Thank you.                            ____________________
