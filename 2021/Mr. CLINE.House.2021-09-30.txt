 Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 20th  anniversary of the Community Foundation for Rockbridge, Bath, and  Alleghany Counties.   In 2001, its first year as an independent organization, the Community  Foundation was able to provide $32,000 in grants to the community. But  through the support of many individuals, families, and businesses over  the years, the organization has grown exponentially.   In the past 10 years, the Community Foundation has been able to grant  a cumulative $2.5 million to nonprofit organizations, projects, and  programs across the organization's service area. Just this year alone,  the group will be awarding more than $300,000 in community grants and  an additional $30,000 in scholarships.   These grants are made possible through the generosity of individuals  and businesses and primarily support projects related to art and  culture, community betterment, education, health, and human services.   In celebration of their 20 years, the organization pledged to give  away $20,000 in 20 days to various nonprofits throughout our region.  Their work is truly inspiring, and we thank them for their tireless  efforts.   I wish the Community Foundation another 20-plus years of success.
