 Mr. Speaker, meet Janet, a constituent of mine from  the Uptown neighborhood in Chicago.   She is 64 years old and is on Social Security disability. She suffers  from chronic mental illness that prevents her from working. Even though  she would prefer to work, she really is unable to do so.   Janet will be devastated by the Republicans holding our economy  hostage. She has $1,200 per month, and that is her total income, Social  Security. She has no other income.   If we do not pass a clean debt ceiling bill, Janet will not be able  to pay for her medication. She will not be able to get food. She will  not be able to pay her rent. There are millions of Janets around this  country. We say: Don't hold Janet hostage.                            ____________________     Mr. Speaker, had I been present, I would have voted  ``no'' on rollcall No. 227.                            ____________________
