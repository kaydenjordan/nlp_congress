 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of Jovita Moore, an  award-winning journalist whose presence and professionalism were known  across newsrooms around Georgia and throughout the country.   I, and so many whose lives she touched every single day, are deeply  saddened by her passing. Her life was a positive force for good in this  world. Every evening, little girls saw themselves on the television  knowing that one day they could be the woman their community trusted at  the end of each day.   So while we mourn her death and suffer our heartbreak, I want to take  this time to celebrate the life of a woman who always stood steadfast  and resolute, who was classy and consistent in presenting us the facts  and the news of the moment.   This week, our hearts are with Jovita's family and her children, and  my prayers are with the WSB team.                            ____________________
