 Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding. Let  me just say first, Madam Speaker, as a Republican, don't let my side  use the security posture as the straw-man argument in this. The reality  is that that is the equivalent of blaming the victim of a crime for the  crime. And while it is important, that is not what we are here to talk  about today.   Madam Speaker, voting on a criminal contempt resolution is not the  position we had hoped to be in, but Steve Bannon went out of his way to  earn this resolution before us and now we must approve it.   Mr. Bannon's willful disregard for the select committee's subpoena  demonstrates his utter contempt for the American people's right to know  how the attacks on January 6 came about. He has advanced a ludicrous  legal argument in support of his decision not to corroborate or comply,  a decision that defies the rule of law and rejects the will of the  American people.   Mr. Bannon's reported actions put him near the center of the  investigation into the events surrounding January 6. His own words  strongly suggest that the actions of the mob that stormed the Capitol  and invaded this very Chamber came as no surprise to him. He and a few  others were, by all accounts, involved in planning that day's events,  and encouraged those who attacked the Capitol, our officers, and our  democracy.   I have no doubt that Mr. Bannon's scorn for our subpoena is real. But  no one--and I repeat, no one--is above the law, and we need to hear  from him.   As the select committee's contempt report states, it was Mr. Bannon  who on January 5 predicted with chilling accuracy: ``All hell is going  to break loose tomorrow.''   On his radio show that day he stated: ``It's not going to happen like  you think it's going to happen. Okay. It's going to be quite  extraordinarily different. All I can say is, strap in. You made this  happen and tomorrow it's game day. So strap in. Let's get ready.''   And it was Mr. Bannon, who was recorded as saying: ``It's all  converging, and now we're on the point of attack tomorrow.''                                time  1515    Mr. Bannon said these things publicly, as a private citizen, someone  deeply involved with the Stop the Steal movement, and he said them  nearly 3 years after leaving his job at the White House.   Mr. Bannon was also reportedly among the small group of Trump  confidants assembled at the Willard Hotel to discuss plans to stop or  delay the January 6 count.   Is it any wonder that the select committee needs to hear from him;  that we want to see related materials that he has?   Furthermore, does anyone really believe Mr. Bannon's actions are  covered by a blanket, no-questions-asked claim of executive privilege?  One the former President has never actually made.   Madam Speaker, Steve Bannon is a key witness to the select  committee's probe. He has yet to say or produce anything in response to  the subpoena. His assertion of executive privilege is farfetched in the  extreme and not his to make.   I urge my colleagues to join me to support the contempt resolution.
