 Madam Speaker, what I am about to show you are the  examples of the cycle of destruction from the climate crisis in my home  district on the central coast of California.   Last year, my district was victim to a brutal wildfire season in  which almost 650,000 acres were burned. What was left behind in many of  those areas is called a burn scar, ground that has crusted and is hard  for water to penetrate. As a result, when it rains, it leads to floods,  mudslides, and devastation, including this damage to Highway 1 in Big  Sur, in which water and debris flowed down the hills, blocked the  culverts, then flowed up over Highway 1, and took out the road from  that side.   Now, we know we have a lot of work to do when it comes to reducing  our carbon output. In the meantime, we can stop this type of damage  with reforestation of burn scar areas.   That is why I will reintroduce the REPLANT Act, to fund those types  of projects, and I plan to work on bipartisan legislation to help  manage forests to prevent fires and not just suppress them. It is that  type of reasonable and practical legislation that is the foundation for  how we in Congress can protect our communities and prevent the effects  of the climate crisis.                            ____________________
