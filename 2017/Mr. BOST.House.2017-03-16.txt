 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Veterans 2nd  Amendment Protection Act.   It is unfortunate that under current practices, it doesn't take a  doctor or a judge to determine a veteran is unfit to own a firearm. Not  a doctor, not a judge; it just takes the assignment of the fiduciary.   Mr. Speaker, the women and men took an oath of office to protect and  defend our Constitution--the same as we do in our offices to serve our  veterans--and to stand in harm's way.   Mr. Speaker, this is exactly the opposite of what our legal system  should allow. There is no due process. All of a sudden they go to the  VA. They are seeking help with maybe other issues that are out there-- because they can't even have a judge or a doctor make that decision, if  that is the case--but they do make a decision that they have to have a  fiduciary to help them with certain things.   It is vitally important that we maintain the due process. This  legislation still allows for dangerous individuals to be denied their  firearms, but it leaves the determination to someone with the expertise  to understand their case. This is a case where bureaucracy has run  amok. We have got to stop it. That is what our job here is to do.   Our Second Amendment rights are vitally important. Each amendment and  those rights under our Constitution are vitally important. And for  those men and women who have served to protect those rights, shouldn't  we make sure that they are protected with due process.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1181.
