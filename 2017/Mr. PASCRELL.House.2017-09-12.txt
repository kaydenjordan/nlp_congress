 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R.  931, the Firefighter Cancer Registry Act. I want to thank my partner,  the gentleman from New York (Mr. Collins), for introducing this bill. I  thank as well Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone, Dr. Burgess, and  Mr. Green for helping to shepherd our bill through the Energy and  Commerce Committee and onto the floor day.   As co-chair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus and lead  Democratic sponsor of this bill, I am proud to stand up for the brave  men and women of our fire service. It is these individuals who put  their lives on the line day in and day out to keep our communities  safe.   In addition to ensuring that our first responders are prepared in  advance of disasters and other emergencies, we must also ensure that  they receive the necessary medical care and services after answering  the call of duty.   When the courageous men and women in the fire services enter  dangerous situations, they do not stop to ask whether they are  subjecting themselves to long-term health risks.   Yesterday, across this Nation, we honored the first responders that  answered the call of duty after the terrorists attacked us on September  11. Many of those brave men and women gave their lives, and many more  are living with long-term health problems stemming from the time they  spent at toxic Ground Zero.   As evidenced on that day, many before and since, our first responders  do whatever is necessary to keep our communities safe. That is why we  must have their backs.   While we know that firefighters are routinely exposed to a variety of  known carcinogens in chaotic and uncontrolled environments, we do not  have a good sense of the full picture of the negative impacts of the  exposure.   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the  National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, firefighters are  at higher risk for certain kinds of cancer, including brain cancer,  leukemia, lung cancer, and kidney cancer, when compared with the  general population.   Despite the knowledge we have gained through these studies, many have  been limited by small sample sizes and an underrepresentation of key  demographic groups.   The first step to finding solutions is understanding the nature of  the problem. Further public health research on this topic is needed so  we can start working to find ways to alleviate this risk.   I am pleased that H.R. 931 is on the floor today. It would create a  national cancer registry for firefighters diagnosed with this deadly  disease. The creation of a specialized firefighter cancer registry will  provide scientists and medical professionals with the detailed national  data that will allow them to study the relationships between  firefighters' exposure to dangerous fumes and harmful toxins and the  increased risk for several major cancers. In the future, this  information could also allow for better protective equipment and  prevention techniques to be developed.   This bill enjoys strong support from major fire organizations across  our Nation, including the International Association of Firefighters,  the Congressional Fire Services Institute, the National Volunteer Fire  Council, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, the National  Fallen Firefighters Foundation, the New Jersey State Firefighters'  Mutual Benevolent Association, and the International Fire Service  Training Association.   Taking care of the brave men and women of the fire service is an  important task. We cannot delay in getting them the help they need. Mr.  Speaker, I urge my colleagues in the House to pass this bill swiftly so  we can work on getting it through the Senate and onto the President's  desk.    Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.   The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.   The text of the amendment is as follows:         Page 291, line 17, after the dollar amount, insert       ``(reduced by $100,000,000) (increased by $100,000,000)''.    The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 504, the gentleman  from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) and a Member opposed each will control 5  minutes.   The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.    Mr. Chairman, I rise today, once again, to highlight  the hypocrisy reflected here of the party that claims to be the law- and-order party, because, once again, the Commerce, Justice, Science  Appropriations bill before us has zeroed out funding for the COPS  Hiring Program.   This critical program provides Federal grants to local police  departments for the hiring and retention of police officers. Despite  the fact that this vital program helps ensure that we have enough cops  on the beat in our communities, the House Commerce, Justice, Science  Appropriations bills have cut or eliminated funding for the COPS Hiring  Program since the Republicans took control of this House in 2011.   So every year, Representative Dave Reichert and I, co-chairs of the  Congressional Law Enforcement Caucus, come to the floor to offer an  amendment to shift funding back to the COPS Hiring Program to show  support for local police hiring programs. We do this dance every year,  but no one seems to learn their lesson, because here we are again with  a bill that zeros out funding for this program.   Our amendments pass with overwhelming support, often by voice vote.  The Senate sees this strong support and ends up funding the program in  the final appropriations package. In fact, both the Senate and  President have proposed funding the COPS program at $207 million.   Typically, we have regular order in the House when considering  appropriations bills. That means we would have an open rule to allow us  to offer any amendment to shift funds in this bill. However, this is  not the case this year, Mr. Chairman.   Our dance with the Appropriations Committee would have continued this  year, but the Rules Committee prevented any substantive amendment to  boost funding for the COPS Hiring Program from moving forward.   This amendment enjoyed the support of law enforcement organizations  across America, including the Major County Sheriffs Association. They  were dismayed at the decision to eliminate the COPS Hiring Program.   The amendment before us enjoys the support of law enforcement  organizations, such as the National Association of Police  Organizations, Fraternal Order of Police. In their letter of support,  NAPO wrote that they are ``very concerned that H.R. 3354 does not  provide funding for the COPS Hiring Program.''   The FOP writes: `` . . . we must continue to fund the COPS Hiring  Program.''   Mr. Chairman, I include these letters in the Record.                              Major County Sheriffs' Association,                                     Pontiac, MI, September 6, 2017.      Hon. Bill Pascrell,      House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Congressman Pascrell: On behalf of the Major County       Sheriffs of America  [[Page H7263]]       (MCSA), I write in support of your amendment to the FY18       House Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies       Appropriations bill which will provide critical funding to       the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant (Byrne JAG) program. The       MCSA is an association of elected Sheriffs representing the       Nation's largest counties with populations of 500,000 people       or more. Collectively, we represent more than 100 million       Americans.        The MCSA was again dismayed at the CJS Appropriations       Committee's decision to eliminate the COPS Hiring program--a       program helping to ensuring state and local law enforcement       have the personnel and resources necessary to protect and       serve their communities. At a time when agencies are being       asked to do more yet are still struggling to recruit and       retain law enforcement professionals, we are seeing a       pullback of federal support.        The MCSA applauds your understanding of the many challenges       facing local law enforcement today and we appreciate your       commitment to our profession.            Very Respectfully,                                               Michael J. Bouchard,      Sheriff, Oakland County (MI).                                   ____                                             National Association of                                      Police Organizations, Inc.,                                  Alexandria, VA, September 7, 2017.      Re Support for Amendment #109 to H.R. 3354 to Provide $100           Million for COPS Hiring.       House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Member of Congress: On behalf of the National       Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), I am writing to       advise you of our strong support for Amendment #109 to H.R.       3354, offered by Congressmen Pascrell and Reichert, that       would provide $100 million in funding for the Community       Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Hiring Program.        NAPO is a coalition of police units and associations from       across the United States that serves to advance the interests       of America's law enforcement through legislative and legal       advocacy, political action, and education. Founded in 1978,       NAPO now represents more than 1,000 police units and       associations, 241,000 sworn law enforcement officers, and       more than 100,000 citizens who share a common dedication to       fair and effective crime control and law enforcement.        NAPO is very concerned that H.R. 3354 does not provide       funding for the COPS Hiring Program. This vital program has       assisted more than 13,000 jurisdictions with over $14 billion       in funding to hire more than 127,000 community police       officers across the United States. A big part of the success       of the original program was its reliance on local police       agencies in defining what their communities needed. In       addition to the hiring and retention of much needed officers,       this funding program has contributed to continued success in       combating crime, drug use, and gangs; reducing and preventing       the manufacture, distribution, and use of illegal drugs;       promoting officer safety and wellness; and addressing       emerging law enforcement needs. It is vital that this program       continue to be funded.        The Pascrell/Reichert Amendment #109 rights this wrong by       providing necessary funding to the COPS Hiring Program. As       major cities across the country are facing an increase in       violent crime for the first time in years and community-      police relations are strained, now is not the time to put       additional stresses on state and local police forces by       leaving them short-handed. Further, this funding will be       essential to police and sheriff departments affected by       Hurricanes Harvey and Irma as they look to rebuild.        NAPO urges you to support this amendment and ensure that       the COPS Hiring Program remains strong and robust.            Sincerely,                                          William J. Johnson, Esq.,      Executive Director.                                   ____                                                  National Fraternal                                                 Order of Police,                                  Washington, DC, September 7, 2017.      Hon. Paul D. Ryan,      Speaker of the House, House of Representatives, Washington,           DC.      Hon. Kevin O. McCarthy,      Majority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Nancy P. Pelosi,      Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.      Hon. Steny H. Hoyer,      Minority Whip, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.        Dear Mr. Speaker and Representatives McCarthy, Pelosi and       Hoyer: I am writing on behalf of the members of the Fraternal       Order of Police to advise you of our strong support for an       amendment, introduced by Representatives William J. Pascrell,       Jr. (D-NJ) and David G. Reichert (R-WA), which would increase       by $100 million the appropriations for the hiring program       administered by the Office of Community Oriented Policing       Services (COPS) at the U.S. Department of Justice.        In 1994, Congress established the COPS Office and, in the       decade which followed, our nation experienced a significant       drop in crime rates. A large part of this success was the       nation's commitment to community oriented policing,       particularly its hiring component which helped get more       officers on the beat. Community oriented policing has been       the cornerstone of our nation's policing strategy for nearly       25 years and the hiring program is the reason this strategy       works.        However, today, we have less police on our streets and       neighborhoods than we did even a decade ago, making the       community policing strategy very difficult to pursue. It is       no surprise to our profession that crime, particularly       violent crime, is on the rise. There are less men and women       policing our streets, keeping the peace and interacting       positively with the communities they protect. If we are       serious about stemming the rise in crime and if we remain       committed to the community policing strategy, then we must       continue to fund the COPS hiring program.        It is for these reasons we urge you and all Members of       Congress to vote in support of the Reichert-Pascrell       amendment providing resources to the COPS hiring program.        On behalf of the more than 330,000 members of the Fraternal       Order of Police, I appreciate you considering our views on       this important issue. If you need additional information,       please do not hesitate to contact me or my Senior Advisor Jim       Pasco in my Washington office            Sincerely,                                                  Chuck Canterbury,                                                National President.     Hiding behind procedural shenanigans to dodge support  for our Nation's law enforcement officers and then pontificating when  you come to the floor, that doesn't settle right with me or a lot of  other people.                                time  1515    You have done it year after year. You are not going to do it this  year? I am sorry. You can't have your cake and eat it.   I want to say this in closing. I want all of my colleagues to reflect  on how, on the one hand, you can claim support for law enforcement  while, at the same time, cutting the resources you need to hire brave  men and women who keep the neighborhood safe. I do not know the answer  to that question, but I do know that, during this year's National  Police Week, a week where we honor the brave men and women who lost  their lives while serving in the line of duty, my friend and the  chairman of the subcommittee--and I consider him a friend--stood on the  House floor and said:         As the chairman of the Commerce, Justice, Science       Appropriations Subcommittee, it is and continues to be my top       priority to ensure that our law enforcement officers have the       resources that they need.    Mr. Chairman, I yield the remainder of my time to the gentleman from  New Jersey (Mr. Lance).
