 Mr. Speaker, throughout history, the Jew has never been  safe. People have demonized, ostracized, and murdered Jews for  millennia. From the ashes of the Holocaust, the massacre of 6 million  of our brethren, Jews return to their ancestral home to build an oasis  in the desert and a democracy of their own.   Jews persisted, even in the face of ultimate evil. And, today, in  their rightful homeland, they are attacked from within. Some call them  villains for defending their home and their families; for not turning a  cheek and a blind eye to terror, bombings, and missiles raining down.   Who would turn a cheek when their mere right to exist is questioned?  Or turn a blind eye when history has been so unkind?   Not you and not the Israelis.   And we as Americans, and me as an American and a Jew, must stand for  what is right. We must declare that Israel has a right to exist; that  Israel has the inherent right to defend itself; that we have a duty, as  Americans, to stand by the side of Israel in the face of attacks from  terrorists and suicide bombers and malign regimes, who, again, have the  same goal in mind, to kill Jews.   Now is the time to stand with Israel.                            ____________________
