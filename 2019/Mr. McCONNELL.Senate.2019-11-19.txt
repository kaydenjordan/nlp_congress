 Madam President, my colleagues are well familiar with  my repeated calls for bipartisan progress in funding the Federal  Government. For more than 2 months, as the appropriations process idled  at partisan roadblocks, I pointed out just how straightforward this  entire process could have been. With the road map negotiated in July by  the President and the Speaker, and approved by each of the  congressional leaders, we had the necessary commitments to move forward  in good faith and avoid partisan riders that would stall the entire  effort, but, of course, that didn't happen.   But failing to secure funding for the Federal Government before the  end of the year is not an option. Chairman Shelby continues to lead  efforts to settle on subcommittee allocations that can earn bipartisan  support. Today, these efforts are ongoing, and with our deadline to  prevent a funding lapse rapidly approaching, I am encouraged that the  House will apparently be voting today on a continuing resolution to  keep the Government funded until December 20, while talks continue.  These talks must continue because it is vital that we work in good  faith to fund important priorities for the coming year, but what is  needed in the near term is to keep the Government open for the next  several weeks while this work goes on.   This is not rocket science. The House needs to send us the short-term  funding bill which the Senate can pass and which the President will  sign. That is the way to keep the government open while our important  discussions continue to make progress toward closing out the  appropriations process and getting full-year bills to the floor.                            ____________________     Madam President, on another matter, for weeks  Republicans have been trying to move forward significant bipartisan  legislation for the American people. Senate Republicans are trying to  get our Democratic colleagues to let us consider defense funding. House  Republicans have tried to get Speaker Pelosi to finally allow a vote on  the USMCA, and in both Chambers we have been asking Democrats to stop  slow-walking the conference committee for the critical Defense bill,  the NDAA.  [[Page S6632]]    Alas, our Democratic colleagues have not been willing to budge on any  of those things. As a result, while the Senate waits for the House to  send us short-term funding legislation, we will spend our time on the  personnel business.   Yesterday, we advanced the nomination of Justice Robert Luck, of  Florida, to be a U.S. circuit judge for the Eleventh Circuit, with the  support of a bipartisan majority.   Justice Luck brings an impressive and well-rounded legal record,  including a clerkship on the Eleventh Circuit, service in the U.S.  Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida, and years spent  ruling from the State bench.   Today, we will also advance the nomination of Justice Barbara Lagoa,  of Florida, also to serve on the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. A  graduate of Columbia University School of Law, Justice Lagoa has spent  years practicing law, serving as a Federal prosecutor, and ruling from  both the State appellate bench and the Florida Supreme Court.   I look forward to confirming both of these impressive nominees, along  with Adrian Zuckerman, the President's nominee to serve as our Nation's  Ambassador to Romania.                            ____________________     Madam President, on a final matter, I spoke yesterday  about the courageous people of Hong Kong who are standing up to Beijing  and speaking up for their freedoms. But Hongkongers are not alone in  bravely speaking up at this time. The Middle East continues to be swept  by widespread and cross-sectarian demonstrations.   In Lebanon, in Iraq, and in Iran, millions are demanding a better  future, greater justice, less corruption, and more democracy from their  governments. These protests expand three countries. Each is unique, but  one common thread connects them: Iran.   For years, Iran has systematically sought to undermine the  territorial integrity and manipulate the politics of countries all  across the Middle East. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Lebanon  and Iraq, where Iranian proxies have challenged the very sovereignty of  the state.   In Lebanon, Iran backs Hezbollah, the terrorist group that has become  a dominant political player. Hezbollah has become a state within a  state. Its weapons and fighters do not work to defend the Lebanese  state but to embroil it in Syria's civil war and imperil its security  by threatening Israel with precision rockets.   In Iraq, Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps has spent years  sponsoring Shia militias and proxies that are more loyal to Tehran than  to Baghdad or to the people of Iraq.   In both of these countries, Tehran has used and promoted the use of  force to acquire power and to acquire influence. A few weeks ago, the  leader of Iran's terrorist Quds Force reportedly flew to Iraq for  secret meetings to guide Iraqi leaders through the protests there.   Here is what this Iranian thug told the Iraqis: ``We in Iran know how  to deal with protests.'' Enough said.   Well, a violent crackdown on peaceful protesters is not going to  resolve anything. What Iraqi and Lebanese leaders must do is stop  listening to the poisonous advice of Iranian tyrants, who are losing  their own grip on their own people, and start addressing their own  citizens' demands for transparency and reform.   Iraq and Lebanon should give their people what they want--less  corruption, less malign foreign influence, more opportunity, and the  rule of law.   That is the path forward for Iraq and Lebanon. Commit to prosperity  and pluralism at home, combat corruption and injustice within all sects  and confessions, protect the sovereignty of your country, pursue peace  with your neighbors, and enjoy support from the United States as well.   I would note that in contrast to Hezbollah's thugs, Lebanon's Armed  Forces by most accounts continue to be one of Lebanon's few  institutions of national unity. The LAF has respected the rights of  protesters, protected them from violence, and sought to deescalate  tensions on the street.   I know the U.S. military believes its training and partnership with  the LAF is paying off, helping it to be a more professional and  responsible security force.   So while these events transpire in Iraq and Lebanon, the Iranian  people themselves are also engaging in their own demonstrations. Iran  used to be a moderate, open, and prosperous society. It could be again.  Now tens of thousands of Iranian people themselves are raising their  voices in righteous anger at what has become of their living conditions  and their country. The Iranian people are feeling the pain inflicted by  the brutality, selfishness, and extremism of their ruling class.   The regime seems to be doing all it can to put a stop to this.  Reports over the weekend indicated an enormous, unprecedented internet  blackout aimed at keeping Iranians in the dark and suggests Iranian  leaders are threatening yet another violent crackdown against their own  citizens.   But Iran's leaders know exactly what must be done to alter the course  of their once-great country and unlock a better future for its  citizens. Iran needs to stop pursuing nuclear weapons and long-range  missile capabilities, stop supporting terror and cyber offensives, stop  causing bloodshed to weaken its neighbors, and stop the horrific  mistreatment of its own people.   There is an entire civilized world full of diverse nations that get  by just fine--just fine--without engaging in any of these rogue state  activities. Iran engages in all of them. Iranian leaders will either  listen to their own citizens and start behaving like a normal nation or  they will be treated more and more like the backward pariahs they have  become.   I suggest the absence of a quorum.
