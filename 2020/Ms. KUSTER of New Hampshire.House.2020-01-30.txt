 Mr. Speaker, climate change poses a  serious threat to virtually every aspect of our lives, particularly in  my State of New Hampshire, where our economy is deeply tied to nature.   That is why, earlier this week, I was proud to unveil my Clean Energy  Agenda with climate experts from across my district to outline policies  and bills that Congress can pass this year to move the United States  toward a clean energy economy.  [[Page H717]]    I have prioritized 25 bills, most of them bipartisan, that identify  areas where Republicans and Democrats can work together to protect our  planet and create good jobs.   From investing in energy efficiency to dramatically ramping up the  deployment of renewable energy and decarbonizing our transportation  sector, my agenda includes a wide range of bills that can be passed if  we find the political will to act.   I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Energy and  Commerce Committee to advance policies that pave a pathway toward a  clean energy future.                            ____________________
