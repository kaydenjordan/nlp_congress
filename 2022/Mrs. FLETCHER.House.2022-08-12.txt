 Madam Speaker, today is a historic day. Today, we will  vote on the question of whether to allow Medicare to negotiate the  price of prescription drugs and cap out-of-pocket costs for seniors;  lower the cost of healthcare; implement smart energy policy to reduce  emissions, fight climate change, and spur energy innovation; invest in  American manufacturing; and reduce our deficit spending by $300  billion.   We answer these questions ``yes'' by voting for the Inflation  Reduction Act.   As the representative of the energy capital of the world, where we  lead in energy technology and investment, I want to respond to some of  the things that we have just heard.   I am particularly proud of the work that we have done here to ensure  that the historic methane emissions reduction program will actually  reduce greenhouse gas emissions, make it possible for energy companies  of all sizes to reduce their emissions through a grant program, and  ensure that the United States remains the global leader in energy  production and in energy innovation and technology.   We do this by voting together for this historic bill today.
