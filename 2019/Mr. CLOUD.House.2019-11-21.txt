 Madam Speaker, I rise to today to wish Mr. George Hyak of  Victoria, Texas, a heartfelt happy 100th birthday and to thank him for  his service to our country.   George is an example of a life well lived. He and his precious bride,  Sarah, have been married for 71 years, and their family has flourished.   George served our Nation heroically during World War II, storming the  beaches of Normandy on D-day, fighting in the Battle of the Bulge, and  liberating a Nazi concentration camp.   After the war, he returned home and continued operating the Dick's  Food Stores in Victoria, which he cofounded. The longevity of the store  earned it the Texas Treasure Business Award.   As we look to celebrate Thanksgiving, we as a nation do have a lot to  be thankful for, including veterans like George. May Mr. Hyak's life  serve as a reminder of the price that he and others like him paid for  our freedom.                            ____________________
