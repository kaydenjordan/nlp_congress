 Mr. Speaker, for us women who have been victims of  assault or harassment, this is a very serious, serious matter. I intend  to vote for this bill today. But, as has been mentioned, it is just a  first step. We know on the House Administration Committee that we are  going to have to dig in and make sure that the training that is  referred to in this bill is a lot better than what we have right now.  It is deficient.   I would like to say also that the process that we have for victims to  come forward is an embarrassment. It needs to be refined, reviewed, and  fixed from the point of view of the victim.                                time  1500    Here in America, every day we open our news feed and we see someone  else who has been fired because of engaging in sexual harassment  misconduct. It is part of, really, a component of devaluing women. That  is what this is about.   I heard my colleague from the House Administration Committee mention  the columnist who said that the sexual harassment racket is over. I am  afraid it isn't. Not yet. But it is our obligation to make sure that it  does end.   We are the House of Representatives. It should be expected of us that  we take the lead, that we set the standard for how women can be valued  in the workplace. I think this first step is valuable, but if we had to  walk a mile, this is a foot.   I am happy to support this measure, but I am looking forward to  working with Mr. Brady, who has been such a leader, and the committee.  We have had a bipartisan effort with the chairman of the committee. We  have got a lot of work to do, and I look forward to doing it.
