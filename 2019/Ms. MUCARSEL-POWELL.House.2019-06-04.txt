 Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 6,  the American Dream and Promise Act of 2019.   Almost half of the people in my district were born in a country other  than the United States, including myself. I did not have the great  privilege of being born into this incredible Nation. But my story is  not unique. My story, and every immigrant's story, is the American  story. It is who we are as a country.   Dreamers, DED holders, TPS, and DACA recipients, are Americans in  every single way but on paper; and it is time that we change that.   Protecting these Americans is not only the right thing to do, but it  also makes economic sense.   In my district alone, Dream and Promise households contribute over  $53 million in Federal taxes and have a spending power of over $271  million. These Americans are our friends, our neighbors, and our  coworkers. They are teachers, doctors, farmers. They represent our  Nation's commitment to hard work.   To every Dreamer, DED holder, TPS and DACA recipient with us here and  across the country, I want you to know, we see you. We hear you. Your  fight is our fight.   Today, we will pass the American Dream and Promise Act of 2019 and  give all these Americans the protections that they deserve.   I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6.
