 Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  Revitalizing Small and Local Businesses Act, which I introduced today.   Even before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, historic  underinvestment in certain communities left their small businesses and  business districts more vulnerable to economic shocks and limited  economic opportunities.   Main Street programs and business district organizations have played  an important role in supporting businesses through the economic crisis  and will continue to play a critical role in supporting a strong,  inclusive recovery. While many communities need place-based supportive  services tailored to their unique needs, Federal investments have not  meaningfully supported these entities.   As we work to build back better, we have an opportunity to improve  equitable access to economic development resources by leveraging the  expertise of nonprofit partners with deep connections to small  businesses and the organizations that serve them.   That is why I am proud to introduce this bill together with Senator  Wicker to create a new $250 million Economic Development Administration  grant program to support place-based supportive services to provide on- the-ground assistance in both urban and rural communities.   This bill would strategically and efficiently deploy funding to  support the vital work of local programs to revitalize small businesses  and business districts as these communities, particularly low-income,  rural, and minority communities, seek to recover from the devastating  economic effects of the pandemic.   It would support job retention and creation opportunities as well as  deliver vital technical assistance to small businesses.   I thank Senator Wicker for coleading this bill with me, and I hope  our colleagues will join us in support of this bill to empower place- based entities to respond to economic recovery needs through locally  tailored solutions.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the  Revitalizing Small and Local Businesses Act, which I introduced today.
