 Madam Speaker, I rise today to celebrate  the life of Dr. James Henry Neely, who passed away on Monday, June 22,  in Oxford, Mississippi.   Dr. Neely was born August 8, 1932, in West Point, Mississippi. His  many accomplishments began at Mary Holmes College High School. He was  the editor of the school newspaper, secretary of the senior class,  president of the athletic club, and member at large of the student  council. He took his successes to Kentucky State University, earning a  degree in chemistry and a minor in math and French.   His passion for chemistry and academia led Dr. Neely to Meharry  Medical College in 1960. After graduation, he took his leadership  skills to the United States Air Force, where he served honorably until  his discharge in 1964, and he relocated in Tupelo, Mississippi. He  served his community as a medical practitioner for 35 years. He was the  first African American doctor to have hospital privileges, admitting  privileges, and could treat patients at North Mississippi Medical  Center.   He would go on to earn the Mississippi Medical Surgical Award,  Practitioner of the Year, and Meharry Medical College Distinguished  Service Award. Dr. Neely, though, will tell you his greatest  accomplishment was his marriage to Elaine Kilgore for 66 years.   Outside of the medical profession, Dr. Neely held many memberships,  including the National Medical Association, the Black Business  Association of Mississippi, the NAACP, and was a member of the West  Point Trinity United Presbyterian Church. He was not only a prominent  figure in the medical field, but in the community in which he served.   Left to cherish his memory is his wife, Elaine; his son, my friend  and mentor and an assistant district attorney in my office, Brian  Neely; his daughter, acclaimed poet and Goodwill Ambassador for the  State of Mississippi, Patricia Neely-Dorsey; his four grandchildren,  and many others.   Dr. Neely led a life we should all admire. He affected change in  Mississippi and this Nation by his life of public service.                            ____________________
