 Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order  for the quorum call be rescinded.    Madam President, Members are working around the clock to  finish the year on a strong note. This week, the Senate will consider  the bipartisan National Defense Authorization bill, which I hope we  will send to the President's desk very soon. The NDAA has consistently  been a bipartisan effort, and that is my expectation this year too.   On the nominations front, we are going to keep working as long as we  can to confirm as many exceptional Biden nominees as possible. Since  the start of the Biden administration, we have confirmed a total of  95--95--judicial nominees to the bench, including 1 Supreme Court  Justice, 68 district judges, and 26--26--circuit court judges.   Let me say that again. Over the past 2 years, we have confirmed 95  new judges to the bench, including 26 circuit court judges, surpassing  the first 2 years of the past two administrations.   Today, we will confirm judge No. 96 when we vote on Tamika  Montgomery-Reeves to serve as a circuit judge on the Third Circuit. An  alumnus of the University of Mississippi and Georgia Law School, Judge  Montgomery-Reeves served as a clerk in Delaware before embarking on a  successful career in private practice. In 2005, she was appointed to  the Delaware Court of Chancery and then to the State supreme court in  2020, becoming the first Black woman to ever serve in either court.   When confirmed, Judge Montgomery-Reeves will join in the proud  company of so many other Biden appointees who, little by little, are  reshaping our courts for the better. Of the 95 judges we have confirmed  to date, 71 are women, about 75 percent; 65 are people of color, almost  70 percent; 45 are women of color, nearly 50 percent; and 23 are Black  women, nearly 25 percent.   We have never seen a class of new judges that brings so much  diversity, variety, and dynamism in a single 2-year stretch.   And, of course, it is not just the diversity of demography that  matters. In the last 2 years, the Senate has confirmed more civil  rights lawyers, public defenders, election attorneys, immigration  lawyers than we typically see in this Chamber. It is a big reason today  why our courts are more balanced and more dynamic and more experienced  than they were 2 years ago.   You can be sure that judges will remain a top priority in the  Congress to come. More judges mean a more balanced judiciary, and a  more balanced judiciary will mean greater trust in our courts in the  long run--so important for our country at this moment in time because  the MAGA Supreme Court and so many of these other MAGA judges have  caused people to lose faith in the courts.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate  proceed to legislative session and be in a period of morning business,  with Senators permitted to speak therein for up to 10 minutes each.    Mr. President, I have one request for committees to meet  during today's session of the Senate. They have the approval of the  Majority and Minority Leaders.   Pursuant to rule XXVI, paragraph 5(a), of the Standing Rules of the  Senate, the following committees are authorized to meet during today's  session of the Senate:                            ____________________     Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 3:30 p.m.  on Tuesday, December 13, the Senate proceed to legislative session;  that the time until 7 p.m. be for debate equally divided between the  two leaders or their designees on the motion to discharge S.J. Res. 56  from the Committee on Foreign Relations, with 30 minutes under the  control of Senator Sanders and 10 minutes under the control of Senator  Menendez; and that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate  vote on the motion to discharge the joint resolution.    Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the  Committee on Environment and Public Works be discharged from further  consideration of S. 5066 and the Senate proceed to its immediate  consideration.    I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered read  a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be considered  made and laid upon the table.

Mr. President, if there is no further business to come  before the Senate, I ask unanimous consent that it stand adjourned  under the previous order following the remarks of Senators Sullivan and  Murkowski.
