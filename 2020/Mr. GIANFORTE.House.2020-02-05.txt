 Mr. Speaker, many Montanans live in frontier and rural  areas where access to doctors and specialists is a big challenge. They  don't worry about when they can see a doctor; they worry if there is  even a doctor to see.   For Montana seniors with mobility issues, getting out to see a doctor  can be difficult and can delay their care leading to worse health  outcomes.   Montana, unfortunately, also has the highest suicide rate in the  Nation. Thousands of Montanans lack adequate access to mental  healthcare.   Telehealth can fix these problems. Telehealth increases access to  care, brings down healthcare costs, and, in some cases, saves lives.   Unfortunately, Federal telehealth programs have been poorly managed.  Currently, 10 different Federal agencies operate telehealth programs  with little or no coordination between them.   That is why Chairwoman Eshoo and I have worked for months on ways to  improve and increase telehealth services. I appreciate her leadership  on this important issue.   Today, we introduce the National Telehealth Strategy and Data  Advancement Act. Our bill reauthorizes telehealth grant programs,  provides greater oversight of Federal agencies, and helps implement  telehealth programs across the country.   Using modern technology to make healthcare more accessible is a  commonsense solution. It will particularly help us with our rural  doctor shortage in Montana.   This bill will ensure that patients can have access to doctors and  specialists in a way that is convenient for them.   I look forward to working on this bipartisan bill. It is a critical  step as we ensure all Americans, particularly those in our rural and  frontier areas, have access to better, affordable healthcare.                            ____________________
