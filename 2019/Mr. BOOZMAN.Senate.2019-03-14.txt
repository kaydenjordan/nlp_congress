 Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the  contributions of Euba Harris-Winton to Fort Smith and the State of  Arkansas. She passed away on Monday, March 11, at the age of 95 and  leaves behind a large, loving family and countless Arkansans whom she  helped and inspired throughout her life.   Euba was born on June 26, 1923, to Rev. Daniel Haven Edward Harris  and Martha T. Hill Harris in Cotton Plant, AR. Her school years were  spent in Fort Smith where she attended Howard Elementary School and  Lincoln High School. After attending Westark Community College and  Philander Smith College, she returned to Fort Smith to raise a family  with her husband, Ellsworth Daniel Winton. They had 10 children: five  girls and five boys.   She was a devout member of the United Methodist Church, and her great  faith and passion for service led her to become the executive director  of the Mallalieu Community Development Center in 1970. The center's  mission was to strengthen the outreach ministry of the church. As part  of that mission, she worked on efforts to fight poverty, improve  substandard housing, increase educational opportunities, and personally  provide help to anyone who asked. She led the organization for 25 years  and improved the lives of countless Arkansans in the process.   Throughout her life, she met with leaders at all levels of government  to advocate for others and served on numerous boards and councils. In  an article in the Lincoln Echo several years ago, Bennie Mae Ware Gunn  remarked that, ``Euba is known and respected for being both relentless  and resourceful in her pursuit of justice and opportunities for others.  However, she is also known for her sensitivity and compassion.''   That is certainly true of my experience with her and that of so many  others she influenced or helped over the years. I was honored to know  Mrs. Euba and will personally miss her example, kindness, advice, and  willingness to help others.   She was a rare individual who never stopped fighting to improve the  world  [[Page S1895]]  around her and was an inspiration to us all. I know her legacy lives on  through her extended family and in every person she touched with her  compassion, strength, and wisdom.                            ____________________     Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and  congratulate my alma mater, Northside High School in Fort Smith, AR, on  winning 6A State championships in both boys and girls basketball this  year.   The high school basketball season was as exciting as ever in the  Natural State, but folks in my hometown of Fort Smith were especially  enthusiastic when tournament time came around because both the boys'  and girls' teams had advanced to postseason play. Both squads have won  multiple State titles, and the fans were eager to add another this  season.   Both the boys' and girls' teams advanced through their respective  tournaments and made it to the finals, overcoming challenges from  talented teams from across Arkansas. The championship games were  incredibly competitive, and each came down to the wire.   The Lady Bears faced off against Bentonville in their State title  game. Led by Jersey Wolfenbarger's 21-point effort, including the game- winning basket as time expired, the team ended the contest on a 7-0 run  to claim the school's seventh girls basketball State championship since  1999. Each of those titles was won under the direction of coach Rickey  Smith. The team ended the season ranked 17th in the Nation in USA  Today's high school rankings.   Not to be outdone, the Northside Grizzlies boys' team also had a  memorable championship game that included a half-court basket to end  the first half. Facing off against Bryant High School, Northside led  for most of the contest. After Bryant tied the game late in the fourth  quarter, Northside came up with a three-point basket and held onto the  lead until the end of regulation. Junior center Jaylen Williams' play-- he scored 20 points and grabbed 16 rebounds--earned him the MVP  designation. The championship was the 11th in school history. The  Grizzlies were led by coach Eric Burnett who believed his team was  built for a good run in the tournament because of the difficulty of its  nonconference schedule. This was their third consecutive championship  game appearance, having won a championship in 2017 as well.   Needless to say, it was a very special day in Hot Springs, where the  title games were played, and in the Fort Smith community, as each team  brought home State championships in the same year for the second time  since 2007.   As a former Northside Grizzly and someone with family roots in Fort  Smith, I am proud that both the Grizzly and Lady Bears basketball teams  earned the highest achievement possible in our State. To do so in the  same year is an even greater testament to the dedication and passion of  the players, coaches, student body, administrators, and the fans of  these terrific teams.   Congratulations again to the Grizzly and Lady Bears squads on this  tremendous accomplishment, and I look forward to celebrating with them,  Northside High School, and the Fort Smith community in the near  future.                            ____________________
