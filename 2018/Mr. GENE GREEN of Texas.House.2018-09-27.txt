 Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak out  against H.R. 6760, the Protecting Family and Small Business Tax Cuts  Acts of 2018, along with the two other bills packaged into what is  being called Tax Reform 2.0. H.R. 6760 is a continuation of the GOP's  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was pushed into law in December 2017. This  2017 tax law is a scam on the American public, and the legislation  before us today is more of the same. The fundamental problem with the  Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is that its goal was never to help the average  American. Instead, it helps out large corporations and wealthy  individuals by dramatically decreasing their tax rates. H.R. 6760  doubles down on these regressive policies, doing nothing to even the  playing field for millions of working Americans struggling to enter or  stay in the middle class. Like the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, H.R. 6760  continues to favor high-income individuals over middle- and working- class Americans.   To make matters worse, H.R. 6760 adds to the large debt we have as a  nation. According to the Congressional Budget Office, H.R. 6760 alone  would increase the deficit by $631 billion over the next ten years. At  a time when the deficit is already too high, we need to start figuring  out ways to stop the deficit from growing, not adding to it. A growing  deficit only means that critical benefits that Americans use every day,  like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will be diminished or  demolished as a way to pay for this unfair and flawed tax legislation.  Ending crucial benefits that Americans rely on every day is another  attack on the very people who sent us here.   Instead of continuing to hurt Americans, Congress must come together  to create a tax code that is fair for all American workers and the  middle class. I urge my colleagues to create a tax code that evens out  the playing field for American workers, strengthens working families,  and helps our economy benefit all Americans.
