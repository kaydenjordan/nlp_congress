 Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of the Financial CHOICE  Act. In response to the Great Recession, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank  law. While well intentioned, various Dodd-Frank provisions and  regulations are actually encouraging some of the behavior that led to  the financial crisis.   The law permits Wall Street to receive bailouts and has constricted  credit lending for consumers and small  [[Page H4724]]  businesses. It has drastically hurt community banks throughout this  country, and they had absolutely nothing to do with the financial  crisis. Two thousand community banks have closed nationwide since Dodd- Frank, including 42 in New Jersey.   Dodd-Frank has institutionalized too big to fail for Wall Street,  while telling community banks on Main Street that they are too small to  succeed.   Congress agrees on the need for strong regulation of our financial  system. The Financial CHOICE Act will bring balanced reform to our  Nation's financial institutions.
