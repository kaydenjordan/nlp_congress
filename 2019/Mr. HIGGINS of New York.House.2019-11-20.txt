 Mr. Speaker, November 21 is recognized as  World Pancreatic Cancer Day, a time to raise awareness and inspire  action in the fight against this devastating diagnosis which touches  too many families.   It is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States,  with a 5-year survival rate of just 9 percent. More than 1,000 new  cases are diagnosed around the world every day, and it is estimated  that pancreatic cancer will be responsible for 3,000 deaths in New York  State this year alone.   The Pancreatic Cancer Action Network and its western New York  affiliate have made it their goal to double pancreatic cancer survival.  As co-chair of the House Cancer Caucus, I am proud to advocate for  robust funding for cancer research to put goals like this within reach.   Recently, researchers at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center  announced promising findings on treatments aimed at overcoming  pancreatic cancer's resistance to treatment, but continued funding on  projects like this is critical to saving lives.   The need to increase pancreatic cancer survival rates is urgent, and  it must be America's goal.                            ____________________
