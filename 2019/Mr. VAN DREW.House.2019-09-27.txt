 Madam Speaker, I am here today to bring attention to  the American Workforce Empowerment Act which I worked on with my friend  from Minnesota, Congressman   Jim Hagedorn.   This is a bipartisan solution--and I hope everybody heard the word  bipartisan--to address the growing shortage of skilled workers to fill  job openings in the technical and skilled trades.   Small businesses are in need of machinists, welders, truck drivers,  and an array of other qualified trades and labor-intensive professions.  We should do everything we can to incentivize technical skills training  and apprenticeships for those who like to work with their hands and see  the product of their hard work.   The bipartisan American Workforce Empowerment Act expands these  programs eligible for payment by 529 savings plans, and by making  registered apprenticeships eligible, we can more easily and readily  close the wide gap of good-paying positions that have gone unfilled in  our robust economy.   Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 4469. We need  to expand our workforce, and this is a great way to do it.                            ____________________
