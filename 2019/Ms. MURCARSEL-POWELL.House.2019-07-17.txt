 Mr. Speaker, oftentimes Latinas in STEM are  used to being the only women in the room and often the only people of  color. Women make up only 24 percent of the STEM workforce, and Latinas  only 2 percent of the entire STEM workforce, but the future is  changing.   I rise today to celebrate the accomplishments of Laura and Natalia  Coronado, twin sisters who recently graduated from Florida  International University with bachelor's degrees in computer  engineering. Now they are each starting careers working for Intel.  Laura and Natalia are making south Florida proud and setting an example  for women and girls everywhere.   Breaking into a career field that is dominated by men is not easy.  Believe me, I know. It is up to all of us to create a society where  women are encouraged to pursue careers in STEM, and that means  promoting diversity and supporting equal opportunities.                            ____________________
