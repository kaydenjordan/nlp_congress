 Mr. Speaker, today I rise to tell you about a time when  bipartisanship was alive and when Congress was, well, boring for most  Americans. In fact, it wasn't that long ago.   It was just in March of 2015 that Democrats and Republicans fixed the  Medicare payment formula and funded the Children's Health Insurance  Program. I was proud to be a Member of the body that day.   Did our bipartisanship dominate the headlines?   No.   Did it get a lot of attention at townhalls?   No, of course not. Because all of us getting along was, well, boring.   But these recent Republican healthcare proposals, they are not  boring. They have been developed in secrecy, they are completely  partisan, and they take us backward.   I challenge my friends across the aisle, the Republicans, to join us  and fix the parts of the Affordable Care Act that need fixing because  the Affordable Care Act has made a real difference for  [[Page H5114]]  millions of Americans, a positive difference. So let's get back to  bipartisanship, back to boring, back to basics because that is what our  constituents want most of all.                            ____________________
