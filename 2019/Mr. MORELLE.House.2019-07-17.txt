 Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on Rules, I  call up House Resolution 492 and ask for its immediate consideration.   The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:                                H. Res. 492         Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be       in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 582) to       provide for increases in the Federal minimum wage, and for       other purposes. All points of order against consideration of       the bill are waived. The amendment in the nature of a       substitute recommended by the Committee on Education and       Labor now printed in the bill, modified by the amendment       printed in part A of the report of the Committee on Rules       accompanying this resolution, shall be considered as adopted.       The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All points       of order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are       waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered       on the bill, as amended, and on any further amendment       thereto, to final passage without intervening motion except:       (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled by the       chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on       Education and Labor; (2) the further amendment printed in       part B of the report of the Committee on Rules, if offered by       the Member designated in the report, which shall be in order       without intervention of any point of order, shall be       considered as read, shall be separately debatable for the       time specified in the report equally divided and controlled       by the proponent and an opponent, and shall not be subject to       a demand for division of the question; and (3) one motion to       recommit with or without instructions.     Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the  customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess), pending  which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During consideration  of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose of debate only.                                General Leave     Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members  may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their  remarks.    Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and  reported out a rule, House Resolution 492, providing for consideration  of H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage Act, under a structured rule.   The rule provides 1 hour of debate equally divided and controlled by  the chair and ranking member of the Committee on Education and Labor.  The rule makes in order one amendment, debatable for 10 minutes.   Mr. Speaker, the Raise the Wage Act gradually increases the Federal  minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025, thereby fulfilling a promise to  the American people that with hard work comes, at a minimum, a livable  wage. Not a wage with eroded purchasing power or a wage that keeps  workers from providing for their families, but a minimum wage that  empowers Americans and gives them a fighting chance at economic  mobility.   It has been over a decade, the longest stretch since the  establishment of the Federal minimum wage, since this body voted to  increase the minimum wage. This is a great disservice to the American  people, and I am thankful to Chairman Scott for making a gradual  increase of the Federal minimum wage a top priority of his Committee on  Education and Labor, of which I am a proud member.   In my home State of New York, we have one of the highest minimum  wages in the country. I was proud to support gradually increasing the  minimum wage to $15 an hour while I served as majority leader in the  New York State Assembly, and I look forward to doing the same here  today to ensure all Americans working full-time can live safely and  sustainably above the poverty line.   The benefits of increasing the minimum wage have far-reaching impacts  throughout our society. The Raise the Wage Act could increase wages for  over 30 million Americans, people who get up every day to work toward  their own version of the American Dream.   It empowers women, narrowing the gender wage pay gap through pay  increases for nearly 23 million women across America.   It would also lift the families of at least 1.3 million Americans,  600,000 of whom are children, out of poverty. Let's just think about  that for a moment: 1.3 million Americans who are working hard to make  ends meet but struggle below the poverty line because, for years,  Congress let the real value of their hard-earned dollars erode.   This isn't a handout for them. This is a fair and overdue adjustment  for employees who deserve to earn a livable wage.   Recently, a friend of mine, who is the administrator at Temple B'rith  Kodesh in Rochester, New York, where I worked to put myself through  college, sent me a copy of my pay stub from 1976.   At the time, I made the minimum wage, $2.30 an hour. People might  argue or debate whether or not I was worth $2.30 an hour, but that was  the minimum wage in 1976. Adjusted for inflation, that would be $10.35  in 2019 dollars.   Had the minimum wage kept pace with inflation, a worker who puts in  2,000 hours annually would make $20,700 today, but because the Federal  minimum wage is still at $7.25, or more than $2 an hour lower than if  the minimum wage had simply been adjusted for inflation since that  time, the same full-time worker today earns $14,500, a more than $6,200  erosion of purchasing power since 1976.   Even if you adjust for inflation since 2009 and look again at a  2,000-hour work year annually, the difference is $2,800.   When you are living paycheck to paycheck, as many minimum wage  workers do, an additional $6,200, or at least $2,800 annually, can make  a significant difference in your financial stability.   Gradually raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour doesn't just  benefit those earning minimum wage. It boosts the local economy in  communities across this country.   A gradual increase to $15 will accelerate economic growth by putting  money in the pockets of workers who want--and now can afford--to spend  money beyond their basic needs.   Whether it be at the community grocery stores or family-owned shops,  by spending money back in their local economy, they contribute to a  positive economic cycle.   From narrowing the gender pay gap and lifting families out of poverty  to strengthening local economies, the Raise the Wage Act has clear  benefits we should all get behind. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this  significant piece of legislation and urge all my colleagues to join me  in supporting its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I appreciate hearing from my distinguished friend and colleague on  the Rules Committee, Mr. Burgess. There is a lot to unpack from what he  said. Let me make a few points before I yield to my colleagues on my  side of the aisle.   First of all, as it relates to the economic numbers, the picture that  Mr. Burgess painted is heavily overstated. What it doesn't take into  consideration is the full picture here, which is the question of, if  you are going to establish as a matter of public policy that there  ought to be a minimum wage throughout this country, you do so  recognizing that that minimum wage ought to continue to keep pace so  that it doesn't get eroded over time. I will come back to that in a  minute.   I want to remind the gentleman that this change alone would lift 1.3  million people out of poverty--600,000 of whom are children who live in  poverty--even though they might work 2,000 hours a year, what we  consider full-time, full employment.   It is extraordinary. The savings alone to the government for people  who are no longer in poverty and who might rise out of the need for  public programs will be significant. Thirty million people would  benefit from this. Thirty million Americans benefit from the  legislation that Mr. Scott has advanced.  [[Page H5929]]    I also note that this economy has been growing for a decade now, what  I call the Obama recovery, which has continued. I also have the view  that Presidents probably get too much blame and certainly take too much  credit, perhaps, for economic growth.   This has been a sustained recovery. During times when there are labor  shortages is exactly the time that we would want to raise the minimum  wage. To do it during a labor market in which there was an excess labor  capacity would be the wrong time, it seems to me, from an economics  point of view.   Nonetheless, the point here is that the value of this has been agreed  to since 1938, when the minimum wage was first enacted under Franklin  D. Roosevelt.   I note, too, that in Mr. Burgess' district in Texas alone, 26 percent  of workers would see a raise of $3,900 a year, on average. That is just  in that district. That is a significant change in the economic well- being of people in his district in Texas.   I certainly don't ever doubt the sincerity of my colleague, but what  would the minimum wage be?   Perhaps my colleagues could argue we get full employment at $2 an  hour. Unfortunately, people would make $4,000 a year. So if we are  going to be truthful to and have fidelity to the notion that a floor  needs to be established--and that is what this is; States and  communities are free to raise beyond the Federal minimum wage--then the  question is, what do we set it at?   I note that in 2007, when the question was last before the House and  when we raised the minimum wage that was at $5.85 per hour, and it is  now at $7.25, Mr. Burgess voted ``no,'' as did many of his colleagues.   Should the minimum wage still be $5.85? I think the question is, what  do we value as Americans? What is the appropriate public policy for  establishing the floor for what an individual works in America?   We feel very strongly about it. We feel lifting 30 million Americans'  economic prospects make this the appropriate thing to do, particularly  in an economy that is growing and an economy that can certainly not  only afford it, but we believe there is a moral imperative to do so.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms.  Frankel).    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   I will admit I think this is the first time I have heard that the  great crisis of 2007-2008 was caused by or a contributing factor was  the increase in the Federal minimum wage from $5.85. That sort of  ignores the problems in the housing industry, credit default swaps, and  a whole host of things in the financial community, not to mention what  happened in the automotive industry. So this is the first time I have  heard that theory promoted by anyone, and I think it varies  dramatically from what history will write about 2007 and 2008.   Nonetheless, I do want to just correct a few things that I thought I  heard my distinguished friend say.   First of all, the 1.3 million people who will receive a raise, that  is not what I said nor is it what CBO said. 1.3 million people will be  out of poverty. It will be a raise for 27 million Americans. So that is  the right number. It is not 1.3 million; it is almost 30 million  Americans.   I just note that nowhere in the CBO does it talk about 4 million  people being displaced. What it says is that there will be zero to 3.7,  a two-thirds chance that will happen. The median loss will be 1.3  million. So nowhere is there 4 million.   But, again, the point here that I think we should take from this is,  using the logic that has been posited by my friend and colleague, you  could argue that, using that logic, there would be no minimum wage.  Just let the States do whatever the States choose to do, localities do  whatever localities choose to do. That is not the public policy  decision we made in 1938, and we continue to have fidelity to this day  and this time and place.   Now, there may be people who disagree with that who think there ought  not be a Federal minimum wage at all. I guess that is certainly their  right to do that and make that argument. But the most important thing  here is that, if we are going to establish this--which we on this side  of the aisle certainly believe in the Federal minimum wage--if you are  going to allow it to continue to function without the erosion of  inflation and the loss of purchasing power, making adjustments--which I  think is one of the things that most advocates for this bill is that  there may be other changes in time to wage rates, et cetera, under  law--this will establish, for the first time in Federal law, a wage  inflation adjustor each year so that we will stop, for the first time  since we initiated the minimum wage,  [[Page H5930]]  the erosion of purchasing power, and we won't need to wait 10 years.   This is the longest period of time, as I mentioned in my opening  comments, the longest period of time since the establishment of the  Federal minimum wage, that we have waited to make those adjustments.   I would just note that, while I was not here and I was laboring in  the State legislature in New York creating what I think was good  economic policy, I noted that the Committee on Education Labor, during  the intervening time while my friends were in the majority, not only  did they not attempt to raise the minimum wage, they did not hold a  single hearing on the erosion of the purchasing power of the minimum  wage, which at the time was $7.25 and remains, to this date, $7.25.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms.  Kaptur).    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Ohio an  additional 15 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I note that using that logic, people might have said the  same thing about my grandparents who came over from Italy at the turn  of the previous century, who came to work in this country as carpenters  and bricklayers and pipefitters.   What we really need, if the gentleman is serious, is a path to  citizenship to allow people, as we did a century ago, to come and  fulfill and be a part of the American Dream.   The truth is it also avoids what is happening, which is we have a  shortage of workers in the country. Every week I try to visit employers  in my community and get a sense of the pulse of what the challenges are  that they face in continuing to seek economic growth and more  opportunities. Repeatedly, I hear the same thing over and over again:  We need good workers. Send us more workers. Do whatever you can.   This is the time while our economy continues to grow following the  policies of the Obama administration, continuing today, economic growth  is now at a 10-year sustained path, but we need workers. You see this  all the time.   We can talk, and I am happy to talk about the impacts of automation  and robotics and AI, but the truth is that, even among some of the  biggest technology companies in the United States, there are thousands  and thousands of openings for jobs. This is hardly a job killer. This  is rewarding people who put in long hours, who look to climb that  ladder of success in the American economy.   I just note, also, for my colleague, Mr. Brooks, that 34 percent of  the workers in his district in Alabama would receive an average raise  of $3,700 a year by implementation of this wage increase.   And I would also remind my colleagues, 65 percent of Americans, when  asked, believe that increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2024  is the right policy for Congress to take.   So this has the backing and support of the American public. It has a  clear path to making sure that there isn't erosion of income in the  United States by people at the lowest end of the economic scale. It is  an opportunity for us to think about a path to citizenship, to end the  challenges faced by so many employers who seek good, hardworking  workers.   Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Rhode Island  (Mr. Cicilline), my good friend and a distinguished gentleman.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, although the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski)  did not actually talk about the minimum wage increase which is before  us, I do note that about 40 percent of the workers in her district  would be affected by this, with annual average raises of $3,200 a year.   Before I just make a couple of other points, Mr. Speaker, I include  in the Record the following letters: The first letter is from the  Service Employees International Union, SEIU, and the second is from the  Communications Workers of America, both sharing overwhelming support  for H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage Act.                                                           SEIU,                                      Washington, DC, July 16, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the two million members       of the Service Employees International Union (``SEIU''), I       write to urge you to vote YES on H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage       Act of 2019, and oppose any Republican Motion to Recommit.       For years, working people and allies have taken to the       streets to call for a $15 an hour minimum wage and to have       their voices heard in the workplace. By ensuring a path to       $15 in every part of our country, Congress will make sure       that everyone--no matter where they are from or what the       color of their skin is--is closer to having what they need to       get by. This is one of the most important changes we can make       in this country. Airport workers, home care workers, child       care providers, and all SEIU members are proud to stand with       the Fight for $15 and a Union and support this legislation.        It has been more than ten years since Congress raised the       federal minimum wage--the longest stretch in history. While       wealthy corporations have been handed tax cut after tax cut,       working families have been forced to scrape by with less than       they need. As a result, one in nine of our nation's full-time       workers struggle to support themselves and their families on       wages that leave them in poverty. There is currently no place       in America where a full-time worker making the federal       minimum wage can afford the basic essentials.        A $15 federal minimum wage would be life-changing for tens       of millions of working families, lifting an estimated 1.3       million Americans out of poverty, and helping to create an       economy that works for everyone, not just the wealthy few. It       is no surprise that poll after poll confirms widespread       support among Americans for this proposal.        The overwhelming share of low-wage earners would       unambiguously benefit from a $15 minimum wage, but enactment       of this bill is particularly critical for women who make up       nearly two-thirds of the workforce earning the federal       minimum wage or just above it, as well as Latinx and black       workers. Currently, black workers are significantly       overrepresented in states where the minimum wage has stayed       at $7.25 an hour. Many of the same states with low minimum       wages also have so-called ``Right-to-Work'' provisions that       weaken collective bargaining and the voice of working people.       These same jurisdictions are also places where voting rights       are under attack, Medicaid has not been expanded, and pre-      emption laws block many localities from raising the minimum       wage. Underpaid people in these regions and across the       country are depending on Congress to take immediate action to       raise the wage.        People like Terrence Wise, a worker at a McDonald's in       Kansas City, Missouri, have been on the front lines fighting       for a $15/hour minimum wage knowing it would be       transformative for him and his family. In his own words:       ``Just like me, a lot of folks in fast-food work two or more       jobs because pay is so low. What if every U.S. worker just       had to work one job, and that was enough to make ends meet? I       want to know that when I get my paycheck, it'll be enough to       pay the rent, feed my kids and keep the lights on--and maybe       even a little extra, like enough to take my girls out to ice       cream. It's not a lot to ask of Congress, and it would change       the lives of millions of workers like me. It would give us a       fair shot at the American dream we all hear so much about.''        We urge Congress to heed the call to action from workers       like Terrence Wise, and raise the wage so that millions of       working people can be paid enough to lead a decent life,       provide for their family and build a better future. SEIU       strongly urges you to vote for H.R. 582, and to vote NO on       any Republican Motion to Recommit. We will add votes on this       legislation and the Motion to Recommit to our legislative       scorecard. If you have any questions, please reach out to       Jaya Chatterjee.            Sincerely,                                                    Mary Kay Henry,      International President.                                   ____                                Communications Workers of America,                                                      July 11, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the officers and 700,000       members of the Communications Workers of America (CWA), I am       writing to urge you to vote in favor of H.R. 582, the Raise       the Wage Act of 2019, and against any amendments that       undermine the bill. At a time when wage stagnation and income       inequality hold back our families and our economy, the Raise       the Wage Act will begin to reverse that cycle and raise pay       broadly across the bottom of the workforce.        It's been a decade since the federal minimum wage has       increased. Meanwhile, the cost of living has continually       increased for working Americans. For many Americans, working       40 hours or more a week is not enough to support themselves       and their families. Airline employees, call center workers,       retail store employees and bank workers are among those who       work full time for some of the most highly profitable       corporations, but still earn poverty level wages. It's time       for an economy that works for working families and especially       for the people who work full time but who earn poverty level       wages.        If enacted, the legislation will raise the federal minimum       wage to $8.55 this year and increase it over the next five       years until it reaches $15 an hour in 2024. Raising the       minimum wage to $15 an hour will give roughly 40 million       workers a pay increase, which is nearly 30% of the workforce.       After 2024, the minimum wage will adjust each year to keep       pace with growth of inflation. In addition, the legislation       will phase out the subminimum wage for tipped workers,       individuals with disabilities and workers younger than 20       years old.        All workers deserve to earn a living wage so they can live       with dignity and respect. It is time Congress takes action to       raise the wages of these low income workers and ensure the       economy works for everyone, instead of those in the 1%.       Therefore, I urge you to support H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage       Act of 2019. CWA will include votes on this bill and any       amendments that would undermine the bill in our Congressional       Scorecard. Thank you for your consideration.            Sincerely,      Shane Larson,        Director of Legislative, Political and International       Affairs, Communications Workers of America (CWA).     Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters from the  American Association of University Women, the Patriotic Millionaires,  the National Education Association, and the NAACP, all in support of  H.R. 582.                                                           AAUW,                                                      July 15, 2019.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the more than 170,000       bipartisan members and supporters of the American Association       of University Women (AAUW), I urge you to vote for the Raise       the Wage Act (H.R. 582) when it comes to the House floor for       a vote and oppose any harmful amendments and any possible       motion to recommit. The Raise the Wage Act (H.R. 582) is       critical legislation which would gradually increase the       federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 per hour and then       require that the minimum wage increase be based on changes in       the median wage. It would also eliminate the tipped minimum       wage and prohibit the use of subminimum wages for employees       with disabilities.        Today, millions of women live in poverty because our       federal minimum wage is inadequate for ensuring the economic       well-being  [[Page H5933]]       of workers and their families. The federal minimum wage is       currently only $7.25 per hour and just $2.13 per hour for       tipped workers. Women comprise a majority of the low-wage       workforce, and African American women and Latinas are       significantly overrepresented in the low-wage workforce.       Nearly two-thirds of minimum wage workers in the United       States are women, as well as two-thirds of workers in tipped       jobs. Some workers with disabilities are paid a subminimum       wage through certificates issued by the Department of Labor.       This is not even close to a living wage, which is necessary       to lift workers out of poverty. A woman with two children       working full-time at minimum wage earns a yearly salary of       $14,500, $5,000 below the poverty line.        Congress must take action to increase the minimum wage by       passing the Raise Wage Act of 2019 (H.R. 582). If enacted,       this legislation would raise the federal minimum wage to       $8.55 this year and increase it over the next several years       until it reaches $15 an hour, phase out the outdated       subminimum wage for tipped workers, and also sunset the       ability of employers to pay workers with disabilities a       subminimum wage.        Women's overrepresentation in low-wage jobs is a       significant factor contributing to the gender pay gap.       Currently, women working full-time, year-round are typically       being paid only 80 cents for every dollar paid to men. The       pay gaps have grown even wider for women of color. African       American women and Latinas make, respectively, 61 and 53       cents on the dollar as compared to non-Hispanic, white men.       Women make up nearly 58 percent of the workers who would       benefit from a $15 minimum wage, making this bill       instrumental for helping to close the gender wage gap.       According to recent estimates from the Economic Policy       Institute, increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2024       would give more than 31 percent of all working women a raise,       including 41 percent of African American working women, 38       percent of working Latinas, 29 percent of white working       women, and 18 percent of Asian working women. Even the       Congressional Budget Office's analysis of the impact of the       bill shows that workers overall will be better off and have       higher annual earnings on average.        Raising the minimum wage is one action that Congress should       take to ensure the economic security of families across the       country. I urge you to vote for the Raise the Wage Act (H.R.       582) when it comes to the House floor for a vote and oppose       any harmful amendments and any possible motion to recommit.

Sincerely,                                              Deborah J. Vagins,                                              Senior Vice President,      Public Policy and Research.                                   ____                                           Patriotic Millionaires,                                                      July 15, 2019.        Dear Representative: I am writing on behalf of the       Patriotic Millionaires organization to urge you to support       the Raise the Wage Act (H.R 582). Our members are deeply       committed to raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour,       and we hope that you will take this opportunity to show your       commitment to ensuring that all working Americans are able to       afford their basic needs.        We understand that you may have some hesitations about       supporting the bill, but I believe that this letter should       adequately address those concerns.        While we understand that legislation is always changeable       until it is voted on, for us this policy has a few ``red       lines'' as follows:        $15 per hour by 2024        One Fair Wage (no sub-minimum for tipped workers or anyone       else)        Indexing        ``No'' on the vote to recommit        Within that framework, we will gladly support whatever       piece of legislation you all decide to advance.        Our members believe that current levels of economic       inequality pose an existential threat to the nation, and that       wealthy Americans have an inescapable responsibility to       engage in the fight for an inclusive economy. That is why we       were such an early adopter of the $15 wage, first endorsing       it in 2013. We will fight urgently and publicly for this       critical policy until it becomes law. Once the House passes       the bill, we will formally launch a robust public education       and advocacy campaign that will continue through next year       and into the 117th Congress.        As business leaders and investors, our members are well       acquainted with building profitable business models and plan       to spend quite a bit of our public education efforts on       outreach to the business community, particularly owners of       small and medium sized companies. A few thoughts to share       with business owners in your district:        First, because every business in the country will be       required to raise wages, no establishment will gain or lose a       competitive advantage based on wages as the cost ``input''       will change at the same rate for each of them simultaneously.        From a macroeconomic point of view, 70% of the American       economy is based on consumer demand. It is only logical that       putting more money in the hands of more consumers will be a       net positive to the economy. Picture a bar on a Saturday       night filled with patrons. Should the owner of the bar be       more concerned about how much money all of those potential       customers have to spend, or the higher wage he is paying the       single bartender who is serving them? It's simple math.        And to the small (but very vocal) group of business owners       who insist their businesses will go under if they are       required to pay a living wage, we have a simple message. If       you cannot afford to pay someone a livable wage, you cannot       afford to hire an employee.        You may have concerns that a higher minimum wage will lead       to greater automation. To that, we say that automation is       coming no matter what--in fact it is already here--and rather       than speeding that inevitable process, a livable minimum wage       will ensure that the jobs that cannot be automated pay       enough. The fact is that companies will automate to the       extent that they believe the capital outlay of automation       will be offset by higher future profits. In that sense, as       technology advances, automation is inevitable regardless of       the minimum wage.        If you've been in a McDonald's recently, you've likely seen       that truth in action. McDonald's pays many of its workers       minimum wage, yet it has already heavily invested in       automation technologies. Raising the minimum wage will not       speed up automation, but will instead ensure that as the       process unfolds, people who are working will be stable enough       (because of the higher wages) to have the time and energy to       do the extra education or training necessary for other       positions.        There is real urgency to our efforts on this policy. June       16th marked the longest period in American history--since the       minimum wage was first implemented in 1938--that the federal       minimum wage has not been raised by Congress, just shy of a       decade. Because the wage was not indexed, that means we've       spent nearly ten years where each passing day marks another       decrease in the purchasing power of millions of working       Americans, adding up to the wage being worth nearly 15% less       than it was in 2009.        Every day that Congress does not act is another day where       millions of paychecks decline in real value. Clearly it is       time to act. Unfortunately in the political dynamic we are       currently suffering under, bipartisan action is difficult to       come by (despite the bipartisan popularity of this issue).       The only way to force the Senate to act is for the House to       act first, and to act decisively. Keep in mind, this issue       polls incredibly well, with 83% of registered voters       believing we need to raise the minimum wage, and 55% of       registered voters, including 53% of independents and 37% of       Republicans, supporting a $15 federal minimum wage.        Senators Mitch McConnell and Alexander Lamar clearly have       no interest in passing a minimum wage bill. To force their       hand, we need to change the perceived consequences of their       inaction by pushing this issue into the public debate and       keeping it there.        To be clear, the choice is not between this bill and some       other more perfect bill, the choice is between this bill and       no bill. While there is another minimum wage bill that has       generated support, it will not reach the threshold of support       required to pass. Nor should it. With all due respect to       Third Way and other ``centrist'' think tanks, the so-called       regional approach will not solve the problem.        First, there already is a regional approach to this issue       in that states and localities are reasonably free to set       wages higher than the federal wage if their economies and       politics support it. The purpose of federal legislation is to       set a floor for the entire country, to ensure that at a       minimum everyone is ok. That floor for everyone should be       $15. A study by the Economic Policy Institute shows that by       2024, there will be no county in the country where a person       can support themselves on less than $15 an hour.        In terms of expecting different things from different       localities, $15 is already not enough in several areas of the       country, but we are not demanding $25 or $30 an hour in these       areas. To say that $15 is ``too much'' in some places while       not being equally as concerned that $15 is ``far from       enough'' in many others challenges the credibility of the       argument.        Furthermore, the regional approach puts the $15 figure for       rural counties off to 2033. Frankly, a 14 year timeline is       absurd on its face.        Lawmakers in the House have a simple choice to make--do       something, or do nothing. Move the minimum wage to $15 an       hour, or keep it at $7.25. The Raise the Wage Act has 203       voting cosponsors, and needs 218 votes to pass the House.       This simple policy will help stabilize the economic lives of       40% of working people. And it is supported by a bipartisan       majority of Americans. This is a no-brainer.        We recognize that you might disagree with our assessment,       that there might be other approaches you think are more       appropriate. But as I stated before, the choice before you is       this bill or no bill. You might not believe that $15 an hour       for the entire country is the best option, but surely you       must see that it's better than $7.25 an hour. We've reached a       critical point where inaction is simply no longer an option.        The Patriotic Millionaires believe that a fair minimum wage       is a fundamental building block of an economy that works for       all Americans, not just the ultra-wealthy. We also believe       that every member of Congress who stands with working       Americans will ultimately recognize the importance of this  [[Page H5934]]       bill, and will vote to support it. We hope that you will be       one of them.        Thank you so much.                                                      Morris Pearl,      Chair.                                   ____                                   National Education Association,                                                      July 11, 2019.      U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of our 3 million members and       the 50 million students they serve, I urge you to VOTE YES on       H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage Act. Votes on this issue may be       included in NEA's Report Card for the 116th Congress.        This legislation will benefit working people across our       nation, including NEA's education support professionals--the       school bus drivers, cafeteria workers, custodians, and other       members of school communities who are the first ones to       arrive in the morning, and the last to go home at night.       Their work is tremendously valuable, and the support they       provide students often goes well beyond their job titles.       Yet, they struggle to make ends meet.        The Raise the Wage Act would:         benefit all low-wage earners, not just teenagers       or restaurant workers;         benefit nearly one-third of manufacturing workers,       one-fourth of health care workers, one-fifth of construction       workers, and one-sixth of educators;         reduce poverty and income inequality by raising       the total annual income of the lowest-paid workers; and         help to close racial earnings gaps.        As you know, the federal minimum wage has not increased       since 2009. During that decade, many working families have       lost ground, and lost hope. Several states have raised their       minimum wages in the past 10 years, but it is time for the       federal government to act. Doing so will improve the       circumstances not only for the workers themselves, but for       their family members and communities. Please VOTE YES and       Raise the Wage.            Sincerely,                                                      Marc Egan,                                   Director of Government Relations,      National Education Association.                                   ____                                          NAACP Washington Bureau,                                                       July 8, 2019.      Re: NAACP strong support for H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage Act       U.S. House of Representatives,      Washington, DC.        Dear Representative: On behalf of the NAACP, our nation's       oldest, largest and most widely-recognized grassroots-based       civil rights organization, urge you to vote for and support       through passage H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage Act. People of       color, women, families and too many others have been left       behind by our economy and our policies far too often, for far       too long. Adopting the Raise the Wage Act would mark a       crucial step toward ensuring we can all work towards greater       equity, dignity, and a living wage.        The Raise the Wage Act will make significant contributions       in the economic security of millions of American women, men,       and families by raising the federal minimum wage from $7.25       to $15 an hour by 2024, then indexing it so that it continues       to rise along with wages overall. H.R. 582 will also end       unfair current exclusions for tipped workers, people with       disabilities, and youth so that they too, can benefit from a       decent minimum wage.        The NAACP has a long and strong history of supporting       federal laws that improved the lives of hard working       Americans, and ensuring that all people are covered. From the       Fair Labor Standards Act to the very first federal minimum       wage bill in 1938, we were active supporters of a fair day's       wage for a hard day's labor. We continue to advocate for an       increase in the buying power of the minimum wage to keep up       with the cost of living in the United States, and that       minimum wage earners, who by definition are working men and       women, are able to keep their families out of poverty.        Thank you for your consideration of our position; the NAACP       is proud to endorse H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage Act. Should       you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to       contact me.            Sincerely,                                              Hilary O. Shelton,                                 Director, NAACP Washington Bureau &                      Senior Vice President for Policy and Advocacy     Mr. Speaker, one additional point that I wanted to make  listening to my friend and colleague who talks about, during the last  several years, the income and the wages of the lowest earning Americans  have gone up. I do note with some irony that the reason for that,  largely, is due to the increases in the minimum wage at the State  levels: California, New York, many places around the country, Missouri.  The list goes on and on.   About half of the States in the United States have now raised the  minimum wage beyond the Federal number. That is the signal significant  reason for wage rates going up for the lowest earning Americans. That  is exactly the point of doing this, so that all Americans at the lowest  end of the economic scale, the lowest wage earners, will see a  significant increase in their earning power.   That will expand further the number of people at the lowest end in  terms of increases in their wages. That will benefit their families-- those families benefit--and make stronger neighborhoods and stronger  communities and, ultimately, a stronger nation. That is why this needs  to get done.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess)  pointing that out because I think it helps make our case.   Mr. Speaker, can I ask the gentleman whether he is prepared to close.    Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to spend some time on the  floor with my distinguished colleague from Texas, though we disagree  strongly about this.   I would just once again reiterate that the CBO estimate on this is  nowhere near 4 million jobs lost. That is not mentioned anywhere in the  CBO report. It talks about a range from zero to 3.7 million. The median  is 1.3 million.   But, again, this is as much a question of values and what we stand  for and a moral imperative as it is for statistics, because the  statistics would argue for it.   1.3 million Americans would be lifted out of poverty the moment we  pass this and this becomes law. Nearly 30 million Americans would see  their annual wage increased, in some cases dramatically.   And this, as I indicated earlier, makes certain that, as a matter of  public policy, we make certain that there is no erosion of the  purchasing power of the minimum wage because of the indexing on this.   I really feel, Mr. Speaker, that those are the statistics that we  ought to be mindful of, not just the worst possible, which is  overstated by my colleague and friend.   There should be, Mr. Speaker, no place in this great Nation where a  minimum wage employee working full-time cannot afford the basic  essentials.   The work we are doing here today does not dictate a one-size-fits-all  model for every State. It simply creates a floor, but a floor that is  important, a Federal standard that says, if you work full-time in this  country, if you put in the effort to earn for yourself and your family,  you will achieve, at a minimum, a wage that lets you afford the basic  necessities of life.   I believe this bill is just; I believe it is moral; I believe it is  long overdue;  [[Page H5935]]  and I look forward to supporting its passage.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my colleagues for their words of  support for H.R. 582, the Raise the Wage Act. I would especially like  to thank Chairman Scott for his leadership and his commitment to this  effort, and Chairman McGovern of the Rules Committee for his work to  move this significant legislation to the floor.   Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``yes'' vote on the rule; I urge a ``yes'' vote  on the previous question.   The material previously referred to by Mr. Burgess is as follows:         At the end of the resolution, add the following:        Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution, the       House shall proceed to the consideration in the House of the       bill (H.R. 748) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to       repeal the excise tax on high cost employer-sponsored health       coverage. All points of order against consideration of the       bill are waived. An amendment in the nature of a substitute       consisting of the texts of H.R. 748, H.R. 1398, and H.R.       2207, each as introduced, shall be considered as adopted. The       bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. All points of       order against provisions in the bill, as amended, are waived.       The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the       bill, as amended, and on any further amendment thereto to       final passage without intervening motion except: (1) one hour       of debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and       ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means;       and (2) one motion to recommit with or without instructions.        Sec. 3. Clause l(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the       consideration of H.R. 748.     Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I  move the previous question on the resolution.
