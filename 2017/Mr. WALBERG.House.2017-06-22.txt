 Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for sponsoring this  legislation.   I rise today to voice my strong support for the Strengthening Career  and Technical Education for the 21st Century Act, H.R. 2353. In today's  economy, we know that not everyone follows the same path into the  workforce. Whether a student wants to pursue a  [[Page H5078]]  job in the auto industry, healthcare, energy, or IT, the reforms we are  advancing will help aspiring workers get the hands-on experience they  need to thrive in the 21st century workforce.   This bill is particularly important for my home State of Michigan,  the heartland of American manufacturing, where high-skilled jobs are a  vital component of our State's economy. I am also glad it includes my  bipartisan provisions to address outdated and burdensome occupational  licensing requirements.   As I meet with educators, workers, and manufacturers across my  district, I consistently hear about the need to improve CTE programs  and close the skills gap. Let's pass this bipartisan bill and help more  men and women in Michigan and across the country secure fulfilling and  good-paying jobs.
