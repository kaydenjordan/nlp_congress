 Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for  the quorum call be rescinded.    I ask for the yeas and nays.    Mr. President, today I wish to recognize MAJ Dustin  Mondloch, U.S. Army, for his outstanding work on behalf the people of  Maine and the Nation as a 2022 Department of Defense Legislative Fellow  serving in my Washington, DC, office. Over the past year, Dustin has  been integral in shaping my foreign policy and defense priorities. He  helped secure a number of provisions in the Fiscal Year 2023 National  Defense Authorization Act--FY23 NDAA--that will make our country  stronger and safer. Dustin led my staff in orchestrating important  appropriations for the Department of Defense, Department of State,  Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Coast Guard, and the Office of  National Drug Control Policy. His contributions--both to office morale  and to our collective work product--are emblematic of his good  character, competence, and strong work ethic.   Throughout his tenure in my office, Dustin demonstrated a level of  professionalism and hard work I have come to expect--but not take for  granted--from Department of Defense Legislative Fellows. Indeed, he  follows a long line of accomplished U.S. Navy and Marine Corps officers  who have made impactful contributions to my office and to U.S. national  security policy. He distinguished himself as the first Army officer to  serve in my office, setting a high bar and providing invaluable advice  and insights personally to me. Over the course of the year, Dustin  prepared and advised me on wide ranging and complex matters under  consideration before the Senate Armed Services Committee. He brought  his space expertise to assist me in the Strategic Forces Subcommittee  briefings and deliberations, that resulted in important funding  authorizations and legislation. Dustin's servant leadership showed in  his work with constituents and while securing legislation to address  Active Duty and veteran suicide. His attention to detail became  apparent as he assisted me in dissecting, literally, thousands of pages  of the Abbey Gate inspector general investigation. Further, he authored  sections of report language, including one of my top concerns regarding  the will to fight analysis of foreign militaries by our national  security community. In addition, he became my go-to lead for monitoring  the horrific war in Ukraine, providing clear-headed and thoughtful  analysis, and liaised with representatives from the White House, State  Department, and Department of Defense to convey my positions and  concerns. His candor and honest assessments provided critical insights  during this fraught time in U.S. history, and our Nation is better  because of it.   On behalf of my colleagues and the U.S. Congress, I thank Dustin for  his dedicated service to my staff, the State of Maine, the U.S. Army,  and the Nation. Part of what makes the U.S. military the greatest in  the history of the world is that servicemembers like Dustin dedicate  their lives to service and sacrifice for their country. Major Mondloch  does not do it alone, so I also acknowledge the support of his family-- his wife Danielle, his son Cole, and his daughter Lennox. I wish them  all the best on what I know is a bright future.                            ____________________
