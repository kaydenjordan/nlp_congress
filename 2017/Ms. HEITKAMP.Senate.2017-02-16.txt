 Mr. President, I join my colleagues today to recognize  that the environment is critically important. One of the true issues  States face is getting back to the promises of the Clean Air Act and  Clean Water Act to make sure States enjoy primacy, and I think that is  a critical component that is not being discussed today as we look at  guaranteed clean water and clean air--making sure that those closest to  those issues have the ability to have the input that was anticipated by  almost every environmental statute. So I would remind my colleagues  that when we focus many times on Federal issues and Federal  appointments, one of the most important things that we can do is focus  on the fact that these Federal agency heads need to work cooperatively  with State organizations.   Scott Pruitt, who is a soon-to-be former attorney general,  understands the State role, and I think that is a critical  qualification and an important distinction to make.    Mr. President, will my friend from Mississippi yield  the floor for one moment?    I thank the Senator from Mississippi.   Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my postcloture debate time to  Senator Carper.   The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right.   The Senator from Mississippi.
