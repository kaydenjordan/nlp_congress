 Mr. President, reserving the right to object, first, I  thank Senator Durbin for 17 years of work on this issue and for  highlighting the reality that there are so many people who came here  through the decisions of their parents--not decisions of their own. I,  for one, believe they deserve a path to citizenship.   I felt so strongly about it that I did something I don't believe any  Republican-only bill has ever done before. I filed a bill, along with  Senator  [[Page S1918]]  Lankford, to do just that--to provide a path to citizenship not only to  the 690,000 who had enrolled in the DACA Program but to some 1.2  million.   I believe we need to come up with a solution to this problem, and I  thank Senator Durbin for his dogged tenacity on this issue. I believe  that if we continue to focus on it, we will succeed.   I just need to set a few facts straight. I know the majority leader  is in the Chamber, and I will keep my comments brief.   I was in that January 9 meeting as well. In the January 9 meeting, we  had an extraordinary meeting, and most of it was on tape. But the  reality is, in the January 9 meeting, we walked away with an  understanding that there were four pillars on which we were going to  build a bipartisan bill. The President looked to the whips in the  minority and the majority, and he said: You guys get together, produce  a bipartisan bill, and I will support it.   The goal was to go out and have everybody get together with the  diverse interests that were represented in the room and come up with  that bipartisan bill. We have to talk about ``bipartisan.'' A  bipartisan bill is not a bill that gets just Republicans and Democrats  on it. A bipartisan bill is a bill that gets up to 60--at least 60-- Republicans and Democrats on it. About a month ago, we came to the  floor and had four bills. There was no open debate. It was just an up- or-down vote. That is why it failed. It also failed when there were  supermajorities, when President Obama was in place, when not a single  Republican vote was necessary. That is why President Obama issued the  DACA Executive order.   President Trump did not create this problem. It was the inaction of  Congress and even a Democratic-controlled Presidency and supermajority- controlled Congress that couldn't solve this problem for whatever  reason.   On the bill that we had, we had three Democrats vote. I guess I could  argue that 39 votes were Democrats. That was a bipartisan bill, but it  was a bill that didn't get 60 votes.   I hope we will continue to work on this issue so that we can provide  certainty to the DACA population. It is not too late to do it. I think  about the Dreamers every single day. They deserve a path to  citizenship. The President deserves to be able to look the American  people in the face and say he secured the border and made the homeland  safer. I think we can work on some of the legal immigration issues that  can actually get this solved.   Senator Durbin, I look forward to working with you, and let this be  the Congress where we actually solve the problem.                     Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 2579    Mr. President, at this time, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator  modify his request and the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 2579; I  further ask that the pending amendments be withdrawn with the exception  of the Grassley amendment No. 1959; and, finally, I ask that the  Grassley amendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be considered  read a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be  considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or  debate.    I object, Mr. President.
