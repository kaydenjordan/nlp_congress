 Mr. President, today, I rise to honor the enduring  legacy of an outstanding Utahn. As the autumn sun sunk below the  mountains surrounding Southern Utah University's sprawling athletic  fields, the men's teams had finished their practice for the day. Only  under the night sky could one group of young, ambitious, and dedicated  women finally take to the empty field, dressed in worn, plain PE  uniforms with hand-stitched numbers. In the collegiate sporting era of  the 1970s, these female athletes had no access to new equipment or team  budgets, let alone scholarships or institutional support. But they did  have a leader. Kathryn Berg, of Heber City, UT, proudly led this group  of woman athletes as their coach, mentor, friend, and lifelong advocate  for gender equality across all sports at the university and the State  of Utah. Today, a return visit to SUU must rekindle mixed emotions for  Kathryn, both for the enormous strides made for gender equality by  virtue for her accomplishments as its associate athletic director and  the work still required in pursuit of that goal. The field bears her  name.   Despite her decorated career, measured in both awards and the  boundless admiration of others, Kathryn Berg would be embarrassed to  have the spotlight shone on her life and achievements. That is because  she spent her over 33-year career elevating others into such a  position. The athletes, families, and individuals who know Kathryn  describe her as a humble servant to others, who worked overtime to  provide opportunities for girls and women to participate in sports. To  accomplish this, she educated herself in sports she knew little about  by becoming an expert in the rules and regulations of each sport, took  classes, and earned certifications at her own expense. She even became  a certified gymnastics judge so she could be a better gymnastics coach.  This enabled her athletes to reach their peak athletic and academic  performances. An athlete herself, Kathryn played basketball and tennis  at Wasatch High School before earning a B.A. and M.A. from Brigham  Young University, followed by a doctorate from the University of Utah.  She taught and coached at Richfield High School, Lincoln Junior High,  and Orem Junior High, respectively, before arriving for a new challenge  at Southern Utah University.   At SUU, she served as administrator for all women's sports, including  softball, basketball, gymnastics, track and field, volleyball,  cheerleading, and synchronized swimming. In Cedar City, she continued  to face down the perennial obstacles halting progress for female  athletic programs. With no available budget, Kathryn and her athletes  had to fundraise for their right to take to the fields and courts.  Kathryn stitched together uniforms, spent her own money, and drove the  team bus herself. With few female coaching mentors around, she instead  learned as she went despite hearing ``no'' to most every request. As a  direct result of her relentless advocacy for gender equality in  collegiate athletics, countless student-athletes had a chance to  compete, to succeed, and to dream.   A giver, a selfless servant, and always present for her friends and  family. These attributes accurately describe who Kathryn is as a person  and what she means to those who love her, reinforced by abundant  examples of humility over the decades. One such example transcends  careers or athletics and speaks to the true nature of Kathryn's heart.  In 2001, she retired from her successful administrative career in order  to care for her younger sister, Charlotte, who suffered from cerebral  palsy. She needed full-time care after their parents died, and Kathryn  made sure that she was able to live life to the fullest until her  passing in 2014.   Kathryn Berg is a founding pioneer of gender equality in collegiate  athletics in Utah. Her indelible legacy includes helping oversee SUU's  ascension into NCAA Division I, helping establish the Utah Summer  Games, and leading the creation of the Thunderbirds' enduring women's  intercollegiate athletic program. She is aptly recognized in several  athletic halls of fame and received an honorary doctorate degree from  SUU. Kathryn is still active in the community, especially as the chair  of the Daughters of Utah Pioneer Museum. She provides a scholarship to  a senior at Wasatch High School each year and is the No. 1 fan of her  family's extracurricular events.   Thank you, Kathryn, for your lifetime of achievement and inspiration  for student-athletes everywhere. Your unwavering work will continue to  benefit untold generations of female athletes and their  families.                            ____________________
