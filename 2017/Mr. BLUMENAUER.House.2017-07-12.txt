 Mr. Speaker, every time I visit Israel, I have such  mixed feelings. It is a land of positive opportunities surrounded by  intractable controversies.   The big question looming is how to achieve a two-state solution for  the Israelis and the Palestinians with appropriate integrity so that  they are actually separate countries. This has raised additional  questions because of the ambiguity from the Trump administration about  whether or not what, for years, has been American policy supporting a  two-state solution is any longer a priority of theirs.   For several years, I have been deeply concerned about the looming  environmental crisis in Gaza. This is a small strip of land about twice  the size of Washington, D.C., but it is home to 1.9 million people,  most of whom are leading a wretched existence, even more so since  Hamas, the political faction, has seized control. That is Israel's  implacable enemy which now controls Gaza.   They have little regard for their own people, using them as pawns,  spending scarce resources, digging tunnels to try to kidnap Israeli  children and soldiers, and launching rockets to terrorize Israeli  communities in the surrounding areas.                                time  1015    Gaza has reached a crisis point in dealing with water and sanitation.  The groundwater is so polluted that virtually all the water is unfit to  drink--polluted by sewage, waste runoff, and seawater encroachment.  They are pumping four times as much water out of the aquifer than can  be replaced naturally, and seawater from the Mediterranean is  encroaching.   We are told that, by the end of the year, there will probably be no  sources of drinking water that are fit to drink. By 2020, the entire  water system will be permanently damaged. Because of problems with  drinking water that is not fit and raw sewage that is not treated,  there is a real likelihood that we could have an outbreak of something  like cholera, threatening not just the people in Gaza, but the Israelis  as well.   Several times recently, sewage from Gaza has washed up on Israeli  beaches and forced the shutdown of water treatment plants from  desalinization. The Israeli military thinks this is a security threat.   In the course of this visit, I had an opportunity to put the question  directly to Prime Minister Netanyahu; Jibril Rajoub, the number three  person in the Palestinian Authority; and United States Ambassador  Friedman about this pending crisis and the need for urgent action.  Sadly, each of those conversations revealed I won't say indifference,  but certainly a lack of urgency and no willingness for anybody to take  the lead and break the impasse.   This is not a problem that is beyond our ability to solve. There are  opportunities to increase electricity for pumping water and treating  sewage. There is the capacity to build some smaller reservoirs to be  able to mix saltwater with freshwater and extend the supplies.   For Israel, water is a mystery they have solved. They are the most  water-rich country on the face of the planet, with very sophisticated  technology. They could provide additional resources. Around the edges,  the United States does some work with USAID, but it is not a priority  for the United States at this point.   Mr. Speaker, I return perplexed. We will continue to push with the  Israelis, the United States Government, the Palestinians, and with NGOs  whenever we have the opportunity. But it seems to me, Mr. Speaker, if  we cannot bring people together to solve a pending crisis with tools  that are available to us now, at a relatively modest cost, what hope do  we have of being able to work cooperatively to implement the two-state  solution and be able to bring peace and security to Israel and the  Palestinians?   I would hope my colleagues would lend their voices to this question.                            ____________________     Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chair, my amendment deletes language in this bill  that would mandate a program of record, green lighting this proposal  for road-mobile, ground-launched cruise missiles with ranges that, if  tested or deployed, would violate the United States' obligations under  the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.   For more than four decades, the United States and Russia have worked  through bilateral agreements to reduce their nuclear weapons  stockpiles, saving money, and making the world safer.   Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush were at the forefront  of this effort with the START 1 and START II treaties.   There is a longstanding precedent of carefully negotiating these  treaties in a bipartisan fashion because these leaders knew that a  world with less of these weapons meant a safer world for all of us.   Yet over the last several years, our nuclear weapons proliferation  has continued on autopilot. Right now we are on track to spend $1.2  trillion on unneeded nuclear weapons. In fact, the Pentagon has  concluded that already the United States' security needs could be met  with one-third fewer strategic warheads deployed than New START limits  of 1,550.   We can and should safely right-size the arsenal as envisioned by  Ronald Reagan and the first President Bush. That is why these treaties  are so important. They hold us and our adversaries accountable.   We see some confusing signals from the administration, at times  appearing to favor nuclear escalation, but at the same time being  deeply concerned about managing costs.   President Trump has demonstrated a lack of clear understanding of  these treaties, but even his administration is fearful that the  language undermining the treaty in this bill ``unhelpfully ties them to  a specific missile system.''   Congress should be playing a lead role in getting us back on track  with smarter defense spending, not working to abandon this nuclear  nonproliferation legacy that Ronald Reagan and Bush, Sr., fought so  hard for.   We can't simply fund every weapons program on the list while  fulfilling other critical obligations like providing for our military  personnel, ensuring we have adequate cybersecurity protections,  strengthening our command and control infrastructure, not to mention  our non-Defense Department programs like foreign assistance and  diplomacy.   We have a poor track record when it comes to carefully managing and  budgeting implementation of our weapons programs.   The House continues this poor record now. Why would we establish a  program of record for something that our military, our diplomats, and  our NATO allies haven't asked for?   Rather than rushing to adopt this program and abandoning a key  international treaty in the process, let's think this through. Let's do  our homework to make sure our allies, the Departments of Defense and  State are all on the same page, and develop a coherent approach to  bring Russia back into compliance, rather than throw money at yet  another unnecessary weapons program and undercut that regime.   This takes our eye off the ball and could have unintended and, I  think in some instances, devastating consequences.   Mr. Chair, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote in support of this  amendment for smarter defense spending and the protection of a landmark  treaty that is part of the legacy of Ronald Reagan and George H. W.  Bush.   Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chair, may I inquire as to the amount of time I  have remaining?    Mr. Chair, the question is how to get Russia into  compliance. Walking away from our obligations? I think not.   The amendment allows going ahead if the Department of Defense  certifies to Congress that it has completed a new nuclear posture  review to make sure this program fits in the overall strategy; that it  certifies that it prefers this program to ensure that NATO's overall  deterrence and defense posture remains credible; that the Department of  Defense certified it prefers this missile for maintaining strategic  stability; that State certifies the program of record is necessary to  help verifiably return Russia to compliance; that at least one NATO  member state has proven it is serious about hosting the missile; and  State certifies that the full Atlantic Council has endorsed deployment  of this missile.   Those are the conditions in the amendment, and I would think they are  reasonable conditions that the gentleman should not object to. If he  truly believes in the merit of his argument, there is no reason that  that cannot be complied with. And if not, it should not proceed.    Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.    Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.    Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes.   Mr. Chairman, it is time to insert fiscal sanity into our nuclear  weapons planning. We are set to spend $400 billion over the next decade  and $1.2 trillion over the next 30 years to recapitalize our entire  nuclear arsenal. This nuclear escalation will build a force far  exceeding what the Pentagon and security experts have said is necessary  to deter a nuclear threat.   A stronger nuclear program is not going to help us deal with the  strategic challenges we face today, like the fight the against Islamic  State, but it will result in having to crowd out Army, Navy, and Air  Force conventional priorities.   We need to revisit the strategy. We are here in Congress to make hard  decisions about how to spend taxpayer dollars. The Pentagon should  provide long-term cost reports and tell us what certain weapons will  actually add to our existing capacity.   My amendment deals with one particular outrageous piece of this  unsustainable escalation: the long-range standoff weapon, or the LRSO.  Now, this weapon is projected to cost $20 billion to $30 billion.   This amendment would lock the LRSO funding at fiscal year 2017 levels  until the administration submits a Nuclear Posture Review to Congress  that includes a detailed assessment of why we need this weapon. It  wouldn't prevent it. It would just keep the funding at the current  level until they can tell us why we need it.   Until the administration carefully examines the utility of the LRSO,  why should we rush its development? After all, the father of this  device, former Secretary of Defense Bill Perry, has argued there is  scant justification for spending tens of billions of dollars on that  weapon. General Mattis has stated numerous times that he is not sold on  the LRSO.   We shouldn't risk making tens of billions of dollars in commitments  like this with potential failure to follow through all while forfeiting  other critical priorities. Before we continue this nuclear escalation  on autopilot, let's make sure.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\1/2\ minutes to the  distinguished gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith), who is the ranking  member.    Mr. Chairman, I am stunned to think that this is  somehow the equivalent of unilateral disarmament.   The amendment says that the funding level for this new program would  remain at the current fiscal year level until the administration  submits a nuclear posture review to Congress that indicates a detailed  assessment of why we need the weapon.   If what the gentleman says is true--and I get mixed signals from the  Secretary--then they can easily do that. They are not cut off. It has  nothing to do with unilateral disarmament. We have more than enough  nuclear weapons to destroy these countries many times over.   My friend, Mr. Smith, talks about other priorities, from  cybersecurity to what is happening with ISIS. Lavishing funds on  programs that have not yet been justified and can't meet this test is  not worthy. You have other things that you want to help the Department  of Defense do, which I think we share.   Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge approval of this amendment, and I yield  back the balance of my time.    Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.
