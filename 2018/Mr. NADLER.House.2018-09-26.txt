 Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.   Mr. Speaker, I oppose H. Res. 1071 because it is nothing more than a  bald-faced political stunt concocted by the majority in an attempt to  stir up its political base ahead of the midterm elections. It also  represents just the latest in a long and cynical line of attempts by  the majority to denigrate and delegitimize our Nation's immigrant  population and to erode public trust in our electoral system, all to  bolster short-term political gains.   Let me start out by saying that I can't imagine someone in a foreign  country deciding to emigrate to the United States in order to vote in a  school board election. That is just absurd.   But the resolution also falls short on its own merits. For example,  the resolution states that it is ``of paramount importance that the  United States maintains the legitimacy of its elections and protects  them from interference, including interference from foreign threats.''   I agree with the statement as far as it goes, but I question why the  resolution makes no mention whatsoever of the greatest foreign threat  of electoral interference, namely interference by Russia in an attempt  to disrupt our democracy and sow chaos in our political an governmental  system.    It is the consensus view of our Nation's intelligence community that  Russia interfered in the 2016 Presidential election in order to help  Donald Trump become President. Indeed, senior administration officials  warned just last month that Russia's attempts to interfere in our  electoral system are ongoing and threaten the integrity of both the  upcoming midyear elections and the 2020 Presidential election.   At a minimum, the resolution should call attention to this fact. Yet,  incredibly, the resolution makes absolutely no mention of it.   The resolution also disrespects States' rights, failing to mention  that the Constitution allows States and localities to permit noncitizen  voting in local elections, a practice that dates to the earliest days  of the Republic. For example, New York City permitted noncitizen voting  in local school board elections until elections in local school boards  were done away with in New York City about 20 years ago.   Indeed, an earlier version of the resolution's text, obtained by the  far-right Breitbart website, included the whereas clause acknowledging  these facts stating: ``Whereas, the Constitution allows States and  localities to grant noncitizens the right to vote in non-Federal  elections.''   Yet perhaps recognizing that this was something of an admission  against interest, the introduced version does not include this clause.   The fact of the matter is that local governments have permitted  noncitizen voting in various local elections, school board elections,  and so forth, through the entire history of the Republic. So why  suddenly do we have this expression of terrible concern?   The resolution also speaks to the fact that ``voting is fundamental  to a functioning democracy.'' Yet, it fails to address any of the real  threats to voting rights that our citizens face.   Five years ago, the Supreme Court effectively gutted the Voting  Rights Act's preclearance requirement, the act's most important  enforcement mechanism, in its decision in Shelby County v. Holder. The  Court reached its conclusion notwithstanding Congress' factual findings  in 2006 that the act, including its preclearance provision, was still  needed in the face of continuing discrimination by some States against  minority voters.                                time  1600    In response to the Court's decision, and under Republican control,  States that had been subject to the act's preclearance requirement  wasted no time in pursuing voting restrictions that once again  threatened to undermine the voting rights of African Americans and  other racial and ethnic minority groups.   These measures included voter identification requirements,  restriction or elimination of early voting or same day registration,  and bans on ex-offenders from voting, all of which makes it  disproportionately harder for racial and ethnic minorities to vote.   These restrictions, enacted by Republican legislatures, have probably  deprived hundreds of thousands--or even several million--of our fellow  citizens of the right to vote. They are the real threat to our  democracy, not the few noncitizens who may vote in a school board  election in some local government that has permitted it through the  last 100 years.   Members have introduced various proposals to address these continuing  attempts by certain States and localities to suppress voters. For  example, H.R. 12, the Voter Empowerment Act,  [[Page H9049]]  which was introduced by Representative  John Lewis and has 183  cosponsors, would reinforce the constitutional right to vote.   The bill includes, among other things, provisions to make it easier  to register to vote and to prohibit and criminally punish voter  suppression tactics like caging, voter intimidation, and the provision  of false and deceptive voting information. The bill would also restore  voting rights for nonviolent felons after they have served their  sentences.   H.R. 2978, the Voting Rights Advancement Act, which was introduced by  Representative Terry Sewell and has 192 cosponsors, is a direct  response to the Supreme Court's invitation to Congress articulated in  the Shelby County decision to revise section 4 of the Voting Rights  Act. The bill would amend the Voting Rights Act to protect voters by  requiring States with a recent history of voter discrimination to seek  approval from the Department of Justice before making any changes to  their electoral laws.   Finally, H.R. 5011, the Election Security Act, which was introduced  by Representative Bennie Thompson and has 122 cosponsors, would  designate election infrastructure as critical infrastructure and  provide financial support and enhanced security for the infrastructure  to carry out elections so we are not subject to foreign invasion by  hackers.   These measures each address critical threats to our electoral system  and the right to vote, yet none of them has received a hearing or other  consideration by the House.   It is a travesty that the Republicans have chosen to spend what is  likely to be the last week of session before the midterm elections to  consider this purely symbolic measure. They refuse to consider bills  that would actually help ensure the right to vote but will consider  this purely symbolic measure, one that in itself seeks to stoke the  worst kinds of sentiments in the body politic, instead of devoting time  to considering and passing meaningful and substantive protections for  the right to vote and to protect us from foreign interference in our  electoral system. I cannot support this travesty.   Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), ranking member of the Crime, Terrorism,  Homeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from Texas an  additional 30 seconds.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  California (Mr. Swalwell), a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1  minute.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from  Florida (Mrs. Demings), a member of the Judiciary Committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from  Illinois (Mr. Gutierrez), a member of the committee.    Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.   Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to be abundantly clear that this  resolution is nothing more than a political stunt steeped in hypocrisy.  The resolution states that it is ``of paramount importance that the  United States maintains  [[Page H9052]]  the legitimacy of its elections and protects them from interference,  including interference from foreign threats. . . .''   Yet, the resolution does not even mention the greatest foreign threat  we face: Russian interference intended to disrupt our elections and sow  chaos in our political system.   The hypocrisy is breathtaking. The chairman of the House Intelligence  Committee and others have worked all year to undermine and discredit  the Mueller investigation into Russian interference with our 2016  election.                                time  1630    To add insult to injury, House Republicans have voted to block needed  funding to help States secure their election systems from the ongoing  Russian and other efforts to interfere in the 2018 elections, ongoing  efforts that have been confirmed by senior administration officials.   In short, this resolution ignores the real threats our elections are  facing and, instead, plays political games by trying to stoke the worse  kinds of sentiments in the body politic, all focused on local practices  that are not sudden and not new but are as old as the Republic and  suddenly pose a threat. I cannot vote for this charade.   Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
